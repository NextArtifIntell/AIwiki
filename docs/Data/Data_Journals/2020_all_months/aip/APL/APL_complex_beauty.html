  abstract     = {The simultaneous retrieval of x-ray attenuation, phase, and scattering using multimodal imaging techniques is finding increasing use in a range of applications, from medicine to materials science. Most techniques rely on the mechanical movement of an optical element (e.g., a grating or a mask) to obtain the multimodal images. While single-shot approaches exist, they typically employ detector pixels smaller than the grating period, often with low detection efficiency, and are limited in resolution unless either the sample or the optical element is displaced in various positions and multiple frames are collected. In this paper, we replace mechanical motion with the MÖNCH detector&#39;s capability to reach sub-pixel resolutions by interpolating between neighboring pixels collecting the charge generated by a single x-ray event. This enabled us to obtain the pilot demonstration of a laboratory-based high-resolution, single-shot multimodal imaging technique capable of simultaneously retrieving attenuation, directional differential phase, and scatter images, without any mechanical movement. We show that our proof-of-concept setup enables a single-shot resolution of 19.5 μ m and that the resulting images provide sufficient information to produce a reliable sample thickness map. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the setup is capable of producing single-shot directional scattering images, while leaving open the option to further increase the resolution by using sample dithering.},

  abstract     = {Betavoltaic batteries are highly attractive for numerous application scenarios where power sources with super-long lifetime and high energy density are required. However, the reported betavoltaic batteries still suffer from low output power and low efficiency, which are much lower than theoretical predictions and bring uncertainty to the future of betavoltaics. In this work, we started from the fundamental hypothesis of betavoltaics and found that, in practice, betavoltaic batteries work under small injection conditions, where the device behavior deviates from the ideal p–n junction, resulting in the performance gap between theoretical and experimental results. We proposed a precise model on semiconductor units, taking into account the recombination current and realistic parameters, and systematically investigated the conversion efficiencies of common planar betavoltaic batteries. Modeling results suggested that semiconductors with low recombination current and a wide bandgap could be ideal candidates for planar betavoltaic batteries using 63 Ni and 3 H. The validity of this model is confirmed by the experimental results of a prototype battery consisting of a SiC p + –n junction and a 63 Ni source. Our work provides a powerful tool for predicting the output performance and optimizing the device structure of betavoltaic batteries.},

  abstract     = {Liquid-metal (LM) electrical switches have been desired for decades to overcome intrinsic shortcomings of traditional mechanical switches equipped with solid contacts. Existing LM electrical switches, functioning via solid-liquid wetting or liquid droplet actuation, mostly focus on low current and small signal switches. In this Letter, a LM switch aiming at a power-level current switch has been proposed. A proof-of-concept prototype was fabricated via encapsulating Galinstan droplets into a silicone matrix. The device switches on a circuit when LM droplets are squeezed into a capillary channel to coalesce. The switch-off process with arc burning is realized by capillary breakup of the LM bridge and high-speed contact separation driven by a pressure difference contributed by Laplace pressure, electrical arc pressure, and atmospheric pressure. Switching off 0.5 A–5 A current under DC 220 V within 0.13–1.69 ms, the device demonstrates a high-speed current interruption ability compared to two kinds of commercial push-button switches. A high-speed camera is utilized to visualize the LM switch&#39;s current interruption process. In such a situation, the LM contacts exhibit a separation speed up to 3.85 m/s. Apart from the pressure difference, a slip layer between the LM and capillary wall also plays an important role in driving LM contacts. The LM switch has potential for applications in communication and control equipment acquiring a fast switch of the electrical power signal. This paper offers a framework for designing the LM switch dealing with intense electrical discharge.},

One constraint, however, is that the intentional dopants required for modulation doping are controlled and incorporated during the growth of heterostructures. Using undoped strained germanium quantum wells as the model material system, we show, in this work, that modulation doping can be achieved post-growth of heterostructures by ion implantation and dopant-activation anneals. The carrier density is controlled ex situ by varying the ion fluence and implant energy, and an empirical calibration curve is obtained. While the mobility of the resulting 2D holes is lower than that in undoped heterostructure field-effect transistors built using the same material, the achievable carrier density is significantly higher. Potential applications of this modulation-doping technique are discussed.},

However, previous reports on waveplates have not addressed the issues of high efficiency, tunable phase delay, and flexibility. Here, we proposed an ultra-thin, flexible, foldable, and stretchable waveplate based on liquid crystal polymer using a water-soluble transfer method. Through Jones Matrix analysis and research on the optical performance of the liquid crystal waveplate, the results show that the overall structure of the prepared liquid crystal flexible waveplate has high fidelity, and its optical performance is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction. The flexible waveplates were used as anti-reflection for foldable organic light-emitting diode displays of smartphones.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we report the percentage of the ferroelectric phase in a 10-nm-thick Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 (HZO) film deposited in a metal-insulator-metal stack by atomic layer deposition. The ferroelectric behavior was confirmed by polarization measurements and piezoresponse force microscopy. Ferroelectric behavior in this material has been attributed most likely to the formation of the polar non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase [Müller et al. , Appl. Phys. Lett. 99 , 102903 (2011)], which is difficult to distinguish from the tetragonal phase in x-ray diffraction due to peak overlap. Using a model for each of the crystal phases of hafnia-zirconia, the phase percentages were estimated using a Rietveld refinement method applied to grazing incidence x-ray diffraction data and a linear combination fit analysis procedure [McBriarty et al. , Phys. Status Solidi 257 , 1900285 (2020)] applied to grazing incidence extended x-ray absorption fine structure data. Using these methods, it was found that the tetragonal (P4 2 /nmc) phase is the most prevalent at 48–60\% followed by the polar non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic (Pca2 1 ) phase at 35\%–40\% with the remainder consisting of the monoclinic (P2 1 /c) phase. Understanding the details of the effect of the phase structure on the electrical properties of these materials is extremely important for device engineering of HZO for logic and emerging nonvolatile memory applications.},

In this work, the Kolmogorov–Avrami–Ishibashi (KAI), the Nucleation Limited Switching (NLS), the Landau–Khalatnikov (LK), and the Inhomogeneous Field Mechanism (IFM) models for polarization switching are surveyed and evaluated with the existing body of literature. Data concerning NLS and IFM are compared to experiments undertaken in this study. After excluding the KAI model because of considerations dealing with film morphology and domain wall energy, we conclude that the NLS, the LK, and the IFM models do not necessarily mutually exclude each other, but rather give a diverse perspective on the switching phenomenon based on thermodynamic, kinetic, statistic, microscopic, and/or macroscopic points of view.},

  abstract     = {Intermittent avalanches in a multitude of materials are characterized by acoustic emission, AE, where local events lead to strain relaxations and generate shock waves (so-called “jerks”), which are measured at the sample surface. The bane of this approach is that several avalanche mechanisms may contribute to the same AE spectrum so that a detailed analysis of each individual contribution becomes virtually impossible. It is, hence, essential to develop tools to separate signals from different dynamical processes, such as ferroic domain switching, collapse of porous inclusions, dislocation movements, entanglements, and so on. Particularly, difficult cases are dynamical microstructures in fcc alloys where the AE signal strength is weak. Nevertheless, using profile analysis of AE signals, we can distinguish between two mechanisms, namely, dislocation movements and dynamic entanglements in fcc 316L stainless steel. In this approach, we are able to measure the statistical AE durations of both subsets separately. The fingerprint for superposed avalanches with different durations is seen by the scaling between the energy E and the maximum amplitude A of each avalanche E ∼ A x with x = 2. While the same exponent x applies for both mechanisms, the scaling relation shows two branches with different absolute energy values. The two mechanisms are then confirmed by separating the energy distributions P(E) ∼ E −ε for the two mechanisms with ε = 1.55 for dislocation movements and ε = 1.36 for entanglements.},

In order to investigate the effects of free carrier doping on the structural, electrical, and magnetic properties of such delta-doped 1D structures, we have used nanosphere lithography to grow uniform arrays of vertically aligned NRs with fixed aspect ratios on single crystal Al 2 O 3 substrates using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE). The precise control of the elemental flux intensity and duration, facilitated by PAMBE, enables the growth of phase-pure nanostructures, resulting in spatial separation on the order of few nanometers, between the δ-Mn layer and the free carriers in the Si:GaN layer. Chemical quantification verifies the presence of Mn and Si, while Raman spectroscopy shows that Si doping enhances the local vibration mode associated with Mn bonded to N as well as the disorder-activated mode. The free carriers do not diminish the inherent magnetic ordering in these 1D structures, while magnetic measurements show a stability in the signal.},

  abstract     = {We fabricate elliptical planar Hall effect magnetometers with Permalloy thickness ranging between 25 and 200 nm. We study the thickness dependence of their equivalent magnetic noise by examining the effect of the layer thickness on the signal and noise including Joule heating contributions. Sensors with a thickness of 50 nm achieve equivalent magnetic noise as low as ∼24 pT/ √ Hz at 50 Hz and ∼36 pT/ √ Hz at 10 Hz, which are the best reported values for any type of magnetic sensor of similar or smaller size. These results are achieved without the use of magnetic flux concentrators, which helps to reduce the sensor volume while improving its spatial resolution and reducing the complexity and time of its production and, hence, its potential cost. We discuss different routes for further resolution improvements.},

Here, we demonstrate that for ferromagnetic films deposited on a semiconducting substrate, the Nernst effect of the semiconductor can serve as an internal reference for estimating the local temperatures present in the film and substrate. The Nernst effect in semiconductors is particularly large in the temperature region above 200 K where the semiconductor shows a strong change in the charge carrier concentration. As an example, we have studied the anomalous Nernst effect of 28 nm thick ferromagnetic Mn 5 Ge 3 C 0.8 films deposited on p-type Ge(111) substrates with the temperature gradient oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the film plane. From the additional contribution of the Nernst effect arising from the substrate and comparison with theory, we estimate the temperature gradient in the substrate and thin film for both configurations and determine the thermoelectric coefficients of the film.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a quantum phase, the topological insulator, has been vividly investigated in a variety of materials. Its unique band structure allows for optical generation and control of spin-polarized currents based on the circular photogalvanic effect. In this paper, we generate and distinguish the different photocurrent contributions via the polarization of the driving light wave. We discuss the helicity-dependent spin-polarized current and the polarization-independent thermoelectric current as spatially resolved maps, focusing on the influence of the topological insulator/metallic contact interface. We observe for both current contributions a significant enhancement of the current values at the topological insulator/metallic contact interface. In the case of the thermoelectric current, the enhancement is localized at the center of the interface. The spin-polarized current reaches two extrema per contact, which differ by their sign and are localized nearby the contact edges. We discuss the general behavior of the thermovoltage as a three-material Seebeck effect and explain the enhanced values by the acceleration of the photoelectrons generated in the space charge region of the topological insulator/metallic contact interface. Furthermore, we interpret the temperature gradient together with the spin Nernst effect as a possible origin for the enhancement and spatial distribution of the spin-polarized current.},

We demonstrate that N-implanted SBDs show a high level of isolation, which can be further improved by electron trapping promoted by current flow and temperature. Charge trapping leads to a shift in the current–voltage curve to more positive bias, a positive effect lasting for hundreds of seconds at room temperature and fully recovered only after 200 s even at 350 K. This charge trapping process takes place in the depletion region of the Schottky diode, in a defect located 0.72 eV below the conduction band, possibly related to gallium vacancies. A model for explaining the trapping kinetics and processes is proposed, based on differential rate equations, highlighting two capture processes: charge injection from the n-type Ga 2 O 3 into the space charge region and thermionic emission from the anode metal to the deep level.},

Surface defects were observed under the Schottky barrier diode, and their impacts on electrical properties were analyzed using a Murphy model and correlation factor analysis. We found that most crystalline defects (surface hillocks) were electrically non-active and that non-epitaxial crystallites and process-related field-plate cracks were the main defects that induced a large leakage current.

While keeping the total III–V layer below 2.7 μ m to avoid thermal cracks, we have achieved a sixfold reduction of TDD in InAs on Si compared to the unoptimized structure. We found a strong correlation between the metamorphic InAs surface roughness and TDD as a function of In x Al 1−x As buffer thickness. An optimal thickness of 175 nm was obtained where both phase separation and 3D islanding growth were suppressed. Moreover, a tensile-strained In 0.95 Al 0.05 As dislocation filter layer and high growth temperature of the InAs cap layer further assisted the dislocation reduction process, which led to a TDD to 1.37 × 10 8 cm −2 .

To accurately account for the polar phonon scattering rate, we take into account the dynamic screening at higher electron densities. An iterative solution of the Boltzmann transport equation is used in order to account for the inelastic and anisotropic nature of polar optical phonon scattering. The thermoelectric transport coefficients, Seebeck coefficient, Peltier coefficient, and electronic thermal conductivity, are calculated for a wide range of temperatures and doping densities. The calculated Seebeck coefficient is compared with the experimentally measured value and found to be in good agreement considering the mobility of the samples. The value of the Seebeck coefficient at 300 K is found to be −341 μ V K − 1 ⁠ , which is high compared to that of the other commonly studied semiconductors. The larger Seebeck coefficient is due to the higher density of states arising from comparatively high electron effective mass.},

This study systematically demonstrates the Si doping range and conditions to realize degenerate n -type Al 0.6 Ga 0.4 N layers based on the electron compensation effect. The temperature-independent electron concentrations resulting from the degenerate band appear in high Si doping conditions to overcome the electron compensation due to carbon on nitrogen sites (C N ). However, excessive Si doping of over 4.0 × 10 19 cm −3 leads to the collapse of the electronic degeneracy and a switch to the temperature-dependent electron transport via the impurity bands, where the luminescence bands originating from III vacancy-Si complexes ( V III - n Si) are dominant. The key parameter is the effective donor concentration, N d − N a , based on the reduction in electron concentrations via acceptor-like deep levels such as C N and V III - n Si. The Hall-effect analyses for n -type Al 0.6 Ga 0.4 N layers with various Si concentrations yielded an N d − N a value of (9.5 ± 2.9) × 10 18 cm −3 to vanish the ionization energy of Si donors, which is approximately six times higher than that in GaN. The results suggest not only the optimal doping range to obtain an Al-rich AlGaN layer with metallic conduction but also the necessity of the growth condition to minimize electron compensation.},

The charge state configurations of the nanowire TQD are studied by measurements of the direct transport signals of the TQD and by detection of the charge state transitions in the TQD via the nanowire QD sensor. Excellent agreement in the charge stability diagrams of the TQD obtained by the direct transport measurements and by the charge-state transition detection measurements is achieved. It is shown that the charge stability diagrams are featured by three groups of charge state transition lines of different slopes, corresponding to the changes in the electron occupation numbers of the three individual QDs in the TQD. It is also shown that the integrated nanowire QD sensor is highly sensitive and can detect the charge state transitions in the cases where the direct transport signals of the TQD are too weak to be measurable. Tuning to a regime, where all three QDs in the TQD are close to being on resonance with the Fermi level of the source and drain reservoirs and co-existence of triple and quadruple points becomes possible, has also been demonstrated with the help of the charge sensor in the region where the direct transport signals of the TQD are hardly visible.},

The growth rate of the films was found to linearly increase with the increase in the molar flow rate of TMGa and reach as high as ∼6 μ m/h at a flow rate of 580 μ mol/min. High purity, lightly Si-doped homoepitaxial β-Ga 2 O 3 films with a good surface morphology, a record low temperature electron mobility exceeding 23 000 cm 2 /V s at 32 K, and an acceptor concentration of 2 × 10 13 cm −3 were realized, showing an excellent purity film. Films with room temperature (RT) electron mobilities ranging from 71 cm 2 /V s to 138 cm 2 /V s with the corresponding free carrier densities between ∼1.1 × 10 19 cm −3 and ∼1.5 × 10 16 were demonstrated. For layers with the doping concentration in the range of high-10 17 and low-10 18 cm −3 , the RT electron mobility values were consistently more than 100 cm 2 /V s, suggesting that TMGa is suitable to grow channel layers for lateral devices, such as field effect transistors. The results demonstrate excellent purity of the films produced and confirm the suitability of the TMGa precursor for the growth of device quality β-Ga 2 O 3 films at a fast growth rate, meeting the demands for commercializing Ga 2 O 3 -based high voltage power devices by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition.},

  abstract     = {Inorganic perovskites have attracted intensive research attention. The perovskites ABX 3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) can be used for blue, green, and red emission by adjusting the halogen X. However, it is very hard to avoid halogen exchanging when different halide perovskites are used together for optoelectronic devices. We synthesized the all-bromide inorganic perovskite nanocrystals with full color emission. The blue emission with a center wavelength of 405 nm originates from the exciton recombination through the charge-transfer exciton state in perovskite Cs 4 PbBr 6 . The green emission with a center wavelength of 520 nm results from band edge-exciton recombination in perovskite CsPbBr 3 . The red emission with a center wavelength of 606 nm comes from the trapped- and self-trapped-exciton recombination in perovskite CsPb 2 Br 5 . Our experimental results show that all-bromide inorganic perovskite nanocrystals have great potential for full color light emitting devices.},

  abstract     = {Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs)—materials that have the twin desirable features of high optical transmission and electrical conductivity—play an increasingly significant role in the fields of photovoltaics and information technology. As an excellent TCO, Ta-doped anatase TiO 2 shows great promise for a wide range of applications. Here, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy is used to study the complex optical conductivity σ ̃ ω of the TCO—heavily Ta-doped TiO 2 thin films with different Ta-doping concentrations, in the frequency range of 0.3–2.7 THz and the temperature range of 10–300 K. Fitting the complex optical conductivity to a Drude-like behavior allows us to extract the temperature dependence of the effective mass, which suggests the existence of many-body large polarons. Moreover, the carrier scattering rate of Ta-doped TiO 2 with different carrier concentrations agrees with the interacting polaron gas theory. Our results suggest that with increasing electron density in TiO 2 , the interaction between polarons is larger and electron–phonon coupling is smaller, which is beneficial for achieving high mobility and conductivity in TiO 2 .},

Lowering the temperature, a transition from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic phase takes place, around 160 K. Such structural transition, monitored by temperature-dependent in situ x-ray diffraction and optical emission, is followed by an inversion of the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity from a semiconductor-like dependence to a metal-like one. The temperature for such semiconductor-metal transition, depending both on the applied electric field and on the optical excitation, is always below the phase transition temperature. The results demonstrate that perovskite materials display interesting scenarios in which lattice structural transitions combined with optical or electrical excitation strongly affect transport properties. The consequences of these characteristics are analyzed in fundamental and applied science perspectives.},

  abstract     = {Due to their frequency-dependent angular emission, leaky-wave antennas have been recently introduced in the terahertz band to tackle many of the challenges associated with THz wireless communications. Most previous works have exploited conventional leaky-wave waveguide architectures developed for the microwave region. In this paper, we study in detail the emission characteristics of leaky-wave antennas at THz frequencies. We show that, at these high frequencies, the wavelength-scale interaction with the aperture causes a nonuniform electric field distribution at the slot interface, which is a unique regime that is not typically encountered at lower frequencies. This effect is even more pronounced as the slot width increases to a point where the sides of the slot act as secondary leaking structures, and the well-known frequency–angle relationship is not obeyed as the energy at a given frequency is radiated in a broad range of angles. Therefore, to exploit the phase matching condition, which couples frequency to emission angle, one must use very thin rectangular slots d ≪ λ ⁠ , at the expense of device efficiency. To address this problem, we explore an alternate slot aperture design, in which the slot width increases linearly along its length (i.e., a trapezoidal shape). We show that this preserves the phase-matching constraint while allowing higher output coupling efficiencies. Moreover, since a wider effective aperture is used, the radiated beam is narrow in both angular directions, allowing the generation of true pencil-like THz beams.},

Although the band-to-band excitation transition in β -Ga 2 O 3 is allowed solely by the UV-C wavelength, the defective sites including oxygen vacancies can induce sub-bandgap absorption, resulting in high background noise. The UV-ozone treatment was performed at elevated temperatures to investigate its effect on removing these oxygen vacancies; it creates reactive oxygen radicals that can reach the β -Ga 2 O 3 lattice and passivate the defective sites. The chemical analysis through x-ray photoelectron and micro-Raman spectroscopies revealed an increase in Ga–O bonding after UV-ozone treatment. The optoelectrical measurements on the β -Ga 2 O 3 UV-C photodetectors showed that the UV-ozone treatment significantly decreased the response to UV-A light. Thus, the photodetector performance (photo-to-dark current ratio, responsivity, detectivity, and rejection ratio) was greatly enhanced; especially, the rejection ratio was increased to 4.56 × 10 8 by eight orders of magnitude after UV-ozone treatment. The remarkably improved UV-C selectivity in the β -Ga 2 O 3 solar-blind photodetector highlights its potential of realizing truly solar-blind photodetectors using a simple UV-ozone treatment technique.},

Such missions, which can last anywhere from hours to days, rely on efficient, lightweight, and high-aspect ratio designs to minimize energy consumption. We investigate a method of aerodynamic control that also permits energy harvesting through surface texturing on aircraft wings using multifunctional kirigami composites. These kirigami skins produce 3D surface features when axially strained and have been manufactured using thin-film solar cells. Here, we show that when actuated, these 3D features increase the drag over the wings, which can be used to control yaw. Wind tunnel experiments were conducted to quantify the effects of kirigami actuation on aerodynamic lift, drag, and yaw moment. These results demonstrate excellent yaw-control capabilities and delayed aerodynamic stall, indicating that the actuated kirigami features may delay flow separation. The implied multifunctionality of these kirigami skins is ideal for low-altitude UAVs, which benefit from both lightweight energy sources and actuators.},

A growth map is constructed using results from a broad range of growth conditions, which shows the dependence of Mg incorporation and surface roughness on the III/V ratio and growth temperatures. Detailed secondary ion mass spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy studies confirmed that N-rich conditions are favorable for significantly higher Mg-incorporation efficiency (∼80\%), whereas the Ga-rich growth condition is preferable for achieving a smooth surface morphology (root mean square roughness: ∼1–2 nm) with poor Mg incorporation. The room temperature Hall measurement confirms that the hole concentration in the range of ∼7 × 10 17 to 2 × 10 19 cm −3 can be achieved in Ga-rich and N-rich conditions, respectively, at a fixed Mg flux depending on the growth conditions.

Our findings reveal how such a multi-layer arrangement strongly affects the attenuation of the surface wave motion within and after the barrier. When the surface waves collide with the barriers, the wavefront is back-scattered and steered downward underneath the oscillators. Due to the stiffness gradient of the granular medium, part of the wavefield is then rerouted to the surface level after overcoming the resonant array. Overall, the in-depth insertion of additional layers of resonators leads to a greater and broader band wave attenuation when compared to the single layer case.},

Here, we report on parasitic modes arising from the finite size of the structure, which can significantly degrade the performance of these membranes. Through interferometric measurements and finite-element simulations, we show that these parasitic modes can hybridize with the localized modes of our structures, reducing the quality factors by up to one order of magnitude. To circumvent this problem, we engineer the spectral profile of the parasitic modes in order to avoid their overlap with the high-Q defect mode. We verify via a statistical analysis that the quality factors of devices fabricated with this modal engineering technique are consistently closer to the value predicted by dissipation dilution theory. We expect this method to find applications in a broad range of contexts such as optomechanical cooling, resonant force microscopy, swept-frequency sensing, or hybrid quantum networks.},

However, as homogeneity of the static field B 0 is a major condition for MR acquisitions, their propensity to warp the magnetic field in their vicinity as a result of magnetic flux expulsion could cause severe image degradation. In this Letter, we report on the observation of artifacts generated by magnetic flux expulsion from a HTS coil. To that end, we acquired MR images of a water sample in the vicinity of a nonresonant HTS coil for different cooling conditions. These are zero field cooling and field cooling of the coil inside a clinical MRI bore magnet of 1.5 T, for a range of working temperatures of the HTS coil. After zero-field cooling, we observed significant artifacts in the MR images, increasing with lower temperature; images acquired after field cooling did not display these alterations. We propose a phenomenological model for the magnetic field disturbance induced by the HTS coil. This model reproduces, in good agreement with the experiments, the phase distortion observed in the MR images and allows one to extract the critical current density of the HTS coil, an important technological parameter of superconductors. Finally, we discuss the necessity of field cooling as a way to avoid these B 0 inhomogeneity artifacts.},

Therefore, different photonic components demonstrated for off-chip operation must be realized in an integrated manner.

Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating the Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission from an In(Ga)As quantum dot coupled to a high-Q cavity-waveguide device. The combination with a piezoelectric actuator further enables the strain-induced emission energy tuning of the quantum dot as well as the cavity mode. We observe wavelength shifts up to 0.85 nm for the quantum dot, with a differential tuning factor of four between emitter and cavity. This allows for the full compensation of the spectral mismatch between a selected quantum dot and the cavity resonance. A nearly twofold enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate is observed at resonance with the on-demand generation of single photons. This demonstration of a strain-tunable emitter in a waveguide-coupled cavity device represents an essential building block for large scale quantum photonic circuits, especially if combined in the future with miniaturization approaches based on recently developed micromachined piezoelectric actuators.},

  abstract     = {Phonon modes at microwave frequencies can be cooled to their quantum ground state using conventional cryogenic refrigeration, providing a convenient way to study and manipulate quantum states at the single phonon level. Phonons are of particular interest because mechanical deformations can mediate interactions with a wide range of different quantum systems, including solid-state defects, superconducting qubits, and optical photons when using optomechanically active constructs. Phonons, thus, hold promise for quantum-focused applications as diverse as sensing, information processing, and communication. Here, we describe a piezoelectric quantum bulk acoustic resonator (QBAR) with a 4.88 GHz resonant frequency, which, at cryogenic temperatures, displays large electromechanical coupling strength combined with a high intrinsic mechanical quality factor, Q i ≈ 4.3 × 10 4 ⁠ . Using a recently developed flip-chip technique, we couple this QBAR resonator to a superconducting qubit on a separate die and demonstrate the quantum control of the mechanics in the coupled system. This approach promises a facile and flexible experimental approach to quantum acoustics and hybrid quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {α -Ag 2 S is a ductile inorganic semiconductor recently identified, which can undergo considerable plastic deformation without the aid of dislocations. Together with its intrinsically poor electrical conductivity, it is one ideal system to study the effect of plastic deformation on phonon thermal transport. In this work, we show that the room temperature phonon thermal conductivity of α -Ag 2 S monotonically increases with compressive strain by about 32\% at a compressive strain of 0.7. No deformation-induced phase transition occurs. Electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient are basically invariant with deformation. No transport anisotropy is observed between the directions that are parallel and perpendicular to the compression direction. The stored energy in α -Ag 2 S measured by differential scanning calorimetry increases with strain but is remarkably larger than plastically deformed Cu at large strains. Possible origins for the increasing phonon thermal conductivity with plastic deformation are discussed. The present work provides original experimental observations on the effect of plastic deformation on phonon thermal conductivity, and it has important implications for the development of α -Ag 2 S-based ductile thermoelectric semiconductors and devices.},

Although substantial research has been done to reveal the occurrence and control mechanisms of such oscillations, the heat transfer mechanism remains a puzzle to be solved. In particular, it is believed that the heat transfer deterioration can be attributed to the flow velocity variation, namely, the amplitude and period of the oscillations. Here, we show that the heat transfer deterioration does not necessarily depend on the flow velocity variation. Using controlled experiments, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of the heat transfer deterioration during flow oscillations. We show that the associated pressure oscillations play a dominant role in triggering the heat transfer deterioration. In the absence of pressure oscillations, even a high amplitude flow velocity oscillation does not deteriorate the heat transfer rates in the studied conditions.},

The MOSFETs with L g = 200 nm had a maximum drain current density of about 250 mA/mm and a peak extrinsic transconductance of 17 mS/mm. The short-channel effect was well suppressed for the devices with L g ≥200 nm, leading to excellent RF device characteristics represented by a record maximum oscillation frequency of 27 GHz at L g = 200 nm. From simple delay-time analysis on the MOSFETs, the effective electron velocity passing through a region under the gate was estimated to be about 2 × 10 6 cm/s. Moreover, it was analyzed that the parasitic channel charging delay occupied a substantial proportion of the total delay due to a large sheet resistance of the Ga 2 O 3 channel and thus limited their high-frequency device performance. These results suggest that both suppressing the short channel effect with a reduction in L g to the sub-0.1- μ m range and minimizing the access resistance are important to further improve RF device characteristics of Ga 2 O 3 MOSFETs.},

The moisture-induced degradation mechanism was revealed by the temperature dependence of the in situ XRD pattern sequences and first-principles calculations based on the nudged elastic band method. The combination of experimental and computational data suggests that the MAPbI 3 crystal spontaneously changes into the MAPbI 3 mono-hydrate crystal once water molecules activated with an energy of more than ∼0.6 eV penetrate the (100) outer surface of the MAPbI 3 lattice.

  abstract     = {Solid-state humidity sensors are generally AC powered as they sense the fluctuations in the dielectric polarization and/or ionic conductance of the water layer formed by Kelvin condensation on the effective surface of their hydrophilic sensing elements. DC-powered, printable, and bendable hygrometers, however, are demanded for battery-driven wearable electronics. Here, we demonstrate that the electronic (as opposed to ionic) conduction in the polymer composite poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) thin films constantly decreases with increasing relative humidity (RH) in the surrounding atmosphere and use this property for the fabrication of a DC-powered solid state hygrometer. PEDOT, the conductive component of this composite, is hydrophobic, and the hydrogen bonding of the airborne H 2 O to the surface available sulfonic acid groups of the non-conductive component, PSS, is verified as the main cause of sensitivity. This hydrogen bonding deters the doping action involving H + transfer from the sulfonic acid groups to the thiophene groups on the PEDOT chain and decreases the bulk conductivity of the sensing element. As predicted by this model, the electrical resistance measurements carried out by applying DC and AC electric fields lead to different RH dependences; the former demonstrates the positive RH dependence in the full RH range, while the latter results in strongly nonlinear RH sensitivity crossing zero around RH 60\%. Our model assists better understanding of the charge conduction mechanisms in PEDOT:PSS. The described sensing mechanism is anticipated to initiate research on many two-component organic composites for the fabrication of varieties of gas and humidity sensors.},

While the thermal responses from the thin film and the substrate cannot be distinguished due to their similar thermal diffusivities, we show that the recombination dynamics of photocarriers in the organic semiconductor thin films occur on a similar timescale and can be separated from the thermal response. Our measurements indicate that the photocarrier dynamics are determined by multiple recombination processes and our extracted recombination rates are in good agreement with previous reports using other techniques. We further apply TG spectroscopy to characterize another conjugated polymer and a molecular fluorescent material to demonstrate its general applicability. Our study indicates the potential of transient grating spectroscopy to simultaneously characterize thermal transport and photocarrier dynamics in organic optoelectronic devices.},

Here, we study the microscopic origin of transport anisotropy in lithographically defined four-terminal tellurene devices using spatially resolved near-field scanning microwave microscopy (SMM). Our conductivity- and carrier type-sensitive SMM imaging reveals that the overall p-type transport measured between adjacent and opposite terminals originates from strong p-type character at the device edges. Despite using an atomic layer deposition-grown conformal overcoat that n-dopes the device interior, we observe only weak n-type transport along the main device channel at positive backgate voltages. This weak n-type transport along the device channel is shown to arise from local p-doping within a few micrometers of the electrodes, which produces a transport barrier from the n-type interior to the electrodes. These results reveal how the backgate-dependent conduction anisotropy could be leveraged to weigh different inputs for non-von Neumann architectures.},

In this Letter, we provide a theoretical explanation for extremely high-effective FEFs ( ⁠ 10 4 ≲ γ eff ≲ 10 5 ⁠ ) recently extracted from an orthodoxy theory analysis of the emission current–voltage characteristics of looped carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers, making them promising candidates for FE applications. In this work, we found a dependence of γ a on the geometrical parameters for an isolated conductive looped CNT fiber, modeled via the finite element technique. The aFEF of looped CNT fibers is found to scale as γ a = 2 + [ h f / r fiber ] [ ln ( 2 h / r fiber ) ] − 1 ⁠ , where f ≡ 1 + θ [ r fiber / b ] α [ ln ( 2 h / r fiber ) − 1 ] ⁠ , in which h is the height of a looped fiber standing on an emitter plate, b is its base length, r fiber is the radius of the fiber, and θ and α are fitting parameters that have a nonlinear dependence on the scaling parameter h / b . Our results show that the scaling law predicts that 10 ≲ γ a ≲ 100 for looped CNT fibers with parameters: 10 μ m ≤ r fiber ≤ 100 μ m, 0.4 ≤ h / b ≤ 2, and d / h ≥ 1 ⁠ , where d is the distance between the apex of the looped fiber and the anode. However, scanning electron microscopy images reveal the presence of microfibrils protruding from the looped CNT fiber surface close to its apex. We show that the modeling of a combined two-stage structure (looped CNT fiber + fibrils) leads to aFEF values in excellent agreement with an orthodoxy theory analysis of FE experiments performed on these fibers.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate the effects of various electrodes on the ferroelectric properties of ultrathin HfZrO x (HZO) films. The ferroelectric polarization is totally suppressed in the HZO films with TiN and W bottom electrodes when the film thickness is below 5 nm. These results can be attributed to the formation of a dead layer at the bottom electrode/HZO interface during the atomic layer deposition (ALD) and annealing processes. On the other hand, the HZO film with a Pt bottom electrode shows an excellent P–E loop with a very high switchable polarization (2P r ) of 42.5 μ C/cm 2 even at a film thickness of 2.5 nm. Through the short pulse switching technique, we confirm the formation of a thick dead layer in the HZO films with TiN and W electrodes, which inhibits the formation of the orthorhombic phase in these ultrathin HZO films. This implies that the ferroelectric property of ultrathin HZO films can be improved by choosing an appropriate electrode material capable of suppress ing the formation of a dead layer.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we accurately visualized the valence electron density distributions of ferroelectrics PbTiO 3 and BaTiO 3 by analyzing synchrotron-radiation powder x-ray diffraction (SXRD) data using the Rietveld method and the maximum entropy method. Clear SXRD evidence indicates that the Pb ion in PbTiO 3 is polarized in the ferroelectric phase, whereas the Ba ion in BaTiO 3 is not polarized and fully ionized as a Ba 2+ ion. The large electronic polarization of the Pb ion is attributed to the anisotropic spatial distribution of the lone-pair electrons of the Pb 2+ ion, particularly the anisotropic p -like orbital of the lone-pair electrons caused by the formation of Pb–O covalent bonds. In PbTiO 3 , the contribution of the electronic polarization of the Pb ion to the spontaneous polarization is significant. We experimentally evaluate the contributions of the ionic polarization and the electronic polarization, respectively, from the valence electron density distribution map and demonstrate that the spontaneous polarization can be calculated from the SXRD data as the sum of them. One of the Ti–O covalent bonds is broken at the phase transition in PbTiO 3 , whereas no change in the atomic coordination is observed in BaTiO 3 . When focusing on the covalent bonding network, we propose using a layered material for PbTiO 3 in the ferroelectric phase. These results agree well with those of first-principles calculations. We expect further comprehensive valence electron density studies can be performed by combining SXRD experiments and first-principles calculations to better understand the emergence of ferroelectricity.},

For the nucleation process from amorphous HfO 2 in the thin film during thermal annealing, the tetragonal phase can be thermodynamically preferred with the effects of dopant and surface energy and temperature for which entropy is directly calculated from phonon spectrum calculations. During cooling down, the diffusionless phase transition from the tetragonal to ferroelectric phase takes place by atomic displacement and the transition to the monoclinic phase is suppressed by the high kinetic activation barrier. The phase transition process from the tetragonal phase to the ferroelectric phase is directly confirmed by ab initio molecular-dynamics simulation.},

It was revealed that both the dielectric breakdown strength ( E b ) and the maximum polarization ( P m ) in the multilayered composite films are increased. Consequently, an ultra-high and recoverable energy storage density ( W re ) of ∼101 J/cm 3 and a high efficiency ( η ) of ∼62\% were achieved in the composite film with an 18 wt.\% STO content. The enhanced W re in the multilayered composite is attributed to the internal-strain release of the PLZT layers and charge blocking by the STO layers with significantly enhanced E b . The results suggest an effective way of improving the energy storage performances by combining AFE PLZT and PE STO.},

Our method can detect arbitrary M x and M y components without an external magnetic field, which is useful for fast characterization of type-X, type-Y, and type-XY SOT magnetization switching.

The SnO layers consist of (001)-oriented grains without in-plane epitaxial relation to the substrate. After subsequent contact processing and mesa-etching (which drastically reduced the reverse current spreading in the SnO layer and associated high leakage), electrical characterization by current–voltage and capacitance–voltage measurement was performed. The results reveal a type-I band alignment and junction transport by thermionic emission in forward bias. A rectification of 2 × 10 8 at ±1 V, an ideality factor of 1.16, a differential specific on-resistance of 3.9 m Ω cm 2 , and a built-in voltage of 0.96 V were determined. The pn -junction isolation prevented parallel conduction in the highly conductive Ga 2 O 3 substrate during van-der-Pauw Hall measurements of the SnO layer on top, highlighting the potential for decoupling the p -type functionality in lateral transport devices from that of the underlying n -type substrate. The measured maximum reverse breakdown voltage of the diodes of 66 V corresponds to a peak breakdown field of 2.2 MV/cm in the Ga 2 O 3 -depletion region and suggests the low bandgap of the SnO ( ⁠ ≈ 0.7 eV) not to be the limiting factor for breakdown. Higher breakdown voltages that are required in high-voltage devices could be achieved by reducing the donor concentration in the β -Ga 2 O 3 toward the interface to increase the depletion width, as well as improving the contact geometry to reduce field crowding.},

By comparing with explicit interface calculations, we confirm that alignments can be reliably extracted from slab calculations that take atomic relaxation and strain into account.

Tensile strain in Al 2 O 3 is found to lower the conduction band; the absolute deformation potential is calculated to be −9.5 eV for Al 2 O 3 and −9.1 eV for Ga 2 O 3 .

  abstract     = {The quasi-static anisotropic permittivity parameters of electrically insulating beta gallium oxide ( β -Ga 2 O 3 ) were determined by terahertz spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved frequency domain spectroscopy in the spectral range from 200 GHz to 1 THz was carried out on bulk crystals along different orientations. Principal directions for permittivity were determined along crystallographic axes c and b and reciprocal lattice direction a * ⁠ . No significant frequency dispersion in the real part of dielectric permittivity was observed in the measured spectral range. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent radio frequency capacitance measurements as well as with extrapolations from recent infrared measurements of phonon mode and high-frequency contributions and close the knowledge gap for these parameters in the terahertz spectral range. Our results are important for applications of β -Ga 2 O 3 in high-frequency electronic devices.},

We find a reduction in the thermal conductivity of Al x Ga 1− x N by more than one order of magnitude compared to that of GaN, which indicates a strong effect of phonon-alloy scattering. It is shown that the short-mean free path phonons are strongly scattered, which leads to a major contribution of the long-mean free path phonons to the thermal conductivity. In thin layers, the long-mean free path phonons become efficiently scattered by the boundaries, resulting in a further decrease in the thermal conductivity. Also, an asymmetry of thermal conductivity as a function of Al content is experimentally observed and attributed to the mass difference between Ga and Al host atoms.},

  abstract     = {Mg-doped AlGaN short-period superlattices with a high aluminum mole fraction are promising to fabricate highly efficient deep UV light emitting diodes. We present a robust and easy-to-implement experimental method for quantification of the vertical component of the anisotropic short-period superlattice conductivity based on current–voltage characteristics of devices with varying short-period superlattice thicknesses. In particular, the vertical conductivity of Al 0.71 Ga 0.29 N/Al 0.65 Ga 0.35 N:Mg short-period superlattices is investigated and found to be strongly affected by the temperature and by the applied electric field. At room temperature, the vertical conductivity varies between 5.5 × 10 −7 Ω −1 cm −1 at 0.05 MV cm −1 and 6.7 × 10 −5 Ω −1 cm −1 at 0.98 MV cm −1 and increases by almost two orders of magnitude when the temperature increases up to 100 °C. This behavior is in very good agreement with simulations based on a 3D-Poole–Frenkel model. In addition, the zero-field ionization energy and the inter-trap distance of the Mg acceptors in the AlGaN short-period superlattices were determined to be 510 ± 20 meV and 5.1 ± 0.3 nm, respectively.},

Its unit cell is composed of four different helicoidal cavities filled by porous media, which are structured and quasi-isotropic micro-lattices with a variable lattice constant. The effective thickness and intrinsic losses of each helicoidal cavity can be adjusted independently by varying their macro- and micro-structures, namely, the number of revolution of the folded structure and the lattice constant of the micro-lattice. An analytical model predicting the physical properties of this metaporous surface is developed. The macro- and micro-structures are then jointly optimized for sub-wavelength broadband perfect absorption. Finally, the system is 3D printed and experimentally tested. The experimental results are found to be in good agreement with the theory and show an almost perfect absorption over a frequency range out of reach for the homogeneous constitutive porous medium and the only helicoidal cavities.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high-porosity structure, the low thermal transport property of graphene foam (GF) is expected. However, the interconnected skeleton can still act as excellent thermal conductor branches if phonon scattering is not severely affected in the structure of graphene flakes. Such a property has not been validated experimentally due to the difficulty in sample manipulation and the fragility of the structure. In this work, we report the characterization results of thermal properties of the free-standing skeleton in GF. Three individual skeleton samples from one GF piece are prepared under the same condition. The thermal diffusivity of GF skeletons is characterized in the range of 3.26–3.48 × 10 −4 m 2 /s, and the thermal conductivity is determined to be 520–555 W/(m K), which is two orders of magnitude larger than the value of bulk GF. These high thermal conductivity values originate from the intrinsic thermal property of graphene, while the contact interfaces, wrinkled structures, and defects induced in the synthesis process do not affect the phonon transport property significantly, which proves that the three-dimensional hierarchical graphene structure can still be implemented in energy-intensive applications.},

Here, we report on germanium quantum dot photodetectors (Ge QD PDs) with a 25-nm-thick active layer that possesses both high internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and fast photoresponse, yet is still based on simple design and fabrication. We characterize these devices with continuous wave (CW) and pulsed excitation at room temperature as a function of incident power and applied bias. Under the reverse bias of –4 V, the IQE approaches ∼2000\% over a broad spectral range ( λ = 500–800 nm). The transient photoresponse speed to a 4.5 ns laser pulse at λ = 640 nm is under 20 ns. Furthermore, we observe an interesting phenomenon: by superimposing a weak CW HeNe laser beam ( ⁠ λ = 632.8 nm) on the laser pulse, we obtain an optically tunable photoresponse while retaining fast speed. This study elucidates the role of photocarrier generation, trapping, and hopping in the percolative Ge QD oxide matrix and helps explain the observed high gain and fast response speed. The demonstrated IQE and nanosecond response time render our devices suitable for low-light detection and imaging.},

Vertical geometry diode is, among possible geometries, the one that has led to the best performance so far. However, this geometry suffers from a lack of tunability after its fabrication, slowing down possible improvements. Here, we demonstrate gate control on a vertical diode in which the active layer is made of HgTe NCs absorbing in the extended short-wave infrared (2.5 μ m). To reach this goal, we take advantage of the electrostatic transparency of graphene, combined with the high capacitance LaF 3 ionic glass to design a gate tunable photodiode. The latter behaves as a work function-tunable electrode which lets the gate-induced electric field tune the carrier density within the nanocrystal film. In particular, we show that the gate allows to tune the band profile leading to more efficient charge extraction and thus an enhanced photoresponse (×4 compared to the device with a floating gate). This work also demonstrates that photoelectron extraction can still be improved in the existing diode, by better controlling the doping profile of the stack.},

In this Letter, we have introduced an efficient method to determine the TC of an incomplete vortex beam (partially blocked by an obstacle) using its reconstructed phase distribution under propagation. The numerical and experimental results showed that the sign and magnitude of the TC can be simultaneously determined by counting the number of phase singularities and the directions of the phase variations around the singularities occurring in the reconstructed phase pattern, respectively. Our method works even when half of the vortex beam is blocked.},

  abstract     = {A magnesium delta-doped AlGaN last barrier (MDDLB) was introduced in the structure of deep ultraviolet light emitting diodes (DUV LEDs) to improve their light output power. The MDDLB effectively improved hole injection efficiency and increased the hole concentration at the last AlGaN well of DUV LEDs. It also raised the potential barrier for electron transport from multiple quantum wells to the p-side. Therefore, it reduced overflow of electrons into the p-side of DUV LEDs. These phenomena improved light emitting efficiency of DUV LEDs with the MDDLB. In addition, the current crowding effect was suppressed by the MDDLB in DUV LEDs. Therefore, the 350 mA-light output power of DUV LEDs with the MDDLB was approximately 30\% larger than that of DUV LEDs without the MDDLB. Furthermore, the largest light output power of DUV LEDs with the MDDLB was 55 mW, which was approximately 46\% larger than that of DUV LEDs without the MDDLB. The suppressed current crowding effect by the MDDLB also reduced efficiency droops of DUV LEDs with the MDDLB. Therefore, efficiency droops of DUV LEDs decreased from 64\% to 55\% when the MDDLB was introduced.},

Relativistically intense laser pulses incident on the outer surface of a microtube target consisting of a thin opaque shell surrounding a μ m-scale cylindrical void drive an initial ion implosion and later explosion capable of generating and subsequently amplifying strong magnetic fields. While the magnetic field generation is enhanced and spatially smoothed by the application of a kilotesla-level seed field, the sign of the generated field does not always follow the sign of the seed field. One unexpected consequence of the amplification process is a reversal in the sign of the amplified magnetic field when, for example, the target outer cross section is changed from square to circular. Using 2D particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that sign reversal is linked to the stability of the surface magnetic field of opposite sign from the seed, which arises at the target inner surface during laser irradiation. The stability of the surface magnetic field and, consequently, the sign of the final amplified field depend sensitively on the target, laser, and seed magnetic field conditions, which could be leveraged to make laser-driven microtube implosions an attractive platform for the study of magnetic fields in high energy density plasma in regimes where sign reversal either is or is not desired.},

  abstract     = {The generation of high-fidelity polarization-entangled photon pairs, to date, has been demonstrated on specific spatial modes or over relatively narrow apertures. We put forward and demonstrate an experimental scheme to extend the temporal and spatial indistinguishability of polarization-entangled photons over wide emission angles, which can be applied to cover the whole spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) cone. Over such a wide angular extent, while the time-delay map is almost flat which renders the conventional compensation via a birefringent element an appropriate approach, the relative-phase map—verified as a quadratic function—necessitates a tunable compensation paradigm. Here, to do so, we employ a phase-only two-dimensional spatial light modulator (2D SLM) loaded by the complementary of the relative phase map to equalize the phase variations for one third of the noncollinear SPDC emission. After eliminating the temporal and spatial distinguishability over the 2D SLM area, a 97\% polarization visibility is verified for the entangled photon pairs scattered widely across the SPDC cone.},

Recently, single-photon emitters in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials have attracted tremendous attention because of their atomic thickness, allowing for high photon extraction efficiency and easy integration into photonic circuits. In particular, a defect hosted by 2D hexagonal boron nitride ( h BN) is expected to be a promising candidate for next-generation single-photon sources due to its chemical and thermal stability and high brightness at room temperature. Here, we report an effective method for generating single-photon emission in mechanically exfoliated h BN flakes by annealing in a carbon-rich environment. The one-step annealing in a mixed atmosphere (Ar:CH 4 :H 2 = 15:5:1) greatly increases the single-photon emitter density in h BN. The resulting single-photon emission shows high stability and brightness. Our results provide an effective method for generating room-temperature single-photon emitters in 2D h BN.},

  abstract     = {Variable microwave-frequency couplers are highly useful components in classical communication systems and likely will play an important role in quantum communication applications. Conventional semiconductor-based microwave couplers have been used with superconducting quantum circuits, enabling, for example, the in situ measurements of multiple devices via a common readout chain. However, the semiconducting elements are lossy and furthermore dissipate energy when switched, making them unsuitable for cryogenic applications requiring rapid, repeated switching. Superconducting Josephson junction-based couplers can be designed for dissipation-free operation with fast switching and are easily integrated with superconducting quantum circuits. These enable on-chip, quantum-coherent routing of microwave photons, providing an appealing alternative to semiconductor switches. Here, we present and characterize a chip-based broadband microwave variable coupler, tunable over 4–8 GHz with over 1.5 GHz instantaneous bandwidth, based on the superconducting quantum interference device with two parallel Josephson junctions. The coupler is dissipation-free and features large on-off ratios in excess of 40 dB, and the coupling can be changed in about 10 ns. The simple design presented here can be readily integrated with superconducting qubit circuits and can be easily generalized to realize a four- or more port device.},

We give a phenomenological description and experimental demonstration of the effects of nitrogen implantation in a buried blocking layer on the performance of transistors. The partial activation of acceptor-like states in the buried implanted region has been revealed and estimated to be ∼20\% through a junction spectroscopic technique involving substrate-bias and sub-bandgap illumination, which remains elusive to standard characterization techniques. The characterization technique, along with a space-charge model of the channel and band model of the buried implanted layer, has revealed the presence of photosensitive mid-bandgap (∼2.47 eV below the conduction band) and tail states near the valence band edge of nitrogen-implanted β -Ga 2 O 3 .},

The β-Ga 2 O 3 VCTs under consideration have fundamental mode resonance frequencies at ∼25 MHz–1 GHz, with quality factors ( Q s) of ∼100–5000 and transconductance g m at ∼0.2 nS–5 μ S.

Reduction of trench depth z 0 can engender a major enhancement in readout current. Reducing channel thickness h and increasing channel length L can improve the readout current while downshifting the resonance frequency at the same time. We design β-Ga 2 O 3 VCT with a suspended modulation doped field effect transistor structure for efficient operation in the GHz range.

Based on the leaky-wave theory and optical holographic principle, the anisotropic impedance pattern can be properly mapped by shaping the quasi-periodic metasurface with different meta-atom sizes. Compared with the prevalent spatial wave-modulated metasurface, this surface wave-modulated holographic metasurface effectively transforms a reference wave excited by a feeding source in a single point at the center of the antenna to a leaky high-order Bessel vortex beam without any extra air feeding, which enables a unique characteristic of error-free alignment between the air feeding and designed metasurface.

Here, a study of the switching kinetics and the timing second-order effects in memristors based on pristine and nanocomposite (with embedded silver nanoparticles) parylene is presented. The strong decrease in the resistive switching time and increase in the amplitude of the resistive state change after preliminary heating pulses are revealed. These effects are explained by the local heating of the parylene matrix by electric pulses, and the given explanation is supported by the numerical electrothermal model.

When using a silver tip to excite the molecule electronically decoupled from the Ag(100) substrate by an ultrathin sodium chloride spacer, we only observe the Q-band electroluminescence originating from the radiative decay of the S 1 first excited state, without any B-band emission due to the lack of effective plasmonic enhancement for the B-band. However, when the nanocavity plasmon resonance is tuned to a bluer range by using an aluminum tip, the S 2 electroluminescence from a single zinc porphyrin shows up because the nanocavity plasmon mode can now spectrally overlap with the B-band emission to generate efficient plasmonic enhancement for the radiative decay directly from the S 2 state. Interestingly, the excitation mechanisms for these two types of emission are found to be different. While the Q-band emission is attributed mainly to a carrier-injection mechanism, the B-band electroluminescence is found to be excited via an inelastic electron scattering process. Our results open a route to investigate the photophysical property and dynamic behavior of isolated molecules in their excited states.},

A growth model has been established to address this peculiar phenomenon, emphasizing the impact of surface/interface tensions on the stability of the leading catalyst droplet.

A theoretical analysis showed that the excited surface plasmon exhibit stronger electric field components at the common metal-to-air interface. The Tb 14 Fe 68 Co 18 nanotip array provided more powerful nanofocusing and a lower infrared reflectivity than an array shaped on a traditional aluminum film. By adjusting the structural parameters of the nanorhombus array formed on the TbCo film system, the convergent light spot could be modulated to improve light absorption markedly.},

  abstract     = {We describe a technique for fabricating one-dimensional Ohmic contacts to individual graphene layers encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN) using CF 4 and O 2 plasmas. The high etch selectivity of h -BN against graphene (&gt;1000) is achieved by increasing the plasma pressure, which enables etching of h -BN, while graphene acts as an etch stop to protect underlying h -BN. A low-pressure O 2 plasma anisotropically etches graphene in the vertical direction, which exposes graphene edges at h -BN sidewalls. Despite the O 2 plasma bombardment, the lower h -BN layer functions as an insulating layer. Thus, this method allows us to pattern metal electrodes on h -BN over a second graphene layer. Subsequent electron-beam lithography and evaporation fabricate metal contacts at the graphene edges that are active down to cryogenic temperatures. This fabrication method is demonstrated by the preparation of a graphene Hall bar with a graphite backgate and double bilayer-graphene Hall bar devices. The high flexibility of the device geometries enabled by this method creates access to a variety of experiments on electrostatically coupled graphene layers.},

  abstract     = {We propose a capacitance measurement scheme that enables quantitative characterization of ferroelectric thin films integrated on semiconductors. The film defect density is estimated by measurements of the CV hysteresis and frequency dispersion, whereas important device parameters such as memory window and endurance can be extracted by a unidirectional CV method. The simple measurement scheme and the usage of metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors rather than MOSFETs make the proposed methods suitable for the future optimization of ferroelectric field effect transistor and negative capacitance field effect transistor gate stacks. Specifically, we present data for the narrow bandgap semiconductor InAs and show that low temperature characterization is critical to reduce the influence of the minority carrier response; however, the methods should be transferrable to room temperature for semiconductors with a wider bandgap. Our results clearly indicate that the defect density of the Hf x Zr 1− x O 2 (HZO) films increases at the crystallization temperature, but the increase is modest and remains independent of the annealing temperature at even more elevated temperatures. It is also shown that the shrinkage of the memory window caused by field cycling is not accompanied by an increase in defect density.},

The HZO on the W electrode exhibits stable ferroelectricity with a remanent polarization of 14 μ C/cm 2 , an enhanced tunneling electroresistance of 16, and excellent synaptic properties. We found that a large tensile stress was induced on a HZO thin film, owing to a low thermal expansion coefficient of the W bottom electrode. The low thermal expansion coefficient results in the effective formation of an orthorhombic phase, even in an ultra-thin HZO film. This was verified by a comparative study of the electrical characteristics, grazing-angle incidence x-ray diffraction, and residual stress measurement of the HZO film on various bottom electrodes with different thermal expansion coefficients. In addition, this study demonstrates the suitable functions of the FTJ for electronic synapses, such as analog-like resistance transition under various pulse schemes. The fabricated stress-engineered FTJ exhibits an appropriate conductance ratio, linearly modulated long-term potentiation and depression characteristics, and excellent reliability. These characteristics render FTJs ideal electronic devices for neuromorphic computing systems.},

  abstract     = {The superconductor proximity effect in systems comprising metallic nanoparticles (NPs) and molecules (NP/molecule/superconductor heterostructure) is an intriguing phenomenon that gives rise to important questions, from both fundamental and applicative perspectives, about the nature of Andreev reflections in nanoscale NPs and molecules and the interplay between the different energy scales, which remain hotly debated. In recent studies of such systems, a unique proximity effect was observed, manifested by an enhancement, rather than reduction, of the superconductor critical temperature, T C , which can be related to higher order Andreev reflections of Cooper pairs that couple through the organic molecule linkers. In the present study, we investigate the proximity effect in such hybrid systems, using two types of superconducting films (Nb 0.17 Re 0.83 and Nb), coupled Au or Ag NPs, via chiral or non-chiral molecule linkers. Non-chiral linkers lead to an enhancement of T C after NP attachment, in agreement with previous results, while chiral linkers cause a decrease in T C following NP adsorption. The results with chiral linkers can be explained by the following possible factors: the magnetic-like behavior that chiral molecules exhibit owing to their spin-filtering properties, which should enhance pair breaking, and strong spin–orbit coupling at the linker/NP interface that affects Andreev reflections between the superconductor and the NP and acts to reduce T C within a two-band model we discuss. The insight gained from this work into the interaction between chiral molecules and superconductors is of importance for applications in chiral-based superconducting spintronics.},

As demonstrated analytically and fully numerically, the system exhibits exceptional points at which a charge current flowing in the substrate results in extraordinary characteristics of magnetic excitation and signal propagation in the SAF. We predict local electric steering, amplification, and damping of magnonic excitations by tuning the voltage on the substrate. Electrical amplification and local control of spin-pumping currents are also demonstrated.

We find intrinsic magnon spin-diffusion lengths of up to 1.5 μ m, and magnetic domain governed decay lengths of 175 nm for the low-frequency magnons, through electrical transport measurements demonstrating that the introduction of nonmagnetic dopants does not strongly reduce the transport length scale, showing that the magnetic damping of hematite is not significantly increased. We observe a complex field dependence of the nonlocal signal independent of the magnetic state visible, in the local magnetoresistance and direct magnetic imaging of the antiferromagnetic domain structure.

However, the determined mechanisms for magnetization switching have not been fully studied. With varying growth temperatures, we have prepared FePt single layers with the same thickness (3 nm) but with different disordering. We have found that nearly full magnetization switching only happens in more disordered films, and the magnetization switching ratio becomes smaller with increasing L 1 0 ordering. The method for deriving effective spin torque fields in the previous studies cannot fully explain the spin current generation and self-induced SOT in the L 1 0 -FePt single layer.

Al x Ga 1− x N is a technologically important ultra-wide-bandgap alloy with promise in light emitting diodes and high-power transistors. Alloying introduces statistical disorder, which causes electrons to scatter between different crystal-momentum states, leading to a reduction in mobility for intermediate alloy compositions. The corresponding lifetime, which appears as an energy broadening in the band structure, can be evaluated by unfolding the band structure from the supercell basis to the primitive-cell basis. We fit the first-principles band broadening with a model scattering potential and evaluate the low-field electron mobility using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation-time approximation. Our calculated mobility is in agreement with experimental values. We also find the lowest alloy-scattering electron mobility (total electron mobility) across the entire composition range to be 186 c m 2 / V s ( ⁠ 136 c m 2 / V s ⁠ ), which is comparable to the highest electron mobility predicted in the competitor system, β - ( Al x Ga 1 − x ) 2 O 3 ⁠ .

GaN layers grown on freestanding substrates with vicinal surfaces led to good transistor behaviors for the m -plane as well as the c -plane. It was found that PMA improves the electron mobility in the MIS channel ( μ EFF ) for both the c - and m -planes, and that μ EFF for the m -plane is slightly higher than that for the c -plane both with and without PMA. Temperature dependences of μ EFF clarified that μ EFF for the m -plane is dominantly limited by phonon scattering, while both Coulomb and phonon scatterings are dominant for the c -plane.

Lifetimes and diffusion coefficients are extracted using two pump–probe techniques based on free-carrier absorption and transient-grating principles and then correlated with the corresponding defect evolution from spectroscopic measurements. The neutral monovacancy is revealed as the main carrier recombination center in the as-irradiated diamond, providing bipolar carrier lifetimes of a few nanoseconds at the highest irradiation dose. Carrier-capture cross sections are reduced during annealing as vacancies aggregate into divacancies at ≤1000 °C and extended vacancy clusters at 1450 °C.},

The deformation behavior of the magneto-active pipe is investigated by using the three-dimensional reconstruction, simulation, and theoretical analysis. The larger deformation under a high magnetic field produces higher driving pressure, and thus, the MAPP can be used to transfer liquid. It is found that the MAPP responds to the strength and frequency of the magnetic field simultaneously and the pumping performance can be analyzed by a magneto-fluid-solid coupling simulation. This work provides guidance for the design and manufacture of pulse pumps in future heart pump components.},

Vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) have the capability for providing an extra degree of freedom to increase the channel and capacity of the wireless communication system. In this Letter, we demonstrate an effective route to achieving efficient bidirectional multi-mode microwave circularly polarized vortex beam generation enabled by spoof surface plasmon polariton (spoof SPPs, SSPPs). According to the dispersion relation of the SSPP waveguide and the radiation principle for a leaky-wave antenna, multi-OAM-mode vortex beams with different topological charges can be generated by changing the operating frequency without changing the structure. Interestingly, the emitter simultaneously radiates the right-hand circularly polarized and the left-hand circularly polarized vortex beams with opposite topological charge values upward and downward, respectively. Simulation and experimental results show that this planar SSPP vortex emitter has the advantages of single-fed, bidirectional, multi-mode, and integration compatibility.},

However, the current broadband light trapping suffers from undesirable direct Joule heat output with plasmonics or bulkiness with photonics. Here, we report a light-trapping photonic structure using an ultrathin all-dielectric super-absorbing metasurface. This presented photonic structure features asymmetrically coupled magnetic resonances, which eliminate reflection and transmission simultaneously by introducing destructive interference between the backscattered field of the resonance and the direct reflected field of the highly reflective Fabry–Pérot background. In particular, this photonic structure enables broadband light trapping by placing nanostructures of different sizes in a supercell. As a proof of concept, we experimentally demonstrate broadband (550–1280 nm) super absorption (&gt;50\%) within an ultrathin (∼200 nm) all-dielectric germanium metasurface. This work provides a design paradigm for harvesting light through flat photonic structures at the nanoscale and paves the way for cost-effective light management.},

UVC LEDs with identical heterostructures were grown on templates providing different threading dislocation densities in the range of 0.8 × 10 9 cm −2 to 5.8 × 10 9 cm −2 . A long-term stress experiment was performed on batches of LEDs, which were operated at a direct current of 200 mA corresponding to a current density of 60 A/cm 2 and at a heat sink temperature of 20 °C. The UVC LEDs on templates with lower threading dislocation densities were found to provide a higher optical power and to degrade slower during 2000 h of operation. The experiment demonstrates an extrapolated L70 lifetime of more than 10 000 h for the high temperature annealed sputtered ELO technology. The results suggest that degradation is caused by operation-induced activation of defects whose density scales with the dislocation density.},

The device operates at ∼255 nm with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 7.2\% and wall-plug of 4\%, which are nearly one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of previously reported tunnel junction devices operating at this wavelength. The devices exhibit highly stable emission, with a nearly constant emission peak with increasing current, due to the strong charge carrier confinement related to the presence of Ga-rich nanoclusters. Efficiency droop, however, is observed at relatively low current densities. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements suggest that the presence of efficiency droop of deep UV LEDs is largely due to electron overflow.},

As a first step toward multiple-qubit operations, we demonstrate coherent manipulations of three singlet-triplet qubits showing underdamped Larmor and Ramsey oscillations in all double dot sites. An accurate measurement of site-dependent field gradients as well as root-mean-squared electric and magnetic noise is provided, which is followed by a discussion of the adequacy of a simple rectangular micromagnet for practical use in multiple quantum dot arrays.

The measurement of thermal expansion provides thermodynamic data about the nature of phase transitions, and uniaxial stress provides a powerful tuning method that does not introduce disorder. Mn 3 Sn exhibits an anomaly in its thermal expansion near ∼270 K, associated with a first-order change in its magnetic structure. We show that this transition temperature is suppressed by 54.6 K by 1.51 GPa compression along [0001]. We find the associated entropy change at the transition to be ∼ 0.1 J mol −1 K −1 and to vary only weakly with applied stress.},

While great progress has been made in this field in recent years, almost all input signals provided to neuromorphic processors are still designed for traditional (von Neumann) computer architectures. Here, we show that a simple photosensitive capacitor will inherently reproduce certain aspects of biological retinas. We found that capacitors based on metal halide perovskites will output a brief voltage spike in response to changes in incident light intensity, but output zero voltage under constant illumination. Such a sensor is not only optimized for use with spiking neuromorphic processors but also anticipated to have broad appeal from fields such as light detection and ranging, autonomous vehicles, facile recognition, navigation, and robotics.},

  abstract     = {Atomic switches based on a metal/oxide/metal structure have attracted considerable attention for application in nonvolatile switching memory devices. In atomic switches, the formation and rupture of atomic-scale conductive metal filaments can be controlled via an applied voltage, which is central to the optimization of the resistive switching of such switches. Because the high-resistance (OFF) state is determined by the previous rupture (RESET) process and affects the subsequent formation process, it is important to know the filament structure and the electronic states in the OFF state. However, direct observation of the structure and electronic states is exceedingly difficult in the case of filaments embedded in the oxide matrix. In this paper, we propose a nondestructive methodology to evaluate the filament structure and electronic states in the OFF state based on current–voltage measurements. Using this method, the OFF states of a Ag/Ta 2 O 5 /Pt atomic switch were characterized, and changes in the size and potential barrier of a ruptured filament were estimated according to the introduction and evacuation of water molecules. The results clarify the effects of moisture, which are important for the operation of oxide-based resistive memories under ambient conditions.},

In this Letter, by using WSe 2 /BN as a model, the annealing effect on the elimination of extrinsic interfacial effects in 2D vdW heterostructures was studied. The formation of the WSe 2 /BN interface can generate interfacial defects and significantly regulate the type and peak intensity percentage of WSe 2 photoluminescence (PL) peak. It is intriguing to find that the thermal annealing effect on the optical property is opposite to that from extrinsic defects. By optimizing the annealing temperature, the PL of the functional-layer WSe 2 in the heterostructure is gradually restored. This finding demonstrates that the thermal annealing can efficiently minimize the extrinsic interfacial effects, which may provide a simple and low-cost route to fabricate high-quality 2D vdW devices.},

Motivated by these exciting experimental results on 2D layered BBL structures, herein we perform density functional theory-based first-principles calculations in order to gain insight into the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the BBL monolayer and bilayer honeycomb crystal structures (planar and vertical). Our computational structural optimization reveals that the BBL monolayer crystallizes in a puckered, anisotropic hexagonal structure, while the BBL bilayer is composed of covalently bonded shifted one with respect to the other BBL layers. Two terminations with hydrogen and fluorine atoms are considered for the BBL bilayer, namely, H-BBL and F-BBL, respectively. The direct bandgaps of H-BBL s and F-BBL s are ∼ 1 eV and ∼ 1.2 eV. The top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band are flat due to the localized carbon states. The BBL monolayer and bilayer can absorb a wide range of visible light. The calculated refractive index of the BBL monolayer is ∼ 1, i.e., it is smaller than the refractive index of the common natural or synthetic polymers.},

For coexisting normal ferroelectric and relaxor behavior in P(VDF-TrFE) (molar ratio: 45:55) films, the relative contribution from the relaxor component is increased when annealed at high temperature and subsequently quenched. A relative peak permittivity of ε′ ∼ 100 is obtained for an annealing temperature of T = 90 °C, which is one of the highest reported so far among poly(vinylidene fluoride) copolymer and terpolymer films. Based on x-ray diffraction analysis, we attribute the changes in dielectric properties to a decrease in crystallite domain size and a consequent increase in the crystalline-amorphous interfacial area.},

The HZO/ZO capacitors exhibited a higher remanent polarization (2 P r = P r + − P r − ) and breakdown voltage ( V bd ) than capacitors with a Hf x Zr 1−x O 2 (HZO) single layer. In particular, a HZO (15 nm)/ZO(10 nm) (HZ15Z10) capacitor exhibited excellent V bd and 2 P r values of 6.7 V and 14 μ C/cm 2 , respectively, which are much higher than those (4.3 V and 10 μ C/cm 2 , respectively) for a HZO (15 nm) (HZ15) capacitor. The HZ15Z10 capacitor also exhibited higher endurance, a smaller wake-up effect (∼5\%), and superior fatigue properties up to 10 8 switching cycles, compared to a HZ15 capacitor, which exhibited a large wake-up effect (∼15\%) and large 2 P r degradation at 10 8 cycles. The wake-up behavior is attributed to domain depinning mainly related to the redistribution of oxygen vacancies and transformation from the nonferroelectric phase to the ferroelectric orthorhombic (O) phase during field cycling. The HZO/ZO bilayer grew a larger grain size with the ZO nucleation layer, which is twice as large as that of the HZO single layer, and the former structure exhibited more stable bulk-like ferroelectricity. Although the ferroelectric O phase in HZO decreased with increasing HZO thickness, the HZO/ZO structure had a larger fraction of the O phase than the HZO structure. Considering the manufacturing process of ferroelectric devices, these thick HZO/ZO bilayers are promising ferroelectric materials.},

A relative resistance change of ∼470\% is obtained at room temperature, while an appreciable magnetization change of ∼15\% was achieved at 50 K by switching the polarization states of PIN-PMN-PT.

  abstract     = {Spin–orbit torque (SOT) offers a promising pathway to electrically manipulate magnetization in perpendicular multilayers, but the ultrahigh current density required for SOT switching limits its applications. Here, we report that field-free SOT switching is achieved in perpendicular Ta/CoFeB/MgO multilayers by inserting ultrathin Mg or Hf layers. A critical current density of 1.18 × 10 7 A/cm 2 is obtained in Ta/CoFeB/Mg(0.1 nm)/MgO multilayers for field-free SOT switching, which is 42\% lower than that in the Ta/CoFeB/MgO sample. The results demonstrate that the enhanced SOT switching efficiency is determined by a modified Rashba interface induced by interfacial orbital hybridization due to the presence of an ultrathin inserted layer. Furthermore, SOT exhibits a significant dependence on the interfacial structure, especially the interfacial oxygen content.

  abstract     = {The resistivity, anisotropic magnetic properties, and magnetic critical behavior of single-crystalline Eu 3 Sb 4 Se 9 with a pseudo-one-dimensional structure have been studied. The resistivity shows a semiconducting temperature dependence, which gives a bandgap of 0.65 eV. The samples are paramagnetic and isotropic at high temperatures and undergo a transition at T c = 5.1 K into a ferrimagnetic phase. The long crystal dimension, the crystalline b axis, is the easy axis. Below T c , the samples have a further metamagnetic transition from the ferrimagnetic to ferromagnetic state when the field is along the easy axis. The low-field magnetization around T c cannot be described by the mean-field theory for a second-order phase transition, but can be well fitted by the modified Arrott plot, which gives a set of critical exponents β = 0.82, γ = 1.08, and δ = 2.35. The magnetic phase diagram for the field applied parallel to the easy axis is finally established.},

  abstract     = {By utilizing magneto-optical microscopy combined with the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) techniques, the photo-induced melting and quenching effects on magnetic domains in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) ferromagnetic Cr 5 Te 8 crystal were investigated. With irradiation of a pulsed laser, the magnetic domain of the Cr 5 Te 8 crystal can be melted at a critical laser power density (2.55 × 10 8 mW/cm 2 ), which has been confirmed by both MOKE images and curves. Moreover, it is intriguing to find that after laser melting and quenching, the dendritic type domains of the Cr 5 Te 8 crystal are broken and the regrown spherical type domains are isolated from the original dendrites. Simultaneously, the magnetization behavior as a function of external field was modulated. These findings suggest that laser melting and quenching is an effective technique to tailor the magnetic domains in quasi-2D magnets and it provides a viable route in the creation of optical spintronic devices.},

We performed magnetic measurements for a thin single crystal of CrNb 3 S 6 with a thickness 3 μ m, permitting the existence of approximately 60 solitons, and observed the magnetization ( M )—magnetic field ( H ) curve with a remarkable full M – H loop. By investigating the minor loop of the M – H curve in detail, we found that the inside of the full M – H loop allows an infinite number of quasi-stable states for each eigen number of solitons, utilizing a non-negligible distribution of the thickness around 3 μ m. This study reveals that in a microcrystal with a chiral axis length of a few micrometers, any magnetic state with an arbitrary soliton number can be created in a certain H range within the full M – H loop.},

The spin wave nonreciprocity in amplitude, resonance frequency, and group velocity of the transmission spectra were observed. The origin of the spin-wave nonreciprocity is attributed to the out-of-plane surface anisotropy, with a value of 1.3 mJ/m 2 at the interface with the substrate, as extracted from the theoretical model. The magnetic field dependence of the frequency shift is attributed to the perpendicular surface anisotropy.

The process is based on a recently developed method that allows the fabrication of freestanding monocrystalline YIG bridges on gadolinium-gallium-garnet. Here, the bridges&#39; spans are detached from the substrate by a dry etching process and immersed in a watery solution. Using drop-casting, the immersed YIG platelets can be transferred onto the substrate of choice, where the structures finally can be reattached and, thus, be integrated into complex devices or experimental geometries. Using time-resolved scanning Kerr microscopy and inductively measured ferromagnetic resonance, we can demonstrate that the structures retain their excellent magnetic quality. At room temperature, we find a ferromagnetic resonance linewidth of μ 0 Δ H HWHM ≈ 195 μ T and we were even able to inductively measure magnon spectra on a single micrometer-sized yttrium-iron-garnet platelet at a temperature of 5 K. The process is flexible in terms of substrate material and shape of the structure. In the future, this approach will allow for types of spin dynamics experiments until now unthinkable.},

Concentration-depth profiles of 2 H-implanted single crystals show that 2 H can diffuse along the direction perpendicular to the (010) surface at temperatures as low as 300 °C, whereas diffusion along the direction perpendicular to the (-201) surface occurs only around 500 °C. For both directions, the evolution of the 2 H concentration–depth profiles after heat treatments can be modeled by trap-limited diffusion. Moreover, the traps can be present in the as-received crystals or created during ion implantation. Comparison of the experimentally obtained binding energy for 2 H to the trap (2.3 ± 0.2 eV) with the binding energies determined from first-principles calculations suggests that intrinsic point defects (e.g., V Ga ib ⁠ ) or defect complexes (e.g., V Ga ( 2 ) V O ( 2 ) ⁠ ) are excellent candidates for the trap and will play a crucial role in the diffusion of H or 2 H in β -Ga 2 O 3 .},

The key motivation is the higher Baliga figure of merit for devices with the UWBG AlGaN channel and their strong potential for use in high-power, high-temperature harsh environmental applications. Over a temperature range of 125 °C, the V TH shifted in the opposite direction for D- and E-mode devices with a rate of +13.5 mV/K and −23 mV/K, respectively, giving an overall shift of +1.7 V and −2.9 V. This was attributed to changes in the fixed and trapped charge densities in the dielectric and at the dielectric–AlGaN barrier interface. A single deep sub-bandgap trap level was sufficient to explain the threshold shifts in both devices. The effective channel mobility in the E-mode devices was argued to be limited by charge scattering, arising from the same charges introduced during barrier recessing that shifted V TH .},

According to the tunneling transmission spectra simulation result, the hump property would be due to two possible scenarios: a resonant tunneling of heavy holes in the QH and/or a resonance phenomenon that heavy holes pass just above a potential barrier.},

In this work, we propose two materials to be added to the family of UWBG semiconductors: Ba 2 CaTeO 6 exhibiting a double perovskite structure and Ba 2 K 2 Te 2 O 9 with a triple perovskite structure. Using first-principles hybrid functional calculations, we predict the bandgaps of all the studied systems to be above 4.5 eV, with strong optical absorption in the ultraviolet region. Furthermore, we show that holes have a tendency to get trapped through lattice distortions in the vicinity of oxygen atoms, with an average trapping energy of 0.25 eV, potentially preventing the enhancement of p -type conductivity through traditional chemical doping.},

The defect-related transitions have been distinguished and examined in the emission and excitation spectra investigated under synchrotron radiation. The broad PL bands of two defect levels in the AlN were detected at around 3 eV and 4 eV. In the PLE spectra of these bands, a sharp excitonic peak originating most probably from the A-exciton of AlN was clearly visible. Taking into account the exciton binding energy, the measurements allow determination of the bandgaps of the investigated AlN samples and their temperature dependencies. Next, they are compared with the literature data obtained by other experimental techniques for bulk AlN crystals and layers grown on different substrates. The obtained results revealed that the AlN bandgap depends on the substrate. The theoretical analysis using density functional theory calculations showed that the effect is induced by the tetragonal strain related to the lattice mismatch between the substrate and the AlN layer, which has a strong influence on the spectral positions of the intrinsic excitons, and consequently on the bandgap of AlN layers.},

On the other hand, with increasing V G , electrochemical decomposition of the channels due to the V G -induced instability of the unusually high Ni valence state [Ni (3+δ)+ ] occurs and the channels are etched, which is seen as an irreversible increase in the channel resistance. We also show that channel layers electrochemically etched to a few nanometers thick exhibit metallic transport behavior and the electrostatic carrier accumulation in the etched metallic channels results in 30\% reductions in the channel resistance at 220 K, which are about twice as large as those seen for the ultra-thin insulating film channels. These observations indicate that surface defects and dangling bonds in the electrochemically etched channel layers differ from those in ultrathin films. Our results highlight that the electrochemical decomposition and etching in electric double-layer transistors is a unique approach for fabricating ultrathin oxide films and exploring electric field-induced effects on their functional properties.},

  abstract     = {Integrating the functions of superconductors and semiconductors by epitaxial growth can lead to the fabrication of quantum devices such as on-chip quantum communication systems with single-photon emitters and detectors. Furthermore, a combination of nitride superconductors and nitride semiconductors is one of the most suitable candidates for application in these quantum devices. However, the structure of superconducting NbN films grown on nitride semiconductors needs to be elucidated. In this study, we report the self-organization of NbN nanostructures that were epitaxially grown on an atomically flat AlN surface. Structural investigation of the NbN/AlN heterostructure revealed that the growth of NbN twins on the AlN surface leads to the autonomous formation of nanostructures. These results significantly contribute to the materials science of cubic transition metal nitride heteroepitaxy.},

The cavities are electron beam pumped, and the quality ( Q ) factor is deduced from the cavity-filtered yellow luminescence. The Q factor is ∼500 for a 1000 nm wide prism cavity and only ∼60 for a 600 nm wide cavity, showing the strong decrease in Q factor when diffraction losses become dominant. Measured Q factors are in good agreement with those obtained from quasi-3D finite element frequency-domain method and 3D beam propagation method simulations. Simulations further predict that a prism cavity with a 1000 nm width will have a Q factor of around 2000 in the blue spectral regime, which would be the target regime for real devices.

The promising performances of photodetectors based on 2D materials, such as ultrafast photoresponse and ultrahigh photoresponsivity, have been demonstrated in the visible to short-wavelength infrared spectrum range (0.8–2 μ m). However, high performance, room temperature operation long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) photodetection is challenging. The detectors based on graphene usually exhibit low photoresponsivity due to the low optical absorption and short carrier lifetime. In addition, the relatively large bandgap of transition metal dichalcogenides limited the photoresponse bandwidth. Here, we report a way to fabricate a scalable device array of room-temperature operation LWIR PtSe 2 -G heterostructure detectors. The photoresponsivity at 10.6 μ m up to ∼300 mA/W is obtained. The long-wave infrared light in the pico-watt range could be detected at room temperature by the PtSe 2 -G heterostructure detector. This result indicates that the PtSe 2 -G heterostructure device could be a highly competitive candidate for an uncooled LWIR detector. It also opens a way for a scalable array infrared focus plane device for the LWIR image.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, infrared detectors with InAs/InAsSb (Gallium-free) type-II strained layer superlattice absorbers became a technology of interest for many imaging applications. In this work, we study the dependence of minority carrier (hole) transport, absorption coefficient, and quantum efficiency (QE) of a 5.6 μ m cutoff wavelength mid-wavelength infrared InAs/InAsSb detector on temperatures and applied bias. We found that the minority carrier lifetime is very long ( τ ≈ 5.5 μ s) and is temperature independent in the temperature range T = 50–150 K. The back-side illuminated QE without anti-reflection coating increases from ∼30\% at T = 50 K to ∼60\% at T = 180 K. The minority carrier (hole) diffusion length, L dh , was found from QE and absorption coefficient. The hole diffusion length at T = 50 K is L dh = 2.4 μ m and increases monotonically to L dh = 7.2 μ m at T = 180 K. The hole mobility, calculated from diffusion length and minority carrier lifetime, is μ h = 4.5 cm 2 /V s at T = 50 K and increases with temperature to reach μ h = 7.2 cm 2 /V s at T = 150 K. In addition, we find that at lower temperatures where the diffusion length is shorter, the stronger QE dependence on applied bias is due to minority carrier collection from the depletion region, whose width increases with applied bias.},

By contrasting the light absorbed solely by the metallic antenna with respect to a surrounding reference medium, we found that some antennas show absorption of almost 50\% of the incident light across the range of the visible spectrum.

  abstract     = {Most quantum communication schemes aim at the long-distance transmission of quantum information. In the quantum repeater concept, the transmission line is subdivided into shorter links interconnected by entanglement distribution via Bell-state measurements to overcome inherent channel losses. This concept requires on-demand single-photon sources with a high degree of multi-photon suppression and high indistinguishability within each repeater node. For a successful operation of the repeater, a spectral matching of remote quantum light sources is essential. We present a spectrally tunable single-photon source emitting in the telecom O-band with the potential to function as a building block of a quantum communication network based on optical fibers. A thin membrane of GaAs embedding InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) is attached onto a piezoelectric actuator via gold thermocompression bonding. Here, the thin gold layer acts simultaneously as an electrical contact, strain transmission medium, and broadband backside mirror for the QD-micromesa. The nanofabrication of the QD-micromesa is based on in situ electron-beam lithography, which makes it possible to integrate pre-selected single QDs deterministically into the center of monolithic micromesa structures. The QD pre-selection is based on distinct single-QD properties, signal intensity, and emission energy. In combination with strain-induced fine tuning, this offers a robust method to achieve spectral resonance in the emission of remote QDs. We show that the spectral tuning has no detectable influence on the multi-photon suppression with g (2) (0) as low as 2\%–4\% and that the emission can be stabilized to an accuracy of 4 μ eV using a closed-loop optical feedback.},

  abstract     = {Rotational motions are generally enabled by the flow energy for generating electricity or by the electric energy to drive various mechanical motions. Here, we report a fundamentally different approach (which we name “semi-flexible rotor”) that uses omnipresent ultralow-frequency (&lt;5 Hz) vibrations as the energy source to achieve high-speed rotational motions. The semi-flexible rotor comprises mainly a turntable, an elastic support, a lid, and a piece of rope, in which the periodically tensioned and released rope under external excitations provides the torque for spinning the turntable. The feasibility of the proposed approach is confirmed by both experimental measurements and theoretical simulations. As excited by a quasi-harmonic vibration with an amplitude of 10 mm, the rotor achieves a high rotational speed of up to 250 rad/s (2400 rpm) at around 2 Hz, and can provide an average rotational speed higher than 50 rad/s within a frequency range from 0.5 Hz to 5 Hz. The semi-flexible rotor is thus an option for realizing some rotation-based devices (e.g., miniature centrifuges) that work in scenarios without electricity supply or for designing efficient energy harvesters that exploit ubiquitous ultralow-frequency vibrations to generate electricity.},

  abstract     = {Modification of the hetero-junction interface in Cd-free and all-dry process Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) 2 (CIGSSe) solar cells by introducing the aging process for the bare CIGSSe films is demonstrated, ultimately achieving the highest conversion efficiency of 22.0\%. In this article, two positive effects of the aging process are discussed. First, additional phases, such as In x (O,S) y and Cu-deficient phases, are naturally formed on the CIGSSe surface. Second, unintentional segregation of Zn-rich particles at the (Zn,Mg)O/CIGSSe interface during the (Zn,Mg)O deposition is suppressed. These effects lead to the reduction of recombination at the hetero-junction interface and dramatic enhancement of performance for the Cd-free and all-dry process CIGSSe solar cells.},

This was achieved by growing monolayer MoS 2 on optical fibers that were then subjected to torsion, such that pure shear was transferred to MoS 2 . The effect of shear was inferred from the observed photoluminescence spectrum, after which a blue shift of ∼ 10 meV /\% emerged. Detailed analysis revealed that this shift is mainly due to the trion luminescence and less due to the excitons. This observation experimentally uncovers the behavior of MoS 2 under a yet uncharted pure shear deformation, which may enable the development of devices, such as tunable electronic components and high-precision sensors.},

  abstract     = {Multi-terminal memtransistors using polycrystalline monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) have recently emerged as novel synaptic devices. Due to the coexistence of disorder and strong Coulomb carrier-carrier interactions in MoS 2 , localization and delocalization of carriers can come into play successively upon the relative strength of disorder and interactions, which can be tuned by the Fermi level ( ⁠ E F ⁠ ). In this work, we show that the transition from trap-mediated to band-like transport leads to the resistive switching behavior in MoS 2 memtransistors, which is driven by the E F shift arising from defect profile redistribution that is facilitated by grain boundaries. In the high resistance state, field-driven hopping conduction can be clearly observed in the high-field region ( ⁠ E &gt; 0.05 MV/cm), whereas the linear dependence of l n ( I / E ) on the square root of the electric field, E 1 / 2 ⁠ , suggests Poole–Frenkel emission in the low-field region ( ⁠ E ≤ 0.05 MV/cm). In the low resistance state, strong interactions prevailed and a substantial amount of thermally activated electrons are excited into the conduction band, leading to band-like transport.},

The conversion of a THz-frequency input signal into DC voltage is done using the inverse spin Hall effect in an (AFM/HM) bilayer. An additional bias DC in the HM layer can be used to vary the effective anisotropy of the AFM and, therefore, to tune the antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) frequency. The proposed AFM/HM heterostructure works as a resonance-type quadratic detector, which can be tuned by the bias current in the range of at least 10\% of the AFMR frequency, and our estimations show that the sensitivity of this detector could be comparable to that of modern detectors based on the Schottky, Gunn, or graphene-based diodes.},

Our experimental results show qualitative agreement with numerical simulations based on the superdiffusive spin transport model.

Based on the principle of identical magnonic path length, we derive the lens contour that can be either elliptical or hyperbolical depending on the magnon refractive index. Micromagnetic simulations are performed to verify the theoretical design. It is found that under proper conditions, magnetic skyrmions emerge near the focus point of the lens where the spin-wave intensity has been significantly enhanced. A close investigation shows that a magnetic droplet first forms and then converts to the skyrmion accompanied by a change in topological charge. The phase diagram about the amplitude and time duration of the exciting field for skyrmion generation is obtained.

A planar Hall effect (PHE), an electric field perpendicular to the applied current but parallel to the applied magnetic field, was recently observed inside the hysteresis loop of Mn 3 Sn. The sign of the PHE displayed a memory tuned by the prior orientation of the magnetic field and its history. We present a study of the PHE in Mn 3 Ge extended from room temperature down to 2 K and show that this memory effect can be manipulated by either a magnetic field or thermal cycling. We show that the memory can be wiped out if the prior magnetic field exceeds 0.8 T or when the temperature exceeds T N ⁠ . We also find a detectable difference between the amplitude of the PHE with zero-field and field thermal cycling. The ratio between the PHE and the anomalous Hall effect decreases slightly as temperature is increased from 2 K to T N and tracks the temperature dependence of magnetization. This erasable memory effect may be used for data storage.},

  abstract     = {In an easy-plane antiferromagnet with the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI), magnons are subject to an effective spin-momentum locking. An in-plane temperature gradient can generate interfacial accumulation of magnons with a specified polarization, realizing the magnon thermal Edelstein effect. We theoretically investigate the injection and detection of this thermally driven spin polarization in an adjacent heavy metal with a strong spin Hall effect. We find that the inverse spin Hall voltage depends monotonically on both temperature and the DMI but non-monotonically on the hard-axis anisotropy. Counterintuitively, the magnon thermal Edelstein effect is an even function of a magnetic field applied along the Néel vector.},

Ni 80 Co 20 was deposited onto a specified PMN-PT substrate with defect dipoles. By exploiting defect dipoles, a distinct and stable strain memory state was achieved at zero electric field. It induces and sustains two distinct magnetization states when removing an electric field via the magnetoelectric coupling effect. Via the detailed x-ray diffraction and piezoresponse force microscopy analyses, the polarization switching pathway and the lattice strain in response to the in situ electric field were investigated to understand the microscopic mechanisms behind the nonvolatile magnetic memory. Furthermore, the impulse electric field can be selected in the range between the coercive field and the saturation field of the PMN-PT, leading to a wide range controlling technique. This work provides a promising way to produce a large and nonvolatile magnetic memory in magnetoelectric heterostructure and is significant for ultra-low-power information storage devices.},

The electrical insulating property of the Mg acceptors in β-Ga 2 O 3 was found to be intrinsically activated in the as-grown Mg-doped β-Ga 2 O 3 thin films. Growth conditions for MOCVD β-Ga 2 O 3 were further explored and optimized at a lower growth temperature regime, leading to a better confinement of the Mg-doping profile. Detailed analysis of Mg diffusion characteristics revealed a diffusion barrier energy E barrier ∼ 0.9 eV for Mg in MOCVD β-Ga 2 O 3 , which is likely related to an interstitial-assisted process. Surface morphologies and electron transport were characterized on samples grown with different growth temperatures and Mg doping levels. The MOCVD growth method demonstrated its feasibility to grow semi-insulating Mg-doped β-Ga 2 O 3 epilayers with controllable Mg incorporation while maintaining good material quality and smooth surface morphology. From capacitance-voltage charge profiling, it is verified that the Mg-doped buffer layer grown at the substrate-epilayer interface could effectively compensate the charge accumulation at the interface. The in situ acceptor doping of Mg in MOCVD β-Ga 2 O 3 will provide versatility for designing β-Ga 2 O 3 power devices.},

We demonstrate that the fine tuning of the MEXCAT growth parameters and the choice of a proper substrate offcut allow for the deposition of thin films with high structural quality via the step-flow growth mechanism at relatively high growth rates for β-Ga 2 O 3 homoepitaxy (i.e., around 1.5 nm/min, ≈ 45\% incorporation of the incoming Ga flux), making MBE growth in this orientation feasible. Moreover, through the employment of the four investigated different (100) substrate offcuts along the [ 00 1 ¯ ] direction (i.e., 0°, 2°, 4°, and 6°), we give experimental evidence on the fundamental role of the ( 2 ¯ 01 ) step edges as nucleation sites in the growth of (100)-oriented Ga 2 O 3 films by MBE.},

In this study, we evaluate such a transition electric field ( E T ) in β-Ga 2 O 3 using a numerical reverse leakage model. E T is found to depend on temperature but has an extremely weak dependence on the doping concentration and the barrier height; as a result, a simple empirical expression can be derived to capture this near-universal dependence of E T on temperature. With the help of a field-plate design, we observed experimentally in lightly doped Ga 2 O 3 Schottky barrier diodes near-ideal bulk reverse leakage characteristics, which match well with our numerical model and that confirm the presence of the transition region. Near the transition electric field, both thermionic emission and barrier tunneling should be considered. This study provides important guidance toward accurate design and modeling of Schottky barrier diodes, which can be readily extended to other semiconductors.},

These TDs then traveled nearly in the same direction tilted by 10° to [-110] from the [001] direction without divergence, while extending with slight divergence within ∼7° in the [110]-[-1-10] direction. The diffraction contrasts observed under several two-beam conditions demonstrated that the SF in the substrate was intrinsic type and had a (111) slip plane with a displacement vector R =- a /3[111], where a is the lattice constant of diamond.

Sn doping in MOCATAXY grown β-Ga 2 O 3 allowed for sharp doping profiles and a wide range of donor concentrations from 3.9 × 10 16 cm −3 to 2 × 10 19 cm −3 and a maximum room temperature Hall mobility of 136 cm 2 /V s at 3.9 × 10 16 cm −3 .

In the growth-temperature range of 700–1000 °C, the growth rate of Ga 2 O 3 was in agreement with that estimated by thermodynamic analysis under the assumption of growth under thermal equilibrium. However, when the growth temperature was lower than 700 °C, the growth rate, which decreased as the growth temperature decreased, deviated from that estimated by thermodynamic analysis, reflecting growth behavior under nonthermal equilibrium. X-ray diffraction and optical absorption measurements of the grown layers revealed that the Ga 2 O 3 growth under nonthermal equilibrium was constrained by the crystal structure of the substrate, i.e., the metastable phase α-Ga 2 O 3 (0001) grew on the sapphire (0001) substrate, whereas the stable phase β-Ga 2 O 3 grew homoepitaxially on a β-Ga 2 O 3 (001) substrate. However, under thermal equilibrium, the growth of the stable phase β-Ga 2 O 3 occurred irrespective of the substrate and the constraint from the crystal structure of the substrate was no longer observed. We also observed that in the β-Ga 2 O 3 homoepitaxial layer grown under nonthermal equilibrium, crystal twinning occurred in the homoepitaxial layer, presumably due to an insufficient growth temperature.},

This work reports an alcohol sensor using the two-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite bis(phenethylammonium) tetrachlorocuprate—(PEA) 2 CuCl 4, also known as phenethylammonium copper chloride—as the sensing material. The device is based on a change in conductance upon exposure to alcohol vapors. A comparison between pristine (PEA) 2 CuCl 4 and (PEA) 2 CuCl 4 after a treatment with ultraviolet light shows that the latter has a higher conductance. Devices made with this UV-converted material show a strong response to 1-propanol vapors, starting from a concentration around 2000 parts per million (ppm). Additionally, these devices demonstrate stable behavior in a nitrogen atmosphere. During the stabilization of the 1-propanol flow rate, the concentration fluctuates. These fluctuations were detected by monitoring the current of the device over time, down to steps in 100 ppm around a concentration of 8000 ppm. The conductance of the devices decreases in contact with air. However, this process can be reversed by additional ultraviolet illumination, thereby making the devices reusable.},

  abstract     = {Photophoretic forces confine particles by a combination of levitation and active trapping. To generate the latter, the component of photophoretic force transverse to gravity generates a torque, which leads to complex rotation of the particle, thereby generating a restoring force. This force has not been understood quantitatively. In this paper, we study this component of photophoretic force by trapping a single absorbing particle using a loosely focused Gaussian laser beam and modulating the trap-center spatially using a superposition of multiple sinusoidal frequencies applied to the trapping beam. We vary the modulation amplitude in proportion to the excitation frequency so as to compensate for the reduced particle response at higher frequencies and thus obtain an almost constant response of the particle over the entire excitation range. We use the amplitude and phase response to determine the resonance frequency and the trap stiffness—which we study as a function of laser power and the intensity experienced by trapped particles of different sizes. We observe that, while the trapping stiffness is proportional to laser power, the optical intensity experienced by a particle at different powers is the same. This is reasonable in order to facilitate optical levitation but implies that the trap stiffness actually depends on an “effective intensity,” which may be a combination of the particle accommodation coefficient and the laser power.},

  abstract     = {Relaxation of tensile strain in AlGaN heterostructures grown on a GaN template can lead to the formation of cracks. These extended defects locally degrade the crystal quality, resulting in a local increase in non-radiative recombinations. The effect of such cracks on the optical and structural properties of core–shell AlGaN/AlGaN multiple quantum wells grown on GaN microwires is comprehensively characterized by means of spectrally and time-correlated cathodoluminescence (CL). We observe that the CL blueshifts near a crack. By performing 6 × 6 k.p simulations in combination with transmission electron microscopy analysis, we ascribe this shift to the strain relaxation by the free surface near cracks. By simultaneously recording the variations of both the CL lifetime and the CL intensity across the crack, we directly assess the carrier dynamics around the defect at T = 5 K. We observe that the CL lifetime is reduced typically from 500 ps to less than 300 ps and the CL intensity increases by about 40\% near the crack. The effect of the crack on the optical properties is, therefore, of two natures. First, the presence of this defect locally increases non-radiative recombinations, while at the same time, it locally improves the extraction efficiency. These findings emphasize the need for time-resolved experiments to avoid experimental artifacts related to local changes of light collection.},

We fabricated Al-doped HfO 2 antiferroelectric thin films via atomic layer deposition at variable thicknesses (20 nm or 50 nm) with varying dopant concentrations (4 at.\% or 8 at.\%). 50 nm thick 8 at.\% Al-doped HfO 2 showed a maximum energy storage density of 63 J/cm 3 while maintaining an efficiency of 85\%. A study comparing these thin films revealed thicker films allowed for higher operating electric fields and thus higher energy storage densities at operating voltage. The loss tangents of the thin films at operating voltage were under 2\% over the range of −4 to 4 MV/cm and at frequencies ranging from 500 Hz to 100 kHz. Reliability studies showed the thin films endure up to 10 6 –10 7 cycles and the breakdown field of the films yielded Weibull moduli greater than 6 for all our thin films. The Weibull modulus provides a measurement of the consistency of the breakdown strength from sample to sample, with higher moduli indicating a more invariable result. These electrical characteristics along with the thin film&#39;s cycling endurance and reliability make antiferroelectric-like Al-doped thin films a promising material for energy storage applications.},

The low pump power and enhanced efficiency of the OFC generation can be attributed to mode coupling between two mode families of the multimode resonator, which acts to change the effective magnitude and the sign of the local dispersion of the resonator. We experimentally observed that the OFC generation had 3.6 times more peaks and 12.1 dB higher conversion efficiency than that without any bias. We compared the efficiencies of the OFC generation at different pump wavelengths within and beyond the mode coupling region. At low pump powers circulating in the resonator, pump wavelengths in the mode coupling regime produced 1.3 times more peaks and 8 dB enhancement in conversion efficiency than pumping beyond the mode coupling regime. The experimental results were consistent with the theoretical simulations by solving the modified Lugiato–Lefever equation.},

Layer resistivities as low as 0.024 Ω cm for x = 0.6 and 0.042 Ω cm for x = 0.8 were achieved. For both aluminum mole fractions, the resistivity exhibits a minimum with the increasing Si concentration, which can be explained by compensation due to the formation of cation vacancy complexes at high doping levels. The onset of self-compensation occurs at larger estimated Si concentrations for larger Al contents.},

The reflectins act as a signal transducer, precisely tuning the dimensions and refractive index of the membrane-bounded structural reflectors containing them to an extent exactly proportional to neuronal signaling. This calibration between the activating signal and the output color and intensity of reflectance is governed by the physics of the liquid state of reflectin assemblies, which osmotically fine-tune the dimensions and refractive index of the membrane-bounded structural reflectors containing them. While thin-film or genetically engineered assemblies of reflectin deliver changes in the colors of reflection approximating those of the biological system (as do other proteins and polymers), none has delivered the signal-activated increase in the intensity of reflectance characteristic of the native system. The membrane envelopes (Bragg reflector lamellae and Mie-scattering vesicles) containing the reflectins apparently serve as amplifiers, functionally “impedance matched” to the range of tunable sizes of the reflectin assemblies; reflectin films or assemblies lacking such an amplifier fail to deliver signal-activated increases in reflectance intensity.},

A magnetic field sensitivity of 45 pT/√Hz is measured at a 35\% modulation duty cycle where Ω L resonance has a maximum amplitude. We have discussed ways to further improve the sensitivity closer to the shot-noise limit by making changes to our existing setup. An additional magnetic resonance at 3Ω L is also formed due to two-photon resonance, which can be utilized in determining the magnetic field orientation.

The Lorenz number linearly decreases from Ag 1.95 Se to Ag 2.03 Se, as the point defect changes from a cation vacancy to a self-interstitial. This striking behavior reveals the inelastic electron scattering process due to nonstoichiometry point defects and suggests that the cation vacancies increase while self-interstitials reduce the amount of heat carried by electrons. Remarkably, the Lorenz number varies by 40\% for such a narrow nonstoichiometry window, with the deviation as large as 36\% from the Sommerfeld value.

Here, we develop a cytoskeleton-based mechanical model to study the migration modes of both isolated cells and cell clusters on gradient substrates. We find that collective cell durotaxis is attributed to the geometrical restriction of cell rotation by neighboring cells, leading to a different migration mode from isolated cells. Moreover, isolated cells are able to undergo directed migration on a soft substrate with relatively high stiffness gradients. In addition, collective cell durotaxis is far more efficient than single-cell durotaxis. The migration mode is determined by the competition between the difference of traction forces between the cell-substrate interface and the random force from microenvironments. This study indicates that isolated cells are more sensitive to environmental fluctuations, whereas cell clusters can counteract the effects of fluctuations by cell–cell interactions.},

Here, the total mode conversion is achieved via a sufficiently large phase gradient, while the full transmission is achieved with the impedance-matched single-layered metasurface. Numerical and experimental investigations show that the proposed metasurface can provide almost total mode conversion for a broad incident angle from −20.4 ° to 22.3 ° ⁠ .

  abstract     = {We use micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy (BLS) to investigate surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in a GaN layer on a Si substrate at GHz frequencies. Furthermore, we discuss the concept of BLS for SAWs and show that the crucial parameters of SAW excitation and propagation can be measured. We investigate a broad range of excitation parameters and observe that Rayleigh and Sezawa waves are excited simultaneously at the same frequency. Spatially resolved measurements of these co-propagating waves show a periodic pattern, which proves their coherent interference. From the periodicity of the spatial phonon patterns, the wavevector difference between the two waves has been identified and compared to the dispersion relation. The appearance of Sezawa waves related to the finite thickness of the piezoelectric substrate leads to acoustic fields with a time-independent spatial variation similar to the situations realized using counter-propagating waves. This periodicity can have an influence on experimental results in angular momentum conversion experiments, for example, via magneto-elastic fields in hybrid-SAW-structures with additional magnetic layers.},

  abstract     = {While a linear growth behavior is one of the fingerprints of textbook atomic layer deposition processes, the growth often deviates from that behavior in the initial regime, i.e., the first few cycles of a process. To properly understand the growth behavior in the initial regime is particularly important for applications that rely on the exact thickness of very thin films. The determination of the thicknesses of the initial regime, however, often requires special equipment and techniques that are not always available. We propose a thickness determination method that is based on X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements on double layer structures, i.e., substrate/base layer/top layer. XRR is a standard thin film characterization method. Utilizing the inherent properties of fast Fourier transformation in combination with a multi-Gaussian fitting routine permits the determination of thicknesses down to t ≈ 2 nm ⁠ . We evaluate the boundaries of our model, which are given by the separation and full width at half maximum of the individual Gaussians. Finally, we compare our results with data from x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, which is a standard method for measuring ultra-thin films.},

Surprisingly, we found that the coercivity of the atomic chains with free boundary conditions is independent of the chain length, whereas the one subject to hybridization of the chain ends exhibits an unexpected length dependence. These findings suggest that ferromagnetism in the free-boundary condition system is caused by an intrinsic indirect exchange. On the other hand, controlled boundary conditions produce a helical spin structure due to an extrinsic indirect exchange, which arises from the interaction between iron atoms at the ends of the chain and the hydrogen in the H 2 phthalocyanine spacer. As a consequence, during magnetic reversal, ultra-short iron chains subject to boundary clamping develop a helical spin structure, leading to increased coercivity. These findings suggest unique insights and ideas for the design of atomic-scale ultra-dense magnetic storage nanodevices.},

Here however, a thin metal oxide layer formed on lithographically defined contacts composed of pure bulk transition metal serves as the precursor. The chalcogen reacts with the metal oxide, leading to the growth of highly crystalline films, which display strong luminescence, monolayer Raman signatures, and relatively large crystal domains. Raman spectroscopy and cross-sectional SEM studies provide insight into the characteristics of the metal oxide and its effect on the TMD growth. The TMD material migrates outward along the substrate while remaining connected to the lithographically defined contacts, offering a scalable path for producing as-grown, naturally contacted, two-dimensional material-based devices.},

Here, we developed a cold field emitter using a cerium hexaboride single crystal (CeB 6 -CFE) as a monochromatic electron source. The work function of the CeB 6 (310) plane was estimated to be as low as 2.25 ± 0.17 eV, and the energy width ranged from 0.17 to 0.26 eV for angular current densities ranging from 0.10 to 80 μ A/sr. This energy width was 20\% to 30\% narrower than that of conventional W(310)-CFEs. Using the CeB 6 -CFE, the spatial resolution of the SEM at an acceleration voltage of 0.5 kV was improved by 11\% compared with that of an SEM using the W(310)-CFE.},

Although the large lateral diameter of quantum rings ( ⁠ ∼ 50 nm) with a few nm size distribution is expected to cause a small spectral inhomogeneity ( ⁠ ∼ 1\% ⁠ ), a broad gain width ( ⁠ ∼ 300 meV) was observed. This result was attributed to a variation of the vertical heights and variations in localized states that exhibit crescent shaped wavefunctions, whereby the energy levels are distributed over a broad spectral range. When the excitation intensity is decreased, irregular peaks appear in the gain spectrum gradually. Similar phenomena were also observed as the temperature increased. We conclude that excited carriers in quantum rings are distributed stochastically at various localized states and that the population inversion is sensitive to both excitation intensity and temperature.},

The capacitors show very weak wake-up and imprint effects, allowing reliable operation in excess of 10 years, which is attributed partly to the clean, oxide-free Ge/HZO bottom interface. The weak temperature dependence and the observed asymmetries between polarization up and down states and between positive and negative coercive voltage shifts lead to the conclusion that imprint is controlled by carrier injection at the top electrode interface. The latter mechanism is associated with trapping at interfacial oxygen-vacancy defects. On the other hand, using ultrafast (millisecond) flash annealing improves the leakage current by at least an order of magnitude and the endurance by a factor of 3 compared to conventional rapid thermal annealing, which makes them suitable for low power nonvolatile memory applications where (ultra)thin HZO is an essential requirement.},

The addition of strontium ferrite led to an increase in the residual magnetic induction of the semiconductor shielding layer. Unmagnetized and magnetized semiconductive compounds were used as electrodes to test the injection of carriers into the LDPE insulation layer. When SrFe 12 O 19 had been added, the charge injected into the LDPE by the magnetized semiconductive layer was less than with an unmagnetized semiconductive layer.

  abstract     = {The utilization of ferroelectric ceramics in electrical energy storage has become a hot topic due to the urgent need for advanced pulsed power and high power energy storage applications. Much attention has been paid to achieving nanograined ferroelectric ceramics but little to the effect of grain size uniformity, which is critical for dielectric breakdown and reliability. We first investigated this effect via a model based on virtually constructed ceramic samples solved with the phase-field method. Ferroelectric ceramic samples with the same average grain size of typically 100 nm but different uniformity degrees by the variation of the standard deviation values of 83.7, 81.9, 80.1, and 78.7 were constructed via Voronoi tessellation based on a controlled seeding method. The effect of grain size uniformity on the dielectric breakdown was studied through a phase-field dielectric breakdown model. The results indicate that with the standard deviation decreasing, the dielectric breakdown strength is distinctly enhanced. Experimentally, BaTiO 3 -based ceramics with the same average grain size of 100 nm but different uniformity degrees were realized via conventional sintering and two-step sintering methods. The grain size uniformity of two-step sintered ceramics is greatly improved, which leads to the breakdown strength and discharge energy density of the two-step sintered ceramics about 50\% and 100\% larger than those of the conventionally sintered ones. This work demonstrates that significant enhancement in dielectric breakdown strength of ferroelectric energy-storage ceramics can be achieved via grain size uniformity control, shedding light on the meticulous design and fine tuning of the energy-storage properties of ferroelectric ceramics.},

With a motivation to improve electromechanical properties, a lead-free Ba 0.95 Ca 0.05 Sn 0.09 Ti 0.91 O 3 (BCST) ceramic close to the polymorphic phase boundary composition is synthesized by solid-state reaction. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy confirm the coexistence of orthorhombic (Amm2) and tetragonal (P4 mm) phases at room temperature. Our low-temperature dielectric study reveals the appearance of a reentrant relaxor state from the ferroelectric state near ∼150 K and is attributed to the coexistence of short and long ferroelectric ordered regions and slowing down of domain dynamics in the smaller regions, similar to the reentrant spin glass state observed in the system Fe- x Au. This feature is confirmed through glass model fitting parameters [ ω o = 2.66(±0.28) × 10 8 Hz, T g = 110(±1) K, zv = 4.5(±0.3)], and Mydosh parameter (“ K ” ∼ 0.05).

When the Josephson effect is suppressed, this structure can support a nonlinear thermoelectric effect due to the spontaneous breaking of electron–hole symmetry, as we recently theoretically predicted. We discuss the possibly relevant role played by the noise in the junction. While a moderate noise contribution assists the generation of the thermoelectric signal, further unveiling the spontaneous nature of the electron–hole symmetry breaking, a large noise contribution can induce a switching between the two stationary thermoelectric values, thus hardening the detection of the effect and its application. We demonstrate that the thermoelectric effect is robust to the presence of noise for a wide range of parameters and that the spurious fluctuations of the thermoelectric signal can be lowered by increasing the capacitance of the junction, for instance, by expanding the junction&#39;s size. Our results pave the way to the future experimental observation of the thermoelectric effect in superconducting junctions and to improved performance in quantum circuits designed for thermal management.},

The unique anisotropy feature causes a strong sensitivity to the assistant field during SOT switching, resulting in a slanted magnetic moment and a highly tunable switching window defined by the difference in Hall resistance between two SOT switching states at zero current. By further reducing the PMA of bottom CoFeB, only the upper layer can be switched by SOT. Until now, there are three types of SOT switching in antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic metal/nonmagnetic metal/ferromagnetic metal trilayers: simultaneous switching between two antiparallel states with strong PMA for both ferromagnetic layers, field-free switching where one layer has in-plane magnetization and the other has canted out-of-plane magnetization, and tunable switching reported in this work. Our findings enrich the physical phenomena in trilayer SOT and may have potential application in multilevel storage and neural computing.},

Here, we investigate the SEB in La 1.5 (Sr 0.5− x Ba x )CoMnO 6 double-perovskites, a system with multifarious magnetic phases for which a notable increase in the exchange bias field is observed for intermediate Sr/Ba concentrations. The Ba to Sr substitution leads to the enhancement of the crystal lattice, which is accompanied by the increase in both the effective magnetic moment ( μ eff ) and the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature that is observed below the ferromagnetic ordering. Such an increase is likely related to the increased fraction of Co 3+ in the high spin configuration, leading to the enhancement of the Co 3+ –O–Mn 4+ AFM phase and the reduction in the uncompensation of the AFM coupling between Co and Mn. The combined effect of the increased μ eff and AFM phase plausibly explains the changes in the SEB effect.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnet (AFM)/ferromagnet (FM) systems such as IrMn/CoFeB/MgO enable spin–orbit-torque- (SOT-) induced switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field. However, the low thermal stability, weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), and indistinctive SOT of these AFM/FM heterostructures pose challenges to the practical application. Here, through the insertion of a thin W layer between the IrMn and CoFeB layers, we show that much larger effective PMA fields are obtained with annealing stability to 300 °C, which is guaranteed by the prevention of Mn diffusion via W insertion as shown in spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy and atomic-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy measurement results. Furthermore, the spin–orbit torque is effectively tuned by changing the W layer thickness via modulation of the interfacial spin–orbit coupling at IrMn/W/CoFeB interfaces, which was reported to degrade the interface spin transparency for the spin currents. Finally, field-free magnetization switching was achieved with comparable exchange bias fields to samples without W insertion. This work demonstrates an effective strategy for improving the performance of the thermally robust AFM-based SOT device.},

In UID crystals with an electron concentration of 10 17 cm −3 , we observe levels at 0.18 eV and 0.46 eV in addition to the previously reported 0.86 (E2) and 1.03 eV (E3) levels. For 10 18 cm −3 Zr-doped Ga 2 O 3 , signatures at 0.30 eV (E15) and 0.71 eV (E16) are present. For the highest Zr doping of 5 × 10 18 cm −3 , we observe only one signature at 0.59 eV. Electric field-enhanced emission rates are demonstrated via increasing the reverse bias during measurement. The 0.86 eV signature in the UID sample displays phonon-assisted tunneling enhanced thermal emission and is consistent with the widely reported E2 (Fe Ga ) defect. The 0.71 eV (E16) signature in the lower-Zr-doped crystal also exhibits phonon-assisted tunneling emission enhancement. Taking into account that the high doping in the Zr-doped diodes also increases the electric field, we propose that the 0.59 eV signature in the highest Zr-doped sample likely corresponds to the 0.71 eV signature in lower-doped samples. Our analysis highlights the importance of testing for and reporting on field-enhanced emission, especially the electric field present during DLTS and other characterization experiments on β-Ga 2 O 3 along with the standard emission energy, cross section, and lambda-corrected trap density. This is important because of the intended use of β-Ga 2 O 3 in high-field devices and the many orders of magnitude of possible doping.},

Indium (In) interstitial atoms existed in the degraded sample, due to the small-bond-energy In atoms deviating from their normal lattice position, caused by the relaxation of the InGaN well. Both the peak wavelengths of the original and degraded green LEDs had similar temperature-dependent behaviors, due to the localization states in the InGaN well. These wavelengths indicate that the degradation had little influence on the localization states. However, the emission peak of the degraded green LED redshifted by 1.6 nm at 300 K, and the integrated intensity decreased by 36.8\%, compared to the peak and intensity of the original sample, respectively. Based on first-principles calculations, the calculated bandgap for the relaxation of the InGaN well was small. Therefore, the wavelength redshifted, and the luminous efficiency of the green LED decreased after degradation. These features are attributed to a decreased bandgap due to the relaxation of the InGaN well; increased defect density, resulting from In interstitial atoms; and an increase in the InGaN well thickness.},

  abstract     = {Scandium nitride (ScN) is an emerging rock salt indirect bandgap semiconductor and has attracted significant interest in recent years for thermoelectric energy conversion, as a substrate for defect-free GaN growth, as a semiconducting component in single-crystalline metal/semiconductor superlattices for thermionic energy conversion, as well as for Al 1−x Sc x N-based bulk and surface acoustic devices for 5G technologies. Most ScN film growth traditionally utilizes physical vapor deposition techniques such as magnetron sputtering and molecular beam epitaxy, which results in stoichiometric films but with varying crystal quality, orientations, microstructures, and physical properties. As epitaxial single-crystalline ScN films with smooth surfaces are essential for device applications, it is important to understand the ScN growth modes and parameters that impact and control their microstructure. In this Letter, we demonstrate that large adatom mobility is essential to overcome the Ehrlich–Schwoebel (E–S) and grain boundary migration barriers and achieve defect (voids, dislocations, stacking faults, etc.)-free single-crystalline ScN films. Using the substrate temperature to tune adatom mobility, we show that nominally single-crystalline ScN films are achieved when the homologous temperature is higher than ∼0.3. For homologous temperatures ranging from 0.23 to 0.30, ScN films are found to exhibit significant structural voids in between pyramidal growth regions with multiple in-plane orientations resulting from additional lateral growth off the facets of the pyramids and broken epitaxy after ∼80 nm of growth. The in-depth discussion of the growth modes of ScN presented here explains its varying electrical and optical properties and will help achieve high-quality ScN for device applications.},

However, most cavitating fluids contain small amounts of non-condensable gases that can change the dynamics of the process significantly. While the effect of non-condensable gases on the surface and bulk properties of the fluid has been studied in detail, its impact on liquid–vapor mass transfer has remained elusive. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into this process using theory and simulations. Our results point to a dual role of non-condensable gases on liquid–vapor mass transfer. While the presence of non-condensable gases always reduces hydrodynamic cavitation, it also leads to a mass transfer mechanism that we call mixing cavitation. We show that mixing cavitation may increase or reduce mass transfer under different physical conditions and can dominate hydrodynamic cavitation. This study opens possibilities to better understand cavitation inception.},

Based on these results, with only the driving frequency varied, the f-scaling for electron density is also validated, showing almost the same trend as the SL scaling, across most of the frequency regime. However, violations of the f-scaling are observed at lower frequencies, which are found to be relevant to the electron heating mode transition from stochastic to Ohmic heating. Electron kinetic invariance is illustrated for the SL and f-scaling being valid, respectively, whereas the electron kinetic variation is observed when the f-scaling is violated.},

  abstract     = {Magnetometers based on nitrogen-vacancy center ensembles in diamond have received considerable attention in recent years. However, their sensitivities are limited by low fluorescence collection efficiencies. With the introduction of some schemes, collection efficiencies of NV ensembles have been improved, but further improvement is still needed. In this Letter, we propose and demonstrate a fluorescence enhancing technique of reflective coating. By applying this technique, collection efficiencies already improved by other schemes will be further enhanced. With the assistance of a 100-nm-thick gold reflective film on the diamond surface, the fluorescence collection efficiency of an NV ensemble continuous-wave magnetometer utilizing a compound parabolic concentrator was further increased by 92\%, and a magnetic field sensitivity of 164 pT / Hz at 0.99 to 77.98 Hz was achieved.},

  abstract     = {The coherent interaction of Rydberg helium atoms with microwave fields in a λ / 4 superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator has been exploited to probe the spectral characteristics of an individual resonator mode. This was achieved by preparing the atoms in the 1s55s 3 S 1 Rydberg level by resonance enhanced two-color two-photon excitation from the metastable 1s2s 3 S 1 level. The atoms then traveled over the resonator in which the third harmonic microwave field, at a frequency of ω res = 2 π × 19.556 GHz, drove the two-photon 1s55s 3 S 1 → 1s56s 3 S 1 transition. By injecting a sequence of Ramsey pulses into the resonator and monitoring the coherent evolution of the Rydberg state population by state-selective pulsed electric field ionization as the frequency of the microwave field was tuned, spectra were recorded that allowed the resonator resonance frequency and quality factor to be determined with the atoms acting as microscopic quantum sensors.},

  abstract     = {Melanin, with its high refractive index (RI) and broadband absorption, is an important biomaterial responsible for many of the vibrant structural colors observed in nature and for UV protection. Even though the RI plays an important role in the function of melanin, there is an ambiguity in its reported complex RI and a lack of understanding of whether and how the UV radiation, these materials are likely to experience under normal use, will affect the complex RI. Here, we measured the wavelength-dependent (360–1700 nm) complex RI of synthetic melanin films before and after in situ UV treatment using ellipsometry. We modeled the ellipsometric data using a modified Tauc-Lorentz dispersion model and measured the thickness independently using atomic force microscopy. The UV radiation reduces the film thickness. Interestingly, we find that both the real and imaginary terms of the RI increase upon UV radiation. These experiments provide accurate measurements of the optical properties of melanin and a surprising result that synthetic melanin absorbs more light (∼25\% increase in extinction coefficient) below 600 nm after UV exposure.},

  abstract     = {The output power of modern 975 nm GaAs-based broad area diode lasers is limited by increasing carrier and photon losses at high bias. We use experiment and one-dimensional calculations on these devices to reveal that higher current densities (and hence higher local recombination rates and higher losses) arise near the front facet due to spatial hole burning and that the non-uniformity is strongly affected by laser geometry, which is more severe for longer resonators and less severe for higher front facet reflectivity. Specifically, we use devices with a segmented p-contact to directly measure the current distribution along the resonator and compare this with laser simulation. Devices with a 6 mm resonator show 29\% more current at the front than back, twice as large as the 15\% current non-uniformity in devices with a 3 mm resonator. In contrast, increased front facet reflectivity (20\% rather than 0.8\%) is shown to almost halve the current non-uniformity from 29\% to 18\% in devices with a 6 mm resonator and reduces power saturation. Although the magnitude of current non-uniformity in experiment and theory is broadly consistent, in experiment, an additional divergence is seen in current flow (and hence recombination rate) near the facets, and earlier power saturation occurs. We discuss the possible saturation mechanisms that are not included in the simulation.},

Double reflections and double transmissions appear, which are specular reflection, retroreflection, normal transmission, and specular transmission. The incident angle dependence transmissions and reflections are studied with different incident energies and different quantum well widths. The retroreflection and the specular transmission appear only when the incident angle of the electron θ is less than the critical value θ c . As the incident energy approximately equals the z component of the momentum, double transmissions disappear completely, perfect retroreflection (specular reflection) can be found when θ is smaller (bigger) than θ c . Under certain conditions, the transmission and reflection types and their magnitudes can be controlled. For the different cases that the nodal line of the Weyl semimetal is parallel to and perpendicular to the interface, the conductance spectra exhibit strong anisotropy. These physical phenomena help us to design nodal-line Weyl semimetal-based nanodevices.},

We use complementary characterization and modeling techniques to reveal significant electron trapping/de-trapping behavior, together with a strong temperature dependence of the electron emission kinetics in ferroelectric layers, which results from the onset of polarization of the ferroelectric layer. This can lead to an apparent difference in the defect characteristics in ferroelectric-HfO 2 compared to the paraelectric-HfO 2 structures they are shown to closely resemble when this contribution is decoupled. The results demonstrate the presence of a defect band closely aligned to the silicon conduction band, which can easily be accessed during device operation.},

  abstract     = {We have investigated how the beam geometry affects the thermal responsivity of doubly clamped GaAs microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) beam resonator structures. When the MEMS beam is heated, a thermal strain is generated and shifts the resonance frequency. MEMS beams with larger l / h ratios ( l and h are the length and the thickness of the MEMS beam, respectively) have lower thermal conductances and are supposed to exhibit higher thermal responsivities. However, the induced thermal strain tends to be released by beam deflection for long GaAs beams, and as a result, long beams do not necessarily lead to high thermal responsivities. To reduce the beam deflection, we have introduced a preloaded tensile strain in the MEMS beam by using the lattice mismatch between GaAs 1− x P x ( x = 0.01) and GaAs. We find that the deflection of the GaAs 1− x P x MEMS beam is suppressed and the responsivities increase with the increasing beam length, demonstrating that the introduction of tensile strain is useful for achieving high thermal responsivities predicted for long MEMS beams.},

From 350 to 500 °C, a measurable increase in J rev was observed, which was consistent with the thermionic emission of charge carriers over the respective image force (IF) lowered Schottky barriers. Despite this increase, PtO x (IrO x )[PdO x ]{RuO x } SCs showed large rectification ratios (at ± 3 V) of 6 × 10 6 (8 × 10 6 )[5 × 10 5 ]{2 × 10 4 } and IF-corrected barrier heights of 2.10(2.10)[1.90]{1.60} ± 0.05 eV, respectively, while operating at 500 °C. The significantly lower 500 °C barrier height of the RuO x SCs was due to the thermal reduction of RuO x to Ru that occurred above 400 °C. In contrast, the Schottky barriers of IrO x , PtO x , and PdO x SCs were thermally stable while operating at 500 °C, indicating significant potential for their use in very high temperature rectifying devices.},

In addition, introducing SOC into graphene causes pristine graphene to evolve into a new condensed matter phase, such as the topological insulator state (quantum spin Hall state). Thus, the control of SOC in graphene is essential for its functional spin-orbitronic applications. Here, we report the nonvolatile tuning of SOC in graphene through the proximity effect from a ferroelectric substrate, Pb(Zr 52 ,Ti 48 )O 3 (PZT). Ferroelectric poling by applying a gate voltage induces a change in the SOC strength in addition to shifting the charge neutral point in graphene. The variations in SOC were extracted from weak localization within the quantum interference theory of graphene. Our analyses show that the dipole moments from the PZT polarization significantly enhance the z → −z asymmetric and symmetric SOCs of graphene. Unlike the impurity doping and/or gating, our methodology leads to the nonvolatile electrical control of SOC, thereby paving the way for versatile spin-orbitronic applications of graphene.},

  abstract     = {The electrocaloric effect represents an adiabatic temperature change or isothermal entropy change upon the application or removal of an external electric field. However, the effect of the repetitive bipolar/unipolar electric field on the electrocaloric effect in ferroelectrics is not well understood. In this work, the electrocaloric effect after both bipolar and unipolar electrical cycling in Pb 0.92 La 0.08 Zr 0.65 Ti 0.35 O 3 relaxor thin films has been indirectly evaluated using the Maxwell relationship. It was found that at room temperature, the electrocaloric temperature change Δ T under higher electric fields decreases gradually from a positive value to a negative one with the increase in the bipolar/unipolar fatigue cycle number. Intriguingly, around the Curie temperature, the positive Δ T of the film after bipolar/unipolar cycling was found to decrease under low or intermediate electric fields, while it remains almost unchanged under high electric fields. This behavior is attributed to the pinning effect of defects caused by phase decomposition during both bipolar and unipolar fatigue. Note that the increase in polarization by temperature induced domain depinning close to room temperature after the fatigue process is manifested by using the Maxwell relation indirectly. Our work further reveals the origin of both the electrocaloric effect and ferroelectric electrical fatigue and is important for the applications of practical electrocaloric refrigerators.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we study the effects of mobile oxygen ions in a synthetic antiferromagnet structure gated by a sputtered SiO 2 dielectric layer for memory and logic applications. Our devices utilize electrochemical reactions between dielectric reactive species and magnetic elements to create irreversible changes in magnetization. We analyzed the dependence of ion velocity on the gate dielectric properties such as the lattice parameter, oxygen migration energy barrier, and electric field (E-field). Hall bar devices were patterned and tested to determine the interlayer exchange coupling between the CoFeB and [Co/Pd] n layers. The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of the CoFeB layer at different gate voltages (V g ) was measured to determine the V g dependence. A sharp change in the behavior of the CoFeB layer with respect to negative V g results in a non-reciprocal decrease in the coercivity and magnetization and an increase in exchange bias. The observed change in exchange bias field and magnetization allows us to measure the change in the effective thickness of the CoFeB layer. This led us to conclude that the source of such behavior is the negatively charged mobile oxygen ions from the SiO 2 gate.},

We focus on the distance between resonance frequencies of the uniform and spin-wave modes as a function of the free-layer size in order to examine the effect of the edge state of MTJs. A marked difference is observed between the two types of MTJs, and the result is consistently reproduced by a model assuming free- or fixed-edge boundary conditions with or without reduced magnetic properties near the pattern edge for each MTJ. The obtained results indicate that the edge state of nanoscale MTJs is crucially affected by the process condition, and spin-wave resonance can serve as a sensitive probe for the edge condition.},

Two alternative ways of obtaining MNR are employed: the quasi-unipolar method and the quasi-minor-loop method, both of which utilize the transition from the rhombohedral (R) to monoclinic (M B ) and then to orthorhombic (O) phase in a PMN-PT substrate. The mechanism is distinct from the conventional unipolar method inducing MNR, which mainly makes use of switching the ferroelectric domain in the R phase. The introduction of these two methods provides different ideas for achieving MNR in ferromagnetic/PMN-PT heterostructures. The observed MNR in an amorphous SmCo/(011) PMN-PT heterostructure demonstrates the potential applicability of hard magnetic materials for multifunctional information storage and spintronic devices.},

Here, we selected a traditional CoFeB-based multilayer film as the platform, and by continuously tuning its magnetic anisotropy, we have observed the progressively evolved angular-dependence of the AHE, in which an abnormal turning peak emerged in the case of moderate perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). By applying comprehensive micromagnetic simulations, a general model was established that can almost fully account for the existing trend of the angular AHE. The PMA magnitude, together with the multi-to-single domain transformation, determined the final behavior of the AHE at various magnetic-field-tilt angles. Notably, we identified a close relationship between the angular-Hall anomaly and formation of magnetic skyrmions, which can possibly offer an alternative method to detect the skyrmions.},

These materials are representative of alloys and disordered materials, which are relatively unexplored for thermal properties owing to their large configuration spaces. Since the full thermal conductivity calculations using the Boltzmann transport equation based solutions are computationally prohibitive for each of the 2 32 considered configurations, we employ regularized autoencoders, a class of generative machine learning models that transform the configuration space to the latent space in which materials are clustered according to the target property. Such conditioning allows selective sampling of high thermal conductivity materials from the latent space. We find that the model is able to learn the underlying thermal transport physics of the system under study and is able to predict superlattice-like configurations with high thermal conductivity despite their higher mass.},

A self-compliance region is formed between the different breakdown voltages of Al 2 O 3 and TiO y layers, and a relatively thinner current path is formed in the Al 2 O 3 layer than a device without the TiO y layer and the overall current level is significantly decreased since the TiO y layer limits the overshoot current.},

The FTA phonon lifetime was a fitting parameter of the model when analyzing the irregular interference pattern in the transmission spectrum measured with a high resolution (0.2 cm −1 ).

Correlation analysis between the E ′ and A 1 ′ phonon energies revealed that tensile strain developed in the TFSI-treated MoS 2 mainly by the filling of sulfur vacancies: 0.13\% and 0.10\% for 1L and 2L MoS 2 , respectively.

The larger p-doping effect in 2L than in 1L MoS 2 was attributed to a relatively higher defect density in the 2L region of the pristine MoS 2 , followed by a subsequent healing of the defects via chemical doping. The TFSI-induced change in electron density estimated from the PL result was in excellent agreement with the Raman correlation analysis. Furthermore, the Raman mapping and PL histogram analyses showed that structural defects in MoS 2 could be effectively healed by chemical treatment.},

In particular, attention has been focused on the surface transfer doping of diamond, in which the hydrogen-terminated diamond (diamond:H) benefices of a unique conductive two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) layer at the diamond&#39;s sub-surface upon coverage with a suitable surface acceptor. Several diamond:H transistors have been developed. However, their inherent architecture dependence on the diamond:H conductive surface sensitivity to harsh processing environments has been a major barrier to the realization of high-performance devices. Here, we report on a diamond:H transistor structure that incorporates a mutual diamond:H active channel into the hybrid model of a metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET) and a self-aligned metal-insulator-semiconductor FET (MISFET) with a common gate connection. The resulting diamond:H hybrid transistor exhibits a beneficial symbiosis that includes the advantages of both the MISFET (a high ON current of 0.8 μ A/ μ m and a low OFF current of ∼10 −9 μ A/ μ m) and MESFET (almost an ideal subthreshold swing of 67 mV/dec) performance operations in the same multilayered device.},

  abstract     = {A diamond (111) substrate cleaned with an NH 3 /H 2 O 2 mixture could form low-temperature direct bonding under atmospheric conditions. When the diamond surface was bonded with a plasma activated SiO 2 surface at 200 °C, the bonding strength was sufficiently high so that cleavage within diamond occurred in a shear test. Moreover, the diamond and Si substrates treated with the NH 3 /H 2 O 2 mixture could form atomic bonds with a 2.5-nm-thick oxide intermediate layer. This bonding method can be applied to electronic devices using diamond because heterogeneous integration can be achieved using a popular wafer cleaning process followed by low-temperature annealing.},

In the presence of a magnetic field, we detect a resonance corresponding to the cyclotron resonance (CR) in the top surface Dirac fermions (DFs) and examine the nontrivial dependence of the surface state cyclotron mass on the Fermi level position. We also detect additional resonant features at moderate electron densities and demonstrate that they are caused by the mixing of surface DFs and bulk electrons. At high electron densities, we observe THz radiation-induced 1 / B -periodic low-field magneto-oscillations coupled to harmonics of the CR and demonstrate that they have a common origin with microwave-induced resistance oscillations previously observed in high mobility GaAs-based heterostructures. This observation attests the superior quality of a 2D electron system formed by helical surface states in strained HgTe films.},

  abstract     = {We report on the development of a highly sensitive imaging polarimeter that allows for the investigation of polarization changing properties of materials in the x-ray regime. By combining a microfocus rotating anode, collimating multilayer mirrors, and two germanium polarizer crystals, we achieved a polarization purity of the two orthogonal linear polarization states of 8 × 10 −8 . This enables the detection of an ellipticity on the same order or a rotation of the polarization plane of 6 arcsec. The high sensitivity combined with the imaging techniques allows us to study the microcrystalline structure of materials. As an example, we investigated beryllium sheets of different grades, which are commonly used for fabricating x-ray lenses, with a spatial resolution of 200 μ m, and observed a strong degradation of the polarization purity due to the polycrystalline nature of beryllium. This makes x-ray lenses made of beryllium unsuitable for imaging polarimeter with higher spatial resolution. The results are important for the development of x-ray optical instruments that combine high spatial resolution and high sensitivity to polarization.},

Using these Stokes parameters, complex field distributions called Stokes fields can be synthesized, and the phase singularities present in these Stokes fields are called Stokes vortices. The SOP of a Stokes vortex can be either linear or circular at the singular point. Of the three types of Stokes vortices, only one of them has handedness associated with it. We show here that changing the handedness of this Stokes vortex results in index sign inversion for the other two types of Stokes vortices. To accomplish handedness inversion without Stokes index sign inversion, a new phase engineering method is introduced here.

Herein, with the coherence of the embedded defects in mind, we explore the effects of substrate miscut on the diamond growth rate, nitrogen density, and hillock defect density, and we report an optimal angle range for the purposes of engineering coherent ensembles of NV centers in diamond according to our growth parameters. We provide a model that quantitatively describes hillock nucleation in the step-flow regime of CVD growth, shedding insight on the physics of hillock formation.

  abstract     = {Very few studies have explored the elastocaloric effect of elastomers other than natural rubber (NR). The aim of the present article is thus to evaluate the elastocaloric properties of a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) in terms of microstructural characteristics and thermoelastic coupling. Calorimetric measurements showed two successive peaks at 240 K and 282 K, attributed to the crystallization and melting of soft segments, respectively. X-ray diffraction indicated that TPU exhibited a fully reversible strain-induced crystallization at room temperature. Thermomechanical experiments performed at different elongations revealed a minimum adiabatic temperature variation of about −8 K after retraction of a sample initially elongated at λ = 5. This is comparable to NR performances. However, for cycles carried out between λ = 1 and λ  = 5, tensile stress/elongation curves showed a non-elastic behavior of TPU. A pseudo-elastic response was obtained for cyclic elongation when unloading was incomplete, in our case, when λ was between 3 and 5. The recorded peak-to-peak temperature variation decreased from 4.5 K to 3.3 K when the number of cycles was increased to 5000. Despite the fact that the issue of fatigue resistance for TPU needs to be addressed, this work opens new perspectives for studying the elastocaloric properties of various polyurethanes (whether crosslinked or thermoplastic) as well as other materials with a tendency for strain-induced crystallization, such as polychloroprene, hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, and others.},

However, the mechanism by which this negative charge is stored is still unclear. We theoretically study the atomic and electronic structures of amorphous silica (a-SiO 2 ) with and without potassium atoms using first-principles molecular-dynamics calculations. Our calculations show that a fivefold-coordinated Si atom with five Si–O bonds (an SiO 5 structure) is the characteristic local structure of a-SiO 2 with potassium atoms, which becomes negatively charged and remains so even after removal of the potassium atoms. These results indicate that this SiO 5 structure is the physical origin of the robust negative charge observed in potassium-ion electrets. We also find that the SiO 5 structure has a Raman peak at 1000 cm −1 .},

However, it is still unclear whether the results and conclusions drawn from the mimicking experiments can provide effective guidance and reference for real radiation. In this work, we systematically investigated the difference of electron guns and radioactive β sources on the efficiency measurement of betavoltaic batteries and gave a quantitative analysis on the causes. Geant 4 simulations of the energy deposition of electrons emitted from electron guns and 63 Ni sources demonstrate that the energy dispersion and the incident direction distribution of electrons are the major causes of the difference of the energy deposition ratio and profile in energy conversion units. The single emission direction of electrons leads to an overestimation around 30\% in the conversion efficiency measured using an electron gun. The device structure also contributes to the efficiency difference. The efficiency difference of three SiC samples with different structures measured under electron guns and 63 Ni sources varies from 20.6\% to 32.0\% in three samples, which agrees very well with the simulation results. This work provides a valuable guidance to evaluate the results generated from electron-gun mimicked β sources. The physics discussed here would provide good references for other applications using mimicked β sources.},

Recently, devices based on a phonon–photon interaction have gathered a lot of interest thanks to their extreme compactness and working frequency directly in the GHz. In this frame, a still-missing element to obtain long-term frequency stability performances is an on-chip delay within the feedback loop. Here, we experimentally show filtering and slow propagation of 2 GHz acoustic waves on a Gallium Arsenide membrane heterogeneously integrated on a silicon wafer. By engineering the dispersion of an acoustical waveguide, we evidence a group velocity below 1000 m/s for the mode able to propagate.

Electrical conduction measured along different directions shows isotropic transport. A reduction of PtS e 2 channel conductance is observed under exposure to light. Such a negative photoconductivity is explained by a photogating effect caused by photo-charge accumulation in SiO 2 and at the Si / SiO 2 interface.},

  abstract     = {Using the tip of a scanning probe microscope as a local electrostatic gate gives access to real-space information on electrostatics as well as charge transport at the nanoscale, provided that the tip-induced electrostatic potential is well known. Here, we focus on the accurate characterization of the tip potential, in a regime where the tip locally depletes a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) hosted in a semiconductor heterostructure. Scanning the tip in the vicinity of a quantum point contact defined in the 2DEG, we observe Fabry–Pérot interference fringes at low temperature in maps of the device conductance. We exploit the evolution of these fringes with the tip voltage to measure the change in the depletion radius by electron interferometry. We find that a semi-classical finite-element self-consistent model taking into account the conical shape of the tip reaches a faithful correspondence with the experimental data.},

We show that the Ru bottom electrode deposited by radical enhanced ALD (REALD) improves the remanent polarization of both capacitors considerably. The origin of such a phenomenon is established by grazing-incidence and symmetrical θ–2θ x-ray diffraction measurements. HZO films on Ru exhibit the orthorhombic phase, which is highly (002)-textured in the out-of-plane direction as compared to HZO on TiN. HZLO films demonstrate the rise of (111) intensity of the orthorhombic phase when it is grown on Ru. Both types of capacitors with Ru exhibit a lower wake-up degree as compared to the ones with TiN, which is assumed to be due to the difference in the bottom interface properties. At the same time, both HZO and HZLO on Ru suffer from the relatively early breakdown during electric field cycling, which is presumably due to the high surface roughness of REALD Ru. Taking into account the continuous search for the new precursor&#39;s chemicals and ALD processes for Ru, which would be able to provide smother films, ALD Ru might be promising for the hafnium oxide-based ferroelectric random access memory.},

Domain patterns of the PbTiO 3 layers containing topological structures were analyzed in detail by using advanced transmission electron microscopy. It was found that by increasing the PbTiO 3 thickness, a / c domains with extra c domains will form in the triangle a domains in pure flux-closure structures. Atomically resolved high-angle annular dark field-scanning TEM imaging demonstrates that this specific domain structure results in vortex-antivortex pairs at the junctions of extra c domains and the original flux-closure structure, forming a periodic vortex-antivortex array throughout the PbTiO 3 layer.

  abstract     = {Artificial heterostructures composed of strongly correlated oxides can host many up-and-coming phenomena. The interfacial ferromagnetism can be observed at the interface of paramagnetic LaNiO 3 (LNO) and G-type antiferromagnetic SrMnO 3 (SMO). Through the macroscopic magnetic and transport measurements and the microscopic x-ray magnetic circular dichroism signals, the obvious interfacial ferromagnetic behavior exhibited in the thicker superlattices. Using x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, the polar mismatch-induced charge redistribution in Ni and Mn ions accurately demonstrates the dependence on the varying thickness of LNO/SMO superlattices. These results suggest that the ferromagnetic double-exchange interaction of Mn 3+ –Mn 4+ increases and the ferromagnetic super-exchange interaction of Ni 2+ –Mn 4+ decreases with the increasing thickness of LNO/SMO superlattices. Consequently, the obvious ferromagnetic behavior in the thicker superlattices is induced by the double-exchange interaction. For the thinner LNO/SMO superlattice, the interfacial super-exchange ferromagnetic state is offset by the double-exchange ferromagnetism. This is the crucial reason behind the fact that ferromagnetism is hard to exist in the prior LNO/SMO superlattices. Our findings highlight the intrinsic mechanism responsible for the interfacial ferromagnetism and the significance of understanding polar mismatch at the interface of heterostructures.},

Along this direction, many interesting results have been reported, including the electric field control of magnetism and topological spin textures. In this report, we present a rapid and spatially resolved imaging method to study the dimensionality-dependent magnetic properties of Fe 3 GeTe 2 (FGT) nanoflakes. Our method is named as polar magneto-optical Kerr imaging microscopy magnetometry (p-MIMM), which is made possible by analyzing the intensity evolution of wide-field polar magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) images that were collected by varying magnetic fields, thicknesses, and temperatures. In particular, spatially resolved MOKE hysteresis loops can be acquired in the FGT nanoflakes with a submicrometer resolution. By analyzing the evolution of the relative (saturated) MOKE intensity as a function of temperature, we further study the critical exponent and universality class and its dependence on the FGT nanoflake thickness. Combining the polar MOKE images with the calculated MOKE hysteresis loops, a detailed magnetic phase diagram summarizing an evolution of the stripe domain, single domain, and paramagnetic state is further validated. Our results suggest that the wide-field p-MIMM can be conveniently used for rapidly examining the magnetic properties of versatile vdW magnetic materials.},

  abstract     = {Neuromorphic computing has attracted increasing attention in medical applications due to its ability to improve diagnosis accuracy and human healthcare monitoring. However, the current remote operation mode has a time delay between in vivo data acquisition and in vitro clinical decision-making. Thus, it is of great importance to build a biodegradable neuromorphic network that can operate in a local physiological environment. A biodegradable synapse is a crucial component of such neuromorphic networks. However, the materials employed currently to develop a biodegradable synapse are incompatible with the foundry process, making it challenging to achieve a high density and large-scale neuromorphic network. Here, we report a biodegradable artificial synapse based on a W/Cu/WO 3 /SiO 2 /W structure, which is constructed from materials widely used in advanced semiconductor foundries. The device exhibits resistive switching, and the dominated mechanisms are attributed to Ohm&#39;s law and trap-filled space charge limited conduction. By manipulating pulse amplitudes, widths, and intervals, the device conductance can be finely regulated to achieve various synaptic functions, such as long-term potentiation, long term depression, paired-pulse facilitation, and spike-rate-dependent plasticity. Moreover, the learning-forgetting-relearning process, which is an essential and complex synaptic behavior, is emulated in a single device. Pattern learning of a slash symbol is also accomplished by building a 4 × 4 synaptic array. In addition, the systematic solubility testing proves its full biodegradability in biofluids. This work opens a potential pathway toward the integration of large-scale neuromorphic network for bioelectronics.},

Toward this goal, this work explores the influence of annealing temperatures on Te transistors and their two failure mechanisms, related to the sublimation of the Te channel and the degradation of the contacts. To overcome these challenges, we fabricated a Te device that is graphene-contacted and SiO x -encapsulated such that the Te channel and the contacts remain intact and stable at high temperatures. The device exhibits an effective mobility of ∼50 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , which is comparable to traditional metal-contacted Te transistors. The traditional Te devices have performance degradation with increasing temperature and failure at 200 °C. Through the graphene contact and SiO x encapsulation, our device shows improved thermal stability despite the repeated annealing processes for temperatures up to 250 °C, making it suitable for practical use.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the tunable resistive switching (RS) functionality of a Cu/MoS 2 /AlN/ITO nanostructured device is systematically investigated in dark and white light illumination. The device exhibits bi-state RS behavior in the dark ambient, whereas light illumination induces an extra intermediate resistance state and provides controllable tri-state RS characteristics. A conceptual model is proposed and discussed to elucidate the origin of the switching behavior of two resistance states and multiple resistance states of the device. Under the dark ambient condition, the high resistance state and the low resistance state in the device could be ascribed to the formation/rupture of a Cu metallic filamentary path between the electrodes. However, the formation of an additional ionic filament via trapping/detrapping of electrons in nitride-sulfide-related vacancies along with the Cu metallic filament is responsible for the tri-state switching under the light illumination. Interestingly, the variation of SET voltage with applied light intensity has also been demonstrated. The calculated value of the temperature coefficient and temperature dependency of resistance in various resistance states confirms the existence of the proposed model. The device performed a good undispersed endurance up to 1.5 × 10 3 cycles and stable retention over 10 3 s at room temperature. This optical activity dependent functionality of the device provides a possibility to extend resistive switching-based nonvolatile random access memory applications to the optical domain such as imaging sensors, photodetectors, and optoelectronic switches.},

  abstract     = {We present thin acoustic meta-structures with subwavelength dimensions through which almost perfect sound absorption is achieved in the low-frequency domain. Our overall strategy builds on the fact that the sound absorption capabilities of the meta-structures primarily depend on the geometric dimensions and can easily be reconfigured as per requirements through a change of geometry. To analyze various possibilities, we optimize the geometric structure through hybrid regression analysis using the genetic algorithm approach and finite element-based numerical simulations so that the geometry is tuned for high attenuation of acoustic signals over a broad range of frequencies. Both theoretical and experimental data show good parity and are able to establish the meta-structure nature of the assembly with respect to different frequency bands in the low frequency domain.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a series of single-layer metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) was theoretically predicted to be two-dimensional organic topological materials. However, the experimental evidence of their nontrivial topological states has not been found. Here, combining the use of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy, we report the electronic structure studies on a single-layer Cu-coordinated 2,4,6-tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (Cu-T4PT) MOF supported by a Cu(111) substrate and identify periodic surface states with the period of the Cu-T4PT reciprocal lattice. These periodic surface states, which have identical features to the Cu(111) Shockley surface states, can be attributed to the quantum confinement of the surface states of the underlying Cu(111) substrate by the network lattices of the Cu-T4PT MOF. Our work indicates that the surface states of the metal substrate can be tailored in a controlled manner by the network structures of MOFs with different periodic lattices. The lack of intrinsic bands and the possible topological properties of the single-layer Cu-T4PT MOF may be attributed to the strong electronic coupling between the Cu-T4PT MOF and the Cu(111) substrates. In order to exploit organic topological materials predicted in MOFs, it is necessary to grow them on weak van der Waals interaction substrates in the future.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-sensitive and fast infrared imaging has become increasingly important in applications that require high frame rates at low light levels, such as exoplanet imaging. The sensitivity of conventional short-wave infrared cameras is limited by their readout noise level. This limitation can be addressed by the internal gain of the sensors, but only if fast response time and low dark current are achieved simultaneously. Recent theoretical predictions suggested that reducing the internal capacitance of detectors with internal gain can increase their sensitivity. Here, we show the experimental validation of this prediction for III–V heterojunction phototransistors. We have fabricated a 320 × 256 array of InGaAs/InP infrared phototransistors integrated with a conventional silicon readout circuit. The array is made of two groups of pixels: 50\% are devices with a 1 μ m base diameter and the other 50\% with a 2 μ m base diameter. Characterization of a large number of pixels shows that 1 μ m devices have significantly higher sensitivity than 2 μ m devices. These have an average noise equivalent photon sensitivity of about 20 photons at a camera frame rate of ∼500 frames per second, which is better than the best existing infrared cameras with a similar cutoff wavelength and frame rate. Interestingly, the processing variation in the 1 μ m devices resulted in variation in sensitivity, and a good number of devices show sensitivity to less than 10 photons. These results suggest that the proposed phototransistors are promising for ultra-sensitive short-wavelength infrared cameras.},

We also show that the proposed CRF could be an excellent candidate for various CD-related applications of OAM modes in the optical fiber. The dispersion of the OAM 3,1 mode can reach down to −75 273 ps/(nm km) at 1491 nm. Furthermore, the effect of the geometrical parameters on chromatic dispersion for different OAM modes is investigated. Adjusting the parameters of the inner ring or the outer ring could greatly influence the peak value of the dispersion, while moving the two high-index rings at the same time mainly changes the position of the crossing wavelength.},

In this Letter, we show dexterous formation of unconventional Chladni patterns in a fluid using standing bulk acoustic waves. A neat acoustofluidic resonator enabling visualization of microparticles in the fluid channel both on its cross section and in its flow direction was designed. In contrast to classical Chladni patterns, which depend on resonant modes of flat plates, the Chladni patterns herein are generated by vibrations of cylindrical walls and are related to resonant modes of fluid channels. The behavior of the acoustofluidic resonator is numerically predicted by applying an acoustic-structure interaction model to calculate the acoustic pressure distribution at different modes of resonances and the Gorkov theory to obtain the potential of the acoustic radiation forces that act on suspended particles. We also demonstrate numerically and experimentally that further focusing of microparticles can be achieved if the actuation of ultrasound continues after Chladni patterns are formed on the cross section of the fluid channel.},

First, we analyze the semiconducting and ferroelectric properties of the α-In 2 Se 3 van der Waals (vdW) stack via experimental characterization and first-principles simulations. Then, we develop a FeSMJ device simulation framework by self-consistently solving the Landau–Ginzburg–Devonshire equation, Poisson&#39;s equation, and charge-transport equations. Based on the extracted Fe-semiconductor (FeS) parameters, our simulation results show good agreement with the experimental characteristics of our fabricated α-In 2 Se 3 -based FeSMJ. Our analysis suggests that the FeS polarization-dependent modulation of Schottky barrier heights of FeSMJ plays a key role in providing the NVM functionality. Besides, the appearance of mobile carriers in FeS due to its semiconducting properties leads to a non-uniform electric field. This further induces partial polarization switching in the FeS layers, resulting in asymmetry in the FeSMJ characteristics for positive and negative voltages. Moreover, we show that the thickness scaling of FeS leads to a reduction in read/write voltage and an increase in distinguishability. Array-level analysis of FeSMJ NVM suggests a lower read-time and read-write energy with respect to the HfO 2 -based ferroelectric insulator tunnel junction.},

This paper investigates the influence of the mode structure on comb generation using a model of two nonlinearly coupled phonon modes. The model predicts that there is only one region within the amplitude-frequency space where combs exist, and this region is a subset of the Arnold tongue that describes a 2:1 autoparametric resonance between the two modes. In addition, the location and shape of the comb region are analytically defined by the resonance frequencies, quality factors, mode coupling strength, and detuning of the driving force frequency from the mechanical resonances, providing clear conditions for comb generation. These results enable comb structure engineering for applications in areas as broad as sensing, communications, quantum information science, materials science, and molecular science.},

  abstract     = {This work demonstrates large-area vertical GaN-on-GaN Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) with different p-GaN terminations fabricated by the p-GaN regrowth on planar and nonplanar n-GaN structures and studies the leakage current in these regrown p-GaN terminations. The SBDs with planar p-GaN terminations demonstrate a higher breakdown voltage than the non-terminated SBDs. In contrast, the SBDs with nonplanar regrown terminations exhibit a significantly higher leakage current, which agrees with the tunneling behavior. The microscopic current mapping and local current–voltage (I–V) spectra are acquired using conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) in the nonplanar regrown junction region. The local leakage currents and conduction types are derived from the I–V characteristics of the Schottky barrier between the metalized C-AFM tip and GaN. The dominant leakage path is revealed to be the tunneling across the Schottky barrier to the regrowth sidewall assisted by high-concentration interfacial impurities, followed by current flow along the regrowth sidewall. An ∼0.7 μ m-wide n-type compensation layer is found next to the non-polar regrowth sidewall, which does not directly induce a major leakage path but moves the p-GaN away from the regrowth interface, thus weakening the p-GaN depletion of the sidewall interfacial impurities as well as facilitating the formation of a crowded electric field and tunneling at the Schottky contact to the regrowth region.},

  abstract     = {An extremely anisotropic phononic crystal with open elliptical dispersion is proposed for energy convergence and beam squeezing. The proposed crystal consists of multiple arrays of Helmholtz resonator pairs, where the Bragg scattering contributes to the negative slope and the resonance of Helmholtz resonators contributes to the extreme anisotropy with open elliptical dispersion from 4.8 kHz to 5.15 kHz. The crystal shows the negative refraction with a reduced range of refraction angles for the incident beams, giving rise to efficient energy convergence in the far-fields of the outgoing interface for acoustic waves emitted from a point source and the beam squeezing effect for divergent sound waves irradiating from a line source. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Our design may provide a potential possibility for sound manipulation, which may find usage in angular filtering and acoustic imaging.},

An insignificant change is perceived, however, in the Raman features with remarkable downward shifts of the BeSe-type confined optical modes. These effects are ascribed to the localization of atomic displacements at the interfacial regions.

Yet the mechanical properties of these heterostructures in the form of NEMS have not been studied extensively. Such 2D NEMS hold promise for various technological applications, namely, ultrafast sensors, actuators, etc. We report fabrication and characterization of h-BN graphene heterostructure-based circular nanoelectromechanical resonators on sapphire substrates. The devices are measured at cryogenic temperatures and exhibit multiple mode frequencies, which are highly tunable with gate voltage. A continuum mechanics model is employed to analyze the transmission (S 21 ) data of the fundamental mode. Parameters like built-in tension obtained from the fit are used to identify the indices (m, n) of higher mechanical modes observed for the device, providing further device characterization.

Focalizing both the pump and the probe on the same spot of the sample is a critical part of pump-probe experiments. This is particularly relevant in the case of small objects. The main practical challenges for the actual implementation of this technique are stability of the spatiotemporal overlap, reproducibility of the focalization, and optical mode matching conditions. In this work, we solve these three challenges for the case of planar and micropillar optophononic cavities. We integrate the studied samples to single mode fibers lifting the need for focusing optics to excite and detect coherent acoustic phonons. The resulting reflectivity contrast of at least 66\% achieved in our samples allows us to observe stable coherent phonon signals over at least a full day and signals at an extremely low excitation power of 1 μ W. The monolithic sample structure is transportable and could provide a means to perform reproducible plug-and-play experiments.},

The lattice constants are precisely determined from the Rietveld analysis. The linear compressibility of each crystal axis a , b , and c is estimated as 10.0 × 10 −3 , 3.8 × 10 −3 , and 12.7 × 10 −3 /GPa, respectively, indicating a strong anisotropy. The equation of state for m-HfO 2 is obtained using the third-order Birch–Murnaghan equation based on the volume and pressure data. The obtained unit cell volume ( V 0 ), bulk modulus ( B 0 ), and its pressure derivative ( B 0 ′) at ambient pressure are 138.3(1) Å, 195(2) GPa, and –5.4(5), respectively. The negative value of B 0 ′ implies the bulk modulus softening with an increase in pressure. The fact that the elastic softening has also been observed in m-ZrO 2 suggests that the abnormal behavior is a characteristic of the monoclinic structure ( P21 / c ). The transition to the orthorhombic phase is observed at approximately 6.4 GPa. The transition is sluggish, and two phases coexist at a pressure of up to 10 GPa.},

However, the mechanism for stabilizing the ferroelectric phase is still controversial. In this study, it is found that the redox reaction at high temperature strongly influences the phase transformation kinetics during the cooling process of Ge-doped HfO 2 and alters the ferroelectric phase ratio at room temperature. The transformation to the non-ferroelectric phase becomes so fast during cooling in the oxidized sample that the transformation is unavoidable even in fast cooling and deteriorates ferroelectricity. It is further revealed that while the high-temperature redox reaction itself is reversible, the transformation to the non-ferroelectric phase during cooling is an irreversible process, which dominates ferroelectricity. These results help understand ferroelectric phase formation in doped HfO 2 and elaborate the fabrication process of advanced ferroelectric devices.},

In this work, we study SOTs and deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization by inserting different asymmetric dusting layers at the heavy metal/ferromagnet interface. Similar to the previous works with lateral structural asymmetry, we study the emergence of current-induced perpendicular effective magnetic fields (H z eff ). By examining three different material combinations of heavy metal/dusting layers (W/IrMn, Pt/IrMn, and W/Ta), we shed light on the origins of H z eff ; we show that H z eff is generically created in all the studied asymmetric structures, has a close correlation with the interfacial magnetic anisotropy, and is independent of the signs of spin Hall angles of the materials. Furthermore, we show that the induction of H z eff enables field-free deterministic SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization.

In this work, we study the temperature-dependent SOT and stability properties of two types of W-based heterostructures, namely, W/CoFeB/MgO (standard) and CoFeB/W/CoFeB/MgO (field-free), from 25 °C (298 K) to 80 °C (353 K). Via temperature-dependent SOT characterization, the SOT efficacies for both systems are found to be invariant within the range of studied temperatures. Temperature-dependent current-induced SOT switching measurements further show that the critical switching current densities decrease with respect to the ambient temperature; thermal stability factors ( ⁠ Δ ⁠ ) are also found to degrade as temperature increases for both standard and field-free systems. The memristive SOT switching behaviors in both systems with various pulse-widths and temperatures are also examined. Our results suggest that, although the SOT efficacy is robust against thermal effects, the reduction of Δ at elevated temperatures could be detrimental to standard memory as well as neuromorphic (memristive) device applications.},

In addition, both measurement schemes allow us to investigate the modulation of magnon transport induced by an additional dc charge current applied to the center modulator strip.

It was found that In composition increases gradually from x = 0 (GaN) to x = 1 (InN) along the growth direction accompanied by a gradual strain relaxation. At the initial stage of growth, multiple quantum wells like structures with low and high In composition In x Ga 1−x N layers are spontaneously formed, effectively relaxing the in-plane strain.

Here, 2DEG was shown to form at amorphous-BN/SrTiO 3 and amorphous-LaF 3 /SrTiO 3 interfaces and have similar properties to 2DEG at traditional oxide interfaces. Because of film chemical properties, the growth atmosphere and air clearly influenced 2DEG at these interfaces. With x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements, anion diffusion between the film and the substrate existed, but they appeared not to be the reason for 2DEG formation. Furthermore, these findings suggested that amorphous film-induced interfacial conductivity might be a common phenomenon that should be considered in the study of heterojunctions.},

It features desirable properties uncommon in optical forces, such as the ability to produce it via wide-area illumination of vast numbers of particles without the need for focusing or being dynamically switchable via the polarization of light. Unfortunately, these recoil forces are usually very weak and have not been experimentally observed in small dipolar particles. Some works theoretically demonstrate orders-of-magnitude enhancement of these forces via complex nano-structuring involving hyperbolic surfaces or metamaterials, complicating the fabrication and experimental demonstration. In this work, we theoretically and numerically show enhancement of the lateral recoil force by simply using thin metallic films, which support ultra-high-momentum plasmonic modes. The high-momentum carried by these modes imparts a correspondingly large recoil force on the dipole, enhancing the force by several orders of magnitude in a remarkably simple geometry, bringing it closer to practical applications.},

Thus, it is easier to rotate the inhomogeneous crystal orientation for subsequent AlN epilayers during the HTA process, greatly improving the recrystallization efficiency of AlN. Due to the improved AlN quality, the 283-nm deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) on the HT-annealed AlN with Gr shows a significant increase in light output power of 2.3 times at an injection current of 20 mA compared to its counterpart on bare sapphire. This research broadens the applications of Gr in assisting group-III nitride epitaxy and provides a useful strategy for the manufacture of high-quality AlN and high-performance DUV-LEDs.},

Unlike quantum well (QW) lasers on Si, 1.3 μ m InAs QD lasers on Si show similar threshold current to those grown on GaAs owing to their better dislocation tolerance. To date, research on dislocation-tolerant QDs has exclusively focused on materials emitting at telecom wavelengths. In this work, we report visible InP QDs on Si with photoluminescence (PL) intensity similar to their counterparts grown on GaAs despite high threading dislocation density (TDD). In contrast, visible InGaP QWs grown on Si with the same TDD value show 9 × degradation in PL intensity compared to QWs grown on GaAs. The dislocation tolerance of InP QDs arises from their high density relative to TDD and the lateral carrier confinement that they provide. InP QDs on Si with bright PL are promising for low-cost light emitters and integrated photonics applications requiring monolithic red-light sources.},

Under optimum conditions, we demonstrate that the former shows 3 and 5 times better performances compared with the latter for detection and generation, respectively. When pumped by an amplified Yb laser, we find that the CdTe crystal is more efficient than the GaP crystal for emission at optical fluences lower than 250 μ J/cm 2 . Although CdTe has some limitations in comparison with GaP, such as high THz absorption above 1 THz and the appearance of two-photon absorption at relatively low optical intensity, our findings demonstrate the potential of this crystal to be used as the emitter and detector in combination with the Yb laser.},

We discuss the striking impact of the aliovalent Zn/Cu substitution on the charge carrier mobility and effective mass and the consequences on the electrical and thermal transport properties. The investigation is supported by first-principles calculations of the electronic density-of-states of doped colusites. The theoretical study reveals the removal of the sharp features at the top of the valence manifold with the incorporation of Zn in the conductive network, with a strong reduction in the estimated relaxation time. These theoretical and experimental observations confirm the importance of disorder within the conductive network and the high sensitivity of the Cu-S tetrahedral framework toward defects in high-performance thermoelectric colusites.},

The proposed harvester comprises a cylindrical container with a certain liquid, a piezoelectric cantilever beam, ropes, and floater-lever arrays. The experimental results indicate that the proposed harvester with a single floater-lever can generate 9.8 μ W under an ultralow frequency (2.6  Hz) and a low intensity vibration excitation (0.03 g), and the normalized power density is 8.89 μ W/(cm 3 g 2 Hz). Under a multidirectional vibration excitation (360° in the horizontal plane) with frequencies below 3  Hz and an acceleration of 0.03 g, the two proposed harvesters with three and four floater-levers indicate a maximum output power (P max ) deviation of 24.92\% and 28.31\%, respectively, and an angle bandwidth of 360° (using 2 /2P max as the standard). All the experimental results indicate that the proposed PVEH is highly promising as an energy supply of wireless sensor networks distributed in ultralow frequency, low intensity, and multidirectional applications.},

  abstract     = {Graphene/semiconductor heterojunction photodetectors have the potential to outperform conventional infrared (IR) sensors. A high-performance graphene/indium antimonide (InSb) heterojunction photodetector for high-resolution mid-IR image sensors was developed using an undoped InSb substrate with low carrier density. The width of the depletion layer at the graphene/InSb interface was increased because of the low carrier density of undoped InSb, which resulted in a low dark current for the proposed device. In addition, the low carrier density resulted in an increased capacitance change due to photocarrier generation for the depletion layer upon light irradiation. As a result, the carrier density modulation effect of graphene was also amplified owing to the photogating effect. Consequently, low dark currents on the order of nanoamperes and high responsivities of over 2 A/W were achieved over a wide voltage range of −0.05 to −0.5 V using our proposed photodetector. The best performance achieved for the developed photodetector corresponded to a specific detectivity ( D * ) of 2.28 × 10 10 cm Hz 1/2 /W and a noise-equivalent-power of 0.13 pW/Hz 1/2 , which makes these detectors suitable for use in mid-IR image sensors, realizing a low dark current of just −7.5 nA over the wide wavelength range of 3–5 μ m. These results demonstrate that an IR image sensor with detection performance better than those developed using existing graphene-based photodetectors can be obtained by adopting a simple graphene/InSb heterojunction with undoped InSb, owing to the photogating effect.},

  abstract     = {Research in the field of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) has progressed tremendously, mostly because of their exceptional optoelectronic properties. Core@shell NCs, in which one or more inorganic layers overcoat individual NCs, recently received significant attention due to their remarkable optical characteristics. Reduced Auger recombination, suppressed blinking, and enhanced carrier multiplication are among the merits of core@shell NCs. Despite their importance in device development, the influence of the shell and the surface modification of the core@shell NC assemblies on the charge carrier transport remains a pertinent research objective. Type-II PbTe@PbS core@shell NCs, in which exclusive electron transport was demonstrated, still exhibit instability of their electron transport. Here, we demonstrate the enhancement of electron transport and stability in PbTe@PbS core@shell NC assemblies using iodide as a surface passivating ligand. The combination of the PbS shelling and the use of the iodide ligand contributes to the addition of one mobile electron for each core@shell NC. Furthermore, both electron mobility and on/off current modulation ratio values of the core@shell NC field-effect transistor are steady with the usage of iodide. Excellent stability in these exclusively electron-transporting core@shell NCs paves the way for their utilization in electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {HfO 2 -based ferroelectrics have dramatically changed the application perspectives of polarization-switching materials for information processing and storage. Their CMOS compatibility and preservation of high reversible polarization down to a few nanometer thickness make them attractive for various device concepts including non-volatile memories and negative-capacitance-enhanced steep-slope transistors. In the context of these applications, the long-standing discussion of intrinsic (thermodynamic) or extrinsic nuclei-limited switching (NLS) in ferroelectrics has recently gained importance. In particular, the negative capacitance effect that is formally described by the Landau–Ginzburg–Devonshire formalism implies the intrinsic polarization switching driven by the thermodynamic coercive field. On the other hand, recent studies reported the nucleation-limited extrinsic switching, which does not result in the hysteresis-free negative capacitance effect. Here, we analyze the polarization response in the nanometer scale on the ferroelectric/dielectric bilayer where the negative capacitance has been previously demonstrated. Our analysis of the two limiting cases of quasi-static switching and the earlier reported ultra-fast polarization response supports the intrinsic polarization reversal scenario. The compatibility of this mechanism with the previously reported NLS region-by-region switching with remarkably low domain wall velocity is addressed. Our results confirm the usability of CMOS-compatible polycrystalline HZO ferroelectric films for gates operating in the negative-capacitance regime. Furthermore, they point towards possible solutions for optimizing their switching properties for applications including memories.},

The anisotropy of the energy exponent of avalanches is very small in BaTiO 3 with exponents between 1.53 and 1.6, which is remarkably close to the prediction of mean field theory 5/3. The anisotropy is much stronger in 0.7Pb(Mg 2/3 Nb 1/3 )O 3 –0.3PbTiO 3 with one exponent slightly above the typical range of mean field values (4/3–5/3): 1.43 ± 0.02, 1.64 ± 0.03, and 1.79 ± 0.03 for fields along [100], [110], and [111], respectively.

By using a self-developed multifunctional scanning tunneling microscope, we investigated the correlation between controllably introduced disorder and superconductivity in the Si(111)- 7 × 3 -In surface reconstruction. It is revealed that not only the density but also the spatial distribution of surface vacancies makes a significant influence on the diamagnetic response of the superconducting surface reconstruction. The higher density of vacancies uniformly dispersed on terraces results in a lower critical temperature and critical magnetic field, while the presence of grooves formed by aggregation of vacancies at step edges reduces the critical supercurrent and thus weakens the diamagnetic shielding effect remarkably.},

In this work, based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate a class of promising two-dimensional valleytronic materials in monolayer MN 2 X 2 (M = Mo, W; X = F, H). Monolayer MN 2 X 2 exhibits a semiconducting nature with the valence band maximum located at the K/K′ points, forming a pair of degenerate valleys. Importantly, upon including spin-orbital coupling, the valleys in these systems experience a significant spin splitting (601 meV), which gives rise to the long-sought strong spin-valley coupling. Such significant spin splitting is attributed to the strong spin–orbit coupling strength within the W- d x 2 − y 2 / d x y orbitals as well as the inversion asymmetry. Moreover, under hole doping and optical illumination, the valley Hall effect can be achieved in these systems.},

It is found that the constant velocity of the skyrmion bag in the ferromagnetic film depends on its topological charge number, while in the case of motion in nanostrips with the skyrmion bag moving along the boundary, the velocity in the first approximation is independent of the topological charge number. The simulation results are in good agreement with the calculation results. Finally, we show that the skyrmion bag can pass through defects and impurities in the nanostrip due to topological protection.

A weak external field dependence of the SOT switching was observed due to the robust domain wall structure in the trilayer. The switching current density was observed to scale inversely with the net magnetization. For trilayers with the same net magnetization, switching current is independent of the layer order because switching in the thicker Co layer dominates. In both ferromagnetic and antiferromagetic regimes, the switching current reflects the interlayer coupling strength.},

This effect, when not properly accounted for, leads to a discrepancy in the dependence of the ferromagnetic resonance field on frequency for different field orientations. The frequency-pulling effect is the complement of the broadening of the ferromagnetic resonance line shape by two-magnon scattering and can be calculated using the same parameters. By accounting for the two-magnon frequency shifts through these means, consistency is achieved in fitting data from in-plane and perpendicular-to-plane resonance conditions.},

  abstract     = {The influence of growth temperature on the distribution (concentrations and energy levels) of individual defect states in metal organic chemical vapor deposition-grown, Si-doped β-Ga 2 O 3 is investigated. A combination of deep level thermal transient/optical spectroscopies and admittance spectroscopy (AS) was used to quantitatively monitor the evolution of trap states throughout the ∼4.8 eV bandgap. States are observed at E C -0.12 eV by AS; at E C -0.4 eV by deep level transient spectroscopy; and at E C -1.2 eV, E C -2.0 eV, and E C -4.4 eV by deep level optical spectroscopy, and showed different dependencies on growth temperatures ranging from 800 °C to 920 °C. The E C -0.4 eV and E C -4.4 eV states both displayed a strong reduction in its concentration with increasing growth temperature, whereas no consistent trends were seen for the states at E C -1.2 eV and 2.0 eV over the temperature range studied. In contrast, the concentration of the E C -0.12 eV trap monotonically increased over the same range of increasing growth temperature, which tracked a slight, monotonic increase in overall Si concentration measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy with growth temperature. The opposing trends in concentrations for some of these states shifted the dominant deep level in the bandgap from the E C -4.4 eV state at the lowest growth temperature explored here to the E C -0.12 eV state at the highest growth temperature. The shifting dominance of various bandgap states can have important ramifications on β-Ga 2 O 3 device behavior, and the different trends for these deep levels cannot only guide further growth optimization but also advance the identification of their physical sources.},

Secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements show that surface segregation is the chief cause of a large FWHM in MOVPE-grown films. The surface segregation coefficient (R) is observed to reduce with reduction in the growth temperature. Films grown at 600 °C show an electron concentration of 9.7 × 10 12 cm −2 and a FWHM of 3.2 nm. High resolution scanning/transmission electron microscopy of the epitaxial film did not reveal any observable degradation in the crystal quality of the delta sheet and surrounding regions.

We discuss the dependence of NV center charge states on annealing temperature, laser excitation power, and measurement temperature. The results show that the NV centers in low-nitrogen diamond are more likely to exist in the form of NV 0 centers. Annealing breaks the charge balance between two charged NV centers, and, as the annealing temperature increases (300–800 °C), NV − centers are converted into NV 0 centers. Meanwhile, the NV intensities significantly increase when the nitrogen atoms capture the vacancies after electron irradiation and subsequent annealing. With increases in laser power, the NV − centers are more prone to Auger recombination, and thus, the NV − centers are converted into NV 0 centers. In addition, the NV centers are quenched by increases in measurement temperature, but the measurement temperature does not affect their intensity ratio. This result indicates that low-nitrogen diamond becomes more likely to form stable NV 0 and NV − centers at different measurement temperatures.},

Here, the Sb of a group-V element is employed as a catalyst. Annealing (450 °C) of a-Ge (100 nm)/Sb (100 nm) bi-layer stacked structures generates layer-exchange crystallization. Namely, Ge and Sb layers exchange their positions, and Ge layers are crystallized on insulator substrates. However, Ge evaporation occurs during annealing, and a high concentration of Sb (∼20\%) remains at the Ge/insulator interface. To solve these problems, the thickness reduction of Sb films and introduction of a-Ge thin under-layers are examined. By annealing (450 °C) a-Ge (100 nm)/Sb (50 nm)/a-Ge (5 nm) tri-layer structures, layer-exchange crystallization of Ge layers on insulator without Ge evaporation or Sb residue has been achieved. This enables formation of n-type tensile-strained (∼0.3\%) Ge layers (free electron concentration: ∼5 × 10 17 cm −3 ). Moreover, crystal orientation control of grown Ge films through the introduction of the diffusion barrier is examined. These results demonstrate the possibility of layer-exchange crystallization induced by a group-V element to realize functional thin-film devices for advanced electronics and photonics.},

Here, the insulator-to-metal (ITM) and metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) hysteresis of the VO 2 thin film influence on the RF characteristics of the filters is analyzed from 25 °C and 120 °C in heating and cooling. The resonance frequency and maximum insertion loss (IL) stability and sensitivity with temperature variations are explored. It is noticed that increasing the temperature to 50 °C from 25 °C (or decreasing it to 50 °C from 120 °C) will result in a less than 1\% fractional frequency shift with respect to the off and on resonance frequencies. The sharp DC conductivity level variations of the VO 2 thin film around the transition temperatures translate into sharp effects on the resonance characteristics of the filters. On the contrary, the maximum IL levels are less sensitive to the sharp conductivity changes of DC films around the VO 2 transition temperature. A unique behavior is reported when successively heating-up and cooling-down, over and below, respectively, the transition temperature of VO 2 : the fabricated filter exhibits completely different resonance frequencies. This suggests that in the temperature dependence of the VO 2 RF design, the practical use of reconfigurable RF functions has to take into account the history of thermal effects and increase or decrease in the device temperature when crossing the IMT/MIT transition point.},

Here, we show the systematic investigation on mixed-halide perovskite films fabricated by the dry-wet hybrid deposition method on a PbBr 2 underlayer. The thermally deposited PbBr 2 underlayer is demonstrated to be beneficial for promoting reaction with an organic halide precursor solution, resulting in a dense morphology with large perovskite grains. Furthermore, the hybrid deposition method is also shown to be a straightforward way for wide-range bandgap tuning as it can facilitate halogen mixing.

However, surface states have slow time constants of (de)trapping electrons and delay electrical signal responses of the transistors, which prevent the ultralow latency. To clarify the mechanism of surface electron trapping (SET) of GaN-based transistors, which varies spatiotemporally, we studied the dynamics of the SET by using spatiotemporally resolved x-ray spectroscopy. We directly observed that neutralization of donor-like surface states occurs only near the gate edge in the drain side just after switching off the bias. We found that the large local electric field formed by the bias application induces site- and time-specificity in the SET, which leads to the delayed responses. Our proposed mechanism will be useful for optimizing the transistor structure to achieve the ultralow latency.},

Our model is a simple extension of an extensively used method proposed by Liu in which error propagation theory is applied to allow us to derive and reach the limits of precision and reproducibility in laser machining.

Here, we report the time-dependent resistance of a quasi-two-dimensional electron gas (Q2DEG) on a KTaO 3 substrate. Ar + -ion bombardment is used to achieve a Q2DEG of high density. Such a Q2DEG shows a linear increase in resistance with time without further physical stimulus. Both the resistance and its increase rate can be determined by the beam voltage of Ar + bombardment. Furthermore, we find that light illumination strongly influences the increase rate of resistance, with the effect depending primarily on the wavelength of incident light. The Hall effect reveals that this phenomenon can be attributed to the spontaneous decrease in carrier density over time due to the migration of oxygen vacancies.

  abstract     = {In high contrast to traditional geometric meta-surfaces, which can only operate on the cross-polarized field, we propose a bi-functional meta-device with full energy utilization in both co- and cross-polarized fields. In this paper, co-polarized refraction and cross-polarized focusing are integrated in one single meta-surface by taking advantage of compound propagation and geometric phases. A multi-layer element structure with various geometric degrees of freedom is designed to realize simultaneous and independent phase modulation of both co- and cross-polarized transmitted waves. The derived criterion is verified in the microwave region, and the proof-of-concept experiments indicate that the proposed meta-surface can have distinct functionalities with orthogonal polarizations in the transmitted field with a specific circularly polarized illumination. This scheme for bi-functional meta-surface construction provides an effective method to manipulate both co- and cross-polarized output fields simultaneously, which can extremely enhance the modulation efficiency of output energy. Different output wavefronts can be conveniently switched by filtering only the polarization state of the output end, simplifying the operational complexity of the bi-functional meta-system. This criterion paves the way for flexible manipulation of electromagnetic waves with a higher degree of freedom and facilitates a larger diversity of applications across the whole frequency spectrum.},

  abstract     = {We report the development of an efficient imprinting process for the formation of metal (Au) nanodot arrays using a square-patterned medium substrate. Solid-state dewetting is induced by differences in the surface energy of the metal film and the interface energy between the substrate and the metal film. Thus, uniform metal nanodot arrays were transferred to the desired substrate by controlling the interfacial surface free energy between the metal film and the substrate. Optical extinction measurements showed an intense extinction peak at 550 nm, corresponding to the simulated result. Imprinting of the Au-nanodot arrays on the substrate enhanced the light trapping function and supported the electrical properties of a polymer electrode. In addition, the combination of a transparent conducting oxide-free device with the Au-nanodot arrays and a polymer electrode resulted in enhanced performance. This can be attributed to the fact that the Au-nanodot arrays allowed higher charge extraction, as confirmed by electrical analyses. Finally, a next-generation approach of imprinting metal nanodot arrays was introduced through the controlled solid-state dewetting mechanism in a specific area, which can be applicable not only in the development of optoelectronic devices but also in semiconductor processes requiring metal nanostructures.},

The previous studies of near-field OAM are limited to generate only one single plasmonic vortex, which inevitably degrades further on-chip applications. Geometric metasurfaces, two-dimensional counterpart of metamaterials, enable the unprecedented capability in manipulating the phase, polarization, and amplitude of electromagnetic waves, providing a flexible platform in controlling plasmonic vortices. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an approach to realize the multiplexing of terahertz (THz) plasmonic vortices based on geometric metasurfaces. Under the illumination of circularly polarized THz waves, multiple plasmonic vortices with identical topological charges are generated at the metal/air interface. Furthermore, the conversion from spin angular momentum to multiple plasmonic OAM, i.e., multiple plasmonic vortices with different topological charges, is also demonstrated. Geometric metasurfaces consisting of paired air-slits with different in-plane orientations are designed to demonstrate these characteristics. Our proposed approach may open an avenue for on-chip applications with increasing information capacity.},

The large density of interface states in the graphene–GaAs junction is partly formed by oxidation in air of the GaAs surface. A graphene transfer presented herein reduces the arsenic species in the GaAs oxide and maintains the reduction over a span of at least one year. The photoluminescence and terahertz emission spectra show reduced surface trapping of photogenerated carriers in GaAs with graphene-capped oxide. These findings demonstrate a 2D material transfer that passivates a 3D semiconductor surface. A consequence of the passivation is observed by photoreflectance modulation spectroscopy of graphene covered semi-insulating GaAs. The built-in surface field is sufficiently screened by optically pumped carriers to reveal an enhanced excitonic absorption just below the GaAs bandgap. The absorption critical point anomalously red shifts by 4–6 meV from the bulk exciton characteristic energy, an effect we attribute to the exciton absorption occurring closer to the graphene–GaAs interface and influenced by the near-surface GaAs dielectric polarization.},

  abstract     = {Omnidirectional photoluminescence (ODPL) and standard photoluminescence (SPL) spectroscopy measurements were carried out on a freestanding GaN crystal at various temperatures ( T ) between 12 K and 300 K. The intensity ratio ( ρ ) of the ODPL to SPL spectra for the near-band edge (NBE) emission of the crystal showed a linearly decreasing slope with respect to photon energy ( E ) below the fundamental absorption edge energy ( E abs ), and the slope became steeper at lower T . The linear extrapolations of the slopes at various T converged at a common point ( E , ρ ) = (3.539 eV, −6.306). This fact implies that the slope obtained for ρ corresponds to the Urbach–Martienssen (U–M) tail of the optical absorption spectra. Numerical simulations under the assumption, where a part of photoluminescence traveled inside the crystal and the scattering occurred at a backside of the crystal, substantially reproduced the ODPL spectra. Accordingly, the origin of the two-peak structure in the ODPL spectra around the NBE emission of the GaN crystal is attributed to the existence of the U–M tail. The E abs value gives the photon energy at which the absorption coefficient becomes approximately 16.7 cm −1 , which corresponds to an inverse of a doubled value of the crystal thickness (0.03 cm).},

This nanocomposite was synthesized by using silica spheres as cores, adsorbing gradient alloy QDs (GA-QDs) as the first shell, and then coating a silica layer as the other outmost shell (termed SiO 2 -GA-QD-SiO 2 ). The retaining ratio of pristine fluorescence intensity after silica coating was found to be significantly improved by the QDs&#39; shell interfacial optimization due to the suppression of surface defects. The mechanism of the QDs&#39; surface trap states capturing the excitons before and after silica coating was analyzed in detail. The results show that the optimized SiO 2 -GA-QD-SiO 2 nanocomposite provides the highest resulting fluorescence intensity of 70\%, which is 62\% and 33\% higher than those of the other two conventional structures. Photoluminescent liquid crystal display backlight samples were prepared with this hybrid nanocomposite to show the robustness against high temperature and humid environment. Even when immersed in water and heated to 80 °C, the backlight samples still retained 85\% of the initial fluorescence, which was 40\% higher than that with bare GA-QDs. High fluorescence and long-term stability highlight the potential of using this nanocomposite in displays or lighting applications.},

This 3D photonic lumped LC resonator at the same time acts as the electrode of a BAW phonon resonator and allows the direct readout of coherent phonons via the linear piezoelectric response of the quartz. A microwave pump, ω p , is tuned to the cavity resonance ω 0 , while a probe frequency, ω probe , is detuned and varied around the red and blue detuned values with respect to the BAW phonon frequency, Ω m . The pump and probe power dependence of the generated phonons unequivocally determines the process to be electrostrictive, with the phonons produced at the difference frequency between the pump and the probe, with no back action effects involved. Thus, the phonons are created without threshold and can be considered analogous to a passive coherent population trapped maser scheme.},

  abstract     = {The systematic tunability of electrocatalytic activity is indispensable not only for realizing highly efficient catalysts but also for understanding the underlying mechanism of chemical reactions at the surface. Epitaxial strain is a powerful tool for tailoring various physical and chemical properties of perovskite transition metal oxides, including electrocatalytic activity. We present single-crystalline CaRuO 3 epitaxial thin films as a model system, in which the oxygen evolution reaction was systematically controlled by the epitaxial strain. With an increase in the degree of tensile strain, the interband transition energy and hybridization strength within the Ru–O bond decreased, which enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction. Our study facilitates the understanding of the correlation between the lattice/electronic structure and the electrocatalytic activity, which might be applied to other transition metal oxide catalysts.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the authors proposed a unique strategy to prepare a high performance Lithium–Sulfur (Li–S) battery cathode by an N-rich nano-graphene hollow sphere from the Prussian blue analog Co 3 [Co(CN) 6 ] 2 . The one-pot solution method with low cost materials was designed to synthesize the cathode by annealing with different temperatures and consistent HCl etching steps for the precursor. The Li–S batteries made by this precursor showed remarkable charge–discharge stability (570.4 mA h g −1 after 500 cycles at a 1 C current density) and outstanding rate performance (1145.5, 717.9, and 672.5 mA hg −1 at 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 Ag −1 current densities) at 800 °C. The results indicated that the stable three-dimensional multi-layer hollow sphere structure relieved the volume expansion of sulfur, which had a significant impact on the polysulfide adsorption, inhibiting the “shuttle effect.” Also, the rich doping of nitrogen in this structure produced many defects and active sites that improved the interfacial adsorption of polysulfides. While Co 3 [Co(CN) 6 ] 2 shows its potential as a cathode material, the material design method used in this paper provides a unique approach to realizing a high performance sulfur cathode for Li–S batteries.},

The magnetic flux density produced by frequency up-conversion mechanisms is calculated to derive the governing theoretical model for harvester performance prediction. The rotation speeds and inductive voltages of theoretical results show good agreement with the experimental results in a range of rotational speeds. A range of motion speed tests on a treadmill are performed to demonstrate the advantage of the stacked electromagnetic harvesters on harvested energy from human motion. The average output power improves from approximately 1.5 mW to 11.8 mW when motion speed increases from 4 km/h to 8 km/h.

These low temperature and passive devices have been shown to generate electricity at night with no active input of heat needed. Here, we optimize both the geometry and operating conditions of radiative cooling driven thermoelectric (RC-TE) generators. We determine the optimal operating conditions, including the maximum power point and maximum efficiency point, by developing a combined thermal and electrical model. Our results show that the optimal operating condition results in larger power output than was previously expected. Moreover, we show that maximum power density occurs when the area ratio between the cooler and P or N element reaches an optimal value and can be improved to nearly 2.2 times larger than what has been achieved with commercial TEGs. Finally, we perform a parametric study that takes account of environmental and structural parameters to improve the performance of the RC-TE device, including enhancing heat transfer between the hot surface and ambient air, suppressing the cooling loss of the radiative cooler, and optimizing the geometry of individual thermocouples. In summary, our work identifies how to maximize the output of RC-TE devices, providing universal guidance for this passive power generation method.},

In this paper, we investigate the magnetic-field control of NFRHT between two graphene-based hyperbolic metamaterials (GHMs). We find that the magnetic field significantly regulates the NFRHT between two GHMs via modifying the intrinsic hyperbolic modes. Specifically, the radiative heat transfer in the low-frequency range is remarkably suppressed for chemical potential of graphene of 0.05 eV accompanied by the splitting of the heat flux peak with the increase in the magnetic field intensity. We also analyze the magnetoresistance effect related to the heat flux, which reaches 78.23\% when H = 7 T. Moreover, we find that the effect of the magnetic field on the hyperbolic modes of GHMs is much stronger for lower chemical potentials. We look forward to the applications of our findings in dynamical thermal management at the nanoscale.},

Recently, intensive theories and experiments have predicted and demonstrated that such a cloaking device can be realized based on transformation optics and metamaterials, in fields of electromagnetics, optics acoustics, or even heat transfer. Metamaterials enable precise control over the propagation of waves due to their delicate micro-structures and spatially tailorable properties. However, a simple and natural way to achieve cloaking without a delicate micro-structure remains unattainable. Here, we report that an electromagnetic quasi-cloaking device can be readily achieved by a granular pile, formed by the falling-off and cumulation of particles on the object to be cloaked. We show that natural particle size segregation during the formation of the granular pile imparts the pile with a spatially variable filling ratio and resultant gradient-distributed permittivity, which enables the realization of the electromagnetic cloaking device. This work may open the possibility that a complicated electromagnetic device may be alternately achieved from manipulation of particle movement or arrangement.},

In addition to the high-sensitivity improvement, the measurement complexity is also considerably reduced compared to the previous amplitude ratio readout sensors. The sensitivity is adjustable by changing the parametric pumping amplitude. The experimental results show that the noise power spectral density is ∼230 ng/√Hz, which is the best reported noise floor for resonant accelerometers based on weakly coupled resonators.},

  abstract     = {We theoretically and experimentally investigate the application of an open-circuit voltage photodetector (VocP) architecture for mid-wave infrared (MWIR, 3–5 μ m) detection and imaging. In contrast to conventional reverse-bias (RB) operation of the diode, which generates a photocurrent that is proportional to the photon irradiance, we evaluate the potential of using unbiased diodes that generate an open-circuit voltage, V OC , under illumination. The predicted Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT) of a VocP is inferior to conventional RB when we assume an infinite well capacity and fixed integration time, but the prediction reverses when the actual well capacity of a readout integrated circuit (ROIC) is taken into account. Therefore, for a focal plane array (FPA) with a ROIC, we predict superior NEDT for the VocP. To demonstrate this concept, we fabricated and tested a basic VocP unit-cell architecture by connecting the V OC anode of a MWIR photodiode to the gate of an n-type metal-oxide semiconductor transistor that is operated in sub-threshold. Very good agreement is obtained between the analytical model and the observed drain current of the transistor over three orders of photon irradiance (10 15 –10 18 photons/sec-cm 2 ). The decoupling of the diode photocurrent from the integration capacitor in the circuit leads to a lower dark current that allows for longer integration times and improved sensitivity. This potentially can have a great impact on the performance and functionality of FPAs, leading to FPAs with better NEDT at a higher operating temperature, wider dynamic range, and smaller pixel size leading to larger array formats.},

Al 2 O 3 gate dielectrics are deposited at 120, 200, and 300 °C by an atomic layer deposition technique. For the H-diamond MOS capacitors with Al 2 O 3 deposited at 120, 200, and 300 °C, leakage current densities at an electric field of 3.0 MV cm −1 are 8.4 × 10 −4 , 7.1 × 10 −6 , and 7.5 × 10 −5 A cm −2 , respectively. A small decrease in the maximum capacitance of the Al 2 O 3 (120 °C)/H-diamond MOS capacitor is observed when the measurement frequency is increased from 1 kHz to 100 kHz. However, the maximum capacitances of the Al 2 O 3 (200 °C)/H-diamond and Al 2 O 3 (300 °C)/H-diamond MOS capacitors are stable. Experimental flatband voltage in the capacitance–voltage curve of the Al 2 O 3 (120 °C)/H-diamond MOS capacitor shifts to the left with respect to theoretical flatband voltage. However, they shift to the right for the Al 2 O 3 (200 °C)/H-diamond and Al 2 O 3 (300 °C)/H-diamond MOS capacitors. Therefore, when the deposition temperature of Al 2 O 3 is increased from 120 to 300 °C, polarity of the fixed charges in the H-diamond MOS capacitors changes from positive to negative. This phenomenon is explained by the variations of negatively charged acceptors at the Al 2 O 3 /H-diamond interface and oxygen vacancies in the Al 2 O 3 film.},

It is observed that such treatment not only condenses the mesoporous skeleton and improves film conductance of the carbon electrode but also makes the perovskite crystallites grow in the core part of the mesoporous skeleton. As such, the extraction process of photogenerated charge carriers is accelerated due to the strengthened interfacial contact between the perovskite crystallites and the skeleton. Accordingly, the photo-to-electric power conversion efficiency of the low-temperature devices is upgraded from 7.38 (±1.40)\% to 10.17 (±0.86)\% (optimized at 12.29\%, AM 1.5 G, 100 mW/cm 2 ). In addition, prolonged stability is observed. Due to the condensed device structure, storage stability of 225 days has been achieved in ambient air (with relative humidity of about 40–60\%), even without encapsulation.

The as-fabricated photodetector has the high responsivity of 0.169 A W −1 at zero bias and the specific detectivity of 6.6 × 10 11 Jones. When bias was applied, a responsivity of 6.81 A W −1 and a specific detectivity of 2.8 × 10 13 Jones have also been obtained. This work demonstrates that selenide van der Waals heterojunctions based on two-dimensional materials have great potential for future electronic and optoelectronic applications.},

Herein, the SnS 2 phase transition was observed on the atomic scale by in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. The 1T and 1H mixed phase was formed under in situ heating and electron beam irradiation. First principles calculations demonstrate that the phase transition between 1H and 1T occurs through multiple layers of phase transition rather than layer by layer. The bandgap of the mixed SnS 2 phase was found to be much smaller than the reported pure 1T phase. Our results provide microscopic insights into the transformation mechanism and highlight how heating and irradiation can be used to tune the electrical transport property of layered tin chalcogenides.},

This is challenging to obtain, not least due to ambient air exposure between fabrication steps, which induces surface oxidation. The geometric and electronic surface structures of In x Ga 1−x As NWs and contacts, which were grown directly in a planar configuration, exposed to air, and then subsequently cleaned using atomic hydrogen, are studied using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S). Atomically flat facets with a root mean square roughness of 0.12 nm and the InGaAs (001) 4 × 2 surface reconstruction are observed on the top facet of the NWs and the contacts. STS shows a surface bandgap variation of 30 meV from the middle to the end of the NWs, which is attributed to a compositional variation of the In/Ga element concentration. The well-defined facets and small bandgap variations found after area selective growth and atomic hydrogen cleaning are a good starting point for achieving high-quality interfaces during further processing.},

The film exhibits excellent crystal quality owing to the perfect lattice matching of both phases with the SrTiO 3 substrate, and very thin SRO nanopillars (∼5 nm) have been obtained. Because of the anisotropic nature of the SRO nanopillars, magnetic anisotropy has been obtained for the nanocomposite thin film, and the Curie temperature ( T c ) can be determined to be 152 K. Furthermore, switchable piezoelectric behavior of the nanocomposite film with a maximum d 33 value of ∼70 pm/V is obtained by the piezoelectric force microscopy measurement. Overall, the SRO-BTO nanocomposite system presents the desirable multiferroic response, which is promising for future magnetoelectric device integration.},

The method relies on the relationship between the magnetic field and frequency of the Kittel mode of a ferrimagnetic sphere, hybridized in the dispersive regime of the superconducting cavity. Results were used to experimentally determine the level of screening that a superconducting Nb cavity provides as it changes from perfect diamagnetism to no screening. Two cavity geometries were tested, a cylinder and single post re-entrant cavity. Both demonstrated a consistent value of field that enters the cavity, expected to be the superheating critical field. Hysteresis in the screened field during ramp up and ramp down of the external magnetic field due to trapped vortices was also observed. Some abnormal behavior was observed in the cylindrical cavity in the form of plateaus in the internal field above the first critical field, and we discuss the potential origin of this behavior. The measurement approach would be a useful diagnosis for axion dark matter searches, which plans on using superconducting materials but needs to know precisely the internal magnetic field.},

  abstract     = {Nanofabrication techniques with atomic level precision are needed for advancement to smaller technology nodes in the semiconductor industry. Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) is currently being developed to isotropically etch material for future applications. In this Letter, an alternative plasma-based ALE process for isotropic etching of Al 2 O 3 is introduced involving SF 6 plasma and trimethylaluminium [TMA, Al(CH 3 ) 3 ] pulses, providing higher etch rates and lower processing temperatures than conventional thermal ALE. This process illustrates that a fluorine-containing plasma can serve as a viable reactant for ALE and that plasmas—besides their conventional use in anisotropic ALE—can be employed for isotropic ALE. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements confirmed saturation of both SF 6 plasma and TMA half-cycles, which results in an etch per cycle (EPC) of 3.1 ± 0.1 Å at 260 °C. The isotropic nature of the plasma ALE process was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy analysis of Al 2 O 3 -coated 3D trench structures after performing ALE cycles. A mechanism of fluorination by F radicals and ligand exchange reactions involving TMA is proposed for this plasma ALE process based on observations from infrared spectroscopy, which are supported by reactant synergy analysis. This work establishes the benefits that a plasma can deliver for isotropic ALE.},

However, it is difficult to obtain high performances at low thermal budgets in SiGe layers, especially in n-type materials. Ag-induced layer exchange enables the synthesis of Si 1− x Ge x ( x : 0–0.3) layers at 500 °C and dynamically controls the Fermi level owing to the self-organizing manner of impurity doping during the layer exchange. Intrinsic, p-type (hole concentration &gt;10 19 cm −3 ), and highly n-type (electron concentration &gt;10 20 cm −3 ) SiGe layers are obtained using pure Ag, B-doped Ag, and As-doped Ag, respectively. Owing to the high carrier concentrations, the thermoelectric power factor at room temperature exhibits high values: 230 μ W m −1 K −2 for the p-type and 1000 μ W m −1 K −2 for the n-type. The latter value is the highest reported power factor at room temperature for SiGe formed below 1000 °C. The dimensionless figure of merit is determined to be 0.19 from the power factor and the thermal conductivity of 1.6 W m −1 K −1 . A thermoelectric generator fabricated with the low-temperature SiGe layers demonstrates a relatively large output for thin films (50 nm): 1.4 nW at room temperature with a temperature difference of 15 °C.},

However, little is known about ENG&#39;s defect properties; such knowledge is necessary to assess its potential for future use in high-efficiency devices. One indicator of a material&#39;s quality is its photogenerated carrier lifetime, which can be related to its bulk defect properties. Here, we use a combination of time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence to assess carrier dynamics in ENG thin films processed from nanoparticle precursors. The Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) lifetimes are on the multi-nanosecond scale, which exceed those reported in more mature systems and represent promising values for a candidate photovoltaic material. These results suggest that ENG is worthy of further research and development effort with an eye toward future photovoltaic applications.},

  abstract     = {Temperature-dependent effective mass in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures was experimentally observed via THz time domain spectroscopy of 2D plasmons in the range of 80–300 K. Grating couplers with different periods and filling factors were developed in order to monitor the behavior of plasma resonances in transmission spectra in the frequency range of 0.5–3.5 THz. For the grating with a 50\% filling factor, the fundamental modes were excited and observed at temperatures below 225 K. The change of the filling factor to 80\% led to the excitation of the fundamental and second order plasma harmonics observable up to 300 K and 220 K, respectively. Moreover, with an increase in temperature, the 2D plasmons experienced the red-shift in transmission power and phase spectra of all samples. This phenomenon was explained by the renormalization of effective mass, which started distinctly to deviate at 134 K temperature and at 295 K increased up to 55\% of its nominal value. The THz spectroscopy of 2D plasmons further confirms a temperature-dependent effective mass in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures as reported previously in optical Hall effect studies.},

A height of ∼0.7 nm, obvious charge transfer, and incommensurate charge fluctuations in 1T′-WTe 2 suggest strong coupling to the STO substrate. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy on the surface reveals that a large energy gap opens at the Fermi level with nearly zero conductance. The opened energy gap decreases with the increase in the WTe 2 island size. The lack of the metallic edge state on monolayer 1T′-WTe 2 /SrTiO 3 (001) indicates the absence of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) state. Our study here demonstrates that the energy gap of monolayer 1T′-WTe 2 can be tuned by lattice strain and illustrates the importance of interface coupling to realize the metallic edge state and QSH in monolayer 1T′-WTe 2 .},

Optical beating created by mixing two frequency-tunable CW lasers is focused on photoconductive switches to generate and detect high-frequency current in a THz circuit. In contrast to time-domain spectroscopy, our frequency-domain spectroscopy enables an unprecedented frequency resolution of 10 MHz without using the complex building blocks of femtosecond laser optics. Furthermore, due to the coherent nature of the photomixing technique, we are able to identify the origin of multiple reflections in the time domain using the Hilbert analysis and inverse Fourier transform. These results demonstrate that the advantages of on-chip coherent frequency-domain spectroscopy, such as its broadband, frequency resolution, usability, and time-domain accessibility, provide a unique capability for measuring ultrafast electron transport in integrated THz circuits.},

However, physics of optical trapping under ultra-short pulsed excitation has not been explored much. The nonlinear nature of optical trapping force/potential under ultra-short pulsed excitation was theoretically investigated, however, without any direct experimental demonstration and development of any generalized theory independent of the particle size. In this work, we present a methodology to numerically estimate trapping force/potential including optical as well as thermal nonlinearity under ultra-short pulsed excitation and implement a variety of detection modalities to capture the particle&#39;s real-time trajectories. We show how highly asymmetric nonlinear axial potential, created by a femtosecond pulse-train, can be mapped from the dynamics of the trapped particle.

  abstract     = {A coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a network of optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), in which the “strongest” collective mode of oscillation at well above threshold corresponds to an optimum solution of a given Ising problem. When a pump rate or network coupling rate is increased from below to above threshold, however, the eigenvectors with the smallest eigenvalue of the Ising coupling matrix [ J i j ] appear near threshold and impede the machine to relax to true ground states. Two complementary approaches to attack this problem are described here. One approach is to utilize the squeezed/anti-squeezed vacuum noise of OPOs below threshold to produce coherent spreading over numerous local minima via quantum noise correlation, which could enable the machine to access either true ground states or excited states with eigen-energies close enough to that of ground states above threshold. The other approach is to implement a real-time error correction feedback loop so that the machine migrates from one local minimum to another during an explorative search for ground states. Finally, a set of qualitative analogies connecting the CIM and traditional computer science techniques are pointed out. In particular, belief propagation and survey propagation used in combinatorial optimization are touched upon.},

Nevertheless, due to its simultaneous sensitivity to both electrostatic and magnetic fields, the interpretation of DPC measurements on magnetic specimens is not straightforward. In this work, we demonstrate that the two contributions to the Lorentz force can be separated by means of the time-reversal operation of the electron beam. In practice, such a condition is easily achieved by repeating the DPC-STEM measurement after flipping the specimen by 180°. The separation of the two contributions allows discriminating the effects of the electrostatic potential, like, e.g., the thickness variation in a specimen with a uniform composition, from the actual magnetic signal. This methodology is particularly relevant for the study of the magnetic nanostructure by DPC-STEM or, more generally, by 4D-STEM.},

The lifetime of the relevant ionic state is longer than that of the ZnO system by a factor of 6, leading to a mismatch in the temporal profiles of emitted photons. A detuned cavity-assisted Raman scheme weakly excites the donor with a shaped laser pulse to generate photons with a 0.99 temporal overlap to the Yb + emission and partially shift the emission of the defect toward the Yb + transition. The remaining photon shift is accomplished via the dc Stark effect.

  abstract     = {Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) has been widely studied in the fields of vibration control, building construction, and underwater vehicles. Recently, researchers began utilizing the VIV phenomenon for flow energy harvesting. Here, we describe that vortex shedding causes periodic rotational motions and explore these vortex-induced swing (VIS) motions for harvesting flow energy and measuring flow speed. An arc-bluff structure was constructed to enlarge the VIS motions, and a phenomenological model was developed using the Van der Pol equation. Swing characteristics when flow velocities were in the range of (0.15, 0.45) m/s were assessed. Experiments showed that the maximum swing amplitude of the device is 120°, and it converges to 80° as the water velocity increases. The frequency, amplitude, and initial angle curve of the VIS device can be used to represent the water speed vector. The proposed flowmeter showed a flow rate sensitivity of 7∼10 Hz/(m·s −1 ) in the experimental range. Energy harvester prototypes demonstrated a peak-peak output of 3.28 V in water with a velocity of 0.45 m/s.

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider the possibility of energy storage enhancement in electrostatic capacitors using the compensational method. The essence of the proposed approach is the use of inductive voltage V ind to partially compensate the electrostatic voltage q / C produced by the electric charges on the capacitor plates. We hypothesize that it may be possible to increase the amount of charge stored on the plates before the breakdown and increase the energy stored in the capacitor using the compensational inductive voltage. There are several possible scenarios of manipulating the inductive voltage to increase the amount of energy released via the discharge. We also consider several electro-magnetic capacitors for practical utilization. Potentially, the energy per volume stored in a simple parallel plate capacitor may exceed that of gasoline. The physical limits and technological shortcomings of the proposed approach are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Interactions among various film growth parameters, such as the substrate temperature ( T sub ), film thickness ( d ), and composition, play a crucial role in controlling the type and density of the intrinsic point defects. In turn, the point defects modulate and control electronic transport properties of Bi 2 Te 3 films. We have grown n-type Bi 2 Te 3 films with different d by molecular beam epitaxy at different T sub . The formation of point defects was analyzed by a combined use of angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) and electronic transport measurements. Two important findings were made: (i) the negatively charged vacancies, V Te · · ⁠ , initially the dominant intrinsic defects, transform gradually during the growth process into positively charged anti-site defects, B i Te ′ ⁠ , driven by thermal annealing from a continuously heated substrate; and (ii) from the film&#39;s surface into the inner strata of the film, the density of V Te · · decreases while the density of B i Te ′ increases, leading to a gradient of vacancies and anti-site defects along the film growth direction. As a result, the electron density in Bi 2 Te 3 films decreases monotonically with increasing d . Moreover, elevating T sub leads to a more significant in situ annealing effect and an eventual onset of intrinsic excitations that deteriorates electronic transport properties. The thinnest Bi 2 Te 3 film (16 nm) grown at T sub = 245 °C has the highest electron concentration of 2.03 × 10 20 cm −3 and also the maximum room temperature power factor of 1.6 mW m −1 K −2 of all grown epitaxial films. The new insights regarding the defect formation and transformation pave the way for further optimization of electronic transport properties of n-type Bi 2 Te 3 -based films.},

These narrow lines appear as peaks at multiples of modulation frequency in the double modulation spectrum. It is shown that the respective line shape can be fitted assuming two Lorentzian line shapes. The linewidth of the narrower Lorentzian is comparable with the linewidth of the Lorentzian obtained from the T 2 relaxation time δ 1 = 1 / π T 2 estimated from the Hahn echo pulsed-EPR experiment. The broader component δ 2 correlates with the T 2 * relaxation time obtained from the free induction decay measurement of the inhomogeneous spectral line shape of the P1 center. The ratio δ 2 / δ 1 ∼ 18 derived from DM-EPR measurements approaches within the experimental error the value T 2 / T 2 * ∼ 16 derived from pulsed-EPR. Sensitivity to the small shift of the magnetic field ( ⁠ ∼ 0.6 μ T) was shown to be detectable from the broadening behavior of the δ 2 component. The results promote DM-EPR as a method complementary to pulsed-EPR for studying coherence times of low density paramagnetic centers in a diamond lattice like nitrogen-vacancy (NV − ) center, since it exhibits similar properties to the here investigated P1 center in terms of long relaxation time at a monitored low concentration.},

The FCC crystallite size greatly reduced from 6.5 to 3.5–3.8 nm after codoping. In particular, the resistivity of FCC C–N codoped Sb 2 Te 3 was about two orders of magnitude higher than that of Sb 2 Te 3 . The effect of the property of the chalcogenide on the writing current of the phase-change device was analyzed by the finite element method.

  abstract     = {Ultra-wide bandgap β-gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ) devices are of considerable interest with potential applications in both power electronics and radio frequency devices. However, current Ga 2 O 3 device technologies are limited by the material&#39;s low intrinsic electron mobility and thermal conductivity. The former problem can be addressed by employing modulation-doped β-(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 heterostructures in the device architecture. In this work, (Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 modulation-doped field effect transistors (MODFETs) have been investigated from a thermal perspective. Thermoreflectance thermal imaging was used to characterize the self-heating of the MODFETs. The (Al 0.18 Ga 0.82 ) 2 O 3 thermal conductivity (3.1–3.6 W/mK) was determined using a frequency domain thermoreflectance technique. Electro-thermal modeling was used to discern the effect of design parameters such as substrate orientation and channel length on the device self-heating behavior. Various thermal management schemes were evaluated using the electro-thermal device model. From an electro-thermal co-design perspective, the improvement in electrical performance followed by the mitigation of self-heating was also studied. For example, by employing a Ga 2 O 3 -on-SiC composite wafer, which was fabricated in this work, a 50\% increase in power handling capability can be achieved as compared to a homoepitaxial device. Furthermore, flip-chip heterointegration and double-sided cooling approaches can lead to more than 2× improvement in the power handling capability. Using an augmented double-sided cooling design that includes nanocrystalline diamond passivation, a 5× improvement in the power handling capability can be accomplished, indicating the potential of the technology upon implementation of a suitable thermal management scheme.},

  abstract     = {High performance organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs), especially those under current injection, have been sought for decades due to their potentially great applications in fields such as spectroscopy, displays, medical devices, and optical interconnection. The design and fabrication of high-quality resonators is a prerequisite for high performance OSLs. In the case of planar microcavities, the fabrication process of top distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) usually requires electron beam evaporation or manual lamination on top of organic thin-film layers, which can lead to issues including degradation of the organic materials, large-scale non-uniformity, and difficulties for current injection. Here, we report a non-destructive way of fabricating a top DBR by thermal evaporation. The top DBR based on thermally evaporated alternative TeO x /LiF stacks shows low morphological roughness, high process tolerance, and high reflectivity. Moreover, the deposition process causes negligible damage to the organic thin-film layers underneath. With the combination of a conventional e-beam evaporated bottom DBR, a high performance planar microcavity OSL with a low threshold of 1.7 μ J cm −2 , an emission linewidth of 0.24 nm, and an angular divergence of &lt;3° has been achieved under nitrogen laser pumping. Similar performance, with a high Gaussian beam quality comparable with that of an ideal diffraction-limited beam, was also obtained under diode pumping, showing the potential of this technique for building compact and cost-effective organic lasers with good beam quality. Our result will open a promising route for future high performance microcavity optoelectronic devices, especially for laser devices under current injection.},

  abstract     = {In heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), a laser is employed above the read-write transducer to provide energy to the media, lowering its coercivity. However, the laser also brings thermal energy diffusion inside the slider and induces an extra angstrom-level protrusion, which we call laser-induced protrusion (LIP). The LIP needs to be taken into consideration in HAMR due to the significance of head-media spacing. This paper focuses on laser heating on the millisecond timescale during flying in the HAMR conditions. When the laser is turned ON for milliseconds, the LIP forms in the short term ( ⁠ ∼ μ s) and fly height change (FHC) happens in the long term (∼ ms) due to the crown/camber change, resulting in a smaller touchdown power (TDP). Thus, the touchdown power change (ΔTDP) is measured and the LIP is isolated using the time constants. A component-level HAMR stage is used to study the effects of laser-on time, laser current, and linear velocity on the ΔTDP. The experimental results show that the FHC needs ∼ 28 ms to reach the steady state and that the protrusion size presents a two-stage linear relation with the laser current separated by a threshold. The LIP size is reduced by about half when operating from 12 m/s to 24 m/s.},

Significantly, the moiré excitons, induced by a moiré superlattice in a twisted heterostructure, have triggered tremendous attention, demonstrating the practicability of artificial excitonic crystals. Besides, recent works have shown that the excitonic states in homostructures also exhibit novel properties worthy of further development. Here, we present a tear-and-stack technique for fabricating a regular or a twisted homostructure. Such a strategy was utilized to reassemble a monolayer WSe 2 into a twisted homostructure, and various excitons from this structure have been identified in the photoluminescence spectra. Interestingly, the unusual equidistant splitting was first observed in the defect-bound excitons. It is believed that this phenomenon is attributed to the various defect states and the local stacking patterns. This interpretation is supported by theoretical calculations, which show the dependence of the energy band structure on different defect states and local stacking patterns. These unconventional defect-bound excitons are key building blocks in the research of homostructures that highlight the feasibility of artificially manipulating local excitons for practical applications.},

Structure evolution of these hierarchical nanoripples was further discussed based on the geometry and thickness of MoS 2 flakes, and we attributed the curtain effect at the limit of a single atomic layer.

  abstract     = {This study demonstrates a low-temperature Ohmic contact to WSe 2 using a van der Waals (vdW) junction between highly p-doped MoS 2 (p + -MoS 2 ) and WSe 2 . p + -MoS 2 exhibits a large work function comparable to that of a well-known metal such as Pt. Owing to its layered crystal structure, p + -MoS 2 can easily be exfoliated to obtain atomically flat, freshly cleaved surfaces. Moreover, it is stable in air; therefore, this material can be used as an efficient hole-injection contact to a transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductor like WSe 2 . An h -BN encapsulated WSe 2 field effect transistor (FET) was fabricated, having electrical contacts in the form of two flakes of exfoliated p + -MoS 2 . The fabricated FET demonstrated Ohmic contact behavior under hole doping between room temperature (295 K) and liquid helium temperature (4.2 K). Further, owing to the low contact resistance of the p + -MoS 2 /p-WSe 2 junction, metal-to-insulator transition of WSe 2 was observed upon hole doping, as well as quantum oscillation under the application of a magnetic field. On the basis of the Arrhenius plot, a potential barrier height of ∼41 meV at the p + -MoS 2 /p-WSe 2 junction was determined; we infer that this value is limited by the carrier depletion region of p + -MoS 2 at the junction. Overall, this appears to indicate potential high performance of the p + -MoS 2 /WSe 2 vdW Ohmic contact.},

  abstract     = {The recent discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO 2 has revived the interest into non-volatile memories based on ferroelectric transistors (FeFETs). The key advantages of these FeFETs include the low power consumption and the compatibility with the existing CMOS process. On the other hand, issues related mainly to endurance still represent a challenge to the development of the technology. In this Letter, we propose to exploit an analytical expression for the Memory Window (MW) as a simple yet effective characterization tool to evaluate the endurance of FeFETs. The MW is defined as the difference between threshold voltages occurring due to polarization switching. The analytical formulation of the MW allows one to quickly estimate the generated trap concentration as a function of number of writing cycles (or time) without recurring to numerical simulations. With the aid of the analytical model, we find that for typical program/erase pulse amplitudes and duration, endurance has a weak dependence on writing conditions. The characterization technique based on the MW would allow the systematic comparison of the performance and endurance of next-generation FeFETs.},

In this work, we demonstrate quantitative prediction of the threshold microwave-field needed for initiating nonlinear behavior in the presence of a secondary microwave frequency. This would allow the in situ control of non-linearity and, hence, prove to be useful for a wide range of applications, especially those involving microwave devices. The fine structures, appearing in the threshold-field upon variation in the frequency of the secondary frequency, have been demonstrated using simulations and explained analytically. The impact of the magnon phase relative to the pump is also quantitatively determined.},

The microwave excitation and detection technique with two coplanar waveguide antenna arrangements on the Y 3 Fe 5 O 12 (YIG) surface is used to characterize the SW. An additional platinum (Pt) stripe connected to a current source is integrated between the coplanar waveguide pair to demonstrate the SW resonant frequency and amplitude modulation by current induction. We selected a Pt stripe due to its significantly lower spin wave absorption property. The application of current through the Pt stripe generates local joule heating that modifies the magnetic properties of the YIG film. Temperature variation through local heating modifies the saturation magnetization of the YIG film, which, in turn, modulates the SW frequency. Moreover, the amplitude of the SW spectra is found to be tuned by the current amplitude. This phenomenon is mainly described by magnon–magnon scattering induced by the spin Seebeck effect in the case of local heating. Furthermore, the group velocity of the proposed device is also found to be responsive to the current, which has been explained by both magnon–magnon and magnon-phonon scattering.},

  abstract     = {Normally-off AlGaN channel heterostructure field effect transistors (HFETs) have been proposed and investigated numerically by taking advantage of the polarization engineering perspective in III-nitrides. The utilization of polarization-matched InAlN/AlGaN heterostructures shifted the threshold voltage to approximately 1.1 V for an Al 0.3 Ga 0.7 N channel HFET. Compared to the AlGaN/GaN HFEF with a low breakdown voltage, the normally-off InAlN/AlGaN HFETs show substantially enhanced breakdown characteristics. Besides, the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) mobility in the InAlN/AlGaN HFETs exhibits much less reduction with the increasing temperature than that in the AlGaN/GaN HFET, according to the calculation of electron mobility dominated by alloy disorder scattering and polar optical phonon scattering. As a result, the temperature dependences of the power figures of merit based on the conduction loss consideration in terms of 2DEG mobility variation and Johnson figure of merit show superior potential for polarization-matched InAlN/AlGaN HFETs in high-power and high-frequency electronics applications particularly operating at elevated temperatures. This work provides a useful way for demonstration of normally-off AlGaN channel HFETs and is also helpful for design of future devices, which can be beneficially exploited from polarized III-nitride heterostructures.},

The most prominent extra Raman peak at 255 cm −1 is an asymmetrically broadened one. It is due to single-particle, electronic excitations involving the impurity band formed by effective-mass-like (hydrogenic) shallow donors. A similar type of excitation is attributed to a Raman line at 675 cm −1 that appears below room temperature in Si doped samples and might be due to a non-hydrogenic donor. Furthermore, we observe four longitudinal phonon-plasmon coupled modes at 215 cm −1 , 280 cm −1 , 400 cm −1 , and 560 cm −1 associated with infrared active phonon modes.

These results are associated with the spatial separation of photoexcited electrons and holes enabled by the thin oxide layer, where electrons and holes accumulate in graphene and the GeSn film, respectively. This spatial separation of negative and positive charges generates a mutual gating that increases the number of carriers in both layers, yielding the amplification observed in the measurement. A quantitative method based on an equivalent circuit model is provided, and the numerical results agree well with the experimental data.

In this work, an interatomic potential is developed for β -Ga 2 O 3 based on a deep neural network model to predict the thermal conductivity and phonon transport properties. Our potential is trained by the ab initio energy surface and atomic forces, which reproduces phonon dispersion in good agreement with first-principles calculations. We are able to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the anisotropic thermal conductivity of β -Ga 2 O 3 with this potential, and the calculated thermal conductivity values agree well with experimental results from 200 to 500 K. Green–Kubo modal analysis is performed to quantify the contributions of different phonon modes to the thermal transport, showing that optical phonon modes play a critical role in the thermal transport. This work provides a high-fidelity machine learning-based potential for MD simulation of β -Ga 2 O 3 and serves as a good example of exploring thermal transport physics of complex semiconductor materials.},

  abstract     = {Ion implantation-induced effects were studied in Ge implanted β-Ga 2 O 3 with the fluence and energy of 3 × 10 13 cm −2 /60 keV, 5 × 10 13 cm −2 /100 keV, and 7 × 10 13 cm −2 /200 keV using analytical electron microscopy via scanning/transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and precession electron diffraction via TopSpin. Imaging shows an isolated band of damage after Ge implantation, which extends ∼130 nm from the sample surface and corresponds to the projected range of the ions. Electron diffraction demonstrates that the entirety of the damage band is the κ phase, indicating an implantation-induced phase transition from β to κ-Ga 2 O 3 . Post-implantation annealing at 1150 °C for 60 s under the O 2 atmosphere led to a back transformation of κ to β; however, an ∼17 nm damage zone remained at the sample surface. Despite the back transformation from κ to β with annealing, O K-edge spectra show changes in the fine structure between the pristine, implanted, and implanted-annealed samples, and topspin strain analysis shows a change in strain between the two samples. These data indicate differences in the electronic/chemical structure, where the change of the oxygen environment extended beyond the implantation zone (∼130 nm) due to the diffusion of Ge into the bulk material, which, in turn, causes a tensile strain of 0.5\%. This work provides a foundation for understanding of the effects of ion implantation on defect/phase evolution in β-Ga 2 O 3 and the related recovery mechanism, opening a window toward building a reliable device for targeted applications.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic impedance regulation of a neck embedded Helmholtz resonator is realized by introducing surface roughness to the neck so as to convert the initially non-perfect sound absorber to a perfect sound absorber. The proposed roughened-neck embedded Helmholtz resonator (R-NEHR) achieves perfect sound absorption ( ⁠ α &gt; 0.999 ⁠ ) at 158 Hz across a deep subwavelength thickness of λ / 42 ⁠ . Theoretical predictions of the R-NEHR&#39;s performance are validated against experimental measurements. Physically, surface roughness triggers the periodic concentration effect of fluid vibration in the neck, thereby improving its acoustic mass and acoustic resistance and altering the resonant damping state of the absorber. As a result, the absorption peak position of the R-NEHR shifts by 16.0\% to lower frequency, together with a peak value increase of 19.6\%. This work provides an approach for perfect sound absorber design and impedance regulation of acoustic metamaterials.},

The topological boundary states can be found at the interfaces, including the zero-dimensional corner state, 1D hinge state, and 2D surface state. The fabricated sample with the bent two-dimensional and one-dimensional acoustic channels exhibits the multidimensional sound propagation and verifies the mode transition among the complete bandgap, hinge mode, and surface mode. The bandwidth of the single-mode hinge state achieves a large relative bandwidth of 9.1\% in which sound transports one-dimensionally without significant leak into the surfaces or the bulk. The higher-order topological states in the study pave the way for sound manipulation in multiple dimensions.},

  abstract     = {This Letter introduces a strategy for transition wave (soliton) management in multi-stable mechanical metamaterials, enabling on-demand, post-fabrication control of the associated phase transformation kinetics and distribution. Specifically, the wave dynamics are controlled by a small, kinematically prescribed spatiotemporal variation in the elastic potential, constituting a driving force. The stability of the wave profile under slow-propagation conditions and the characteristic spatial localization of the Hamiltonian energy support an analogy with a Newtonian particle traversing a viscous medium under forcing. The theoretical analysis adopts this particle perspective, describing the soliton dynamics through ordinary, rather than partial, differential equations. While myriads of definitions for the potential modulation are possible, a traveling sinusoid assists the development of analytical solutions. Following this prescription, two wave propagation regimes are revealed: in one, the soliton is carried by the modulation with a commensurate velocity; in the other, the soliton is out-paced by the modulation and, thus, travels at reduced velocity. To illustrate the utility of this method, we demonstrate both the tractor and repulsor effects in multi-stable systems away from equilibrium: as a tractor (repulsor), the potential variation attracts (repels) the transition wave front in opposition to the system&#39;s energy-minimizing tendency. This method provides greater flexibility to the transformation performance of multi-stable metamaterials and supports the adoption of such systems in applications demanding multi-functionality.},

With the increasing thickness of the buffer layer, the LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interfaces exhibit the metal-to-insulator transition. More importantly, we also observe a substantial enhancement in the photoresponse under a 360 nm light irradiation and the relative change in the resistance of heterointerfaces is enhanced from 6.8\% (without a buffer layer) to 50 139\% (with a 1.6 u.c. buffer layer) at 300 K. Moreover, the heterointerfaces exhibit a state of change from persistent to transient photoconductivity.

  abstract     = {Intrinsic Si(111) surfaces passivated with atomic hydrogen are an ideal platform to host two-dimensional electron systems. Traditional methods to probe these surfaces, however, typically involve the placement of dopants and metals directly onto the surface and subsequent high temperature processing, which can be harsh and invasive and lead to surface degradation. Here, we detail a non-invasive gating approach for probing two-dimensional electron systems on intrinsic H-Si(111) surfaces using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) gating assembly. In this architecture, all harsh device fabrication is performed on a single SOI chip, ensuring that the H-Si(111) surface remains in pristine condition, or as close to the original manufactured intrinsic-Si wafer as possible. To achieve this, we intentionally keep our H-Si(111) surfaces free of any dopants or metals, which are instead placed on the adjacent SOI chip. All electrical components, including Ohmic contacts and accumulation and depletion gates, are housed in the SOI piece. The Ohmic contacts on the SOI piece are brought into physical and electrical contact with the pristine H-Si(111) piece after being van der Waals bonded at room temperature, while all gates on the SOI piece are separated from the H-Si(111) surface by vacuum. Architecture details, baseline operation tests, and 77 K device characterization measurements will be discussed, as well as the implications of going beyond H-Si(111) surfaces and using our device architecture to facilitate transport measurements on halogen-terminated Si surfaces.},

Here, we report the droplet impact dynamics on a moving superhydrophobic surface. We show that compared to the stationary surface, the moving superhydrophobic surface breaks the symmetry in both droplet spreading and retracting. Specifically, the shear force exerted by the moving surface acting on the impact droplet enlarges the maximum spreading in the moving direction, and thus, the droplet contact time is reduced. The contact time of impact droplets was examined thoroughly under the effects of the droplet impact (normal) and the wall moving (tangential) Weber numbers. We provide a scaling analysis to explain how the contact time depends on the normal and tangential Weber numbers. Our experimental investigation and theoretical analysis provide insight into the droplet impact dynamics on moving superhydrophobic surfaces.},

However, such oxygen control by the growth pressure is challenging to synthesize for some oxide films, which requires a subtle control of the oxygen content. A parameter of controlling the oxygen content independent of the growth pressure is desired. Here, we propose a method of controlling the oxygen content of films by engineering the substrate before the growth. The oxide substrate serves as an oxygen sponge, which provides a tunable oxygen environment ranging from oxygen-rich to oxygen-poor for the film growth, depending on the pre-substrate annealing (PSA) conditions. Using manganite as a model system, we demonstrate that this simple PSA method leads to remarkable changes in the structure and physical properties of the as-grown films. This substrate oxygen sponge effect, driven by the large oxygen concentration gradient at high temperatures, can be applied to explore not only emergent interfacial phenomena but also the growth of a variety of functional oxide thin films and nanocomposites.},

These SWMs are formed due to the scattering from the gold nanoparticles attached to the WGM. Monitoring the WGM linewidth provides a robust method for sensing single molecules over prolonged time periods as the linewidth is unaffected by changes in the host refractive index due to drifts in temperature, pressure, or change in the concentration of buffers.},

Tube-shaped mirrors with a large numerical aperture and high demagnification, including ellipsoidal mirrors and Wolter mirrors, have recently been developed for soft x-ray nanofocusing. However, these mirrors have low efficiency because they cannot focus the central part of the illumination beam. Here, we propose a two-stage focusing system, in which a ring-shaped beam formed by a ring-focusing mirror illuminates a quasi-Wolter mirror. A prototype of the system is experimentally constructed at beamline BL25SU-A of SPring-8. Observation of the wavefront error based on ptychography enables efficient alignment of the two mirrors.

Cross-relaxation between two Nd 3+ ions ( 4 F 3/2 , 4 I 9/2 ) → ( 4 I 15/2 , 4 I 15/2 ) with subsequent phonon emission leads to two ions at the 4 I 11/2 level, with every iteration triggering a photon-avalanche-like emission, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the UC emissions. Ladder thermal excitation 4 F 3/2 → ( 4 F 5/2 , 2 H 9/2 ) → ( 4 F 7/2 , 4 S 3/2 ) → 4 F 9/2 was achieved, and the ground-state relaxation from these levels provided emission at 880 nm, 810 nm, 750 nm, and 690 nm, respectively. Energy transfer UC (Auger) between Nd 3+ ions at the 4 F 3/2 level allowed the population of ( 2 G 3/2 , 4 G 7/2 ) from which relaxations to the 4 I 9/2 , 4 I 11/2 , and 4 I 13/2 states provided emissions around 536 nm, 600 nm, and 660 nm, respectively. Associated with the nonradiative relaxations, we observed the heating of the nanoparticles (22 °C–240 °C) with subsequent thermal enhancement of the frequency UC emissions due to population redistribution between the coupled energy levels of the Nd 3+ ions. The present results have potential applications in super-resolution imaging and nanothermometry.},

We demonstrate this approach for a fiber-tip sensor consisting of a photonic crystal (PhC) structure in a semiconductor membrane on the cleaved facet of a telecom fiber. The PhC structure is fabricated on a wafer by lithography and etching and then transferred to the fiber facet by a simple mechanical pickup process through an opening in the substrate, without the need for adhesives or a micromanipulator. Due to its reliability, scalability, and the use of wafer-scale fabrication methods, this process increases the possibilities for fiber-tip applications at the industrial level. With the fabricated fiber tip sensors, we demonstrate sensing of the refractive index and temperature, with resonance wavelength shifts of 120 nm/RIU and 95 pm/K, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) are a perfectly tuned quantum-mechanical machinery in which counterpropagating and oppositely spin-polarized conduction channels balance each other on the surface of the material. This topological surface state crosses the bandgap of the TI and lives at the interface between the topological and a trivial material, such as vacuum. Despite its balanced perfection, it is rather useless for any practical applications. Instead, it takes the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and the appearance of an exchange gap to unlock hidden quantum states. The quantum anomalous Hall effect, which has first been observed in Cr-doped (Sb,Bi) 2 Te 3 , is an example of such a state in which two edge channels are formed at zero field, crossing the magnetic exchange gap. The breaking of TRS can be achieved by magnetic doping of the TI with transition metal or rare earth ions, modulation doping to keep the electronically active channel impurity free, or proximity coupling to a magnetically ordered layer or substrate in heterostructures or superlattices. We review the challenges these approaches are facing in the famous 3D TI (Sb,Bi) 2 (Se,Te) 3 family and try to answer the question whether these materials can live up to the hype surrounding them.},

This technique, dark field proton radiography, provides two additional capabilities to a standard proton radiography setup. First, protons with a high degree of angular dispersion are removed from the beam, reducing the effects of chromatic aberrations and decreasing noise. Second, protons below the same threshold are removed from the beam downstream of the objects, effectively making the transmission highly sensitive to small amounts of scatter at the object plane. Initial results indicate that the system is highly sensitive to the presence of thinner materials and improves sensitivity to subtle areal density variations in thick objects.},

Moreover, an interesting “layering phenomenon” was discovered in the spaces where particles concentrated. Variations in the concentration of particles of different sizes were measured in the sump. A higher voltage and a larger particle size were found to be associated with a faster decrease in the particle concentration. Based on a coupled model of the electric field and the force field, the different forces acting on particles of different sizes were analyzed. Particles of different sizes were observed to reunite into a spindle shape in the calculation space, with large particles playing a leading role. According to the calculation results, the particles around the conductor will settle and reunite, and the gathering of particles accelerates the settlement.},

Demultiplexing via on-chip circuitry offers an effective strategy to overcome this bottleneck. In the case of gate-defined quantum dot arrays, specific static voltages need to be applied to many gates simultaneously to realize electron confinement. When a charge-locking structure is placed between the quantum device and the demultiplexer, the voltage can be maintained locally. In this study, we implement a switched-capacitor circuit for charge-locking and use it to float the plunger gate of a single quantum dot. Parallel plate capacitors, transistors, and quantum dot devices are monolithically fabricated on a Si/SiGe-based substrate to avoid complex off-chip routing. We experimentally study the effects of the capacitor and transistor size on the voltage accuracy of the floating node. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the electrochemical potential of the quantum dot can follow a 100 Hz pulse signal while the dot is partially floating, which is essential for applying this strategy in qubit experiments.},

Specifically, the capability of cavity magnon polaritons of converting magnetic excitations to electromagnetic ones allows for translating to magnetism the quantum-limited sensitivity achieved by state-of-the-art microwave detectors.

EXAFS analysis revealed that Sb substituted Si and that the nearest neighbor distance expanded around Sb. Furthermore, HAXPES confirmed the formation of density of states near the Fermi level by co-doping with 0.5\% Zn and 0.5\% Sb. The comparison of the experimental and theoretical results suggested that the density of states at the Fermi level was due to the tail of the conduction band, and it was filled by the electrons provided by doped Sb.

  abstract     = {Cell death mediated by non-thermal mechanisms is an essential characteristic of irreversible electroporation for tumor ablation. However, needle electrodes inherently promote thermal damage immediately adjacent to the electrode/tissue interface, especially in cases when intensive pulsed electric fields are applied to get a large ablation. In this study, we propose utilization of endothermic reactions in the core of clinically used needle electrodes to absorb the heat generated during electroporation, thereby accentuating the nonthermal aspect of irreversible electroporation. In this study, numerical models were developed to determine temperature profiles resulting from a typical irreversible electroporation (IRE) protocol in clinic using either conventional solid electrodes or hollow electrodes filled with NH 4 NO 3 to facilitate an endothermic reaction in the electrode core. The results indicate that the endothermic electrodes can reduce the temperature rise and thermal damage during IRE treatment.},

  abstract     = {Piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity in biological tissues, which originate from oriented fibrous proteins with a polar axis, have long been suggested to play important roles in physiological functions. The possible manipulation of their polarity by external mechanisms, however, remains unsettled. We revisit this problem here using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) as the tool and the intima layer of murine artery as a model system. By carefully examining first and second harmonic piezoresponses at both selected points and through spatial mapping, we establish that electromechanical coupling probed by PFM is predominantly piezoelectric in the intima layer, while the quadratic effect makes only minor contributions. More importantly, we observe competition between the linear and quadratic effects after removal of DC biases applied to the sample surface, revealing not only interesting relaxation dynamics, but also highly asymmetric piezoresponse. Positive DC rotates dipoles in tropoelastin monomers away with reduced alignment, while negative DC aligns dipoles more leading to enhanced piezoresponse. The electric manipulation of biological polarity is thus demonstrated, with the relaxation time constant determined on the order of 0.1 s, much slower than classical ferroelectrics.},

Here, we investigate transport in a two-terminal diamond device comprising a conductive channel defined by a hydrogen-terminated diamond surface, bridging two TiC contacts. The surface charge distribution was imaged by monitoring the photoluminescence of nitrogen vacancy centers incorporated below the active device layer. A strong charge accumulation near the TiC contact/H-terminated channel interface is observed and is discussed in terms of deviation from Ohmic behavior evident in the DC electrical measurements. Small voltage steps applied to the device result in current transients due to carrier trapping at the contact/diamond interface. This gives rise to dynamic negative capacitance at low AC frequencies and is discussed in detail.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a tri-gate GaN junction high-electron-mobility transistor (JHEMT) concept in which the p–n junction wraps around the AlGaN/GaN fins in the gate region. This tri-gate JHEMT differs from all existing GaN FinFETs and tri-gate HEMTs, as they employ a Schottky or a metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) gate stack. A tri-gate GaN JHEMT is fabricated using p-type NiO with the gate metal forming an Ohmic contact to NiO. The device shows minimal hysteresis and a subthreshold slope of 63 ± 2 mV/decade with an on-off current ratio of 10 8 . Compared to the tri-gate MISHEMTs fabricated on the same wafer, the tri-gate JHEMTs exhibit higher threshold voltage ( V TH ) and achieve positive V TH without the need for additional AlGaN recess. In addition, this tri-gate JHEMT with a fin width of 60 nm achieves a breakdown voltage ( BV ) &gt; 1500 V (defined at the drain current of 1 μ A/mm at zero gate bias) and maintains the high BV with the fin length scaled down to 200 nm. In comparison, the tri-gate MISHEMTs with narrower and longer fins show punch-through at high voltages. Moreover, when compared to planar enhancement mode HEMTs, tri-gate JHEMTs show significantly lower channel sheet resistance in the gate region. These results illustrate a stronger channel depletion and electrostatic control in the junction tri-gate compared to the MIS tri-gate and suggest great promise of the tri-gate GaN JHEMTs for both high-voltage power and low-voltage power/digital applications.},

  abstract     = {Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) with large normal (vertical) surface displacement at the surface are commonly utilized in microfluidic actuators in order to provide the desired momentum transfer to the fluid. We present an alternative concept using a SAW with comparatively small vertical displacement. Such a SAW passes underneath the microfluidic vessel walls with minimum losses but it needs to be converted inside the vessel into surface vibrations with large vertical displacements. The principal operability of the above idea is illustrated by experimental and numerical studies of the polarization conversion of a leaky SAW on 64° rotated Y-cut of lithium niobate owing to the partial metallization of the substrate surface. In particular, it is found that vertical displacements on the metallized surface can be up to 3.5 times higher as compared to their values on the free surface. Results of computations agree reasonably well with measurements carried out with a laser Doppler vibrometer and allow the clarification of some specific features of this polarization conversion by means of spatial frequency analysis.},

The room-temperature current–voltage characteristics reveal a negative differential conductance (NDC) region with a peak tunneling current of 6.8 ± 0.8 kA/cm 2 at a forward bias of ∼8 V. Under reverse bias, the polarization-induced threshold voltage is measured at ∼ − 4 V. These resonant and threshold voltages are well explained with the polarization field, which is opposite to that of the metal-polar counterpart, confirming the N-polarity of the resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs). When the device is biased in the NDC-region, electronic oscillations are generated in the external circuit, attesting to the robustness of the resonant tunneling phenomenon. In contrast to metal-polar RTDs, N-polar structures have the emitter on the top of the resonant tunneling cavity. As a consequence, this device architecture opens up the possibility of seamlessly interfacing—via resonant tunneling injection—a wide range of exotic materials with III-nitride semiconductors, providing a route towards unexplored device physics.},

Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigated the structure, stability, magnetism, and band structure of this material. It is a flexible and stable monolayer exhibiting a low lattice thermal conductivity, which is promising for future thermoelectric devices. The monolayer shows the ferromagnetic ground state with a spin-polarized band structure. Two linear spin-polarized bands cross at the Fermi level forming a Dirac point, which is formed by the p atomic orbitals of the N atoms, indicating that monolayer 1T-LaN 2 is a Dirac spin-gapless semiconductor of p -state. When the spin–orbit coupling is taken into account, a large nontrivial indirect bandgap (86/354 meV) can be opened at the Dirac point, and three chiral edge states are obtained, corresponding to a high Chern number of C = 3, implying that monolayer 1T-LaN 2 is a Chern insulator. Importantly, this kind of band structure is expected to occur in more monolayers of rare-earth-metal dinitride with a 1T structural phase.},

However, polymers are subjected to low thermal conductivity. The enhancement of their thermal conductivity is often at the cost of deteriorating dielectric properties, resulting in a substantial increase in the dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and conductivity. In order to address this problem, we developed a double core shell structured Al@Al 2 O 3 @SiO 2 filled epoxy composite to enhance the thermal conductivity as well as keep the low dielectric constant and dielectric loss. The thermal conductivity of the composite with a loading of 40 wt.\% fillers can be enhanced by three times that of the pure epoxy. Compared with the composite loaded with the unmodified aluminum particles, the double core shell Al@Al 2 O 3 @SiO 2 is more effective in curbing the trend of the steep rise of the dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and conductivity of the composites. The potential use of the obtained composites for the thermal management of power light emitting diodes (LEDs) and chips has also been demonstrated by a practical LED chip and the analysis of finite element simulation.},

To study this residual phase, a low and homogeneous electric field can be used because antiferroelectric domain walls are not sensitive to homogeneous fields; thus, contributions of ferroelectric domain wall motions to permittivity and dielectric losses can be isolated. In this paper, the hyperbolic law characterization is used on lead zirconate thin films, which present a residual ferroelectric phase. The study shows that domain wall contributions of the ferroelectric phase are small (less than 2\% of the total permittivity), but their impacts are very important in the overall dielectric losses (≈26\%). These losses are, however, lower than those obtained in pure ferroelectric materials due to a residual state composed of well distributed ferroelectric clusters of small size with no interactions between domain walls.},

  abstract     = {The Gibbs energy can yield fundamental insight into the material properties of ferroelectrics such as energy barriers and phase transitions. Particularly for newly emerging classes of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric materials, such as fluorite-structured HfO 2 and ZrO 2 , the Gibbs energy can bridge theoretical calculations with experimental observations. Experimentally observed dynamic double hysteresis loops in thin film ZrO 2 and Si-doped HfO 2 capacitors are used to obtain a solution to the Gibbs energy by calculating the internal electric field with depolarization. By accounting for dipole-field interaction energies and static energies in the solution of the Gibbs energy of double-hysteresis ZrO 2 and Si-doped HfO 2 , a characteristic triple-well with two polar and one nonpolar energy minima emerges. Macroscopic metastable polar and nonpolar phases close in free energy are shown to be in agreement with first-order phase transitions underlying double hysteresis in ZrO 2 and Si-doped HfO 2 . The application of an external field is demonstrated to lower the free energy minimum of the polar phase below the nonpolar phase, providing macroscopic support that a first-order phase transition driven by an electric field is responsible for antiferroelectric behavior in doped HfO 2 and ZrO 2 . Energy barriers for the nonpolar → polar phase transition from 0.75 to 4.3 meV per formula unit are calculated for ZrO 2 and Si-doped HfO 2 . The macroscopic Gibbs energy profiles obtained through experimental measurements and device modeling connect the fundamental phenomenology of ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics to electronic devices.},

Moreover, without any poling treatment, direct and inverse transverse piezoelectric coefficients, e 31,f , near 0 kV/cm were approximately −5.0 C/m 2 for the as-deposited film. This value was nearly unchanged following the application of an electric field and poling treatment, suggesting that as-deposited films are almost in a fully self-polarized state without the application of an electric field. As-deposited films with a thickness of up to 22 μ m showed constant piezoelectricity without any poling treatment. The films did not crack or peel because of substrates due to the small thermal strain originating from the low deposition temperature. The figures of merit (FOM) for the vibration energy harvester [ FOM = e 31,f 2 /( ε 0 ε r )] and sensor [ FOM = e 31,f /( ε 0 ε r )] were estimated to be good at 32.8 GPa and –5.9 GV/m, respectively, primarily because of the low relative dielectric constant of ∼110. Furthermore, the piezoelectric voltage coefficient g 31 [= d 31 /( ε 0 ε r )] was estimated and demonstrated a high value of 0.073 Vm/N.},

Wake-up, endurance, and fatigue of these films are found to be intricately correlated, strongly hysteretic, and dependent on available thermal energy. Field-dependent measurements reveal a decrease in polarization with temperature, which has been determined not to be an intrinsic change of the material property, rather a demonstration of the increase in the coercive bias of the material. Our findings suggest that a deficiency in thermal energy suppresses the mobility of defects presumed to be oxygen vacancies during wake-up and trapped injected charge during fatigue, which is responsible for polarization evolution during cycling. This permits accelerated wake-up and fatigue effects at high temperatures where thermal energy is abundant but delays these effects at cryogenic temperatures.},

In the present work, the charge transport mechanism in La:HfO 2 was experimentally studied, and four theoretical conductivity models—the Frenkel effect of Coulomb trap ionization, Hill-Adachi model of overlapping Coulomb potentials, Makram–Ebeid and Lannoo model of multiphonon isolated trap ionization, and Nasyrov-Gritsenko phonon-assisted tunneling between traps—were quantitatively analyzed. It was shown that the charge transport mechanism in La: HfO 2 is qualitatively described by the Frenkel effect, but the Frenkel effect predicts an abnormally low trap concentration value and a large high-frequency dielectric constant value, which is not consistent with the experiment. The charge transport in La:HfO 2 is quantitatively described by the model of phonon-assisted tunneling between neighboring traps.},

Here, we report on the development of sub-terahertz FFOs based on parallel JJ-arrays made of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ thin films. Sharp multiple flux-flow resonances were observed in the temperature range 77–89 K in asymmetric JJ-arrays, suggesting that they can operate as a narrow-band FFO in sub-terahertz integrated-receivers at more practical temperatures than 4.2 K. We detected electromagnetic radiation (EM) emitted by symmetric JJ-arrays in the range of 30–45 K using on-chip build superconducting detectors based on single JJs. For both asymmetric and symmetric JJ-arrays, the frequency f of the emitted radiation could be tuned continuously by an applied magnetic flux Φ with a one-flux-quantum Φ 0 periodicity. Remarkably, since f can be tuned continuously, there are no gaps in the frequency range of the emitted EM. The fundamental Φ 0 -periodicity of f ( Φ ) is similar in nature to a SQUID&#39;s voltage response V ( Φ ) and, consequently, using high-performance magnetic flux-to-field conversion and readout techniques, a sensitive field-to-frequency magnetometer can be developed. Incorporated into non-accessible micro/nanostructures as a magnetic sensor, it would allow precise measurements of magnetic-fields from a distance, without the need to measure it locally as the radiation is detected remotely.},

Analysis of the THz emission as a function of the polarization of the femtosecond laser pulse, external magnetic field, sample temperature, and sample orientation shows that the photocurrent can emerge due to vertical spin pumping and photo-induced inverse spin–orbit torque at the FeRh/Pt interface. The vertical spin pumping from FeRh into Pt does not depend on the polarization of light and originates from ultrafast laser-induced demagnetization of the ferromagnetic phase of FeRh. The photo-induced inverse spin–orbit torque at the FeRh/Pt interface can be described in terms of a helicity-dependent effect of circularly polarized light on the magnetization of the ferromagnetic FeRh and the subsequent generation of a photocurrent.},

Our formulation is based on drift-diffusion equations supplemented with generalized boundary conditions. The latter encode the effects of ISOC and relate the electronic transport in such systems to spin loss and spin-charge interconversion at the interface. We demonstrate that the conversion efficiency depends solely on these interfacial parameters. We apply our formalism to two typical spintronic devices that exploit ISOC: a lateral spin valve and a multilayer Hall bar, for which we calculate the non-local resistance and the spin Hall magnetoresistance, respectively. Finally, we perform measurements on these two devices with a BiO x /Cu interface and verify that transport properties related to the ISOC are quantified by the same set of interfacial parameters.},

Here, we propose a simple method to realize the field-free spin–orbit torque-driven magnetization switching by exploiting a tilted magnetic anisotropy, which is caused by the direct coupling of two ferromagnetic layers in the Pt/Co/FeNi/Ta structure. When preparing the sample, a 1000 Oe in-plane magnetic field was applied to ensure the magnetic moment deviating a small angle from the out-of-plane direction to this in-plane field direction. We experimentally demonstrate the deterministic field-free magnetization switching in Pt/Co/FeNi/Ta by the field-like spin–orbit torques when the electric current is applied perpendicular to this in-plane field direction. The switching performance is slightly degraded with the critical switching current density and thermal stability factor, respectively, reaching 6.4 × 10 6 A/cm 2 and 25 due to the slightly decreased spin–orbit torque efficiency and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with introducing the FeNi layers. Our work paves the way for realizing the field-free magnetization switching by spin–orbit torques.},

In order to reduce the energy required to efficiently switch neighboring ferromagnetic layers for applications, one should not only increase the charge-to-spin conversion efficiency but also decrease the longitudinal resistivity of the heavy metal. In this work, we investigate the spin Hall conductivity in W 1-x Ta x /CoFeB/MgO (x = 0–0.2) using spin torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements. Alloying W with Ta leads to a factor of two change in both the damping-like effective spin Hall angle (from −0.15 to −0.3) and longitudinal resistivity (60–120 μ Ω cm). At a 11\% Ta concentration, a remarkably high spin Hall angle value of –0.3 is achieved with a low longitudinal resistivity of 100 μ Ω cm, which could lead to a very low power consumption for this W-based alloy. This work demonstrates that sputter-deposited W–Ta alloys could be a promising material for power-efficient spin current generation.},

  abstract     = {The electrical device characteristics of Ni/β-Ga 2 O 3 vertical Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) were measured in situ during the irradiation of 120 MeV Ag 7+ swift heavy ions (SHIs). These devices exhibit SHI irradiation-induced degradation with 120 MeV Ag 7+ ions in the ion fluence ranges of 1 × 10 10 to 1 × 10 12 ions/cm 2 . The height of the Schottky barrier is found to decrease from 1.11 to 0.93 eV, and the ideality factor increases from 1.16 to 2.06. These changes indicate the degradation of the device with SHI irradiation. A significant four orders increase is observed in the leakage current density from 4.04 × 10 −8 to 1.98 × 10 −4 A/cm 2 at −1 V, and the series resistance also increases from 3.38 × 10 3 to 1.15 × 10 4 Ω. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that the Ga ions are present in divalent and trivalent states with the spectral features having the binding energies centered at 20.2 eV and 19.9 eV (Ga 3d core-levels) before and after ion irradiation. The O 2s peak shifts to 23.7 eV, and there is an increase in intensity and peak broadening due to the change in the trivalent to divalent state of Ga due to the irradiation. The O(I) peak appears at 530.7 eV in the pristine sample with the Ga–O bonding with the Ga 3+ state in pure Ga 2 O 3 . Moreover, there is a significant change in the intensity and the peak width of O(II) centered at 533.0 eV after ion irradiation at the fluence of 1 × 10 12 ions/cm 2 . This indicates that there is an increase in the surface adsorbed/lattice oxygen, resulting in GaO.},

Our studies demonstrate that the key optoelectronic properties of the heterostructure in the strongly coupled regime are substantially different from those of the control WS 2 and RGO, promoting the mixing of electronic states at the interfaces leading to the suppression of direct excitons. The combined effect of midgap states and donor levels induced by RGO below the conduction band of WS 2 along with the charge transfer to these trap states forms long-lived non-decaying excitons existing more than 1.5 ns, an ultimate time limit in our experiment. These results identify the interfacial trap states as a useful degree of freedom to engineer the lifetime of trapped excitons.},

Low-temperature β -Ga 2 O 3 thin films grown at 600 °C on Fe-doped (010) bulk substrates exhibit remarkable crystalline quality, which is evident from the measured room temperature Hall mobility of 186 cm 2 /V s for the unintentionally doped films. N-type doping is achieved by using Si as a dopant, and a controllable doping in the range of 2 × 10 16 –2 × 10 19 cm −3 is studied. Si incorporation and activation is studied by comparing the silicon concentration from secondary ion mass spectroscopy and the electron concentration from temperature-dependent Hall measurements. The films exhibit high purity (low C and H concentrations) with a very low concentration of compensating acceptors (2 × 10 15 cm −3 ) even at this growth temperature. Additionally, an abrupt doping profile with a forward decay of ∼ 5 nm/dec (10 times improvement compared to what is observed for thin films grown at 810 °C) is demonstrated by growing at a lower temperature.},

While our previous work provides strong evidence for one, two, and perhaps three or four H trapped into the shifted vacancy configurations introduced by Varley and Kyrtsos, the apparent experimental absence of several H trapped in the unshifted configuration is puzzling. While a structure of two hydrogen atoms trapped in the unshifted configuration is not favored energetically, structures of three or four hydrogens in the unshifted configuration are favored. We suggest that these structures are absent because there are no available pathways for the system to reach them by sequentially trapped H and, therefore, that three- or four-hydrogen defects will occur only in the shifted vacancy configurations.},

The thermoelectric films composed of group-IV elements are advantageous due to their compatibility with the Si process. We fabricated Si 1− x Ge x epitaxial films with various controlled x values and strains using various growth methods. Ge epitaxial films without strains exhibited the highest thermoelectric power factor (∼47 μ W cm −1 K −2 ) among various strain-controlled Si 1− x Ge x ( x ≠ 1) epitaxial films, which is higher at room temperature than SiGe alloy-based bulks ever reported. On the other hand, strained Si 1− x Ge x epitaxial films showed an ultralow thermal conductivity of ∼2 W m −1 K −1 , which is close to the value for amorphous Si. In addition to strained SiGe films with the ultralow thermal conductivity, unstrained Ge films with a high thermoelectric power factor can also be used for future TFTEGs by applying a nanostructuring technique. A preliminary TFTEG of Ge epitaxial films was realized, which generated a maximum power of ∼0.10 μ W cm −2 under a temperature difference of 20 K. This demonstrates that epitaxial films composed of group-IV semiconductors are promising materials for TFTEG applications.},

Although the sample annealed at 800 °C can achieve the best dielectric quality (reflected by its lowest oxide-charge density, smallest dielectric surface roughness, and largest pentacene grain size), it shows the lowest carrier mobility of 0.44 cm 2 /V·s as compared to the highest mobility of 1.69 cm 2 /V·s for the control sample without dielectric annealing. In addition, this mobility degradation increases with increasing annealing temperature in spite of improving dielectric quality. Transmission electron microscopy shows that higher annealing temperature results in the formation of a thicker Si-gate/gate-dielectric interlayer, which increases the separation between the Si-gate plasmons and the gate-dielectric dipoles to weaken the screening effect of the gate electrode on the remote phonon scattering of the high-k gate dielectric, resulting in a lower carrier mobility. Measurements at high temperatures also support the effects of the interlayer.},

This is performed on a GaSb-based quantum well laser emitting at ∼2 μ m. Stable mode locking operation with a fundamental repetition frequency of ∼13.3 GHz is achieved on this laser up to 60 °C. At a fixed temperature, there is no monotonous dependence of integrated jitter on the bias condition. For a given gain current or absorber voltage, there exists a corresponding optimal absorber voltage or gain current, respectively, that minimizes the integrated jitter. More important, the phase noise properties improve obviously at elevated temperatures with the lowest achievable jitter reducing obviously from 3.15 ps at 20 °C to 1.39 ps at 60 °C (100 kHz–1 GHz). We consider that the reason is reduced amplified spontaneous emission noise at high temperatures. This is confirmed by the extracted peak-to-valley ratio of the involved laser modes. We believe that this study provides an important insight into the carrier behaviors and noise performance of mode-locked semiconductor lasers, which is meaningful to their applications especially at high temperatures.},

  abstract     = {We present a different perspective on wireless power transfer by uniting topological edge states, which are robust states on the edge of a material enforced by topological invariants, with magnetoinductive waves on a 1D diatomic chain of magnetically coupled meta-atoms with intracell coupling exceeding intercell coupling. We show that robust edge states that exist in the stop band of the magnetoinductive waves can, in fact, be used for efficient wireless power delivery by relying on coupling via evanescent modes. Advantages in comparison to wireless power delivery via travelling magnetoinductive waves include lower electromagnetic pollution of the space around the wireless power delivery channel due to the evanescent nature of the modes and robustness against perturbations in the system. This study may change the approach to wireless power systems and near-field sensors based on arrays of coupled meta-atoms.},

We present in situ observations of hydrodynamic jetting and ejection of matter from high-velocity metallic microparticle impacts that still result in rebound of the particle. While the occurrence of jetting has been linked to permanent particle deposition in prior studies, the present findings reveal that any bonds that may form upon jetting can be rebroken by particle rebound in some circumstances. We further present asymmetric occurrences of jetting associated with localized delays in particle detachment followed by rotation during particle rebound, which may speak to transient bond formation at the jetting sites.},

We show that the activation energy of diffusion, E , is controlled by the high-frequency shear modulus, G ∞ ⁠ , and can be presented in the form E = const × G ∞ in the whole temperature range studied. We conclude that the displacements of a group of atoms in metallic alloys occur during the elastic shear deformation of their surroundings.

  abstract     = {Recently, sound attenuation with ventilation is highly needed in many practical applications. In this study, we report on a subwavelength acoustic silencer, named double-layer acoustic silencer (DAS), based on compactly assembled slit-type Helmholtz resonators (SHRs) for low-frequency broadband sound insulation while preserving ventilation. A simple yet insightful theoretical model is first established to characterize the sound insulation performance in terms of transmission loss (TL) and used for microstructure designs of the DAS. The fluctuating TL of the DAS, inevitably produced by the SHR resonances, is then mitigated and optimized via the introduction of viscosity and proper SHR frequency detuning. The overall TL is numerically investigated and experimentally observed to reach beyond 30 dB over the target working band of 0.48–0.95 kHz, with a maximum exceeding 50 dB. In addition, the proposed design also provides perfect ventilation when deployed in a duct environment, due to the straight and conserved airflow cross section. We believe that the proposed acoustic silencer design and its associated theoretical model pave the way for designing and optimizing highly efficient low-frequency subwavelength acoustic liners and silencers.},

With increasing power voltage, two separated plumes are first generated downstream of the pair of jets, which transit to the uniform planar plume with a fairly large scale. The planar plume elongates with the increasing air flow rate or power voltage. Moreover, the temperature of the planar plume is comparatively low with a maximum of about 80 °C, which is symmetrically distributed perpendicular to the pair of jets. For the separated plumes, discharge current is intermittently pulsed under a time-invariant gap voltage. However, both gap voltage and discharge current are periodically pulsed for the planar plume. High-speed video images reveal that the planar plasma plume stems from two discrete plumes flushing out of the pair of jets, which are soon merged together by a cathode-directed streamer due to interactions between them, leading to the generation of an arc-shaped filament. Due to the air flow, the arc-shaped filament keeps moving away from the jet vicinity until it quenches at last, which belongs to a glow discharge regime. In addition, surface modification of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is performed with our planar plasma plume, which reveals that the hydrophilicity of the PET surface can be improved greatly.},

The discussed cases herein are compelling due to the specific energetic structure of pyramidal InGaAs QDs—an antibinding biexciton—a state with a positive binding energy. We demonstrate that resonant two-photon excitation of QDs with antibinding biexcitons can lead to a complex excitation-recombination scenario. We systematically observed that the resonant biexciton state population is competing with an acoustic-phonon assisted population of an exciton state. These findings show that under typical two-photon resonant excitation conditions, deterministic biexciton state initialization can be compromised. This complication should be taken into account by the community members aiming to utilize similar epitaxial QDs with an antibinding biexciton.},

Specifically, we find that if the device structure promotes, under light, hole (electron) accumulation within the perovskite layer, these excess holes (electrons) would release an almost equivalent number of cations (anions) into the transport layers toward the contacts. Our analysis suggests that it would be beneficial to include intentional doping of the blocking layers and that it should follow the “just enough” strategy.},

However, the synthesis of bronze-phase TiO 2 (B) thin films on perovskite substrates, such as SrTiO 3 (STO), which is one of the most conventional versatile substrates for oxide epitaxy, has been extremely challenging owing to the preferential formation of the anatase TiO 2 over TiO 2 (B). The main reason is that the anatase TiO 2 has not only a smaller lattice mismatch than TiO 2 (B), but also a better structural symmetry match when grown on STO. Here, we demonstrate a way to circumventing this problem by using a VO 2 (B) buffer layer, yielding the growth of a high-quality single crystalline TiO 2 (B) film on a (001)-oriented STO substrate. From the resulting TiO 2 (B) film, we found that this film has a large optical bandgap of ∼3.6 eV, which is close to the known theoretical value, the largest among TiO 2 polymorphs, and useful for developing high-power energy devices.},

Two distinct oxidation modes determined by the competition between the oxide shell melting and core reaction have been identified. One is the fast oxidation mode with a high reaction heat release rate, where core Al and ambient O atoms diffuse into each other to form a homogeneous alumina particle. The other is the moderate oxidation with lower heat release, where only core Al atoms diffuse into the oxide shell to form a hollow spherical structure. By modeling the shell melting and Al core reaction, a size-derived oxidation model has been proposed to conveniently but accurately predict the ANP reaction dynamics. This work also provides fundamental insight into the synthesis of ANPs that serve as a high energy density fuel and high-performance catalyst.},

However, to date, e-jet printing has focused on additive material deposition, rather than patterning through material subtraction. This work proposes displacement-based e-jet printing using solvent inks for subtractive patterning of polymer thin films, with microscale resolution in the x–y plane and nanoscale control in the z (dissolving) direction. The behavior of displacement-based e-jet printing is characterized using atomic force microscopy, and two methodologies are developed for controlling the linewidth and displaced depth. An example of area-selective thin film deposition on displacement-based e-jet patterns is provided to demonstrate the applicability of this patterning technique for printable microscale devices.},

  abstract     = {The stability of solid–liquid interfaces during solidification is a physical phenomenon of fundamental interest with a wide range of practical applications, including the freezing of biological matter for medical and agricultural purposes. Much of the classical research in this field treats solidification in isobaric (constant-pressure) systems in which the phase transition typically occurs under constant atmospheric pressure. Recent research has found, however, that freezing in isochoric (constant-volume) systems in which the solidifying material is confined within a high-strength constant-volume chamber held at subfreezing temperatures gives rise to many atypical physical phenomena, and understanding of the solid–liquid interface behavior under isochoric conditions is currently lacking. In this work, we study the stability and propagation of the solid–liquid interface during isochoric freezing of aqueous solutions. Using a mathematical model of heat and mass transfer during solidification coupled with multiple criteria for predicting the emergence of interfacial instabilities based on temperature and concentration gradients in the phase transition region, we find that isochoric freezing significantly stabilizes the solid–liquid interface relative to isobaric freezing, suggesting the potential for extended growth of planar, non-dendritic interfaces.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we present direct current (DC), small signal radio frequency (RF), and large signals with pulsed and continuous wave (CW) studies and characterization on oxygen annealed (OA) β -Ga 2 O 3 metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) with significantly improved CW output power density (P out ) when compared to other β -Ga 2 O 3 RF devices. The OA process is found to be useful in compensating and neutralizing the donors in the unintentionally doped (UID) buffer layer and, hence, suppressing a second depletion effect in this UID layer. The device demonstrates a peak DC drain current of 200 mA/mm, a transconductance of 11 mS/mm, and an on/off ratio of 10 9 . Small-signal RF characterization indicates a cut-off frequency and maximum oscillation frequency ( f T / f max ) of 1.8 GHz and 4.2 GHz, respectively. The device also shows an output power ( P out )/peak power added efficiency (PAE)/gain of 0.4 W/mm/10\%/3.2 dB and 0.43 W/mm/12\%/3.6 dB for CW and pulsed signals, respectively, at an operation frequency of 1 GHz.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical oscillators incorporating miniaturized structures to transduce mesoscopic motion as readable electrical signals are often limited by the feedthrough effect (FE) because oscillation features are corrupted. The knowledge of FE parasitic resonance hitherto is only demonstrated in the linear regime. Herein, we reveal the nature of phenomenological FE parasitic nonlinear resonance. An inverse distortion in the spectra resulting from the superposition of Duffing nonlinearity and the FE is observed and modeled with physical insight into the governing parameters. We find that the manipulation of electromechanical coupling of the oscillator can fully de-embed the FE, while the device oscillates at the nonlinear bifurcation point under phase control. The generic nature of our model indicates that similar dynamic behaviors will occur for the nonlinear resonant systems containing the FE, regardless of transducing techniques. The strategy of on-chip FE control in our capacitive platform is scalable and can be suitably transformed for application in oscillators employing alternative transducers.},

  abstract     = {Threshold voltage analysis can help reveal the reliability of semiconductor transistors and its underlying mechanism. Herein, negative constant voltage stress (NCVS)-induced threshold voltage instability is studied in hydrogen-terminated diamond metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (HD MOSFETs) with an Al 2 O 3 dielectric layer deposited via atomic layer deposition at 90 °C. An unusual bidirectional shift in threshold voltage ( V th ) can be observed with time. When a weak gate NCVS is applied, V th gradually decreases during the first 500 s but increases in the next 500 s. A similar but opposite phenomenon is observed when the HD MOSFETs are in a recovery stage upon removing the NCVS, i.e., V th increases in the first 500 s but decreases in the next 4500 s. A kinetic hydrogen motion model shows that this phenomenon can be attributed to the larger characteristic time constant of the unactuated oxygen-dangling bonds (UODBs) compared to that of the traps in the gate dielectric. Consequently, the trapping effect dominates and decreases V th at the onset of NCVS. After 500 s, the UODB effects can be observed, increasing V th . In the recovery stage, V th is larger than the initial value. Further, modified hydrogen kinetic equations accounting for the dynamic effects of UODBs and traps are provided to quantitatively analyze the results.},

The low-cost and high-throughput techniques matching with the large-scale and roll-to-roll (R2R) process for fabricating efficient OSCs in the ambient condition would greatly accelerate the potential commercialization of OSCs. Herein, we demonstrate that the fabrication processes of OSCs using the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) composed of poly[(2,6–(4,8-bis(5–(2-ethylhexy)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5–(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3–(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5-methylindanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (IT-M) are transferred from a glovebox to the ambient condition, where the deposition of doctor blading instead of conventional spin coating is investigated. The morphology, microphase separation, and crystallinity of BHJ PBDB-T:IT-M are dramatically influenced by the fabrication processes. The OSCs with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:IT-M/MoO 3 /Ag fabricated via doctor-blading in the ambient condition show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.0\% as compared to conventional spin-coated OSCs in a glovebox with a PCE of 11.91\% and in the ambient condition with a PCE of 9.91\%. These results suggest that efficient OSCs could be processed in the ambient condition by large-scale and low-cost doctor-blading, which can be compatible with the R2R manufacturing process.},

We report that the MIT in high quality epitaxial SrVO 3 (SVO) thin films is present as the film thickness is reduced, lowering the dimensionality of the system, and electron-electron correlations start to become the dominant interactions. The critical thickness of 3 u.c is achieved by avoiding effects due to off-stoichiometry using optimal growth conditions and excluding any surface effects by a STO capping layer. Compared to the single SVO thin films, conductivity enhancement in SVO/STO superlattices is observed. This can be explained by the interlayer coupling effect between SVO sublayers in the superlattices. Magnetoresistance and Hall measurements indicate that the dominant driving force of MIT is the electron–electron interaction.},

To further the understanding in the physical nature of this phase transition, a systematic Raman spectroscopic study is performed on α -TiBr 3 crystals. With temperature decreasing, a large frequency blue shift and peak width narrowing are observed in the vibrational mode associated with Ti in-plane relative movement, which indicates the formation of Ti–Ti bonding and orbital-fluctuation freezing at low temperatures.

In this Letter, we take Pb-doped BiCuSeO and BiCuSeO embedded with rGO (BiCuSeO-rGO) as examples, and we reveal the effect of the secondary phase on local thermal conduction via quantitative scanning thermal microscopy in combination with finite element simulation. It is found that Pb-doping effectively reduces the thermal conductivity of BiCuSeO, while the rGO secondary phase slightly increases its thermal conductivity. Good quantitative agreement is observed between our nanoscale measurement and bulk values reported in the literature.

For the presented device, the channel and electrodes consist of semiconducting single-walled CNTs and multi-walled CNTs, respectively. We demonstrate an approach to selectively assemble multi-walled CNTs on a chemically heterogenous surface of a highly doped silicon wafer using electrophoresis, while single-walled CNTs are assembled on a photoresist templated substrate using meniscus driven fluidic assembly. Both layers are sequentially transfer printed on a stack of polyurethane and SU-8, which serves as the gate dielectric. This approach utilizes lithographically patterned silicon wafers as reusable templates, which significantly lowers the manufacturing cost and provides greater resolution than other printing techniques. The printed transistors exhibit on/off ratio as high as 10 6 with mobility approaching 10 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , which is highly promising for fully printed flexible FETs.},

The results closely agreed with structures obtained from neutron diffraction and the Fe 3 d DOS generated by density functional theory calculations. The previously unknown local structure of FeO 6 octahedra present at octahedral sites as a minor component (14.4\%) in the brownmillerite structure of Ca 2 Fe 1.07 Mn 0.93 O 5 was determined.

Here, we track the ferroelectric domain formation mechanism in ultrathin PbTiO 3 films in real time during epitaxial growth using in situ optical second harmonic generation. In combination with complementary ex situ piezoresponse force microscopy and second harmonic generation imaging, we unambiguously identify the tensile-epitaxial-strain-induced partial conversion of out-of-plane-polarized c -domains into in-plane-polarized a -domains. We further show that, in the strongly compressive epitaxial regime, the c -to- a conversion can be shifted to the early stage of the growth to favor a remarkable randomization in the distribution of a - and c -domains. This unprecedented access to the domain-formation dynamics constitutes an important step toward deterministic domain architectures in technologically relevant ultrathin ferroelectrics which, in turn, is valuable for the development of functional ferroelectric and piezoelectric structures.},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate a GHz-gated operation of resonator-coupled superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors suitable for synchronous applications. In comparison with conventional dc-biased nanowire detectors, this method prevents the detector from latching and can suppress dark counts and background noise. Using a gating frequency of 3.8 GHz and a fast, synchronized laser diode, we show that the detector&#39;s operation point follows the oscillating current and its detection efficiency depends on the relative frequency and phase of the bias and modulated optical signal. The obtained experimental results are in good agreement with simulations, showing that the duty cycle of a gated detector can be adjusted in a wide range in the case of a pronounced saturation of the current-dependent detection efficiency. This operation mode could be suitable for applications such as quantum key distribution and time-of-flight laser ranging.},

  abstract     = {The phenomenon of ferrofluid-water mixing is investigated using a double-layer magnetic micromixer, in which a layer of micromagnet bars is placed immediately below the fluid layer. A wavy pattern of the ferrofluid–water interface is surprisingly observed at each micromagnet responsible for improved mixing. The mechanism causing the wavy mixing is discovered and analyzed through experimental measurements and numerical simulations, and the mixing efficiency under different flow conditions is discussed. For flows with Re ≪ 1, the resultant steep gradient of opposing magnetic forces by micromagnets in the ferrofluid region gives rise to a local pressure source that induces a transverse/spanwise pressure gradient and activates momentum transfer between fluids. The current finding enables effective localized mixing of ferrofluids with a small footprint and, thus, has great potential to achieve fast mixing for high-throughput flows with an integrated parallel system of multiple microfluidic channels and micromagnets.},

The resistivity data show typical semi-metallic behavior in the temperature range of 3 K ≤ T ≤ 350 K with a transition from semiconductor- to metal-like behavior below 3 K. The metallic behavior at low temperature disappears entirely in the presence of an external magnetic field &gt;1 T. The weak-antilocalization (WAL) effect is observed in magneto-conductance data in the low magnetic field region and follows the Hikami–Larkin–Nagaoka (HLN) model. HLN fitting estimated single coherent channel, i.e., α ∼ −0.51 at 1.9 K, and the phase coherence length ( L ϕ ) shows the L ϕ ∼ T −0.52 power law dependence on temperature in the range of 1.9 K–10 K, indicating the observation of 2D WAL. Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations are observed in magneto-resistance data below 10 K and are fitted to standard Lifhsitz Kosevich theory. Fitting reveals the effective mass of charge carriers ∼0.15 m e and a finite Berry phase of 0.86π ± 0.16. The sheet carrier concentration and mobility of carriers estimated using SdH data are n s ∼ 1.35 × 10 12 cm −2 and μ s = 1210 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , respectively, and match well with the data measured using the Hall measurement at 1.9 K to be n ∼ 1.22 × 10 12 cm −2 , μ = 1035 cm 2 V −1 s −1 .

The reversible metal-to-insulator transition, enhanced colossal magnetoresistance (∼ 27 000\% for V g = 3.0 V), and giant memory effect have been observed, which can be attributed to an electronic phase separation scenario manipulated by a tiny doping-level-variation of less than 0.02 electrons per formula unit.

Our calculations demonstrate that CeCu 3 Cr 4 O 12 is a ferrimagnet with a saturated magnetic moment of 7.00 μ B f.u. –1 . Effective ferrimagnetic interactions are generated from the antiparallel spin arrangement between the A′-site Cu and B-site Cr. The electronic structure analyses reveal that CeCu 3 Cr 4 O 12 exhibits half-metal performance, which can be attributed to the mixed-valence of B-site Cr. More importantly, a small amount of 4f itinerant electrons are located on the A-site Ce, i.e., both itinerant electron magnetism and localized magnetic moments are observed in the theoretical calculations. The charge distribution in this system is confirmed to be Ce (4−δ)+ Cu 2+ 3 Cr (3.5+δ)+ 4 O 2− 12 .

The one-particle excitations can be identified as relativistic massive particles. These particles, the “nutatons,” acquire their mass via the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism, through the interaction of the wave with an emergent topological gauge field. This spin excitation would appear as a peak in the spectrum of the scattering structure factor in inelastic neutron scattering experiments.

It appears that most inverse domains shrink to stripes and disappear suddenly to achieve the saturation state under a magnetic field, and the saturation field increases with the decreasing temperature due to the increased anisotropy. Magnetic bubbles with zero topological number are formed at temperatures higher than T SR , whereas magnetic skyrmions are found at temperatures around T SR due to the spin reorientation. The tunable anisotropy and saturation magnetization at T SR are the main causes of forming magnetic skyrmions.

  abstract     = {Acoustic computational metamaterials have enabled the realization of mathematical operations in the spatial domain. Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate the time domain mathematical operations, such as fractional differentiation and integration and Gaussian filtering, based on a fully reconfigurable acoustic computational metamaterial. We also demonstrate the potential to achieve an integrated computing network in order to realize complicated functionalities by exploiting differentiation, integration, and their series and parallel functions in a simple acoustic metamaterial circuit. For generality and universality, the linearity and the product rule for the wave-based differentiation are also verified as well as the functionality of cascaded differentiators. We expect that acoustic computational metamaterials will enable capabilities in signal acquisition and processing and network computing and drive applications of sound waves.},

  abstract     = {The bond imaging atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique has become an invaluable tool for studying organic molecules on surfaces. The key feature of this technique is the functionalization of the AFM-tip with a single CO molecule, which improves the lateral resolution and allows us to visualize the chemical structure of adsorbed organic molecules. Such experiments are usually performed at low temperatures in an ultrahigh vacuum environment in the frequency modulation (FM) mode. Here, we use the Q -controlled amplitude modulation (AM) mode for imaging organic molecules with CO-functionalized tips in constant-height mode. By reducing the effective quality factor ( Q eff ) of the sensor from about 20 000–30 000 to 1500–4000, we are able to image molecules with atomic resolution. Detailed instructions for determining the optimum Q eff and oscillation amplitude are given. To compare the phase and frequency shift images of the Q -controlled AM and the FM mode, we define an effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that relates the observed contrast between the bonds and centers of imaged carbon rings to the noise in the respective image regions. This effective SNR is systematically analyzed in different regions of the imaged molecule for different oscillation amplitudes and average tip-substrate distances. By using appropriate imaging parameters, an increased effective SNR is achieved in the Q -controlled AM mode (on the order of 30–60\%). This advantage over the conventional FM mode might, e.g., be used for increasing the experimental throughput.},

Here, we present lithium niobate optomechanical resonators with film-thickness-mode mechanical resonances up to 5.2 GHz, reaching the operating frequency regime of superconducting qubits. By engineering the mechanical anchor to minimize the phonon loss, we achieve a high quality factor up to 12 500 at cryogenic temperatures and, hence, a frequency-quality factor product of 6.6 × 10 13 . Our system also features interference between piezo-optomechanical and electro-optic modulation. A theoretical model is derived to analyze these two effects and their interference.},

This paper reports on the integration of an InAs virtual substrate and high crystalline quality InAs/InAsSb multi-quantum wells on Si using a three-stage InAs/GaSb/Si buffer layer. It is shown that the InAs/GaSb interface demonstrates a strong dislocation filtering effect. A series of strained AlSb/InAs dislocation filter superlattices was also used, resulting in a low surface dislocation density of approximately 4 × 10 7 cm −2 . The InAs/InAsSb wells exhibited a strong photoluminescence signal at elevated temperatures. Analysis of these results indicates that radiative recombination is the dominant recombination mechanism, making this structure promising for fabricating MIR Si-based sensor systems.},

The broad family of layered thio- and seleno-phosphates with wide and tunable bandgaps (1.3 − 3.5 eV) can complement the intermediate bandgaps from 1.6 to 4 eV, which can fill the gap between transition metal dichalcogenides and boron nitride. In this work, a high-performance ultraviolet photodetector based on multilayered CuInP 2 S 6 was fabricated. It exhibits fast response times shorter than 0.5 ms, i.e., rise time ∼ 0.36 ms and fall time ∼ 0.44 ms for ultraviolet illumination (280 nm, 50 nW), which is superior than previously reported 2D layered-based UV detectors. Significantly, this photodetector also shows ultralow dark current (∼ 100 fA), a high on/off ratio (∼10 3 ), and a specific detectivity of 7.38 × 10 10 Jones.

In this Perspective, we review recent progress in the engineering of synthetic magnets coupled by the interlayer and intralayer DMI. We show how multilayer chiral magnetic structures and two-dimensional synthetic antiferromagnets, skyrmions, and artificial spin systems can be realized by simultaneous control of the DMI and magnetic anisotropy. In addition, we show that, with the combination of DMI and current-induced spin–orbit torques, field-free switching of synthetic magnetic elements is obtained as well as all-electric domain wall logic circuits.},

In the last decade or so, many claims of plasmon-assisted “hot” electron driven catalysis of bond-dissociation reactions have been put forward. These claims were challenged in a recent series of papers where both the underlying theory of “hot” electron generation and the use of specific experimental setups to discover them in chemical reactions were examined in detail. The conclusion that arose from these works is that as long as temperature gradients exist inside the system (as for typical experimental setups), a quantification of non-thermal effects is close to impossible. Instead, a standard thermal theory was shown to be capable of explaining the experimental findings quite accurately. Here, we review the central lines of thought that led to these conclusions from a personal point of view. We lay out the key aspects of the theory and point to the specific caveats one must be aware of in performing photo-catalysis experiments. Finally, we provide some future directions of study.},

Here, we have studied the nonlinear dynamics of periodic chain of mass-in-mass systems, which can be used to model composite foundations, where the external spring is characterized by an anharmonic potential. The main finding of this work is the identification of two attenuation mechanisms, one is characterized by an exponential amplitude decay and is observed in the strongly anharmonic regime, whereas the other has a linear decay pattern and characterizes the weak anharmonic dynamics.

Engineered nano-devices enable the efficient confinement of light and, ultimately, the control of the spontaneous emission dynamics of single emitters, which is crucial for cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments and for the development of classical and quantum light sources. Here, we report on the demonstration of enhanced light-matter interaction and Purcell effects on a chip, based on bio-inspired aperiodic devices fabricated in gallium arsenide. Indium arsenide single quantum dots are used as internal light sources to image, by means of micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy, the optical modes supported by photonic membranes with Vogel-spiral geometry. These emitters are also used to probe the density of optical states, modified by the aperiodic devices, by means of time-resolved spectroscopy. Our results show cavity quantum electrodynamics effects providing strong modifications of the spontaneous emission decay of single optical transitions. In particular, thanks to the significant modification of the density of optical states demonstrated in Vogel-spiral photonic structures, we show control of the decay lifetime of single emitters with a dynamic range reaching 20, thus opening the path to the implementation of aperiodic geometries in active classical and quantum devices.},

  abstract     = {Josephson tunnel junctions are the centerpiece of almost any superconducting electronic circuit, including qubits. Typically, the junctions for qubits are fabricated using shadow evaporation techniques to reduce dielectric loss contributions from the superconducting film interfaces. In recent years, however, sub-micrometer scale overlap junctions have started to attract attention. Compared to shadow mask techniques, neither an angle dependent deposition nor free-standing bridges or overlaps are needed, which are significant limitations for wafer-scale processing. This comes at the cost of breaking the vacuum during fabrication, but simplifies integration in multi-layered circuits and implementation of vastly different junction sizes and enables fabrication on a larger scale in an industrially standardized process. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of a subtractive process for the fabrication of overlap junctions. In an array of test contacts, we find low aging of the average normal state resistance of only 1.6\% over 6 months. We evaluate the coherence properties of the junctions by employing them in superconducting transmon qubits. In time domain experiments, we find that both, the qubit life- and coherence time of our best device, are, on average, greater than 20 μ s. Finally, we discuss potential improvements to our technique. This work paves the way toward a more standardized process flow with advanced materials and growth processes, and constitutes an important step for the large scale fabrication of superconducting quantum circuits.},

We fabricate isotropically trenched resonators to produce a series of device geometries that accentuate a specific dielectric region&#39;s contribution to the resonator quality factor. While each dielectric region contributes significantly to loss in TiN devices, the metal–air interface dominates the loss in the Al devices. Furthermore, we evaluate the quality factor of each TiN resonator geometry with and without a post-process hydrofluoric etch and find that it reduced losses from the substrate–air interface, thereby improving the quality factor.},

  abstract     = {This Letter reports measured cryogenic temperature trends for over 300 longitudinal phonon modes spanning &gt;10 GHz in an epitaxial GaN/NbN/SiC high overtone bulk acoustic resonator (epi-HBAR). We present temperature profiles from 7.2 K to 200 K for the mode frequency ( ⁠ f ⁠ ), the quality factor ( Q) , the figure of merit ( ⁠ f × Q ⁠ ), and the phonon loss or attenuation coefficient ( ⁠ α ⁠ ). We show that for all m phonon modes, f m T follows an identical parabolic trend, with a zero-slope turnover temperature of 35 K. Thus, the epi-HBAR comb spectrum can be considered an ensemble of modes with the same temperature dependencies, potentially enabling the design of precise multi-mode temperature-stable RF oscillators and clocks operating at GHz frequencies. Using temperature trends for ( f × Q ) m and α m ⁠ , we provide strong evidence that the epi-HBARs are fundamentally limited by anharmonic phonon scattering in the materials that make up the epi-HBAR. Crucially, we unambiguously demonstrate the evolution of this anharmonic phonon scattering from the low frequency Akhiezer scattering regime α m ∝ T 1 to the high frequency Landau–Rumer scattering regime α m ∝ T 4 ⁠ , using hundreds of phonon modes in the same device. Finally, we show that at extremely low temperatures, other emergent loss mechanisms overshadow anharmonic phonon scattering. This finding motivates further investigation into the root causes of these limiting mechanisms for precision RF signal processing, quantum acoustodynamics, and other applications that require extremely low loss micromechanical devices.},

In some cases, electrolysis operation causes fracture near the GDC/YSZ interface. Here, we explain this effect using a numerical calculation, showing that a peak oxygen pressure is observed near the GDC/YSZ interface during electrolysis operation. Moreover, GDC/YSZ interdiffusion and possible zirconate phase formation occurring during electrode firing yield a low oxygen ion conductivity region that introduces a much higher peak oxygen partial pressure at the interdiffusion layer/YSZ interface, thereby exacerbating degradation. The results indicate that the peak pressure can be reduced and, thereby, damage can be mitigated by altering processing in order to minimize interdiffusion, decreasing the GDC layer thickness, and reducing oxygen electrode polarization resistance or altering electrolyte transport properties, e.g., changing the Gd doping level of GDC to increase the oxygen vacancy diffusivity.},

Most research on topological insulators focuses on their fundamental physical properties, and until now, there has been little work on their practical applications. Here, we extend the application of topological insulators to the field of acoustics. We show that topological insulators can be used for sound source applications using a large area of Bi 2 Se 3 . The sound pressure level (SPL) can reach up to 30 dB with an 85 mW input at a measured 1 cm distance at room temperature. More interestingly, an anomalous valley with a sound pressure level (SPL) drop of ∼9 dB occurs at 21.5 kHz in a Bi 2 Se 3 topological insulator, which is not observed in monolayer graphene. This anomalous phenomenon is related to the unique surface and bulk states of Bi 2 Se 3 . A theoretical equivalent circuit model is built for a topological insulator and compared with that of graphene. Based on the equivalent circuit model combined with thermoacoustic sound-generation theory, such an anomalous thermoacoustic effect with an SPL valley at around 21.5 kHz can be simulated. Our work shows that topological insulators have potential as powerful sound sources, such as earphones and loudspeakers, and that the unique surface states are highly conducive to frequency-selected sound emission.},

There, however, remains a difficulty in increasing the tunnel current in TFETs since the energy gap at the tunnel junction has a unique probability. Here, we investigated the strain effect stemming from the InGaAs-InP core–shell (CS) structure on the tunneling current in a vertical TFET using an InGaAs nanowire (NW)/Si heterojunction. We found that the TFET demonstrated a 10-fold enhancement in current while achieving a steep SS (minimum SS = 41 mV/dec). Strain analysis for the InGaAs NW/Si tunnel junction revealed that specific strain induced at the junction affected the increase in the on-state current.},

  abstract     = {An electrically stable Ag nanowire (Ag NW) network was fabricated by passivating with a conductive amorphous InSnTiO (ISTO) layer. It could be used in flexible transparent conductive electrodes for flexible organic photovoltaics. By plasma damage-free sputtering of amorphous ISTO on Ag NWs, sulfurization of Ag NWs was effectively prevented without sacrificing sheet resistance (44.5 Ω/sq.), optical transmittance (87.2\%), or mechanical flexibility. Flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) fabricated on ISTO covered Ag NW network anodes showed slightly higher power conversion efficiency (5.94\%) than reference OSCs with ITO anodes (5.79\%). These results demonstrate that passivation of Ag NWs by amorphous conductive ISTO is a useful approach to improving the reliability of Ag NW network electrodes for high-performance flexible OSCs because the amorphous compact structure can effectively prevent the diffusion of sulfur from ambient air.},

  abstract     = {In donor–acceptor (D–A) heterojunction organic solar cells, hot and cold charge transfer (CT) states are formed at the interface as the precursor for subsequent charge separations. Hot CT states dissociate easily because they are loosely bound, while for cold CT states, the origin of their high-efficiency charge separations still remains heavily debated. Here, we propose a simple but effective methodology that can be used to simulate the cold CT dissociation process and, thereby, the multiple factors which may essentially affect the charge separation efficiency and can be conveniently investigated. The energy barriers on the path from cold CT to the separated charges are analyzed by calculating the adiabatic potential energy surfaces of the lowest-energy excitonic state. The calculation results indicate that the D–A molecular coupling strength and coupling area, D–A energetic offset, charge carrier delocalizations, interfacial Coulomb screening strength, and interfacial disorders can essentially affect the charge separation efficiency of a cold CT state.},

The position of the junction is found to be dependent on the length of the upper Be-doped segment evidencing the diffusion of Be atoms from the upper segment to the bottom part of the nanowire. Comparison between non-passivated and passivated nanowires shows a strong enhancement of the collection region after passivation. The results also prove the existence of a p-doped shell around the nanowires formed due to a parasitic radial growth. This shell is depleted in non-passivated nanowires; however, it becomes electrically active after surface passivation modifying the carrier collection pattern.},

In this article, we demonstrate a frequency doubler consisting of only one single heterostructure device by stacking two atomically thin MoTe 2 and MoS 2 flakes together. The resultant MoTe 2 /MoS 2 heterostructure exhibits prominent anti-ambipolar characteristic after rapid thermal annealing treatment, which effectively modulates the p-doping level of the MoTe 2 , and thus, the transfer characteristic of the MoTe 2 /MoS 2 heterojunction. The anti-ambipolar behavior gives the transfer curve of the MoTe 2 /MoS 2 heterojunction an inverted “V” shape, based on which the source—drain current of the junction oscillates at a frequency that is twice that of the signal frequency inputted through the gate electrode. As a result, the frequency of the output voltage on the loading resistance doubles the input signal frequency. The developed frequency doubler functions well within 3 kHz, which may be improved by optimizing the device structure. This approach greatly reduces the total number of devices required to achieve the function of frequency doubling, and therefore, may achieve higher degree of integration.},

In this study, we demonstrated the synthesis of wafer-scale direct growth of GaN on MoS 2 using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Systematic studies were employed to understand the growth diagram of GaN on large area multi-layer MoS 2 , and various growth parameters such as substrate temperature and Ga to N flux ratio were investigated to study the degradation mechanism of the underlying MoS 2 layer. The growth diagram of GaN on MoS 2 was proposed based on the studies. The microstructure of GaN (i.e., N-rich and 550 °C) was evaluated by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Phase segregation was found in the N-rich GaN layer. A two-step growth process involving N-rich condition at a lower temperature and Ga-rich condition at a higher growth temperature was attempted to obtain the smooth and high crystalline quality of GaN. While the two-step growth method led to substantial improvement in the film quality, the removal of MoS 2 was observed and the degradation of MoS 2 substrate was attributed to Ga diffusion through dislocation lines based on energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy mapping. This work helps illuminate critical issues in the epitaxial growth of conventional semiconductors on 2D crystals for various device applications.},

Recently, two-dimensional few-layer h-BeO predicted as an ultrawide bandgap material has been synthesized in the experiment. In the present work, the first-principles calculations show that monolayer h-BeO has an indirect bandgap of 7.05 eV with the HSE functional. The ultrawide bandgap results from the atomic electronegativity difference in the polar h-BeO. The electronic transport properties are also systematically investigated by using the Boltzmann transport theory. The polar LO phonons generate the macroscopic polarization field and strongly couple to electrons by the Fröhlich interaction. Limited by the electron-phonon scattering, monolayer h-BeO has a high mobility of 452 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room temperature. Further studies indicate that the biaxial tensile strain can reduce the electron effective mass and enhance the electron-phonon coupling strength. A suitable strain promotes the mobility to ∼1000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room temperature.},

Meanwhile, the dielectric maximum temperature T m went down and the dielectric peak exhibited an enhanced diffused nature with a stronger frequency dispersion, where the saturated P–E loop (x = 0 and 0.1) transformed to a slim relaxor loop (x = 0.25) and finally to the linear one (x = 0.5). Raman spectra results revealed the reduced covalence between the B -site cation and the oxygen ion as a result of Ta-substitution. The coexistence of Nb 5+ and Ta 5+ , which possessed the distinct covalence with the oxygen ion, played the key role in the structural variation and crossover from normal to relaxor ferroelectrics in the present system.},

The lattice parameters exhibit anomalies near the Néel temperatures. The Bi 0.8 La 0.2 FeO 3 film has a spin order-to-disorder transition at the T N without a structural phase transition, suggesting that a spin-lattice coupling drives the thermal expansion anomalies. The spin-lattice coupling can be enhanced by the coexistence of phases in the thicker BFO films. The density functional theory calculations show a smaller lattice constant of the c axis in the spin-order state than that in the spin-disorder state for the same tetragonal-like phase, which supports that the thermal expansion anomalies are a consequence of the spin-lattice coupling. Our findings may have application prospects for functional materials with controllable thermal expansions.},

  abstract     = {The control of pure spin currents carried by magnons in magnetic insulator (MI) garnet films with a robust perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is of great interest to spintronic technology as they can be used to carry, transport, and process information. Garnet films with PMA have labyrinth domain magnetic structures that enrich the magnetization dynamics and could be employed in more efficient wave-based logic and memory computing devices. In MI/non-magnetic (NM) bilayers, where NM is a normal metal providing a strong spin–orbit coupling, the PMA benefits the spin–orbit torque-driven magnetization switching by lowering the needed current and rendering the process faster, crucial for developing magnetic random-access memories. In this work, we investigated the magnetic anisotropies in thulium iron garnet (TIG) films with PMA via ferromagnetic resonance measurements, followed by the excitation and detection of magnon-mediated pure spin currents in TIG/Pt driven by microwaves and heat currents. TIG films presented a Gilbert damping constant of α ≈ 0.01 ⁠ , with resonance fields above 3.5 kOe and half linewidths broader than 60 Oe, at 300 K and 9.5 GHz. The spin-to-charge current conversion through TIG/Pt was observed as a microvoltage generated at the edges of the Pt film.

The magnetic responses are consistent with two distinct populations of atoms, one displaying the ideal Re 3+ magnetic moment and the other displaying a sub-ideal magnetic moment. If all sub-ideal ions are taken to be on the surface, the data are consistent with ≈ 2 − 10 nm surface layers of reduced magnetization. The magnetization of the rare-earth oxide nanoparticles at low temperatures (1.3–1.9 T) exceeds that of the best iron-based nanoparticles, making rare-earth oxides candidates for use in next-generation cryogenic magnetic devices that demand a combination of hysteresis-less response and high magnetization.},

  abstract     = {An MgAl 2 O 4 barrier with an ordered spinel structure for magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was prepared via a two-step process by repeating Mg–Al alloy deposition and post-oxidation to tune its oxidation state. The obtained Fe/MgAl 2 O 4 /Fe(001) epitaxial MTJs showed a large tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio (&gt;150\%) in a wide resistance × area ( RA ) range; this behavior was in contrast with that of MTJs prepared through a conventional one-step process, which exhibited a large TMR ratio only in a narrow RA range. The bias voltage at which the TMR is halved from the zero-bias value increased up to 1.20 and 1.47 V for the positive and negative bias polarities, respectively, when optimizing the two-step process. The nanostructure analysis revealed an improved oxygen distribution on the atomic scale in the MgAl 2 O 4 barrier with the two-step process, providing a coherent barrier suitable for various practical applications.},

The emitted THz signal is calibrated against static magnetometry data measurements, giving a direct measure of the absolute magnetic moment of the sample on the sub-picosecond timescale.

Varying the intensities of the pulses and the delay between them, we study the degree of demagnetization caused by the pulse duo. It is shown that the result of the excitation does not depend on the pulse sequence. Our findings indicate that both intra- and interband electronic transitions result in ultrafast demagnetization of the semiconductor via the very same mechanism, which evolves at a ps timescale. Independent of the origin of the electronic transition, ultrafast demagnetization is a result of a temperature increase in the free charge carriers (holes).},

However, the existence of a dead layer not only degrades device performance but also hinders the ultimate miniaturization of devices. Intense research has been made to eliminate the dead layer and understand its origin. Here, we have investigated the dead layer of (110)-oriented LSMO films on SrTiO 3 (STO) substrates in which there is no polar discontinuity across the interface, in contrast to the (001)-oriented LSMO/STO interface. Our results reveal an 8 unit cell (u.c.) dead layer for (110) LSMO. Angle resolved x-ray photoemission demonstrating Sr segregation at the surface. Additionally, the broken symmetry at LSMO/vacuum interfaces also degrades the transport property. By introducing a capping layer, the film conductivity is enhanced. Finally, an ultrathin limit dead layer of 5 u.c. (=1.36 nm) has been obtained by introducing both the LaMnO 3 capping layer and the buffer layer to compensate the excess holes at both LSMO/STO and Vacuum/LSMO interfaces and also to reduce the structural distortion at the top surface of LSMO. Our work paves the way toward eliminating the LSMO dead layer for spintronics application and provides a route to engineer the intriguing physical properties of oxide heterointerfaces.},

This power loss reduction comes from the decrease in hysteresis loss of composites, and this reduction is influenced by transverse magnetization state. This hysteresis loss reduction is attributed to domain wall displacements and spin rotations being completely locked in the direction of the transverse field, and this effect has great application potential in high-power electrical systems.},

  abstract     = {Epitaxially integrated III–V semiconductor lasers for silicon photonics have the potential to dramatically transform information networks, but currently, dislocations limit performance and reliability even in defect-tolerant InAs quantum dot (QD)-based lasers. Despite being below the critical thickness, QD layers in these devices contain previously unexplained misfit dislocations, which facilitate non-radiative recombination. We demonstrate here that these misfit dislocations form during post-growth cooldown due to the combined effects of (1) thermal-expansion mismatch between the III–V layers and silicon and (2) mechanical hardening in the active region. By incorporating an additional sub-critical thickness, indium-alloyed “misfit dislocation trapping layer,” we leverage these mechanical hardening effects to our advantage, displacing 95\% of misfit dislocations from the QD layer in model structures. Unlike conventional dislocation mitigation strategies, the trapping layer reduces neither the number of threading dislocations nor the number of misfit dislocations. It simply shifts the position of misfit dislocations away from the QD layer, reducing the defects&#39; impact on luminescence. In full lasers, adding a misfit dislocation trapping layer both above and below the QD active region displaces misfit dislocations and substantially improves performance: we measure a twofold reduction in lasing threshold currents and a greater than threefold increase in output power. Our results suggest that devices employing both traditional threading dislocation reduction techniques and optimized misfit dislocation trapping layers may finally lead to fully integrated, commercially viable silicon-based photonic integrated circuits.},

A charge transfer analysis reveals a small amount of charge transfer from the H-diamond (100) surface to the 2D layers, and most of the transferred charge was found to be confined within the vdW gap. In the graphene/H-diamond (100) heterostructure, the semi-metallic characteristic of the graphene layer is preserved. On the other hand, the hBN/H-diamond (100) heterostructure shows semiconducting characteristics with an indirect bandgap of 3.55 eV, where the hBN layer forms a Type-II band alignment with the H-diamond (100) surface. The resultant conduction band offset and valence band offset are 0.10 eV and 1.38 eV, respectively.

  abstract     = {We investigate laser-induced acoustic wave propagation through smooth and roughened titanium-coated glass substrates. Acoustic waves are generated in a controlled manner via the laser spallation technique. Surface displacements are measured during stress wave loading by the alignment of a Michelson-type interferometer. A reflective coverslip panel facilitates capture of surface displacements during loading of as-received smooth and roughened specimens. Through interferometric experiments, we extract the substrate stress profile at each laser fluence (energy per area). The shape and amplitude of the substrate stress profile are analyzed at each laser fluence. Peak substrate stress is averaged and compared between smooth specimens with the reflective panel and rough specimens with the reflective panel. The reflective panel is necessary because the surface roughness of the rough specimens precludes in situ interferometry. Through these experiments, we determine that the surface roughness employed has no significant effect on substrate stress propagation and smooth substrates are an appropriate surrogate to determine stress wave loading amplitude of roughened surfaces less than 1.2 μ m average roughness (Ra). No significant difference was observed when comparing the average peak amplitude and loading slope in the stress wave profile for the smooth and rough configurations at each fluence.},

  abstract     = {A low-pass filtering compensation (LPFC) method is proposed to compensate for phase aberrations in point diffraction-based common-path digital holographic microscopy. This method estimates the phase aberration from the object hologram by Fourier transform and low-pass spatial filtering. The estimated phase aberration is subtracted from the object phase image to achieve single-hologram phase compensation. The accuracy and capability of LPFC for phase compensation were demonstrated by experiments on a Ronchi grating and a human blood smear. LPFC provides phase compensation for both smooth objects and objects containing abrupt edges, in the special case of a system with relatively high-frequency objects and low-frequency slight phase aberrations. LPFC operates without the need for fitting procedures, iterative steps, or prior knowledge of the optical parameters, which substantially simplifies the process of phase compensation in quantitative phase imaging.},

We harness the peculiar out-of-plane component of polarization of interlayer excitons in conjunction with the anisotropy of the vacuum of the electromagnetic field enabled by the metasurface to induce coherent coupling between mutually orthogonal interlayer excitonic optical selection rule. This coupling leads to a much larger domain within the valley psuedo-spin Bloch sphere being accessible in these heterostructures.

Small perpendicular magnetic fields, in the range of 0.5 mT, enhance Q i by approximately 15\%, possibly due to the introduction of quasiparticle traps in the form of fluxons. Further increasing the perpendicular field deteriorates the resonators&#39; quality factor.

Switching between the amorphous and crystalline states of phase change materials could generate force contrast sufficient for actuation, though for practical applications, the influence of protective capping layers and volume compression have to be better understood. Resilience against the pull-in instability is also a critical point defined by the material choice, dissipation in the system, and roughness of the surfaces. The adhesion induced by the Casimir forces is omnipresent, and it can play a pivotal role in unwanted stiction demanding deeper understanding. The open problems are the distance upon contact and the relative area of the real contact since both of them control the adhesion.

Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) is an emerging technique for measuring cell stiffness on the micro- and nanometer scale in a non-contact fashion. However, as SICM stiffness measurements are based on a localized deformation of the sample, they are affected by the thickness of the sample. We found experimentally and numerically that the apparent stiffness of a thin sample is overestimated. We present a straightforward correction method to account for this effect and derive a thickness-dependent, multiplicative correction factor, which we apply to SICM stiffness mapping of living cells. The correction method allows us to quantitatively measure the stiffness of thin samples with SICM and is, therefore, essential for the comprehensive application of SICM to nanomechanical measurements.},

Along these lines, we propose two prototypes of acoustic topological devices and experimentally exhibit two promising applications of the topological corner states for frequency-selected energy harvesting in different conditions.

A continuing opportunity of this area is in the development of strategies for fabricating tubular origami, in solvent-free and low-cost conditions. This paper proposed a semidry release approach, allowing for the sacrificial layer-free, vapor-assisted self-rolling, and recyclable use of substrates, to create microscale tubular origami. Interface engineering designs that involve hydrophilic and hydrophobic material stacks are introduced to realize the semidry release of nanomembranes, which finally self-roll into multifunctional tubular structures. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate the controllability of their dimensions. Finally, a bioresorbable microtube with potential for transient implantable devices is demonstrated. Our present work adds to the portfolio of routes for the construction of tubular origami, which can be utilized as functional platforms for fundamental studies and practical applications.},

We observed Bi segregation at the interface of the twin defect interface in the GaAsBi shell. The phenomenon produced a horizontally spread Bi-accumulated nanostructure in the nanowire, which is probably induced by the large lattice mismatch between GaAs and GaAsBi. Bi is expected to penetrate through the twin defect interface, which results in the existence of Bi along twin defects and also inside the GaAs core. The existence of twin defects induced structural deformations and resulted in the formation of corrugated complex sidewall surfaces on the nanowire.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we have predicted a giant thermal magnetoresistance for the thermal photon transport based on the tunable magnetoplasmon of graphene. By applying an external magnetic field, we find that the heat flux can be modulated by approximately three orders of magnitude. Accordingly, both negative and giant relative thermal magnetoresistance ratios are achieved for magnetic fields with a maximum strength of 4 Tesla. This effect is mainly caused by the suppression and enhancement of scattering interactions mediated by a graphene magnetoplasmon. Specifically, it has never been achieved before for nanoparticles, which have no response to magnetic fields. The effect is remarkable at these reasonable strengths of fields and, thus, has considerable significance for real-life applications. It is also expected to enable technological advances for thermal measurement-based magnetic sensors and magnetically thermal management.},

  abstract     = {We have measured the electrochemical capacitance in a quantum coherent capacitor consisting of a quantum dot connected to an electron reservoir by a gate tunable quantum point contact and Coulomb coupled to a gate. The results show that for a weak transparent channel, the capacitance exhibits sharp Coulomb blockade oscillations with gate voltage related to the oscillations of the dot density of states, which is almost independent of the applied magnetic field. As the transmitting channel becomes more transparent, the capacitance oscillations decrease in magnitude reflecting the broadening of the resonances. Remarkably, we find that the capacitance oscillation persists even for a fully transparent quantum channel. From the magnetic field and temperature dependence, we conclude that such a capacitance oscillation is a mesoscopic coherent effect that arises due to the interference of electrons in a nearly open dot.},

  abstract     = {Bright emission from non-classical light sources is a key requirement for their practical use in quantum optics. In this Letter, we report on an alternative approach to realize high-brightness nanowire emitters in the telecom band. We discuss the growth and optical properties of a single InA s 0.68 P 0.32 quantum dot in an InA s 0.50 P 0.50 quantum rod, all embedded in an InP nanowire waveguide. Modifying the bandgap energy of the matrix surrounding the quantum dot by inserting it into an InA s 0.50 P 0.50 quantum rod, instead of InP, reduces the barrier height for carriers in the dot. As a result, light emission at λ = 1310 nm is reached from an InA s 0.68 P 0.32 dot grown with the same deposition conditions as that used for λ = 950 nm emission in the conventional structure. We demonstrate that the dot-in-a-rod (DROD) configuration increases (up to fivefold) the emission rate of the emitters at 1310–1550 nm as compared to those grown with the higher dot aspect ratio required when not using the DROD structure. Carrier generation localized to the dot (quasi-resonant scheme) is achieved by optically pumping the rod below the InP bandgap.},

A huge redshift of the near band edge emission, from 2.1 eV to 1.5 eV, with an increasing Se content in the dots is observed. It is accompanied by an increase in the excitonic lifetime by the factor of 10. We associate these effects with a gradual change from the direct type I confinement character in CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots to the staggered type II band alignment in the case of Cd(Se,Te)/ZnTe dots. This interpretation is consistent with the micro-photoluminescence study of several individual quantum dots, which reveals a gradual decrease in the biexciton–exciton energy difference with the increasing content of Se in the dots, which leads ultimately to the change from the binding to antibinding character of biexcitons. The latter effect originates, most likely, from the increasing Coulomb repulsion between excitons forming dipoles at the dot/barrier interface.},

In this work, Janus structure polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composites filled with barium titanate (BT) and cobalt ferrite (CFO), respectively, were prepared by electrospinning and hot pressing techniques. The Janus structural composites (J-type) have higher magnetic and dielectric properties than the conventional blended fibrous composites (H-type). When the PVDF matrix was replaced by polystyrene, the effect of Janus structure on dielectric and magnetic properties was even more pronounced. An optimum dielectric constant up to 25.1 and a saturation magnetization of 7.12 emu/g were obtained, which can be attributed to the modification and Janus structure of m-BT/PVDF+m-CFO/PVDF multifunctional composite materials.},

However, their low dielectric constant or polarization restricts the stored electrical energy, which makes them less attractive for high energy density storage applications compared to relaxor ferroelectrics or anti-ferroelectrics. Here, we realized an ultrahigh energy density ( U e ∼ 59.4 J/cm 3 ) and high efficiency (∼89\%) simultaneously in the Ca 0.74 Sr 0.26 Zr 0.7 Ti 0.3 O 3 (CSZT) linear dielectric thin film, which are competitive with those of other lead-based and lead-free dielectric films deposited on Si wafers. Moreover, the CSZT thin-film capacitor exhibits great thermal stability with the U e variation less than 3\% from −90 °C to 170 °C and good fatigue endurance with the U e variation of 4.5\% after 3 × 10 7 cycles at 10 kHz.

This work presents preliminary results on the preparation and piezoelectric effect of ferroelectrets based on the polylactic acid (PLA) polymer. A distinctive feature of the manufactured films is that they are biodegradable. After a microstructure modification of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) foamed PLA sheets by hot-pressing treatment and corona polarization, these cellular films reveal large piezoelectric d 33 and d 31 responses in both quasi-static and dynamic modes. For freshly charged films, the maximum quasi-static piezoelectric coefficients are about 600 pC/N ( ⁠ d 33 ⁠ ) and 44 pC/N ( ⁠ d 31 ⁠ ) for a relatively thick film of 360 μ m and a nominal porosity of about 60\%. During the first 20 days after polarization, the piezoelectric activity decreases by half compared to the primary value, but then remains almost unchanged for a long time. Due to an already established inherent biocompatibility of PLA polymers, these eco-friendly ferroelectrets can be potentially used in various biological applications such as biosensors and microenergy harvesters embedded in tissue and artificial muscles.},

The effective spin Hall angle “ θ SH ” of the YIG/Cr interface is found to be three orders of magnitude larger than the spin Hall angle θ SH of the bulk Cr layer in YIG/Cu/Cr.

Three trap states were revealed to be responsible for carrier compensation. Besides the residual carbon (C) acceptor, two deep electron traps detected in the DLTS high-temperature range, labeled E2 and E3 with energies E C of 0.98 and 1.38 eV, respectively, were also found to have contributions to the carrier compensation. A comprehensive investigation combining with positron annihilation spectroscopy measurements revealed that E2 and E3 are related to the (–/2–) and (0/–) acceptor levels of the V Ga –O N complex, respectively. The relatively high concentrations of E2 and E3 imply that the V Ga –O N complex is an essential carrier compensation source in the drift layer and plays a crucial role in developing kV-class vertical GaN power devices.},

As the economic viability of ruthenium (Ru) is more than that of iridium (Ir), a 150-nm Ru (0001) thin film was sputter-deposited on an Al 2 O 3 (0001) substrate using a RF/DC magnetron sputtering system. X-ray diffraction analyses of the Ru film revealed the (0001) phase orientation with high crystalline quality. Both bias-enhanced nucleation and initial heteroepitaxial growth of diamond were realized via antenna-edge-type microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition. After 30 min of heteroepitaxial growth, the crystallite (diameter ∼500 nm) with a smooth surface was observed through scanning electron microscopy. Electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) orientation mapping indicated the presence of the highly oriented diamond (111) crystallite. The epitaxial orientations between diamond (111) and Ru were determined as [111] diamond //[0001] Ru and [11 2 ¯ ] diamond //[10 1 ¯ 0] Ru . The EBSD pole-figure pattern represented the formation of a double positioning defect. This study demonstrated the feasibility of heteroepitaxial growth of diamond (111) on Ru, which provides a more economically viable approach to fabricating large-size diamond substrates.},

Measurement of the piezoelectric d 33 coefficient shows a 150\% increase for lattice-matched Sc 0.18 Al 0.82 N relative to pure aluminum nitride, whereas higher Sc contents exhibit lower piezoelectric coefficients. The electromechanical response of the epitaxial films correlates with the crystal quality and the presence of zinc blende inclusions, as observed by high-resolution electron microscopy. It is further found that the polarity of the epitaxial Sc x Al 1−x N layers is locked to the underlying substrate. The measured electromechanical properties of epitaxial Sc x Al 1−x N, their relation to the atomic crystal structure and defects, and its crystal polarity provide useful guidance toward the applications of this material.},

However, the number of ultrasound transducers and their spatial arrangement limit the accuracy of the particle alignment with any 3D user-specified orientation. We define a set of 3D user-specified orientations and use numerical simulations to quantitatively evaluate the effect of the number of ultrasound transducers, their spatial arrangement including a sphere, cube, and two parallel plates, and the size of the spatial arrangement on the orientation error of a high aspect ratio particle in a standing ultrasound wave field. We demonstrate that a spatial arrangement of ultrasound transducers with more than two unique wave propagating directions is required to orient a high aspect ratio particle in 3D, and we determine that the orientation error decreases with the increasing number of unique wave propagation directions. Furthermore, we show that in a spherical arrangement of ultrasound transducers, the orientation error is independent of the size of the arrangement of transducers. This knowledge facilitates using ultrasound DSA as a fabrication method for engineered composite materials that derive their function from the location and orientation of particle inclusions.},

  abstract     = {Ultrasonic phased-array (PA) systems have been widely adopted in the field of nondestructive evaluation for material characterization and imaging of internal defects. Whereas many defects exhibit complex three-dimensional structures, most PA systems provide only two-dimensional images. In this Letter, we demonstrate the ability to create high-resolution 3D images of internal defects using a PA system based on a piezoelectric and laser ultrasonic system (PLUS). The PLUS combines a piezoelectric transmitter to insonify the structure to be inspected with a laser Doppler vibrometer to create a matrix array of receiver points without contact. The small size of the laser beam results in an ultra-multiple number of elements on the order of thousands, which is impossible to achieve with a conventional piezoelectric matrix array transducer. An emission from a piezoelectric transmitter compensates for the intrinsically low sensitivity of a laser Doppler vibrometer. After formulating the 3D imaging algorithm of the PLUS, we demonstrate that the PLUS with 4096 receiving points (i.e., 64 × 64 points) achieves high-resolution 3D imaging in a specimen with a flat bottom hole. We also visualize the complex structure of stress corrosion cracking. We believe that the 3D imaging capability of the PLUS may open up new avenues to the accurate evaluation of material strength, the identification of the types of defects, and the elucidation of the mechanisms of defect initiation.},

  abstract     = {Epitaxial metal/semiconductor superlattice heterostructures with lattice-matched abrupt interfaces and suitable Schottky barrier heights are attractive for thermionic energy conversion, hot electron-based solar energy conversion, and optical hyperbolic metamaterials. HfN/ScN is one of the earliest demonstrations of epitaxial single-crystalline metal/semiconductor heterostructures and has attracted significant interest in recent years to harness its excellent properties in device applications. Although the understanding of the mechanism of thermal transport in HfN/ScN superlattices is extremely important for their practical applications, not much attention has been devoted to measuring their phonon dispersion and related properties. In this Letter, we employ non-resonant meV-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering to determine the momentum-dependent phonon modes in epitaxial metallic HfN and lattice-matched HfN/ScN metal/semiconductor superlattices. HfN exhibits a large phononic bandgap (∼40 meV) and Kohn anomaly in the longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonon modes at q ∼ 0.73 along the [100] and [110] directions of the Brillouin zone due to the nesting of the Fermi surface by the wave vector ( ⁠ q ⁠ ). The in-plane [100] acoustic phonon dispersion of the HfN/ScN superlattices is found to be dominated by the HfN phonons, while the optical phonons exhibit both ScN and HfN characteristics. First-principles density functional perturbation theory modeling is performed to explain the experimental phonon spectra, and temperature-dependent thermal conductivity is measured using a pump-probe spectroscopic technique. These results will help understand the phonons in HfN and HfN/ScN metal/semiconductor superlattices for thermionic energy conversion.},

However, as the synergetic effect of water and oxygen leads to performance degradation under an ambient atmosphere, it is urgent to develop a passivation strategy for robust stability. Herein, a scalable superhydrophobic passivation layer is designed to improve the stability of BP transistors, which consists of fluoroalkylsilane-coated titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanoparticles. Due to the superhydrophobic property of the passivation layer, the BP transistors preserve intrinsic performance in extremely wet conditions, including humid air, water, HCl, and KOH. After 28 days in atmospheric conditions, the performance presents only 20\% channel current degradation and the device can work even after 60 days. This work not only experimentally demonstrates robust stable BP transistors in harsh conditions but also provides a highly efficient and damage-free strategy to suppress the influence of water adsorption in atmospheric conditions for highly stable 2D materials devices.},

We show here that using a dry source of oxygen at pressures in the range of 0.01–1 Torr leads to a 10-fold increase in the etch rate compared to etching in atmospheric air. The enhanced etch rate is also found to be accompanied by a marked change in the nanopatterned surface morphology. We developed a rate equation model for the etch rate that provides good agreement with measurements for pressures up to approximately 0.1 Torr. For higher pressures, the reduced etch rate and departure from the model are attributed to the contamination of the diamond surface by trace amounts of water vapor, introduced as an impurity from the gas sources. The results provide a method for markedly increasing the etch rate, as well as a better understanding of the role of gas impurities on the etch mechanism and emergent nanopattern formation.},

We present a 1D ultra-thin (&lt;100 nm) compact finite design of seven periods of amorphous Si slabs with subwavelength periodicity surrounded by Al mirrors, which allow the finite array to approximate an infinite array and enabling a small footprint (∼5 μ m), for near-infrared applications ( λ = 800–2000 nm). We demonstrate spectral tunability (amplitude, bandwidth, and peak location) via geometric parameter variation and demonstrate the performance of these filters both in experiment and in simulation.

InP-based QDs are one of the most promising candidates for low-toxicity QDs. Here, we report an efficient green QD-LED whose emitting layer was composed of InP-based QDs and an organic electron-transporting material (ETM). To investigate ETMs suitable for combining with the QDs, the device characteristics of QD-LEDs with various ETMs were compared. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the driving voltage were found to be markedly improved by the incorporation of suitable ETMs. We demonstrated green QD-LEDs with a high maximum EQE of 10.0\% and a low turn-on voltage of 2.4 V by using 2,4,6-tris(3′-(pyridin-3-yl)biphenyl-3-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (TmPPPyTz) as an ETM. Furthermore, to clarify the origin of the difference in device characteristics, we investigated their hole- and electron-transporting properties. The results suggested that the hole-current leakage from the QD layer was substantially suppressed in the QD-LEDs with TmPPPyTz. Using an ETM with such hole-suppressing ability is demonstrated to be an effective approach to improving the EQEs of QD-LEDs.},

We experimentally demonstrate a modulation depth of 90\% at 1 THz obtained with a continuous laser at irradiation lower than 10 W cm − 2 ⁠ . Beyond the strong attenuation of the THz transmission provided by the ENZ absorption effect, we also report a broadband modulation of the THz waves from 1 to 10 THz. In addition, our experimental results show that the cut-off frequency of 3 dB attains 2 MHz in the dynamic modulation regime.},

However, the addressable frequency range of the AMM is set at the time of manufacture by the geometry, materials, and construction. In this work, a reconfigurable magnetorheological elastomer (MRE)-based AMM is proposed to alter the addressable frequency range without the need for remanufacture. By changing the spatial placement and the mass of neodymium magnets attached to the MRE plate by magnetic attraction, it is possible to engineer the mode shape of the MRE-AMM and tune the absorption, transmission loss, and effective density. It is shown through simulations and experiments that the MRE-AMM can affect wavelengths in air up to 13 170× greater than its own thickness.},

It reveals a continuous increasing trend in open-circuit voltage with the decrease in Poisson&#39;s ratio of the electrodes. Further, graphene-assembled macro-film (GAMF), an NPR material with excellent flexibility and high conductivity, is used as the electrodes to fabricate flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters. Compared with the energy harvesters using silver electrode, the harvesters made by GAMF electrodes, with an NPR of −0.39, achieve nearly 1.7-times enhancement in open-circuit voltage and 1.6-times in short-circuit current for output performance. The experimental results are highly consistent with the simulation results, indicating that the GAMF has great prospects in developing flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters with enhanced electrical output performance.},

A second point, more important from the driving circuit point of view, is that the voltage-off response time drastically reduces and even becomes practically invariant over the thermal range of the nematic phase. A smart window fabricated using this biopolymer network system exhibits good contrast between the scattering and transparent states driven by voltage and shows an exceptionally high haze factor. A highlight of the device fabrication is that the employed protocol is facile, making it appealing for a potentially viable smart window application.},

The resonators are tuned to support a TE mode within the frequency of 3 T MRI and implemented as a pair of coaxial hollow cylinders consisting of ceramic rings with extremely high permittivity (ε ∼ 870) and low loss. We study the electromagnetic coupling between two resonators placed in the near field and analyze the impact of symmetric and antisymmetric mode excitation on the sensitivity of the MRI machine. We experimentally verify that the coupling of the mode with symmetric field distribution to the radio frequency body birdcage coil allows us to enhance the receive sensitivity substantially and to decrease the excitation power needed to provide the optimal transmit efficiency, thus making the MRI procedure safer.

To evaluate the operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), measurements on their current density–voltage ( J − V) curves are periodically repeated in most literature studies. However, how the periodic J – V measurements affect the operational stability of PSCs has not been well understood to date. In this study, we found that repeating the J − V measurements, especially applying a voltage higher than the open-circuit voltage of PSCs, under continuous illumination, causes serious ion migration, which lowers the operational stability of PSCs. On the other hand, we observed no decrease in operational stability when the applied voltage is close to or lower than the open-circuit voltage of PSCs during the periodic J − V measurements because of the suppressed ion migration. These findings are important in evaluating the intrinsic operational stability of PSCs.},

  abstract     = {Recent technological innovations in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have enabled their applicability to be expanded to not only displays but also the lighting industry. In addition, the high scalability and flexibility of OLEDs render them promising candidates for next-generation displays. However, their insufficient lifetime and low uniformity/stability are challenging issues, mainly because of inadequate understanding regarding the fundamental degradation mechanism of OLEDs owing to their complex device structure. Herein, based on impedance spectroscopy (IS), we report the origin of the relaxation frequency ( f R ) shift in blue OLEDs as a function of electrical stress time for up to 1000 h with a constant current stress condition of 1 mA. These experimental conditions allow us to separately study the degradation mechanisms of the emission and transport layer (TPL) interfaces. On the basis of thorough understanding of the theoretical expression of f R , we mainly attribute the variation in f R at the charge-balancing voltage to the degradation of the TPL interface; this is further rationalized by the negligible difference between f R values obtained from IS and the equivalent circuit theory.

  abstract     = {Designing two-dimensional materials with magnetic and topological properties has continuously attracted intense interest in fundamental science and potential applications. Here, on the basis of first-principles calculations, we predict the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and Dirac nodal loops (NLs) in monolayer MnB, where the band crossing points are very close to the Fermi level. Remarkably, a moderate strain can induce an antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition, driving monolayer MnB to a ferromagnetic metal with Weyl NLs. Such a type of topological quantum phase transition has not been observed before. In addition, the symmetry-protected properties of the two types of NLs as well as the magnetic critical temperatures are investigated. The controllable magnetic and topological order in monolayer MnB offers a unique platform for exploring topological quantum phase transitions and realizing nanospintronic devices.},

Dynamic pyroelectric measurements provide evidence for persistent macroscopic polarity of the samples. Annealing experiments below and above Burns temperature of polarized samples relate this polarity to the presence of polar nano-entities and their dynamics. The dc electric field strength required for macroscopic polarization reversal is similar to the amplitude of the ac field where dynamic nonlinear dielectric permittivity reaches its maximum. Consequently, the aforementioned maximum is related to the reorientation of polar nano-entities. The results question the existence of an ergodic state in PMN below Burns temperature.},

The metamaterials are formed by a periodic array of thin magnetic layers (“resonators”) embedded in a nonmagnetic matrix. Acoustic waves carrying energy through the structure hybridize with the magnetic modes of the resonators (“Fano resonance”). This leads to a rich set of effects, enhanced by Bragg scattering and being most pronounced when the magnetic resonance frequency is close to or lies within acoustic bandgaps. The acoustic reflection from the structure exhibits magnetically induced transparency and Borrmann effect. Our analysis shows that the combined effect of the Bragg scattering and Fano resonance may overcome the magnetic damping, ubiquitous in realistic systems.

Based on the results, we propose a model for a multifunctional coupler as a single system incorporating giant magnetoresistance, a spin–valley filter, and a spin–valley valve. The device is made up of ferromagnetic/ferromagnetic/normal junctions, with an off-resonant light and an electric gate potential functioning as the spin–valley filter and spin–valley valve, respectively. Increasing the asymmetrical magnetization is found to substantially enhance the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of the system, leading to giant TMR. The spin–valley filtering is based on the spin imbalance modulation that arises from asymmetrical magnetization and the valley degeneracy breaking of off-resonant light, and the spin–valley valve is produced by altering the effective density of states of spin/valley polarized bands via the gate potential that controls the flow of spin/valley polarized particles. By fixing the magnetization configurations, one specific spin–valley filter and spin–valley valve can be acquired by tuning an external parameter to the corresponding spin/valley polarized energy windows.},

Secondary electron imaging and cathodoluminescence mapping are used to correlate the morphology and the optical properties of regions resulting from lateral and vertical growth.

This effect, and how it differs between the two dopants, is investigated by hybrid functional density functional theory calculations and grand canonical thermodynamics models and is found to be due to the onset of multi-member Ga vacancy-donor substitutional complexes under degenerate doping conditions. The differing energetics of Ge- and Si-related complexes leads to different responses, ultimately making Ge the more effective donor in degenerate conditions.},

Low temperature time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) experiments reveal a strong variation of the carrier decay times with detection photon energy, suggesting a strong impact of carrier localization, which is found to depend primarily on the QW width. In combination with time-integrated PL measurements and numerical band structure calculations, we are able to provide conclusive evidence that the localization strength in AlGaN-based QW structures is directly coupled to the oscillator strength, providing an explanation for its strong dependence on the QW width. This is further supported by the observation of a strong polarization field dependency of the carrier localization, which excludes excitons and may be explained by the accumulation of electrons close to the QW interface, while holes are independently localized across the QW. We complete our discussion by proposing a model to explain the well-known phenomenon of efficiency droop in accordance with our findings, suggesting delocalization-induced Auger recombination as the responsible loss channel.},

  abstract     = {Power electronics seek to improve power conversion of devices by utilizing materials with a wide bandgap, high carrier mobility, and high thermal conductivity. Due to its wide bandgap of 4.5 eV, β-Ga 2 O 3 has received much attention for high-voltage electronic device research. However, it suffers from inefficient thermal conduction that originates from its low-symmetry crystal structure. Rutile germanium oxide (r-GeO 2 ) has been identified as an alternative ultra-wide-bandgap (4.68 eV) semiconductor with a predicted high electron mobility and ambipolar dopability; however, its thermal conductivity is unknown. Here, we characterize the thermal conductivity of r-GeO 2 as a function of temperature by first-principles calculations, experimental synthesis, and thermal characterization. The calculations predict an anisotropic phonon-limited thermal conductivity for r-GeO 2 of 37 W m −1 K −1 along the a direction and 58 W m −1 K −1 along the c direction at 300 K where the phonon-limited thermal conductivity predominantly occurs via the acoustic modes. Experimentally, we measured a value of 51 W m −1 K −1 at 300 K for hot-pressed, polycrystalline r-GeO 2 pellets. The measured value is close to our directionally averaged theoretical value, and the temperature dependence of ∼1/T is also consistent with our theory prediction, indicating that thermal transport in our r-GeO 2 samples at room temperature and above is governed by phonon scattering. Our results reveal that high-symmetry UWBG materials, such as r-GeO 2 , may be the key to efficient power electronics.},

The variations in both oxygen-rich composition and the crystallinity in AlN make annealing-dependent conduction band offsets of as-deposited and annealed AlN/4H–SiC to be 1.36 eV and 1.20 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, I–E measurements separately yield the occurrence of the Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling and space-charge-limited conduction in as-deposited and annealed metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitors, corresponding to lower barrier heights of 0.92 eV and 0.54 eV, respectively. The reason for the energy-band shift between I–E derivations and the XPS results was analyzed and demonstrated together.

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we report on the evolution of electronic properties governed by epitaxial misfit strain in cubic In 2 O 3 epilayers grown on sapphire. At elevated growth temperature, the competition between the film/substrate lattice mismatch and the thermal expansion mismatch alters the macroscopic biaxial strain from compressive to tensile. Simultaneously, the electron concentration is tuned from degeneration to non-degeneration density below the Mott criterion. The observed surface electron accumulation and metal-insulator transition result from the oxygen deficiency formed at low growth temperature, while high-temperature epitaxy is favorable to achieve remarkably enhanced mobility. The effective strain-property coupling suggests that the improved oxygen stoichiometry and the Fermi level movement controlled by the biaxial strains are responsible for the Mott transition. The strain-mediated reduction of the electron effective mass contributes to the enhanced intrinsic mobility in tensile-strained In 2 O 3 epilayers. These results highlight that strain engineering is an effective stimulus to manipulate the transport properties of oxide semiconductors with improved performance and unexpected functionalities.},

The temperature effects on lattice vibrations were discovered by Raman spectra from 123 K to 423 K. The frequency and full width at half maximum of the A 2 g 1 (LO) mode show a strong nonlinearity with the temperature. The energy band structure and electron–phonon interaction were studied by temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry with the aid of the Tauc–Lorentz model. It was found that five electronic transitions around 1.33, 1.61, 2.53, 3.73, and 4.64 eV generally show a redshift trend with the temperature.

  abstract     = {Vibrational properties and ultrafast photocarrier dynamics of 2 H –TaS 2 under pressures are studied by the experiments of Raman scattering and femtosecond time resolved spectroscopy. With increasing pressure, the linewidth of two-phonon Raman mode broadens, especially features with a sudden rapid increase above 10 GPa. Meanwhile, the ultrafast dynamics show that the fast decay through optical phonon scattering is significantly suppressed in amplitude and prolonged in lifetime; however, the weight of the slow decay component originating from acoustic phonon scattering is enhanced at high pressures. Furthermore, the electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling constant, λ q , and the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, N(0), are evaluated qualitatively, which reveals a drastic decrease in e-ph coupling strength and a sudden increase in the DOS beyond 10 GPa. This turning pressure is consistent with the critical point where T c of superconductivity peaks while the charge density wave (CDW) vanishes, indicating the direct correlations between λ q , N(0), superconductivity, and the CDW under pressure. The anomaly of the DOS may imply the occurrence of a topological transition of the electronic structure. Our work not only provides valuable information for the understanding of competition between the CDW and superconductivity in 2 H –TaS 2 but also may open up a routine to unveil the pressure-induced electronic topological transition.},

The active region consists of a highly doped AlInAs/InGaAs/AlInAs single quantum well that presents an intersubband transition at 1190 cm −1 (λ = 8.4 μ m). When the patch antenna optical resonance approaches and matches the intersubband transition frequency (L ∼ 1.8 μ m), a clear anticrossing behavior—evidence of strong coupling—is observed in the near-field scattering phase spectra of individual antennas. The measured Rabi splitting is 4.5 THz. The near-field scattering spectra agree with the far-field extinction spectra acquired on arrays of identical antennas.},

  abstract     = {Chiral nature of an enantiomer can be characterized by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, but such a technique usually suffers from weak signal even with a sophisticated optical instrument. Recent demonstrations of plasmonic metasurfaces showed that chiroptical interaction of molecules can be engineered, thereby greatly simplifying a measurement system with high sensing capability. Here, by exploiting super-chiral field in a metasurface, we experimentally demonstrate high-sensitive vibrational CD spectroscopy of alanine enantiomers, the smallest chiral amino acid. Under linearly polarized excitation, the metasurface consisting of an array of staggered Au nano-rods selectively produces the left- and right-handed super-chiral fields at 1600 cm −1 , which spectrally overlaps with the functional group vibrations of alanine. In the Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer measurements, the mirror symmetric CD spectra of D- and L-alanine are clearly observed depending on the handedness of the metasurface, realizing the reliable identification of small chiral molecules. The corresponding numerical simulations reveal the underlying resonant chiroptical interaction of plasmonic modes of the metasurface and vibrational modes of alanine. Our approach demonstrates a high-sensitive vibrational CD spectroscopic technique, opening up a reliable chiral sensing platform for advanced infrared inspection technologies.},

Since the PL intensity of rare-earth luminescent materials is sensitive to the excitation efficiency, continuous tuning of the excitation laser wavelength under a magnetic field could result in a mapping of PL enhancement peaks vs excitation wavelength. This enables us to figure out the fine energy levels and the corresponding Lander g factors of materials, such as Er 3+ :YVO 4 crystal as an example. Comparison between this method and the Zeeman splitting technique demonstrates that the proposed technique is a powerful solution to detect the fine energy structures and Lander g factors of rare-earth luminescent materials.},

  abstract     = {A transient spark discharge is an atmospheric pressure plasma that has applications in pollutant removal, medicine, water treatment, agriculture, bactericides, and nanomaterial synthesis. Conventional methods of generating transient sparks at atmospheric pressure usually require a high voltage input at nanosecond pulses. Piezoelectric crystals offer a path to creating plasma devices that do not require a high voltage power supply to generate high voltage outputs; they directly transform mechanical energy into electrical energy. This work examines a manually-operated piezoelectric mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion plasma device. Electrical characterization of the plasma discharge generated by this device shows that it behaves as a transient spark, discharging 0.96 mJ over approximately 30 ns, with consistent behavior across multiple consecutive discharges. Although this specific device had a low mechanical-to-plasma energy conversion efficiency of 1.54\%, the piezoelectric crystal resets to an equilibrium condition after approximately 8 μ s, which suggests that it could be operated with a mechanical input of up to nearly 125 kHz. This work shows the potential of generating plasma in off-the-grid situations using piezoelectric crystals. One particular application of a piezoelectric plasma device is for in situ pollution mitigation or plasma-enhanced combustion, embedding such a device on the high-frequency oscillating or rotating components of internal combustion engines and turbomachinery.},

Flexural modes of nearest-neighboring (NN) and next-nearest-neighboring (NNN) resonators are parametrically coupled through modulated electrostatic interactions. Particularly, in a wide range up to deep strong coupling regimes, both the NN and NNN coupling strengths are precisely proportional to manipulation voltage.

Here, we report the experimental observation of spintronic THz emission from an n-doped wide bandgap semiconductor, n -GaN. We found that the amplitude of THz emission strongly depends on the carrier concentration of the semiconductor layer, which could be attributed to the tunable Rashba state occurring at the n -GaN/ferromagnet interface. Our work offers exciting prospects for pursuing wide bandgap semiconductor-based spintronic THz devices and demonstrating their intriguing spin Hall physics at the ultrafast timescale.},

On the other hand, the commonly used electron transport material in QLEDs, ZnMgO, has been extensively studied as a resistive switching material. In this work, we found that the ZnMgO nano-particle film used in QLEDs showed a clear resistive switching effect. It is, thus, reasonable to relate the resistive switching mechanism of ZnMgO to the aging characteristics of QLED devices. We found that during the first stage of QLED aging, the efficiency of the QLED was improved due to the migration of off-lattice ions and formation of conductive filaments in the ZnMgO layer. Subsequently, as active oxygen ions migrated to the interface between quantum dots and ZnMgO, the barrier for electron transport increased due to the oxidation of quantum dots. At the same time, the conductive filaments were gradually fused due to the continuous external electric field. As a result, the performance of QLED devices continuously deteriorated.},

Owing to the low dark current noise and high responsivity to NIR wavelengths, an unexpectedly high specific detectivity of 5.1 × 10 13 Jones at 930 nm is obtained together with a linear dynamic range of 157  dB and a −3  dB cutoff frequency of 4.5  kHz.

The signature of the plexciton is evidently studied by implanting a TDBC layer over plasmon active metals. The interaction between the strong dipole moment of the TDBC molecules residing at the metal-TDBC interface and the electric field generated by the plasmons is responsible for the transfer of energy between plasmon and exciton modes. We have demonstrated that the coupling between the plasmon and the Lorentzian oscillator (i.e., exciton-based system) gives rise to two plexciton modes, namely, upper plexciton (UP) and lower plexciton (LP). We have clearly shown the excitation of the UP (LP) for λ 589 nm). We observed that the UP exhibits strong dispersion, resulting in high sensitivity. Furthermore, depending upon the nature of the analyte, the change to the organic semiconductor like the TDBC film can be reversible or irreversible. Accordingly, the probe can be reused with a polar analyte like ammonia as such gas desorbs from the surface once removed from the environment. We believe that the plexcitonic nose can open a platform for analyzing food freshness by sensing propanol and acetic acid, identifying traces of explosives and nerve gas, and detecting hazardous chemicals in work environments.},

Here, we experimentally study the cross-plane thermal transport in amorphous Si/SiO 2 superlattices at room temperature. Using the micro time-domain thermoreflectance technique, we measured the thermal conductivity of superlattices with periods of 6.6, 11.8, and 25.7 nm. The thermal conductivity values are in the range of 1.1–1.5 W m −1 K −1 and generally agree with the values reported for amorphous Si and SiO 2 . However, the superlattice with the highest density of interfaces seems to have the thermal conductivity slightly below the amorphous limit. These data suggest that heat conduction below the amorphous limit might be possible in amorphous superlattices with a periodicity shorter than 6.6 nm.},

High resolution x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy show epitaxial growth and an atomically sharp interface between InN and 4H–SiC. The InN film is fully relaxed already after a few atomic layers and shows a very smooth morphology where the low surface roughness (0.14 nm) is found to reproduce sub-nanometer surface features of the substrate.

This study reports FCE analysis of BaTi 0.87 Sn 0.13 O 3 ceramics in a cantilever configuration.

  abstract     = {Multiple polymorphs coexist in doped HfO 2 ferroelectric material, and their relative fraction depends on the dopant concentration. The ferroelectric properties originate only from the polar orthorhombic Pca2 1 phase, which can be stabilized in a binary mixture of HfO 2 and ZrO 2 at a low thermal budget. However, this material suffers from limited field cycling endurance. Additional doping with La improves the field cycling endurance by several orders of magnitude. Hence, La doping is of interest to have better operational reliability. The dynamics of phase formation in Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 is well established, but they have not been investigated in the recently reported La:Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 in detail. In this work, a comprehensive analysis of stability dynamics of polymorphs in La:Hf 1−x Zr x O 2 with different La doping concentrations and its implications on ferroelectric properties is reported.},

The bi-compositions lead to an integration of two sets of phase transition temperatures, coercive fields, and lattice parameters, etc. Interestingly, the polarization microscopy and piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) results show that domain structures are coherent across the boundary. In addition, there are large flexoelectric fields ( E flexo ) at the boundary, which can impact the polarization orientation and electric properties. Thus, the special crystal system provides some potential insights, such as the fabrication of both ferroelectric and metal materials and also the design and manufacture of piezoelectric and optical functional materials.},

Currently, there is a limited number of thin-film magnetic insulators with low magnetic damping. Li 0.5 Fe 2.5 O 4 (LFO) is well known to possess the lowest damping among the bulk spinel structure oxides, but, thus far, LFO thin films have not lived up to these expectations. Here, we demonstrate low magnetic damping (even lower than typical bulk values) and bulk magnetization in 3 nm thick epitaxial LFO thin films. At room temperature, SQUID magnetometry shows a high saturation magnetization of 320 kA/m, and broadband ferromagnetic resonance measurements yield an effective Gilbert damping parameter of 1.3 × 10 − 3 ⁠ , which is among the lowest reported for ferro-/ferrimagnetic films of comparable thickness. Our results show the promise of LFO as a candidate material for spin current-based spintronics.},

Efficient charge accumulation by ionic gating enables a substantial upshift in the Fermi level of the Pd film, which was corroborated by the suppression of the resistivity in the Pd. Electromotive forces arising from the inverse spin Hall effect in Pd under spin pumping were substantially modulated by the gating, in consequence of the modulation of the spin Hall conductivity of Pd as in an ultrathin Pt film. The same experiment using a thin Cu film, for which the band structure is largely different from Pd and Pt and its SOI is quite small, provides further results supporting our claim. The results obtained help in developing a holistic understanding of the gate-tunable SOI in solids and confirm a previous explanation of the significant modulation of the spin Hall conductivity in an ultrathin Pt film by gating.},

  abstract     = {We have investigated the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of van der Waals (vdW) layered CrCl 3 from magnetization and heat capacity measurements. CrCl 3 exhibits complicated magnetic properties due to the strong competition between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions: a ferromagnetic ordering around 17 K followed by an antiferromagnetic ordering at 14.3 K. A large magnetic entropy change (− Δ S M ⁠ ) of 19 J kg −1 K −1 , an adiabatic temperature change ( ⁠ Δ T a d ⁠ ) of 6.2 K, and a relative cooling power of 600 J kg −1 are observed for a field change of 7 T near the transition temperature, and the mechanical efficiency ( η m ) at 18 K and 0–3 T is 1.17. These values of magnetocaloric parameters are significantly larger than those for CrI 3 and other layered vdW systems. The scaling analysis shows that all the rescaled Δ S M ( T , H ) data collapse into a single curve, which indicates the second order nature of magnetic phase transition. The above results suggest that environmentally friendly CrCl 3 can be a phenomenal alternative to very expensive rare-earth material for the magnetic refrigeration for liquefaction of hydrogen.},

Negative and positive exchange biases are symmetric and maximized for less than two angstroms of the nonmagnetic layer. Moreover, the dusting reduces the field cooling threshold to switch between the negative and the positive exchange bias. This finding demonstrates that nonmagnetic dusted layers can improve the interfacial exchange energy density in antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic heterostructures and modify the bulk antiferromagnetic domain structure.

The D it extracted by the conductance method exhibited good agreement with that by the high-low method, whereas there exist large errors when surface potential fluctuation was not considered by using the conductance method. The capture cross section extracted by the conductance method was on the order of 10 −17 cm 2 .

  abstract     = {Fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM) is a scanning nanodiffraction-based method that offers a unique approach to characterizing nanometer-scale medium-range order (MRO) in disordered materials. In addition to determining the degree of MRO, careful analysis of scanning nanodiffraction data can also be used to determine strain in thin film amorphous samples. We applied FEM to characterize the strain and MRO of magnetron sputtered amorphous tantalum ( a- Ta) thin films over a range of tilt angles from 0 ° to 45 ° in order to measure any deviations between the in-plane and out-of-plane strain and MRO. We validate our approach using electron diffraction simulations of FEM experiments for a- Ta. We measure anisotropic strain in the simulated a- Ta diffraction patterns and find that the experimental a- Ta is isotropically strained within the accuracy of our method. Our approach provides a workflow for acquiring tilted scanning nanodiffraction data, determining the relative strain and ordering as a function of in- and out-of-plane directions, and removing any artifacts induced in FEM data due to strain. We also describe some limitations of the tilted FEM method when applied to thin films with very low strains.},

We provide the design of the decorated window, numerical simulation, and experimental demonstrations for this kind of metamaterial and analyze the underlying physical mechanism. Furthermore, we show that more transmission peaks can be realized by introducing multilayer resonance coupling of this decorated window.

Despite a century of progress in understanding of steady-state condensation, less is known about transient condensation. Here, we study transient pulse condensation of ethanol vapor. Using rigorous two-phase heat transfer measurements, we characterize transient heat transfer performance for filmwise and dropwise condensation of ethanol on smooth copper and nanostructured copper oxide lubricant-infused surfaces, respectively. We demonstrate an 8X and 5X enhancement in the condensation heat transfer coefficient during transient operation for dropwise and filmwise modes, respectively, when compared to the steady state. Beyond transient heat transfer enhancement, repeated cycles or pulses of dropwise condensation led to 30\% higher time-averaged heat transfer performance due to higher nucleation site density and convective effects. Our work not only demonstrates transient condensation as a method to enhance heat transfer but also develops a methodology for enabling enhanced condensers for high power density thermal management systems for applications employing transient energy dissipation.},

The success of GI relies on the strong spatial correlation of photons. However, not all optical systems in nature are strongly spatially correlated. Two-color pseudo-thermal GI (PGI) can be viewed as such a weakly correlated system with two independent light sources. In this Letter, Deep Learning is introduced to learn the correlation between two-color speckle patterns, which solves the problem of two-color PGI with a wavelength gap of 101 nm (from 633 nm to 532 nm). Further, we retrieved dual-band ghost images using one broad-spectrum bucket detector and the reference speckle patterns at 633 nm. Our scheme provides insights into all PGI with weak correlation and also is a potential approach for multi-spectral PGI with “learned” wavelength conversion, especially for invisible wavebands.},

  abstract     = {Quantum dots (QDs) are expected to be used as an emitting material in wide-color-gamut displays. However, the development of low-toxicity alternatives is necessary because QDs that exhibit high color purity and highly efficient emission contain toxic materials such as Cd. Here, QD light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs) fabricated using AgInS 2 /GaS x core/shell QDs (AIS core/shell QDs) as low-toxicity QDs were investigated. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of an AIS core/shell QD dispersion showed a band edge emission with a peak wavelength of 560 nm and a full-width at half-maximum of 45 nm because the GaS x shell suppressed the surface defects. Electroluminescence (EL) emission, which mainly comprises the band edge emission, was realized in the AIS-based QD-LED. However, the EL spectra included a large defect emission component, together with the band edge emission. The defect emission was attributed to electrons flowing in the emitting layer (EML) being easily trapped at defect levels in the QDs. The addition of tris(2,4,6-trimethyl-3-(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)borane (3TPYMB) as an electron transporting material to the EML effectively suppressed the defect emission. The radiation-energy ratio of the band edge emission to the total emission was 50\% in the QD-LED without 3TPYMB and was improved to 64\% in the QD-LED with 3TPYMB; this ratio was comparable to that in the PL spectrum of the AIS core/shell QD film. The addition of 3TPYMB improved electron injection into the QDs and the carrier balance in the EML. As a result, the defect emission was suppressed and the EL characteristics were improved.},

Furthermore, the reconstruction quality and resolution can be further improved by compressed sensing. This study shows a demonstration of ghost imaging using mechanical waves.

Indeed, the rapid increase in damping as a function of frequency makes high frequency waves unable to provide sufficient strain energy to successfully excite nonlinearity. The drawback is that low frequency waves are not suitable for imaging, due to their long wavelength and resulting intrinsic averaging of nonlinear effects over large spatial scales. To address this, we propose here an amplitude modulation of swept sources that allows us to correlate the frequency at which harmonics are detected with the position of the source of nonlinearity, taking advantage of the different strain distributions in the sample at different frequencies.},

Here, we develop a compact multi-mode metamaterial-inspired resonator formed as an array of sub-wavelength parallel strip conductors. This resonator aims to replace conventional flat coil resonators and offers multiple modes with different profiles of electromagnetic field distribution for various near-field WPT applications.

Here, an antimony-assisted hydrothermal method is developed for the low-temperature production of wafer-scale vertical VO 2 NAs on arbitrary substrates of glass, quartz, and silicon. Sb 2 O 3 plays a key role in the controlled growth of pure VO 2 (M1) by modulating the size, density, alignment, and MIT properties of VO 2 NAs. Furthermore, the growth mechanism of vertical VO 2 NAs is explained. In contrast to conventional fabrication technologies, the weak interaction between NA films and substrates enables a much easier transfer of VO 2 NAs for various potential applications.},

One of the key challenges lies in matching the emission frequency of quantum dots with the transition frequency of rubidium atoms while preserving the relevant emission properties. Here, we demonstrate the bidirectional frequency tuning of the emission from a narrow-linewidth (close-to-transform-limited) quantum dot. The frequency tuning is based on a piezoelectric strain-amplification device, which can apply significant stress to thick bulk samples. The induced strain shifts the emission frequency of the quantum dot over a total range of 1.15 THz, about three orders of magnitude larger than its linewidth. Throughout the whole tuning process, both the spectral properties of the quantum dot and its single-photon emission characteristics are preserved. Our results show that external stress can be used as a promising tool for reversible frequency tuning of high-quality quantum dots and pave the wave toward the realization of a quantum dot–rubidium atom interface for quantum networking.},

Recently, long-range 2D ferromagnetism was observed in van der Waals crystals CrI 3 and Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 , however, their Curie temperature is significantly lowered when reducing down to monolayer/few layers. Herein, using renormalized spin-wave theory and first-principles electronic structure theory, we present a theoretical study of electrically tunable 2D ferromagnetism in van der Waals layered CrSBr and CrSeBr semiconductors with a high Curie temperature of ∼150 K and a sizable bandgap. The high transition temperature is attributed to the strong anion-mediated superexchange interaction and a sizable spin-wave excitation gap due to large exchange and single-ion anisotropy. Remarkably, hole and electron doping can switch the magnetization easy axis from the in-plane to the out-of-plane direction. These unique characteristics establish monolayer CrSBr and CrSeBr as a promising platform for realizing 2D spintronics and magnetoelectrics such as 2D spin valves and spin field effect transistors.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional multiferroics have attracted tremendous attention due to their intriguing physics and promising applications. However, it has been a major challenge to discover and design two-dimensional multiferroic materials with large electric polarization and strong magnetoelectric coupling. In this work, we propose a strategy to design a two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure with strong magnetoelectric coupling by stacking a transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecule with ferroelectric monolayer In 2 Se 3 . By first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that the magnetic states of the TMPc molecule can be controlled by electrically switching the polarization direction of In 2 Se 3 using an external electric field. This strong magnetoelectric coupling effect originates from the interfacial charge transfer and orbital splitting, resulting in the different magnetic states of TMPc/In 2 Se 3 heterostructures in two opposite ferroelectric phases. Based on the TMPc/In 2 Se 3 heterostructure, a high-density magnetic memory device is proposed for pure electric writing and magnetic reading. Our predictions may open avenues for finding and designing multiferroic heterostructures by using two-dimensional ferroelectric materials and zero-dimensional magnetic molecules with a strong proximity effect.},

  abstract     = {Diverse effects of lattice strain on the optical properties in the near-infrared to vacuum ultraviolet spectral range are experimentally revealed in cube-on-cube-type epitaxial perovskite SrTiO 3 films grown on compressive substrate. Compared to the reference crystal, the tetragonal antiferrodistortive film exhibits spectral blueshifts, which are consistent with the theoretically predicted bandgap widening. In addition to this strain-induced interband effect, the peculiar near-edge absorption and smearing of interband transitions are found. It is shown that Fröhlich-type electron–phonon coupling can be enhanced by strain and lead to this behavior. It is suggested that electron–phonon interactions can play an important role in optical properties of ferroelectric films and deserve further studies.},

  abstract     = {By using a double-pulse excitation scheme, we demonstrate the optical control of higher-order spin waves in a ferromagnetic permalloy thin film. Three spin precession modes are observed in the film under single pulse excitation. Based on a theoretical calculation, these spin precession modes are assigned to the fundamental Kittel mode and the first- and second-order perpendicular standing spin-wave (PSSW) modes. In order to excite the first-order PSSW mode selectively, we use double-pulse excitation at 400 nm. We show that, by choosing an appropriate time interval between the two pump pulses, it is possible to obtain a relatively large amplitude of the first-order PSSW mode while the amplitudes of the other two modes are almost completely suppressed. By analyzing the spin dynamics, it is found that the spin precession motion under the double-pulse excitation condition can be explained by the interference between the spin waves that have been induced by the first and second pulses. Our finding indicates that the selective excitation of a spin precession mode with a high precession frequency in a ferromagnetic metal may be realized by a multiple-pump pulse excitation scheme with more than two pulses.},

In bulk crystal form, CrCl 3 is a vdW antiferromagnet with in-plane ferromagnetic ordering below 17 K, and CrI 3 is a vdW ferromagnet below 61 K. Here, we report on the electron spin resonance (ESR) properties of CrCl 3 and CrI 3 single crystals upon photo-excitation in the visible range. We noticed remarkable changes in the ESR spectra upon illumination. In the case of CrCl 3 , at 10 K, the ESR signal is shifted from g = 1.492 (dark) to 1.661 (light), the linewidth increased from 376 to 506 Oe, and the signal intensity is reduced by 1.5 times. Most interestingly, the observed change in the signal intensity is reversible when the light is cycled on/off. We observed almost no change in the ESR spectral parameters in the paramagnetic phase (&gt;20 K) upon illumination. Upon photo-excitation of CrI 3 , the ESR signal intensity is reduced by 1.9 times; the g-value increased from 1.956 to 1.990; the linewidth increased from 1170 to 1260 Oe at 60 K. These findings are discussed by taking into account the skin depth, the slow relaxation mechanism, and the appearance of low-symmetry fields at the photo-generated Cr 2+ Jahn–Teller centers. Such an increase in the g - value as a result of photo-generated Cr 2+ ions is further supported by our many-body wavefunction calculations. This work has the potential to extend to monolayer vdWs magnets by combining ESR spectroscopy with optical excitation and detection.},

In this work, we experimentally investigate the structure, thermal stability, and magnetic properties of FePd thin films seeded by an Ru layer. An fcc -phase Ru layer induces the highly-ordered L1 0 -phase FePd thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( K u ∼10.1 Merg/cm 3 ). The thermal stability of FePd samples is then studied through the annealing process. It is found that a K u ∼6.8 Merg/cm 3 can be obtained with an annealing temperature of 500 °C. In addition, the Gilbert damping constant α , an important parameter for switching current density, is determined as a function of the testing temperature. We observe that α increases from 0.006 to 0.009 for the as-deposited FePd sample and from 0.006 to 0.012 for the 400 °C-annealed FePd sample as the testing temperature changes from 25 °C to 150 °C. These results suggest that Ru-seeded FePd provides great potential in scaling perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions below 10 nm for applications in ultralow energy-consumption spintronic devices.},

The most accepted and promising way to increase the output power and decrease the signal noise of STNOs is through their mutual synchronization. However, it is confused that the mutual synchronization of STNOs is very difficult to achieve at room temperature although the non-linear nature of STNOs contributes to the large frequency range of injection locking. In this work, first, it is revealed that the difficulty of STNOs&#39; mutual synchronization stems from the high output signal noise of STNOs. Based on this observation, a noise reduction technique is invented, which introduces a Band Pass Filter in the coupling loop of STNOs. Using the noise reduction technique, it is demonstrated that even non-identical STNOs can be mutually synchronized at room temperature.},

In contrast with previous studies that mainly considered the extrinsic effects on K 2 , we obtain high K 2 values of up to 2.04 × 10 6 erg/cm 3 for the stack annealed at T a = 400 °C by maximally utilizing the intrinsic effect at the Co/MgO interface, thus facilitating robust easy-cone anisotropy.

Ultralow power Brownian computers have been theoretically proposed and are a promising example of a skyrmion-based device. However, such devices have not been realized as it would require skyrmions to be stabilized and easily movable within a circuit. Skyrmion circuits fabricated by the etching of ferromagnetic films often decrease the dipolar magnetic field stabilizing the skyrmions, thus preventing their formation. In this study, a skyrmion Brownian circuit has been implemented in a continuous ferromagnetic film with patterned SiO 2 capping to stabilize the skyrmion formation. The patterned SiO 2 capping controls the saturation field of the ferromagnetic layer and forms a wire-shaped skyrmion potential well, which stabilizes skyrmion formation in the circuit. Moreover, using this patterned SiO 2 capping, we have implemented a Y-junction hub circuit exhibiting no pinning site at the junction, contrary to conventional etched hubs. Thus, this technique enables the efficient control of skyrmion-based memory and logic devices to move closer toward the realization of Brownian computers.},

The temperature dependent I–V measurement shows that the reverse leakage transport mechanism is dominated by Poole–Frenkel emission at room temperature through the etch-induced V N defect.

Yet the boron compositions of the grown alloys have been limited. In this Letter, we report on the demonstration of a thick single-phase wurtzite BAlN film with a boron composition over 20\%. The growth was conducted at 1010 °C and 150 Torr with continuous flows of group-III precursors and ammonia with a growth rate of 2.2 μ m/h by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. The boron composition was studied by x-ray diffraction (XRD), secondary neutral mass spectrometry (SNMS), and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). The XRD 2θ scan exhibited the clear wurtzite BAlN peak 1.82° larger than the AlN peak, indicating the boron composition of 30.9\% based on the lattice constants of wurtzite AlN and BN. The SNMS and RBS experiments, independent of strain and defects, revealed that the boron content was 22\%. The microstructures of the wurtzite BAlN film were further studied by transmission electron microscopy, showing an initial 5 nm thick layer free of crystal twinning followed by widespread crystal twinning with lattice rotations of 60° clockwise and anti-clockwise. The optical transmission experiment manifested that the bandgap of the smaller-lattice BAlN film was 5.1 eV, smaller than that of larger-lattice AlN. This trend was the opposite of the conventional InGaAlN but consistent with theoretical predictions. This study would greatly facilitate the research of material, physics, and devices incorporating the wurtzite BAlN alloys.},

Employing the obtained resonance energies and proportionality factors extracted as fitting parameters, the modified model showed a good agreement with the experimental data. While the doping decreased thermal conductivity for all temperatures, the room temperature values started decreasing significantly once the doping levels approached ∼10 19 cm −3 . Consequently, required doping levels to achieve certain GaN-based devices may reduce the thermal conductivity of GaN by as much as 1/3.},

  abstract     = {The magneto-structural evolution of a Ni 2 MnGa single crystal was investigated by in situ polarized neutron diffraction under both magnetic field and mechanical loading. The ability to separate the nuclear and magnetic scatterings by polarized neutrons enables simultaneous observations of the twin reorientation (through twin boundary motion) and magnetic moment configuration. It is found that under a 1.0 T saturating magnetic field, twin reorientation can be activated by compressive stress and is accompanied by a realignment of the magnetic moment, which follows the easy axis of the twin variant. On the other hand, compressive stress as small as 1.0 MPa can freeze the twin reorientation. The evolution of the magnetic scattering amplitudes suggests that the change in magnetization was mainly achieved through the magnetic domain wall motion, while the twin boundary motion was blocked.},

The thermal equation of state determined from the P – V – T measurements indicates that crystalline anti-perovskite Li 3 OBr exhibits similar thermo-elastic properties to common salts. At temperatures that are 50–75 °C below the crystal melting, a pre-melting behavior was inferred based on weakened Bragg intensity and a substantial increase in the diffuse scattering. Concurrent with the onset of pre-melting, an anomalous increase in the lattice volume was observed and is interpreted as anion sublattice disorder. These findings support previous ab initio molecular dynamics simulations based on a simple anion interchange mechanism, indicating that structural disorder below crystal melting temperature can be a main driving force for Li-sublattice melting and superionic transition in the Li 3 OBr anti-perovskite.},

The substrate miscut angle plays a critical role in controlling the in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The microscopic origin of such magnetic anisotropy is attributed to the formation of anisotropic stripe domains along the surface step terraces. The magnetization in the LSMO films was found to be selectively modulated by the antiferrodistortive phase transition of the SrTiO 3 substrate. This phenomenon has been qualitatively explained by a strain modified Stoner–Wohlfarth model. We conclude that the magnetization modulation by the SrTiO 3 phase transition depends on h , the ratio of applied magnetic field to the saturation field. Such modulation is only visible with h &lt; 1. The established domain microstructure–anisotropy–magnetism correlation in manganite films can be applied to a variety of complex oxide thin films on vicinal substrates.},

The recovered samples were characterized to be well crystallized nanodiamond with a quasi-spherical shape and a size of 3–10 nm mostly. The possible mechanism that governs the formation of nanodiamond (ND) was illustrated. Furthermore, the results show that a high input energy density of pulsed wire discharge is critical to the ND formation. The increase in the charge voltage and application of copper-foil pipe can improve the yields of ND up to 20\%. This work provides an innovative route to synthesize ND through the pulsed wire discharge method and is conducive to the investigation and applications of extreme conditions induced by pulsed discharge.},

Along those lines, the Kresling origami pattern has been used to design and construct bi-stable bellows with tailorable stiffness. In this work, we exploit the inter-well dynamic behavior of such bellows to develop and characterize a cluster of mechanical binary switches that can be selectively operated using a single input. This input is in the form of a harmonic resonant excitation with a pre-selected frequency and magnitude applied at the base of the switch. Using a phenomenological model of the switch, we study its nonlinear dynamic behavior and approximate its activation frequency bandwidth. We also demonstrate that multiple binary switches of different geometric characteristics can be combined to create a mechanical memory board of multiple bits placed on a single harmonically excited platform.},

The substrates are normally topographically structured using subtractive techniques to produce saw-tooth, herringbone, and other patterns and bulk heated, leading to significant challenges in energy consumption and controlled operation. Here, we propose a planar lithographic approach to levitate and propel droplets using temperature profiles, which can be spatially patterned and controlled in time. We show that micro-patterned electrodes can be heated and provide control of the pressure profile and the vapor flow. Using these almost featureless planar substrates, we achieve self-directed motion of droplets, with velocities of approximately 30 mms −1 , without topographically structuring the substrate or introducing physical walls. Our approach has the potential to be integrated into applications, such as digital microfluidics, where frictionless and contactless droplet transport may be advantageous.},

By arranging four metal bars of two different lengths in a cross-configuration in a planar metal-insulator-metal structure, we experimentally realize a strong hybridized resonance mode at 82.6 THz with a Q-factor of 60.2. The high-Q hybridized metamaterial mode exhibits distinct properties of polarization-selective excitation, cross polarization conversion, and a high figure-of-merit of 4 in refractive index sensing.

The PbS layer, which was comprised of nano-scale domains (NDs) grown by Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD), was quantum confined to absorb SWIR light. The heterojunction showed tunneling characteristics with a soft breakdown at a relatively low reverse bias (∼−1 V) and a strong photoconductive response at a negative bias above −1.8 V. The voltage dependent behavior is explained using the band structure of the heterojunction. The high IQE observed in the photoconductive response at −2 V is attributed to a high photoconductive gain of more than 40. This assumption was confirmed by mixed conduction behavior observed in a magnetic field dependence Hall effect measurement. These measurements enabled extracting concentrations and mobilities of both electrons and holes. It was found that the CBD grown p-type PbS NDs layer has a mixed conduction nature due to the high electron-to-hole mobility ratio of more than one order of magnitude. This explains the high photoconductive gain achieved and, thus, the high IQE measured for these devices.},

While numerous studies have been performed on interface roughness from the atomic perspective, the relation with photoelectric performance is not yet straightforward. In this study, we carry out mid-infrared magnetophotoluminescence (MPL) measurements on InAs/GaSb T2SLs with a nominally identical period structure. Micro-fluctuation potential and effective interface roughness are evaluated and compared by the photoluminescence linewidth evolution. The analyses agree qualitatively with the x-ray diffraction linewidth and resolve two types of interface roughness quantitatively: the long lateral-length fluctuation, which is exacerbated by the lattice-mismatch, and the short lateral-length fluctuation, which is related possibly to interfacial atomic exchange. These results suggest that MPL can be an effective tool for evaluating the micro-fluctuation potential of InAs/GaSb T2SLs and understanding the effects of interface roughness on electro-optical performance.},

  abstract     = {Featuring a nontrivial coupling between the orbital angular momentum of light and spatially inhomogeneous polarization, hybrid-order Poincaré sphere (HyOPS) beams have recently triggered numerous curiosities, especially in classical and quantum informatics. Despite much effort devoted to creating single HyOPS beam, it is still a formidable challenge to simultaneously harness multichannel and diverse HyOPS beams in a simple and efficient manner. Here, we propose a digitalized geometric phase optical element via photo-induced liquid crystal microstructures and demonstrate flexible and spin-controlled massive channels of HyOPS beams. By tuning the incident polarization, any state on up to 24 diverse HyOPSs is simultaneously mapped from common Poincaré sphere in high efficiency and good energy uniformity. All experimental results match well with the theoretical predictions of such a planar multifunctional device. This adds an extra spatial degree of freedom to advanced light tailoring and may facilitate parallel optical trapping, high-capacity communication, and high-dimensional quantum entanglement.},

Especially, by applying external pressure, the energetic order between different phases in perovskite and double perovskite materials can be notably modified with more fascinating physical properties. However, it is still a challenge to propose a general model to explain and predict the high-pressure structures and properties of various perovskites and double perovskites due to their flexibility and complexity. In this perspective, we will discuss pressure effects on the crystalline structure and electronic configurations in some perovskites and double perovskites. We then focus on a prediction method for the evolution of the lattice and electronic structure for such materials with pressure. Finally, we will give a perspective on current challenges and opportunities for controlling and optimizing structural and electronic states of a given material for optimized functionalities.},

The working mechanism of OECTs relies on the mixed transport of ionic and electronic charge carriers, extending throughout the bulk of the organic channel. This attribute renders OECTs fundamentally different from conventional field effect transistors and endows them with unique features, including large gate-to-channel capacitance, low operating voltage, and high transconductance. Owing to the complexity of the mixed ion-electron coupling and transport processes, the OECT device physics is sophisticated and yet to be fully unraveled. Here, we give an account of the one- and two-dimensional drift-diffusion models that have been developed to describe the mixed transport of ions and electrons by finite-element methods and identify key device parameters to be tuned for the next developments in the field.},

Environmental harshness can come from the surrounding temperature, varying pressure, intense radiation, reactive chemicals, humidity, salinity, or a combination of any of these conditions. Here, we present graphene as a candidate for a multisensory flexible platform in harsh-environment applications. We designed sensors for harsh environments like high temperature (operating range up to 650 °C), high salinity, and chemical harsh environments (pH sensing) on a single flexible polyimide sheet. The high-temperature graphene sensor gives a sensitivity of 260\% higher than the Pt-based sensor. The temperature sensor acts between metal and a thermistor, thereby providing an opportunity to classify the region depending on temperature ( 210 °C up to 650 °C as quadratic). Improved performances are observed for salinity and pH sensing in comparison with existing non-graphene solutions. The simple transfer free fabrication technique of graphene on a flexible platform and laser-induced graphene on a flexible polyimide sheet opens the potential for harsh-environment monitoring and multisensory graphene skin in future applications.},

Non-Newtonian flow behavior and the presence of multi-phase components pose a significant challenge to uniform flow in porous media. Specifically in the case of blood, for biosensing applications, fast spread on a large area is required to avoid coagulation and non-uniform component spread. In this work, we have developed a filter paper-based device to resolve this spreading challenge. We sandwich the filter paper between a matrix of nanofibrous membrane backed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets, forming a multi-scale porous network: one within the filter paper and the other between the PET sheet and the filter paper. By doing so, we decrease the overall resistance to flow while maintaining the same capillary suction pressure to obtain a quick, uniform spread of dyed liquids, milk solutions, and whole blood. The device design and concepts used here can be used in paper microfluidic applications and to develop devices for dried blood spot analysis, which utilize this fast flow while maintaining even spreading over a large area.},

It is shown that unidirectional flow is generated along the path of light-travel when a laser is irradiated parallel to the interface. On the contrary, liquid flow toward the light source is caused when the incident angle of the laser is tuned so as to make the total reflection at an air/water interface. Such switching of the flow direction, positive or negative to the light propagation, was applied to the movement of mm-sized floating object, revealing that repetitive back and forth motion of the solid object is generated. This directional switching of photo-induced movement is interpreted by taking into account the flow caused by the spatial gradient of the surface tension due to the thermal effect of the incident laser. A numerical model with a Navier–Stokes-type equation reproduces the essential aspects of the switching of the direction observed in the present study.},

Interfacial engineering by depositing Ti film served as the oxygen gettering material on top of the TiO 2 layer induces a spontaneous reaction to form a TiO x interfacial layer (due to the low Gibbs free energy of suboxide formation). Such an interface layer acts as an oxygen reservoir that promotes gradual oxidation and reduction during the set and reset processes. Consequently, an excellent analog behavior having a 2-bit per cell and robust epoch training can be achieved. However, a thick interfacial layer may degrade the switching behavior of the device due to the high internal resistance. This work suggests that interfacial engineering could be considered in designing high-performance analog memristor devices.},

This standing wave accelerating structure consists of a single-cell copper cavity and a Gaussian to TM 01 mode converter. The accelerator structure is powered by 110 GHz, 10-ns long rf pulses. These pulses are chopped from 3 ms pulses from a gyrotron oscillator using a laser-driven silicon switch. We show an unprecedented high gradient up to 230 MV/m that corresponds to a peak surface electric field of more than 520 MV/m. We have achieved these results after conditioning the cavity with more than 10 5 pulses. We also report preliminary measurements of rf breakdown rates, which are important for understanding rf breakdown physics in the millimeter-wave regime.

The non-volatility of the small-signal capacitance originates from the non-uniform distribution of oxygen vacancies near/at the bottom electrode, resulting in polarity-dependent responses of the domain-wall vibration. Our hypothesis also agrees with the observed frequency dispersion, which could be explained with the Maxwell Wagner effect. Furthermore, we have shown more than 10 4 endurance and 10-year retention at 85 °C for this non-volatile capacitance. With tunable capacitance at a fixed bias, HZO capacitors can potentially be applied to reconfigurable analog or mixed-signal circuits.},

  abstract     = {Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have been widely used as transducers in electrophysiology and other biosensing applications. Their identifying characteristic is a transconductance that increases with channel thickness, and this provides a facile mechanism to achieve high signal amplification. However, little is known about their noise behavior. Here, we investigate noise and extract metrics for the signal-to-noise ratio and limit of detection in OECTs with different channel thicknesses. These metrics are shown to improve as the channel thickness increases, demonstrating that OECTs can be easily optimized to show not only high amplification, but also low noise.},

In addition, the effect of PEDOT:PSS conductivity on the performance of hybrid heterojunction photodiodes is also explored.

  abstract     = {Raman and coherent phonon spectroscopies were used to investigate the thickness-dependent phononic properties of ultrathin single-crystal Bi films prepared by molecular beam epitaxy on Si(111) substrates. Both the A 1g and E g Raman peaks disappeared in the Raman spectra of a 4 nm Bi film, indicating a complete transition from the low-symmetry A7 structure to the high-symmetry A17 structure. Coherent phonon signals of the A 1g mode also showed a strong dependence on the film thickness, where thin samples (≤15 nm) exhibited lower phonon frequency and shorter phonon lifetimes than the thick samples (≥30 nm). This difference is attributed to a shallower energy potential barrier caused by both a permanent phase transition, which is determined by the film thickness, and a temporary structural transition by photo-excited carriers. Our results not only provide evidence of a phase transition from the A7 to the A17 structure with the decreasing Bi film thickness but also reveal the influence of this phase transition on phonon dynamics. Understanding these material performance traits will facilitate modern application of Bi thin films in electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {The three-omega method, a powerful technique to measure the thermal conductivity of nanometer-thick films and the interfaces between them, has historically employed straight conductive wires to act as both heaters and thermometers. When investigating stochastically prepared samples such as two-dimensional materials and nanomembranes, residue and excess material can make it difficult to fit the required millimeter-long straight wire on the sample surface. There are currently no available criteria for how diverting three-omega heater wires around obstacles affects the validity of the thermal measurement. In this Letter, we quantify the effect of the wire curvature by performing three-omega experiments with a wide range of frequencies using both curved and straight heater geometries on SiO 2 /Si samples. When the heating wire is curved, we find that the measured Si substrate thermal conductivity changes by only 0.2\%. Similarly, we find that wire curvature has no significant effect on the determination of the thermal resistance of an ∼65 nm SiO 2 layer, even for the sharpest corners considered here, for which the largest measured ratio of the thermal penetration depth of the applied thermal wave to radius of curvature of the heating wire is 4.3. This result provides useful design criteria for three-omega experiments by setting a lower bound for the maximum ratio of the thermal penetration depth to wire radius of curvature.},

However, due to their quasi-one-dimensional nature, thin TiS 3 flakes are typically in the form of nanoribbons that are challenging to characterize by optical absorption spectra, due to their small cross section. Here, we employ a sensitive photocurrent spectroscopy technique to probe the absorption of a thin TiS 3 nanoribbon in a field-effect transistor configuration. We have found a significant modification of the band structure of the thin TiS 3 nanoribbon, compared to its bulk counterpart. In addition, the polarization-dependent photocurrent spectra of thin TiS 3 nanoribbons exhibit greatly enhanced anisotropy compared to that of a thick TiS 3 device. The atomically thin TiS 3 flake, thus, not only provides an exciting platform for investigating many-body physics but also enables anisotropic quantum optoelectronics.},

Extension of this Si doping effect to CoFe−MgF 2 films led to a record-high Δ ε ′/ ε ′ of 4.3\% at 10 kHz and 8.5\% at 200 kHz under the application of a magnetic field ( H ) of 10 kOe, while remaining as high as 2.1\% even under H = 1 kOe.

This scenario opens an additional avenue toward high-temperature magnetoelectric (ME) coupling that is achievable in a large class of relatively weak frustrated magnetic systems such as honeycomb antiferromagnets. It is, thus, urgent to unveil the physics underlying the linear ME coupling in these linear ME materials. We grow the single crystals of Mn 4 Nb 2 O 9 , a linear ME candidate with high magnetic ordering temperature, and carry out a set of structural, magnetic, and ME characterizations. An antiferromagnetic ordering with [001]-oriented moments at the Neel point T N = 109 K is identified together with magnetic field driven large electric polarization emerging at T N , due to the strong exchange striction dependent mechanism. The measured ME coupling tensor α fits well the magnetic symmetry −3′ m ′, consistent with the linear ME scenario. Furthermore, remarkable responses of FE polarization and magnetization to the magnetic field and electric field, respectively, are demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {The noise of a spin torque oscillator (STO) is 4–6 orders higher than that of a traditional CMOS Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO). This is the biggest obstacle hindering the STO to replace the VCO in pragmatic usage since a high quality RF signal is essential to the modern telecommunication system. The phase-locked loop (PLL) is widely used in RF chips, which can both stabilize VCO frequency and reduce its noise. There are very few experimental and theoretical works investigating the STO stabilized by the PLL, whereas the numerical investigation is totally missing. In this work, the STO stabilized by the PLL is numerically investigated. Based on the analysis, a combinational frequency tuning method is proposed, which is suitable for the PLL operation and can reduce the STO noise even further.},

The direct current magnetic susceptibility results indicate that the product of the molar magnetic susceptibility and temperature is close to the theoretical value for the current Ln phthalocyanines. A further analysis using the Curie–Weiss law demonstrates the existence of an antiferromagnetic interaction between the Ln ions. Alternating current magnetic susceptibility measurement indicates that both Tb and Dy ions exhibit a slow relaxation with the phthalocyanine ligands compared to that of the Er ion. The effective energy barriers estimated in quantity using the Arrhenius law are 740 K and 40 K for Tb and Dy phthalocyanines, respectively. A theoretical fitting for Cole–Cole plots by the generalized Debye model demonstrates that the Orbach relaxation process prevails in Tb phthalocyanines. The present work clearly demonstrates that the selection of lanthanide ions is important to design single molecule magnets with a high performance.},

This study reveals that slight fluctuations in SAF coupling at the margin of the reference layer and hard layer (i.e., concurrent reversal) can lead to write errors in the form of back-hopping (BH). It appears that variable BH behavior can be attributed to competition between antiparallel ( AP ) → parallel ( P ) and P → AP transitions associated with SAF coupling. Our conclusions are supported by careful analysis of switching phase diagrams and measurements of self-heating and voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy. We also observed that one form of coupling provided higher perpendicular magnetic anisotropic energy and thermal stability, which is likely due to the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) effect. Thus, minimizing variations in DMI by optimizing SAF coupling is crucial for minimizing write error rates.},

The selection of an appropriate thickness and substrate enables us to dramatically decrease the coercive magnetic field from 2.4 T previously observed in sintered PVO 3 bulk to 0.05 T for compressive thin films making from the PrVO 3 compound a nearly soft magnet. This is associated with a marked enhancement of the magnetic moment and the magnetocaloric effect that reaches unusual maximum values of roughly 4.86 μ B and 56.8 J/kg K with the magnetic field change of 6 T applied in the sample plane in the cryogenic temperature range (3 K), respectively.

The current state-of-the-art UWBG materials such as β -Ga 2 O 3 , diamond, and AlN/AlGaN, however, show fundamental doping and thermal conductivity limitations that complicate technological adaption and motivate the search for alternative materials with superior properties. Rutile GeO 2 (r-GeO 2 ) has been theoretically established to have an ultrawide bandgap (4.64 eV), high electron mobility, high thermal conductivity (51 W m −1 K −1 ), and ambipolar dopability. While single-crystal r-GeO 2 has been synthesized in bulk, the synthesis of r-GeO 2 thin films has not been previously reported but is critical to enable microelectronics applications. Here, we report the growth of single-crystalline r-GeO 2 thin films on commercially available R-plane sapphire substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Due to a deeply metastable glass phase and high vapor pressure of GeO, the growth reaction involves the competition between absorption and desorption as well as rutile and amorphous formation. We control the competing reactions and stabilize the rutile-phase growth by utilizing (1) a buffer layer with reduced lattice misfit to reduce epitaxial strain and (2) the growth condition that allows the condensation of the preoxidized molecular precursor yet provides sufficient adatom mobility. The findings advance the synthesis of single-crystalline films of materials prone to glass formation and provide opportunities to realize promising ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductors.},

In this study, an investigation is presented focusing on the switching characteristics of the structure of MoS 2/ HfO 2 /p-Si, the cause of which is mainly attributed to the action of sulfur vacancies. Specifically, the switching characteristic can be greatly enlarged by optical stimulation and regulated by the irradiation position. Owing to the modification of the oxide layer, the growth orientation of the MoS 2 base layer on the surface of HfO 2 layers alters horizontally. This induces an optimum path for the transport of photocarriers, which effectively takes full advantage of the conductive filaments and reduces the loss in diffusion. Consequently, the level of switching characteristics in light is highly promoted. We hope that these results can make a contribution to related optoelectronic research studies and MoS 2 -based devices.},

  abstract     = {β -Ga 2 O 3 is an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor and is thus expected to be optically transparent to light of sub-bandgap wavelengths well into the ultraviolet. Contrary to this expectation, it is found here that free electrons in n-doped β -Ga 2 O 3 absorb light from the IR to the UV wavelength range via intra- and inter-conduction band optical transitions. Intra-conduction band absorption occurs via an indirect optical phonon mediated process with 1 / ω 3 dependence in the visible to near-IR wavelength range. This frequency dependence markedly differs from the 1 / ω 2 dependence predicted by the Drude model of free-carrier absorption. The inter-conduction band absorption between the lowest conduction band and a higher conduction band occurs via a direct optical process at λ ∼ 349 nm (3.55 eV). Steady state and ultrafast optical spectroscopy measurements unambiguously identify both these absorption processes and enable quantitative measurements of the inter-conduction band energy and the frequency dependence of absorption. Whereas the intra-conduction band absorption does not depend on light polarization, inter-conduction band absorption is found to be strongly polarization dependent. The experimental observations, in excellent agreement with recent theoretical predictions for β -Ga 2 O 3 , provide important limits of sub-bandgap transparency for optoelectronics in the deep-UV to visible wavelength range and are also of importance for high electric field transport effects in this emerging semiconductor.},

The multilayer consists of 10 repetitions of 35 nm thick PbTe layers and 75 nm thick CdTe layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs (100) semi-insulating substrates. Simple technological methods were used to manufacture photoresistors from the structure containing the PbTe/CdTe composite. The front-side illuminated photodetectors show a cut-off wavelength of 3.57 μ m and a peak current responsivity of 127 mA/W at a bias voltage of 10 V, a frequency of 730 Hz, and a temperature of 300 K. The specific detectivity of photoresistors at the peak wavelength of 2.9 μ m equals 2.7 × 10 10 cm·Hz 1/2 /W and 6.1 × 10 9 cm·Hz 1/2 /W for 77 and 300 K, respectively. Although the ML photoresistors were not optimized, neither antireflection coated nor lithographically defined, their detectivity, especially at room temperature, is highly comparable to that of photoconducting infrared detectors available in the market. Possible mechanisms causing the relatively high performance of PbTe/CdTe ML detectors have been discussed in detail. These are a decrease in the electron concentration in the conducting PbTe layers caused by capturing some mobile electrons by dangling bonds present at the PbTe/CdTe interfaces and the effective suppression of the Auger recombination in nanostructures made of narrow and wide bandgap semiconductors.},

  abstract     = {Nondoped phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with simplified stacks are desired for practical displaying and lighting applications. However, doping emissive layers are commonly adopted due to serious triplet quenching of phosphors. Here, we demonstrate high-efficiency nondoped bilayer OLEDs based on triphenylphosphine oxide protected iridium(III) complexes. The host feature of peripheral phosphine oxide groups effectively suppresses intermolecular interaction induced quenching. As consequence, the maximum external quantum efficiency beyond 20\% and near-zero roll-offs at 1000 nits were achieved, comparable to the best nondoped phosphorescence devices.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, organic halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention from scientists. To understand the device&#39;s operational mechanism, obtaining their valence band maxima (VBMs) using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy plays a critical role in determining their electronic structures and related energy level alignments. Two methods are commonly used to extract their valence band (VB) edge from either linear or logarithmic intensity scales to reach the agreement with theoretical calculations. However, the consistency behind these two methods is not revealed. In this report, we have quantitatively studied VB edges for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 single crystals using different photon energies. After considering both their origins of orbital hybridizations and density of state (intensity) distributions at various momentum spaces, it is revealed that precise VBMs from linear scales can be realized. The VBMs obtained from M symmetry points are 1.13 eV away from the Fermi level for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and 1.29 eV for CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 , suggesting that the VBMs (at the R point) are 0.86 eV for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and 0.89 eV for CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 . Our findings explain the mechanism of precisely obtaining VBMs from these halide perovskite single crystals.},

  abstract     = {Rashba spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is a core issue in semiconductor spintronics, which allows the manipulation of electron spin through an electric field rather than an external magnetic field, revealing a bright prospect for advanced electronic devices with ultra-high speed and integration. Conversely, the emerging piezotronic effect is the born characteristic for many semiconductors that have a non-central symmetric structure, such as ZnO and GaN. Here, we design three heterostructure devices, based on piezoelectric p-type (CH 3 NH 3 )PbI 3 single crystals and n-type wurtzite-structured ZnO thin films, to theoretically study how the piezotronic effect can effectively work on the Rashba spin–orbit coupling. Benefiting from large piezoelectric charges at the interface when a vertical strain is applied, a high concentration of two-dimensional electron gas is induced in the plane of the heterostructure, which can tune the built-in electric field at the interface and further manipulate the Rashba SOC. With the increase in pressure, both the Rashba parameter and spin splitting are found to first vanish and then increase linearly for ZnO with doping densities of 10 15 and 10 16 cm −3 . This work provides insight for manipulating electron spins via the introduction of piezocharges, showing great application potential of the piezotronic effect in tuning spintronic devices.},

An approximately 2 λ -thick ZnO active layer with a thickness gradient less than 10 nm/mm (i.e., an angle of gradient less than 2 arc sec) across the entire 10 × 5 mm 2 device area was formed by thinning a bulk single crystal of ZnO grown by the hydrothermal method, whose typical threading dislocation densities were lower than 10 2 cm −2 .

The quality factor of a passive cavity consisting of the same DBR stacks was in the range between 670 and 720 for the areal size of 1 mm in diameter. Angle-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the ZnO MCs measured at different positions with a macroscopic spot size of 80 μ m in diameter exhibited distinct emission from the lower branch of cavity polaritons with apparent detunings ranging from −40 meV to 40 meV at room temperature.},

High-quality graphene has been grown on an n − doped 4H-SiC substrate along with a 900 °C hydrogenation process. Temperature-dependent current–voltage characteristics of the graphene/4H-SiC heterojunction have been measured to obtain the Schottky barrier height. The bias-dependent Schottky barrier height (varying from 0.43 eV to 0.41 eV) was found and could result mainly from the electrical doping and Fermi level shifting in graphene. With the increase in the bias, the unsaturated dark current of graphene/4H-SiC/graphene photodetectors indicated the electron diffusion at the graphene/4H-SiC heterojunction. The increased responsivity peaks come from the absorption of the graphene layer in the UV range and the long lifetime of photo-induced thermal electronic carriers being contributed to the bandgap shrinking of graphene and reduction of the Schottky barrier height. The photodetectors biased at 6 V showed a responsivity of 40 A/W, an external quantum efficiency of 1.38 × 10 4\%, and a detectivity of 9 × 10 11 Jones, which are larger than those of previously reported similar devices based on graphene/SiO 2 or graphene/SiC.},

A high photo-to-dark current ratio over 10 8 and a high responsivity of 2 × 10 4 A/W were demonstrated in the device. Moreover, with a cutoff wavelength of 395 nm, the PDs exhibited an ultrahigh UV-to-visible rejection ratio of over 10 7 .

  abstract     = {We report a simple and accurate method to address the inevitable radiative heat loss in the Thomson coefficient measurement. The additional steps required are the measurement of the Joule heat arising from the ac current, measurement of the electrical resistance of the sample, and calculation of the ratio of the two measurement signals arising from the Joule and Thomson effects. The underlying concept is that most of the radiative heat loss that occurs during the measurement of Joule and Thomson heats can be compensated for by calculating the ratio of the two signals. This is because the heat loss during the Joule heat measurement will be highly similar to that during the Thomson heat measurement. Heat transfer analysis indicates that radiative heat loss is reduced by at least a factor of six. Once the Thomson coefficient is measured, accurate Seebeck and Peltier coefficients can be obtained in a single run. This approach was demonstrated by performing measurements on fine platinum wires in the temperature range of 80 K–300 K. The difference between the compensated and uncompensated curves became significant as the temperature increased; moreover, this difference was proportional to the cube of the temperature for a long fine-wire sample, where there is substantial radiative heat loss. Thus, the proposed approach is completely different from a conventional one, wherein the measurement accuracy degrades owing to inevitable radiative heat loss without prior knowledge of the thermal conductivity and emissivity of the sample.},

  abstract     = {Constructing two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is becoming a promising way for photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen. In this Letter, we perform a 2D vdW blue phosphorous/ β- AsP (BP/ β- AsP) heterostructure based on density functional theory calculations. The type II band alignment in the BP/ β- AsP vdW heterostructure is beneficial for separating the photogenerated electrons and holes and suppressing their recombination. The BP/ β- AsP heterostructure not only keeps a suitable band edge position for the water splitting reaction but also significantly improves the optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet light region. Appropriate uniaxial strain can change the indirect bandgap of the BP/ β- AsP heterostructure into a direct one. The present findings indicate that the BP/ β- AsP heterostructure is a promising candidate for applications in photovoltaic devices and photocatalysis.},

  abstract     = {Engineering the propagation of water waves is a crucial challenge for potential applications at oceanic scale. Despite their apparent complexity, they do not fundamentally differ from any other kind of physical wave. Similar to recent approaches in optics or acoustics, we propose to artificially manufacture materials at the sub-wavelength scale to modify the propagation characteristics at will. We demonstrate that hydroelastic waves allow for the straightforward control of the medium properties, as well as the quantitative measurement of the full wave field. We investigate propagation in hydroelastic metamaterials made from periodic arrays of tunable resonators. We fully characterize the band structures of such materials, revealing the coexistence of Bragg and hybridization bandgaps. We also introduce a theoretical approach to model this complex system and predict its band structure. These unprecedented experimental and theoretical results reveal the possibility to efficiently control water waves at the laboratory scale.},

The in-plane geometry of the membrane, with an overall thickness of 50 nm and an aspect ratio exceeding 10 4 :1, is optimized to simultaneously preserve the stress profile needed for sustaining ferroelectric polarization and enable propagation and constructive interaction of extensional and shear waves to create bulk acoustic modes. A ferroelectric polarization of 11.2 μ C/cm 2 is measured at the transduction ports, which is consistent after nano-membrane release. The first, third, and seventh order width extensional modes (WE 1,3,7 ) and the third order of the width shear mode (WS 3 ) are electrically measured at 109, 389, 766, and 267 MHz, respectively, showing Q s over 50–100 that are dominated by the large electrical resistance of TiN electrodes. High mechanical Q s of 538, 407, 781, and 594 are extracted for the WE 1,3,7 and WS 3 modes, respectively, after de-embedding the TiN electrode impedance, resulting in large resonance frequency ( f 0 ) × Q products as high as 6 × 10 11 . The measured characteristics, along with numerical simulations, are used to extract a Young&#39;s modulus of ∼340 GPa for the 10 nm-thick Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 film, which is in close agreement with the reported ab initio estimations.},

The presence of exciplexes has been demonstrated in a host material interface in a multiple stacked OLED; therefore, understanding the degradation mechanism of exciplexes and host materials is essential to develop highly reliable and uniform OLEDs. Herein, we report thermal stress-driven exciplex degradation in a blue OLED, which comprises 4,4′-bis( N -carbazolyl)-,1′-biphenyl (CBP) as a host material without dopants. The device structure dependent-electroluminescence clearly confirms the formation of exciplexes surrounding the CBP interfaces at 398 and 450 nm, respectively. During the thermal stress over the glass transition temperature (T g ) of the CBP, the spectral intensity of the exciplex decreased significantly, and the ideality factor and characteristic trap energy increased abruptly when the thermal stress temperature was higher than the T g of CBP, signaling the origin of thermal degradation effects on the exciplex and host material in our OLED.},

In this work, an InSnBi alloy, which has a low-melting-point of 47 °C, is developed as a laminated top cathode for the QLEDs. Because of the presence of the native oxides that serve as an electron blocking layer, the resultant vacuum-free fabricated QLEDs exhibit an improved performance, with a peak external quantum efficiency of 12.3\%, 9.15\%, and 2.5\% for red, green, and blue devices, respectively, which is 1.5-, 1-, and 1.1-fold higher than that of QLEDs with evaporated Al cathodes.

We determined the cross-plane thermal conductivity, which turns out to be relatively low, i.e., about 1 W m −1 K −1 for all TM PS 3 investigated. When compared with previous results of graphite and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), thermal conductivity becomes smaller as it goes from graphite to TMDs to TM PS 3 , and the difference is larger at low temperature, e.g., around 50 K. From the Callaway model analysis, we could attribute the large thermal conductivity reduction for TM PS 3 , particularly at low temperature, to the phonon scattering from the boundary. We actually confirmed the existence of the large population of the stacking faults with the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy image of MnPS 3 . This suggests that intrinsic or extrinsic stacking faults formed in van der Waals materials and their heterostructures can play an important role in reducing the cross-plane thermal conductivity as a source of the boundary scattering.},

Typically, chemical configurations are changed to tune the ultrafast ET rate. However, direct tuning of the ET rate in QD-molecular acceptor systems while maintaining the chemical configurations remains a challenge. To this end, high pressure can be used as a powerful external control knob. Herein, pressure tuning of the ultrafast ET rate in NIR lead sulfide (PbS)–anthraquinone (AQ) complexes was experimentally performed using in situ high-pressure ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. As pressure changes, ET lifetimes shorten. The results show that the promotional ET in the NIR range was assigned to the shortened distance between PbS and AQ under compression. This study thus indicates that pressure can effectively tune the ET rate and provides brand routes toward efficient NIR QD-based photonic applications.},

In wires of 20 μ m and 25 μ m, a large edge pinning potential produces the anchoring of the DW ends to the wire edges, which is evidenced as a significant curvature of the DW front as it propagates. As the driving magnetic field is increased, the curvature reduces as a result of the system moving away from the creep regime of DW motion, which implies a weaker dependence of the DW dynamics on the interaction between the DW and the wire edge defects. A simple model is derived to describe the dependence of the DW curvature on the driving magnetic field and allows us to extract the parameter σ E , which accounts for the strength of the edge pinning potential. The model describes well the systems with both weak and strong bulk pinning potentials like Ta/CoFeB/MgO and Pt/Co/Pt, respectively. This provides a means to quantify the effect of edge pinning induced DW curvature on magnetic DW dynamics.},

We calculate charge currents in a four-terminal geometry using the adiabatic pumping formula with full account of magnetization dynamics based on the stochastic Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation. The longitudinal current (Seebeck effect) is induced from the thermally driven spin waves via the spin-transfer and momentum-transfer processes, and these two processes contribute constructively (destructively) in ferromagnets having a negative (positive) s-d exchange interaction. The transverse currents (anomalous Nernst effect) arise in proportion to the number of skyrmions, whose mechanism is identified as the thermal topological Hall effect of magnons followed by the momentum-transfer drag process.},

  abstract     = {A three-dimensional breakdown behavior of the magnetic Bloch-point domain wall (BP-DW) propagation was investigated in a ferromagnetic nanowire with the variation of the external magnetic field by means of micromagnetic simulation. As magnetic field strength increases up to a threshold value, the BP-DW velocity approaches a critical phase velocity of the spontaneously emitting spin wave (SW), where a Cherenkov-type DW breakdown phenomenon is observed originating from an interaction between the spontaneously emitting SW and the BP-DW. It is found that the velocity of the BP-DW approaches a maximum value (∼2000 m/s) due to the intrinsic reversal time of a BP spin texture. This suggests that although cylindrical ferromagnetic nanowires might be free from the two-dimensional Walker breakdown phenomenon, there exists a Cherenkov-type three-dimensional breakdown behavior.},

Using hybrid functional based density functional theory calculations, we show that water molecules spontaneously split into H + and OH − .

Thus, in agreement with experimental findings, our results suggest that the concentration of oxygen vacancies decreases as the partial pressure of water increases. The charge transition level, ϵ ( − / + ) ⁠ , of a hydrogen interstitial and the Fermi level at which the formation energies of OH − and H + are equal lie above the conduction band minimum, suggesting that the H + interstitial has a lower formation energy.

Owing to simultaneously breaking the spatial symmetry of the solid panel and adjusting the boundary impedance of the solid–air interface, the proposed ultra-thin layer combines three operating states that are unique to each of the existing mechanical wave metamaterials. Specifically, we observe the “sound state” for intensely reflecting sound waves at the local anti-resonance, the “elastic state” for completely preventing elastic waves at the local resonance, and the “transition state” for totally converting elastic waves into sound waves at the entire monopole-type resonance. Hence, we denote such an ultra-thin layer as the “hybrid metamaterial.” Our work may broaden the way of designing multifunctional materials and devices for manipulating mechanical waves.},

Pentamodes can, therefore, be considered as building blocks of exotic materials with any arbitrarily selected thermodynamically admissible elasticity tensor. The pentamode lattices can then be envisioned to be combined to construct intermediate extremal materials, such as quadramodes, trimodes, and bimodes. In this study, we constructed several primary types of anisotropic pentamode lattices (with midpoint positioning of 10\%, 15\%, 20\%, 25\%, 30\%, 35\%, and 42\% of the main unit cell diagonal) and then combined them mutually to explore the dependence of elastic properties of hybrid pentamodes on those of individual constructing lattices. Several anisotropic individual and hybrid pentamode lattice structures were produced using the MultiJet Additive Manufacturing technique and then mechanically tested under compression. Finite element models were also created using the COMSOL Multiphysics package. Two-component hybrid pentamode lattices composed of individual lattices with extensively different (as large as two orders of magnitudes) B / G ratios were constructed and analyzed. It was demonstrated that it is possible to design and construct composite intermediate extremal materials with arbitrary eigenvalues in the elastic tensor. It is concluded that the elastic E ⁠ , shear G ⁠ , and bulk moduli B of the hybrid structure are the superpositions of the corresponding moduli of the individual lattice structures. Poisson&#39;s ratio ν of the hybrid pentamode structure equals that of individual structure with higher Poisson&#39;s ratio.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also applied to further investigate the passivation mechanism, and the results show that the lone pair electrons in BP&#39;s valence band transfer to F4TCNQ molecules and were firmly localized due to the strong withdrawing ability of F4TCNQ, which greatly enhanced the energy barrier of electrons transfer to H 2 O and O 2 and hindered the further oxidation of phosphorus atoms.

To this end, GaAsP step-graded buffer layers are commonly applied. The thickness and composition of the individual layers are decisive for the envisaged strain relaxation. We study GaAsP growth by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy in situ with reflection anisotropy spectroscopy. We find that the growth surface exhibits optical fingerprints of atomically well-ordered surfaces. These allow for tuning the interface preparation between adjacent layers. The spectral position of the characteristic peaks in the RA spectra, which are related to surface-modified bulk transitions, behaves similarly upon an increased As content as does the E 1 interband transition of GaAsP at the growth temperature. The impact of strain on this shift is negligible. We thus monitor a bulk property via the surface reconstruction. An empiric model enables quantification of the As content of individual layers directly in situ without growth interruptions and for various surface reconstructions. Our findings are suitable for a simplified optimization of the GaAsP buffer growth for high-efficiency devices.},

The main advantage of this combined methodology was that the amount of light absorbed by the sample was not required for EQE determination, which minimized the experimental error. In order to validate the methodology, the well-known Ce 3+ :YAG crystal was used for EQE determination, with the value obtained being in agreement with previous experiments.

  abstract     = {In this study, two methods to tune the emission wavelength of micro-LEDs fabricated on tile patterned compliant GaN-on-porous-GaN pseudo-substrates (PSs) are presented. The mechanical flexibility of porous GaN was utilized to relax the strain induced during the growth of light-emitting diode (LED) structures with n- and p-InGaN layers and enhance the indium incorporation via the composition pulling effect. The first approach involved only varying the size of the PS square tiles used for LED structure regrowth, from 20 × 20 μ m 2 to 8 × 8 μ m 2 . Higher n-InGaN base layer relaxation with decreasing tile size resulted in a red shift of emission from 525 nm to 561 nm with no change in the growth conditions. The second method involved changing the mole fraction, x, of the n-In x Ga 1−x N base layer of the LED structure from 0.04 to 0.09 by reducing growth temperature, while maintaining the high temperature growth conditions of the multi-quantum well (MQW) and p-InGaN targeting 530 nm emission. The resulting wavelength shift was a remarkable 536–616 nm due to the stronger composition pulling effect, providing a pathway to enable high indium content MQW active regions to be grown at high temperature.},

  abstract     = {Interband Zener tunneling of electrons has been recently used in III-nitride semiconductor based light emitters to efficiently inject holes into p-cladding layers. Zener tunneling probabilities can be significantly enhanced if crystal symmetry-induced internal polarization fields assist the dopant-induced built-in electric fields of tunnel junctions because of the large reduction of the tunneling distance. In a metal-polar buried tunnel junction geometry, such electric field alignment needs an AlN interlayer at the tunnel junction. Because AlN is a larger bandgap semiconductor than GaN, it is not clear a priori if the net tunneling probability is reduced or enhanced compared to a homojunction. By combining theoretical modeling with experimental blue light emitting diodes, we find that the large tunneling enhancement due to the polarization field and band realignment overcome the reduction in tunneling due to the larger bandgap of AlN. Compared to a homojunction tunnel-junction, the inclusion of AlN in the tunnel junction is found to lower the turn-on and operating voltages and increase the wall-plug efficiency. This proves that polarization-induced AlN tunnel junctions are superior to homojunctions at low injection currents, resulting in higher optical emission intensity and superior uniformity.},

Nomarski imaging shows that smooth, droplet-free surface morphologies are obtained in 1 μ m thick InAsSbBi epilayers grown at temperatures between 360 and 380 °C. The alloy composition-dependent bandgap energies for the InAsSbBi samples are determined from temperature-dependent steady-state photoluminescence measurements and compared with the tetragonal distortion measured by x-ray diffraction to determine the Sb and Bi mole fractions of each sample. The minority carrier lifetime and the achievable extension of the InAsSb(Bi) cut-off wavelength are analyzed as functions of alloy composition and compared with the performance of InAsSb layers with similar growth parameters.},

Single-photon photofield emission is identified as the emission mechanism that exhibits fast switching times with an upper limit on the order of 1 μ s. The explored fiber optic nanotips are flexible back-illuminated emitters, which can be operated in continuous wave and pulsed modes using lasers with photon energies in the visible range or higher.

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed healthcare systems and supply lines, forcing medical doctors to risk infection by decontaminating and reusing single-use personal protective equipment. The uncertain future of the pandemic is compounded by limited data on the ability of the responsible virus, SARS-CoV-2, to survive across various climates, preventing epidemiologists from accurately modeling its spread. However, a detailed thermodynamic analysis of experimental data on the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses can enable a fundamental understanding of their thermal degradation that will help model the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigate future outbreaks. This work introduces a thermodynamic model that synthesizes existing data into an analytical framework built on first principles, including the rate law for a first-order reaction and the Arrhenius equation, to accurately predict the temperature-dependent inactivation of coronaviruses. The model provides much-needed thermal decontamination guidelines for personal protective equipment, including masks. For example, at 70 °C, a 3-log (99.9\%) reduction in virus concentration can be achieved, on average, in 3 min (under the same conditions, a more conservative decontamination time of 39 min represents the upper limit of a 95\% interval) and can be performed in most home ovens without reducing the efficacy of typical N95 masks as shown in recent experimental reports. This model will also allow for epidemiologists to incorporate the lifetime of SARS-CoV-2 as a continuous function of environmental temperature into models forecasting the spread of the pandemic across different climates and seasons.},

The metal-coated diamonds display a two times higher formation yield than the other samples. The coherence time T 2 varies by less than a factor of two between the investigated samples.

As a result, the electrical conductivity and power factor of the modulation doped Si 1-x-y Ge x Sn y alloy were greatly improved. The findings of this study present emerging opportunities for the modulation of Si integration thermoelectrics as wearable devices charged by body temperature.},

The performance of GSSCs as a function of the interface Schottky barrier height and the bandgap of semiconductor ( E g ) is investigated. Under ideal conditions, these photovoltaic cells reveal a broad maximum at E g = 1.1 – 1.7 eV with PCE exceeding 25\%. The efficiency limits of graphene/silicon and graphene/GaAs solar cells are determined to be 25.5\% and 27.5\%, respectively. The effect of environmental temperature on the solar cell performance is also investigated, and it is found that to a good degree, the PCE of GSSCs varies linearly with temperature. The thermal coefficients of PCE for graphene/silicon and graphene/GaAs solar cells are obtained to be −0.076\%/K and −0.058\%/K, respectively. This study is of fundamental importance for GSSCs and provides insights for further improvements.},

By the full many-body radiative heat transfer theory, we are able to investigate how the size, distance, and relative orientation between the gratings influence the radiative heat flux. By changing the twisting angle θ , we show a significant oscillation of the thermal conductance G ( θ ) ⁠ , due to the size effect for gratings of both square and circular shapes. The distance- and twisting-dependent coupling between the gratings accounts for a strong and characteristic modulation of radiative thermal conductance with implications for the energy management, sensing, and the micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) and nano-electromechanical system (NEMS) devices.},

Although the performances of InP-QLEDs have been rapidly improved in recent years, the device mechanisms are not completely clear and there are still debates in the community regarding the details of excess charge carriers, which are expected to affect the charge balance and the efficiency of the devices. In this work, by studying the influence of charge injection on the efficiency and the charge carrier dynamics, we identify that holes are over-injected in InP-QLEDs, which is different from that in CdSe-QLEDs. By enhancing the injection of electrons and/or blocking the injection of holes, the population of excess holes is reduced, consequently enabling red and green InP-QLEDs with high external quantum efficiencies of 10.78\% and 7.56\%, respectively. Our work provides a practical way to identify the type of excess carrier and can serve as a useful guide for the optimization of charge balance in InP-QLEDs.},

Here, we propose and demonstrate a simple cylindrical shell structure for the trapping of microparticles with a radius as small as 1/400 of the corresponding acoustic wavelength, and its trapping ability is much stronger than that of the standing wave. This mechanism is attributed to the significantly enhanced acoustic radiation force originating from the resonant excitation of low order circumferential modes intrinsically existing in the cylindrical shell, which is a highly localized field around its surfaces. Cylindrical shell-based acoustic tweezers are simple, disposable, low cost, biocompatible, and functional, which may be of interest for nano-scale manufacturing and biomedical applications such as bio-printing, cell culturing, and tissue engineering.},

The systematic behavior of the output intensities as a function of the relative phase of incident beams and the thickness of the absorbing cavity layer is investigated. We experimentally verify that the absorption resonance of the cavity is accompanied by a transition of the phase difference of the individual outputs, which is characterized by a passage from out-of-phase to in-phase behavior of the outputs for varying relative phases of incident beams. The analysis shows that the amplitudes and offsets of the outputs qualitatively follow the theoretical model.},

However, background doping and unipolar electrical characteristics are commonly observed in TMDCs and their based FETs due to the naturally inevitable vacancy defects, which limit their application in electronics and optoelectronics systems. Here, taking MoS 2 as an example, in a TMDC FET, ambipolar properties were achieved at room temperature by introducing an amorphous solid ionic conductor lithium tantalate (LiTaO 3 ) as the gate dielectric, which could guarantee the modulation of the Fermi level in the MoS 2 channel by the gate electric field. Based on the modulation mechanisms by the solid ionic conductor-gated electric field for the transformation of conduction mode, the three-terminal device exhibits a gate-controlled rectifying, that is, thyristor performance with a high rectification ratio over 300 obtained at a low gate voltage of 2 V.

However, only a few single-phase multiferroic materials exhibit ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders at room temperature. Recently, some bismuth layer-structured Aurivillius compounds were reported as multiferroics at room temperature, but the origin of their magnetic property is still under debate because the net magnetization may originate from the presence of secondary phases that are not easily detected by laboratory XRD diffractometers. Here, textured Aurivillius phase Bi 5.25 La 0.75 FeCoTi 3 O 18 ceramics were prepared by Spark Plasma Sintering. The ferromagnetic character of the ceramics was indicated by the magnetic field-induced reversible intensity changes of a certain set of crystalline planes belonging to the Aurivillius phase, as measured by in situ neutron diffraction under the applied magnetic field. The first principles calculations indicate that the ferromagnetism originates from double exchange interactions Fe 3+ –O–Fe 3+ , Co 3+ –O–Co 3+ , and Fe 3+ –O–Co 3+ in the ferro-toroidal main phase. The magnetic-controlled ferroelectric domain switching was observed by piezoelectric force microscopy at room temperature. The prepared Aurivillius phase ceramics, with Co/Fe contributing to magnetization and polarization at the same time, can be considered an intrinsic room-temperature multiferroic.},

The most attractive method for fabrication of structures of these scales is the domain writing by an AFM-tip voltage U tip . The use of this method is limited by the appearance of so-called anomalous domains, in which a small area under the tip is polarized oppositely to the poling field. We present the studies of anomalous domains in zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled Sr 0.61 Ba 0.39 Nb 2 O 6 crystals. A correlation between the spatial distribution of the domain shape and the bias U b of local hysteresis loops was found in ZFC crystals, namely, in the points with a larger U b the anomalous domains appeared at higher U tip . Based on this correlation, we managed to prevent the formation of anomalous domains by a strong preliminary poling of the crystal resulting in an essential increase in U b all over the bulk. The dependences of the domain diameter D on U tip and the exposure time t p are described by the unique linear and power D ∼ t p k functions, respectively. These dependences are not affected by the appearance of an anomalous region growing with U tip and t p .},

Here, we report a sign conversion of the anomalous Hall effect and a large topological Hall effect in (Cr 0.9 B 0.1 )Te single crystals. The spin reorientation from an easy-axis structure at high temperature to an easy-cone structure below 140 K leads to conversion of the Berry curvature, which influences both, anomalous and topological, Hall effects in the presence of an applied magnetic field and current. We compare and summarize the topological Hall effect in four categories with different mechanisms and have a discussion into the possible artificial fake effect of the topological Hall effect in polycrystalline samples, which provides a deep understanding of the relation between the spin structure and Hall properties.},

  abstract     = {Current-induced magnetization has been investigated in a monoaxial chiral crystal CrNb 3 S 6 by means of superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. We found that bulk magnetization was generated by applying electric current along the principal axis of the monoaxial chiral crystal and that the magnetization changed linearly with the current. Directly detecting such magnetization enables one to estimate the number of spin-polarized electrons. Using this number, we evaluated the spin polarization rate within the framework of Boltzmann&#39;s equation. We also observed that the current-induced magnetization increased in the vicinity of the phase boundary between paramagnetic and forced ferromagnetic phases, which could be attributed to the enhancement of spin fluctuation. We discuss these observations based on a chirality-induced spin selectivity effect enhanced by exchange interactions.},

A large topological Hall effect up to 3.5 μ Ω·cm at 50 K has been found due to the formation of noncoplanar spin structures when the competition occurs among magnetocrystalline anisotropy, antiferromagnetic coupling, and ferromagnetic interaction at low temperature.

  abstract     = {Diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) have drawn much attention due to their potential in spintronics and magnetoelectronics. Transparent conducting oxides, which are characterized by high carrier density and mobility, may provide a platform to realize room-temperature DMS oxides via the carrier-induced ferromagnetism. However, magnetic properties of DMS oxides are sensitive to their stoichiometry, and the magnetic performance of the same material synthesized by different groups or preparation methods may vary greatly. Therefore, it is important to clarify the relationship between the magnetic property and the lattice structure. Here, we investigate the magnetic property of Ru 0.037 Ba 0.963 SnO 3 powders calcined in different atmospheres. It is demonstrated that for Ru 0.037 Ba 0.963 SnO 3 , the measured ferromagnetism is much weaker than the calculated one, and the ferromagnetism of the samples calcined in oxygen is stronger than that of the samples calcined in air. Electron spin resonance measurements show the existence of oxygen vacancies in Ru 0.037 Ba 0.963 SnO 3 powders, and the first-principles calculations confirm that oxygen vacancies will suppress the ferromagnetism. This work offers a guide to synthesize diluted magnetic oxides with the desired magnetic property.},

We investigate size-dependent anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ( 11 2 ¯ 0 ) -oriented noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn 3 Sn films. The switching field (coercive field) of the AHE decreases abruptly when the width of the Hall bar decreases to hundreds of nanometers, giving rise to the reduced coercive field from 445 to 30 mT for Hall bar with width from 2 μ m to 100 nm. This observation is in contrast to the ferromagnetic counterpart. The transition from a multidomain to single domain-like mode and the reduction of Néel temperature are proposed to explain the coercivity variation. Our finding provides a promising candidate for the device miniaturization and adds a different dimension to antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

Such a gap is highly spin selective as a result of a topologically protected spin-momentum locking, which can be used for spin filtering. We experimentally demonstrate such a spin filtering effect in a quasi-ballistic p -type germanium/silicon core/shell nanowire (NW), which possesses a pseudo-helical gap without the application of magnetic field. Polarized hole spin injection to the NW is achieved using cobalt ferromagnetic contacts with controlled natural surface oxide on the NW as a tunnel barrier. Local and nonlocal spin valve effects are measured as the verification of polarized spin transport in the NW outside the helical gap. We electrically tune the NW into the helical gap by scanning its chemical potential with a gate. A hysteresis loop with three resistance states is observed in the local spin valve geometry, as an evidence of spin filtering in the helical gap.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a tremendous rise of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials, several of which were verified experimentally. However, most of the theoretical predictions to date rely on ab initio methods, at zero temperature and fluctuation-free, while one certainly expects detrimental quantum fluctuations at finite temperatures. Here, we present the solution of the quantum Heisenberg model for honeycomb/hexagonal lattices with anisotropic exchange interaction up to third nearest neighbors and in an applied field in arbitrary direction, which answers the question whether long-range magnetization can indeed survive in the ultrathin limit of materials, up to which temperature, and what the characteristic excitation (magnon) frequencies are, all essential to envisaged applications of magnetic 2D materials. We find that long-range magnetic order persists at finite temperature for materials with overall easy-axis anisotropy. We validate the calculations on the examples of monolayers CrI 3 , CrBr 3 , and MnSe 2 . Moreover, we provide an easy-to-use tool to calculate Curie temperatures of new 2D computational materials.},

Relaxation in the InGaN templates, due to the lattice mismatch, is accommodated by the generation of V-pits rather than the formation of misfit dislocations. In x Ga 1− x N templates (x ∼ 0.1) are grown via a modified semibulk (SB) approach, with a gradually increasing GaN interlayer thickness to provide a mechanism for backfilling of V-pits . We used high-resolution x-ray diffraction rocking curves to quantify the edge-type and screw-type dislocation density present in the SB and compared the results with the etch pit density obtained via atomic force microscopy after treating the SB with a silane etch. Device-quality InGaN templates with defect density in the mid 10 8 cm −2 were investigated using the above two approaches, with a quality comparable to state-of-the-art GaN.},

Red luminescence features have been reported from multiple types of Ga 2 O 3 samples, including Fe-doped β -Ga 2 O 3 , and attributed to Fe or N O . Herein, however, we demonstrate that the high-intensity red luminescence from Fe-doped β -Ga 2 O 3 commercial substrates consisting of two sharp peaks at 689 nm and 697 nm superimposed on a broader peak centered at 710 nm originates from Cr impurities present at a concentration near 2 ppm. The red emission exhibiting a twofold symmetry, peaks in intensity for excitation near the absorption edge, seems to compete with the Ga 2 O 3 emission at a higher excitation energy and appears to be intensified in the presence of Fe. Based on the polarized absorption, luminescence observations, and the Tanabe–Sugano diagram analysis, we propose a resonant energy transfer of photogenerated carriers in the β -Ga 2 O 3 matrix to octahedrally coordinated Cr 3+ to give red luminescence, possibly also sensitized by Fe 3+ .},

  abstract     = {Barium hydride can undergo a structural phase transition from an orthorhombic phase to a hexagonal phase induced by high temperature or high pressure. This transition causes an immediate increase in the hydrogen diffusion rates by over an order of magnitude, and therefore, understanding the origin and details of such transition is of great interest not only for fundamental reasons but also for improving materials for future applications. In this work, the pressure evolution of the crystal structure was characterized using neutron powder diffraction up to a maximum pressure of 11.3 GPa. The pressure dependence of the unit cell volumes, lattice parameters, atomic sites, and compressibilities were determined for both phases. A structural phase transition occurred over a wide pressure range of P = 1.3 GPa–4.9 GPa. The transition to the higher density hexagonal phase reduced the volume per formula unit of BaD 2 by 13.6\%, hence increasing the volumetric storage density. In addition, we investigated the hydrogen diffusion process using high pressure quasi-elastic neutron scattering up to 7.1 GPa. Our results show that the hydrogen mobility increases with pressure in the hexagonal phase. This work sheds light on the structural and dynamical aspects of barium hydride caused by the application of high pressure. The results may aid in the development of advanced metal hydride systems with increased hydrogen dynamics.},

Although a lower ion conductivity of 9.30 × 10 −9 S/cm has been obtained with the Ta 2 O 5 :Li doped with the arc discharge frequency of 1 Hz than the arc discharge frequency of 4 Hz, the ECD has demonstrated a better optical modulation (ΔT) of 58.25\%. To analyze the detailed material characteristic, the ion mobility and concentration have also been extracted from the Li drift current by the current–voltage (I–V) measurement with the isothermal transient ionic current method. The optimal Ta 2 O 5 :Li doped with the arc discharge frequency of 1 Hz has demonstrated a higher ion mobility of 8.22 × 10 −10 cm 2 /V s and a lower concentration of 7.07 × 10 19 cm −3 . As a result, the electrolyte with higher ion mobility and lower concentration is more important than the higher ion conductivity for ECD applications.},

  abstract     = {We experimentally observed the dynamic behavior of OH on the Ti site (OH t ) of TiO 2 (110) at 78 K in detail by atomic force microscopy (AFM). OH t was imaged as a dimer shape or a fuzzy round shape corresponding to the motion of OH t that OH t swings along the [1–10] direction. The frequency of swing positively responds to the applied bias voltage between the tip and the sample, and it is proposed that the applied bias voltage decreases the barrier of the OH t transition between two or more equilibrium states. Such specific response of OH t to the applied bias voltage can be used as the fingerprint. In addition, the atomic contrast of O adatom (O ad ) and OH t is compared with the contrast of other surface species by AFM, and it is demonstrated that the contrast of O ad and OH t is similar to the contrast of the surface defects due to the effect of tip apex polarity. H atom desorption of OH t is performed by Kelvin probe force spectroscopy, and it is resulted from the reduction of barrier width together with the tunneling electron excitation. The present study is expected to be useful to explore the property of H-involved species and the surface reactions on the oxide surface by AFM.},

The in situ N-doping of graphene by an NH 3 source during AlN growth was responsible for AlN nucleation. The first-principles calculation indicated that N atoms doped initially at the step edges of graphene and subsequently at its center and AlN nuclei followed the same sequence, which is consistent with experimental observations of nucleation. The lower migration barrier of Al atoms (0.07 eV) on graphene created larger AlN nuclei compared to that on bare sapphire (0.21 eV), leading to improved quality of the upper GaN epilayer with lower defect density. This work offers guidance for precisely controlling the nucleation morphology and density of GaN base materials and thus realizing high-quality epitaxial materials and related high-performance devices by quasi-van der Waals epitaxy.},

Our results show that buried gratings can be detected by observing diffraction from the spatially periodic acoustic replica of the buried grating at the glass/metal interface and from replicas of the acoustic wave inside the glass substrate. The measured diffraction signals show a linear dependence on grating duty cycle rather than the expected quadratic one. We find that this is due to the presence of a coherent background optical field, which interferes with and coherently amplifies the weaker fields diffracted off the grating-shaped acoustic waves. Our measurements show that ultra-high frequency photoacoustics is a promising technique for detection of sub-wavelength periodic nanostructures.},

  abstract     = {When conventionally calculating carrier leakage for state-of-the-art quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), that is, LO-phonon-assisted leakage from the upper laser level via electron thermal excitation to high-energy active-region (AR) states, followed by relaxation to low-energy AR states, ∼18\%-wide gaps were recently found between calculated and experimentally measured internal efficiency values. We incorporate elastic scattering [i.e., interface-roughness (IFR) and alloy-disorder scattering] into the carrier-leakage process and consider carrier leakage from key injector states as well. In addition, the expressions for LO-phonon and IFR-triggered carrier-leakage currents take into account the large percentage of thermally excited electrons that return back to initial states via both inelastic and elastic scattering. As a result, we find that the gaps between theoretical and experimental internal efficiency values are essentially bridged. Another finding is that, for the investigated state-of-the-art structures, IFR scattering causes the total carrier leakage to reach values as much as an order of magnitude higher than conventional inelastic scattering-only leakage. The developed formalism opens the way to significantly increase the internal efficiency (i.e., to more than 80\%) via IFR-scattering engineering, such that maximum wall-plug efficiencies close to projected fundamental, both-facets values (e.g., 42\% at λ = 4.6 μ m) can be achieved. By employing this formalism, we reached a 4.6 μ m-emitting-QCL preliminary design for suppressing IFR-triggered carrier leakage, which provides an internal efficiency of 86\% as well as a projected single-facet wall-plug efficiency value of 36\% at a heatsink temperature of 300 K.},

Recovering images from raw ptychographic data, however, requires the solution of an inverse problem, namely, phase retrieval. Phase retrieval algorithms are computationally expensive, which precludes real-time imaging. In this work, we propose PtychoNN, an approach to solve the ptychography data inversion problem based on a deep convolutional neural network. We demonstrate how the proposed method can be used to predict real-space structure and phase at each scan point solely from the corresponding far-field diffraction data. Our results demonstrate the practical application of machine learning to recover high fidelity amplitude and phase contrast images of a real sample hundreds of times faster than current ptychography reconstruction packages. Furthermore, by overcoming the constraints of iterative model-based methods, we can significantly relax sampling constraints on data acquisition while still producing an excellent image of the sample. Besides drastically accelerating acquisition and analysis, this capability has profound implications for the imaging of dose sensitive, dynamic, and extremely voluminous samples.},

  abstract     = {The compressed ultrafast photography (CUP) method is used to observe ultrafast light emission phenomena by restoring multiple images from a single observed image via a compressed sensing algorithm. However, because its regularization function is only suitable for ultrafast light emissions with lattice contours, the CUP method frequently produces artifacts in the restoration result. To solve this problem, we propose a restoration method that is suitable for ultrafast light emissions with any contour shapes. Specifically, we derive a regularization function that automatically estimates the contours of the ultrafast light emissions. Furthermore, we correct the movement of the ultrafast light emissions. By solving the inverse problem with the derived regularization function, accurate restoration results without artifacts can be obtained. Simulations using datasets that emulate fundamental phenomena show that the proposed method is superior to the conventional CUP method in terms of visual quality and the correlation with the original image.},

  abstract     = {Fluorescent digital image correlation (DIC) has been implemented on monocular and binocular fluorescence microscopes for shape and deformation measurements at the microscale and even the nanoscale by tracking fluorescent particles. This technique, however, has not been used with regular optical imaging systems for DIC measurements at the macroscale so far. In this Letter, by combining the photoluminescence nature of fluorescent materials and bandpass filtering imaging, we discover that fluorescent DIC also features some distinct advantages in macroscale characterizations, e.g., specular reflection elimination, high speckle contrast, and the capability to simultaneously observe superficial/internal surfaces of transparent structures. To show these advantages and reveal the potential applications of fluorescent DIC, comparative experiments, including shape, displacement, and deformation measurements, were carried out. Furthermore, some issues accompanied by employing fluorescent imaging in DIC were discussed. This study indicates that upgrading classic DIC to fluorescent DIC can significantly improve its performance, enhance its functions, and expand its applications without introducing additional problems.},

  abstract     = {We present experimental evidence for the simultaneous existence of the magnons and spin-state transition contributions to the heat capacity in ferromagnetic (FM) Cr-doped MnTe ( T c ∼ 280 K), where the magnon heat capacity is attributed to the observed magnon-bipolar carrier-drag thermopower. The pristine antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnTe shows only a magnon-induced peak in the heat capacity near the Néel temperature, T N ∼ 307 K. However, Cr-doped MnTe shows a magnon-contributed heat capacity peak at ∼293 K with an additional peak in the deep paramagnetic domain near 780 K. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility reveals that Cr-doping initially creates low-spin (LS) state Mn 2+ ions into MnTe near and below T N due to a higher crystal field induced by Cr ions. Above 400 K, LS Mn 2+ ions start converting into high-spin (HS) Mn 2+ ions. The LS-to-HS transition of Mn 2+ leads to an excess entropy and hence excess heat capacity contribution in the system. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (XRD) and magnetic field-dependent susceptibility (M-H) confirmed no presence of any structural changes and magnetic polaron, respectively. Both XRD and M-H ensure that the peak of the heat capacity in the paramagnetic domain is originated solely by the spin-state transition. The heat capacity vs temperature was calculated to explain the contribution of each component, including the ones due to the phonons, magnons, spin-transition, Schottky anomaly, and lattice dilation. With the recent advances in spin-caloritronics extending the spin-based effects from magnetic to paramagnetic materials, the data from the heat capacity can play a crucial role to probe the presence of different phenomena, such as paramagnon-carrier-drag and spin-entropy thermopowers.},

  abstract     = {Small-scale wind energy harvesting, which can replace batteries to power small electronic devices and realize self-powered systems, has been extensively studied. To improve the working wind-speed range and output power of small-scale wind energy generation systems, we propose a synergetic hybrid piezoelectric and triboelectric mechanism for galloping wind energy harvesting. In this mechanism, a piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) works in the vibration area and starts working at low wind speeds, while triboelectric nanogenerators work at the vibration boundaries and cooperate with the PEH at high wind speeds. The triboelectric nanogenerator boundaries can (1) constrain the maximum deformation of the beam at high wind speeds to avoid damage to the PEH, (2) increase the vibration frequency to enhance the electromechanical conversion efficiency, and (3) allow the PEH to have a low equivalent stiffness to work effectively at low wind speeds. A dynamic model is presented to characterize the synergetic hybrid piezoelectric–triboelectric wind energy harvester (SHPTWEH) and this is verified by experiments. The results show that the triboelectric nanogenerator boundaries greatly expand the effective working wind-speed range, and the total average power output by the prototype SHPTWEH was 0.24 mW at a wind speed of 14 m/s, which was 2.3 times that of the PEH alone.},

  abstract     = {Little has been studied on how the electrochemical noise impacts the limit of detection of field effect transistor (FET) biosensors. Herein, we investigate low frequency noise associated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solutions at varying ionic strengths ( N i ) under both weak and strong gate biases corresponding to saturation and sub-threshold regimes, respectively, in AlGaN/GaN heterojunction FET biosensors. We show that the electrochemical noise is strongly dependent on the ionic strength and gate biasing conditions. In the saturation regime (low bias), varying the ionic strength (a range of 10 − 6 × PBS to PBS 1 × stock solutions used for testing) has little to no effect on the characteristic frequency exponent β ( β = 1 ) ⁠ , indicating a predominately diffusion-based process. Conversely, under higher biases (sub-threshold regime), the β parameter varies from 1 to 2 with ionic strength exhibiting both diffusion and drift characteristics, with a “cut point” at approximately 10 − 5 × PBS ( N i ≈ 9 × 10 14 /mL). Under a high bias, once the PBS concentration reaches 10 − 3 × ⁠ , the behavior is then drift dominant. This indicates that the higher bias likely triggers electrochemical reactions and by extension, faradaic effects at most physiologically relevant ionic strengths. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the device has an inverse linear relationship with the low frequency current noise. The device exhibits a higher SNR in the sub-threshold regime than in the saturation regime. Specifically, within the saturation regime, an inversely proportional relationship between the SNR and the ionic concentration is observed. The electrochemical noise induced from ionic activities is roughly proportional to N i − 1 / 2 ⁠ .},

  abstract     = {The cell membrane experiences deformation and poration due to electrical stress. In this Letter, we develop continuum simulations of the capacitance-transmembrane potential (TMP) characteristics of the cell membrane. The electromechanical properties of biological cells are gaining increasing visibility so that the utility of numerical models should not be underestimated as a means to check and vet experimental analysis. While several early experiments with solvent-containing bilayers have demonstrated a nonlinear electric field dependence of the capacitance of artificial bilayer membranes, it is noteworthy that the TMP dependence of the membrane capacitance and resistance is not commonly reported in the computational literature. We consider both nonuniform tension and compression of the membrane to determine the anisotropic variation of its thickness, which depends on TMP and Young modulus. The membrane capacitance per unit area of the order of 10 −2 Fm −2 and the areal membrane resistance of the order of 10 −2 Ω m 2 can be explained by the core (cytoplasm)-shell (membrane) structure of the cell. Our results show that a quadratic dependence of membrane capacitance and conductance captures the impact of the strain state under electric field excitation. We, furthermore, discuss the different degrees of influence on membrane capacitance and resistance that different structural parameters (cell aspect ratio, membrane thickness, and surface area) have. The method presented here provides a path forward toward exploring different core-shell models of biological cells in order to optimize cell electrodeformation and electroporation.},

The simulated and measured sound pressure fields are in good agreement, which shows that the valley-projected edge states are excited with angular selectivity at the interfaces and then directionally radiate in different directions for different interfaces. In addition, the far-field radiation patterns of the proposed antennas clearly illustrate improved confinement of acoustic energy along the radiation directions, which can be attributed to the double C 3 symmetry of the snowflake-like scatterers employed to construct the antennas. Our proposed antenna greatly enriches the functionalities of topological insulators and provides a practical method to design acoustic devices with switchable and improved directional emission.},

  abstract     = {The temperature coefficients of the resistivity (TCR) of Cu, Ru, Co, Ir, and W thin films have been investigated as a function of film thickness below 10 nm. Ru, Co, and Ir show bulk-like TCR values that are rather independent of the thickness, whereas the TCR of Cu increases strongly with the decreasing thickness. Thin W films show negative TCR values, which can be linked to high disorder. The results are qualitatively consistent with a temperature-dependent semiclassical thin-film resistivity model that takes into account phonon, surface, and grain boundary scattering. The results indicate that the thin-film resistivity of Ru, Co, and Ir is dominated by grain boundary scattering, whereas that of Cu is strongly influenced by surface scattering.},

In this work, we present a flexible and convenient cavity fabrication process that writes a SU-8 microstrip onto a photonic crystal waveguide deterministically, in which InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots are present as emitters. The strip cavity is laser patterned at the location of a quantum dot with a chosen emission wavelength. Micro-photoluminescence studies are undertaken, which demonstrate an enhanced emission intensity by a factor of 2.1 with weak coupling to a single quantum dot, and time-resolved photoluminescence further shows a Purcell enhancement factor of 2.16. The fabrication process is, thus, verified as a reliable recipe to introduce deterministic cavity coupling to a chosen quantum dot.},

Using tungsten-based nanogratings, we show that the Raman signal originating from the Si substrate underlying a metallic nanograting is primarily sensitive to the distance between the nanolines, as could be expected for such metallic waveguides. However, surprisingly, when using incident light polarized perpendicular (transverse-magnetic) to the nanolines, the technique becomes strongly sensitive to the width of the lines. Using a simple analytical model, we explain the experimental data quantitatively and show that the very high sensitivity to the width under transverse-magnetic illumination is due to the strong impact of their nanometer variations on the absorption properties of the fundamental transverse-magnetic mode excitable within the nanogratings. This work constitutes an important milestone for the Raman technique to become a routine dimensional metrology tool for nanophotonic and nanoelectronic applications.},

TMDCs have crystal phase structures, such as the 2H semiconducting phase and the 1T (or 1T′) metallic phase. Recently, we demonstrated the creation of few-atom-layer 1T-metal/2H-semiconductor molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2 ) lateral Schottky junctions by using electron beam (EB) irradiation and revealed their unique optoelectronic properties. However, the 1T phase is metastable, whereas the 1T′ phase is more stable and useful for various applications. Here, we create a few-layer 1T′-metal phase MoS 2 by laser beam irradiation, which is a simpler, convenient, and low-cost method compared to EB irradiation. We observe unique optoelectronic features of the few-atom-layer 1T′-metal/2H-semiconductor lateral Schottky junctions in reverse bias voltage regions, such as an effective barrier height of ∼0.15 eV, highly efficient photogeneration ratios (&gt;20\%), and high sensitivity to photoirradiation angles without degradation for one month. These properties show great promise for application to highly efficient, flexible, and semitransparent photodetectors and solar cells with long-term reliability.},

In this work, time-resolved x-ray diffraction was carried out during the application of an external electric field to investigate the dynamic electric-field response mechanisms of BaTiO 3 (BT) and BiZn 1/2 Ti 1/2 O 3 (BZT)-modified BT (0.94BT-0.06BZT). These data evidence that the incorporation of BZT into BT fundamentally alters what processes are activated to reorient the polarization by 180°. Polarization reversal in BT is achieved through direct inversion of spontaneous dipoles. However, the addition of BZT into BT promotes a two-step polarization reversal process (i.e., two consecutive non-180° reorientation events).},

Although this advanced electrical characteristic is utilized worldwide, its physical–chemical nature remains unclear, which greatly restricts the design and improvement of next generation electrical insulating composites. Herein, the interfacial charge behaviors in cellulose-liquid composites are investigated, and the results indicate that the majority of charge carriers in insulating liquid are electrostatically adsorbed at the nano-scale interface, forming interfacial charge traps, leading to 17.66 times increased deep trap density, which suppress further charge migration under high voltages, and consequently lead to the ∼400\% improved dielectric breakdown strength compared to that of cellulose paper and insulating liquid. By controlling the interfacial trap characteristics with insulating liquids of strong electron withdrawing ability, the resistivity and breakdown strength of cellulose-liquid composites are further improved.},

In Ti-rich samples, excessive Ti mainly exists in the form of an impurity Aurivillius phase, and so except that the impurity phase reduces the resistance, the structure, morphology, Curie temperature ( T C ∼ 390 °C), and ferroelectricity in Ti-rich ceramics are similar to those in stoichiometric ceramics (BF30BT-1.00). In Ti-poor samples, the appropriate Ti-poor concentration appears in the BF30BT-0.90 ceramic, and the structure becomes the coexistence of the rhombohedral phase and the pseudo-cubic phase (R+PC). The ferroelectric phase transition becomes a frequency-independent normal phase transition, and T C is greatly increased (553 °C). The hysteresis loop becomes more saturated, and a large internal bias field ( E i = 4.5 kV/cm) appears.

Here, we apply two different methods in order to compare and analyze reversible and irreversible or metastable contributions to the electrocaloric effect. The indirect method is based on temperature-dependent ferroelectric hysteresis characteristics. Furthermore, we apply a direct method, where electrocaloric temperature variations are observed using a specialized test structure. A comparison of both methods reveals that the indirect method dramatically overestimates the response due to thermal fatigue effects, which are caused by the migration of charged defects to the electrode interfaces. The partial transition to the antiferroelectric-like tetragonal phase is not immediately reversed to the polar Pca 2 1 phase upon cooling. An electrocaloric coefficient of − 107 μ C m − 2 K − 1 is determined for a 20 nm thick Si-doped HfO 2 film with the direct method, which corresponds to a Δ T of 4.4 K.},

Additionally, this depolarization process alters physical and mechanical properties that might cause energy and electric charge losses in the ferroelectric materials. We report, herein, the results of an experimental study of electric charge losses in Pb 0.99 (Zr 0.95 Ti 0.05 ) 0.98 Nb 0.02 O 3 and Pb 0.99 (Zr 0.52 Ti 0.48 ) 0.99 Nb 0.01 O 3 ferroelectrics subjected to shock compression. We found that electric charge losses mainly occur in the compressed zone of ferroelectric elements; i.e., shock compression is an essential part of the charge loss mechanism. Based on our analysis of the experimental results, charge losses are explained by the leakage current flowing through microscopic conductive pathways (conductive channels), which are formed due to the effects of high magnitude stress and high electric fields in compressed zones of ferroelectric elements. It is shown that the Joule heating of conductive channels by the leakage current increases their temperature and conductance, eventually short-circuiting the electrodes of the shocked ferroelectric element and causing electric breakdown. The leakage current density, j leak , and breakdown delay time, t cr , can be described by the relationship, j leak 2 t c r = β (where β is the material dependent constant), over a wide range of delay times. The breakdown criterion we propose is based on the integral of specific current action and can be used to characterize the electric breakdown in a broad range of shock-compressed ferroelectric materials.},

Here, we experimentally show the inverse spinel ferrimagnet NiCo 2 O 4 (NCO), whose band structure is theoretically predicted to be half-metallic, has both high spin polarization and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Perpendicular MTJs with NCO magnetic electrodes exhibit magnetoresistance up to 230\%, indicating that the spin polarization of perpendicularly magnetized NCO is as high as −73\%.

  abstract     = {Recently, two-dimensional ferrovalley materials have attracted increasing interest due to their intrinsic ferromagnetism and valley polarization. The 2H VS 2 monolayer is taken as an example, and our calculations indicate that the spin direction and strain can modify its valley splitting while further leading to a strong dependence of the Kerr signals. Moreover, the strain-tuned magnetocrystalline anisotropic energy and magnetostrictive coefficient provide a strong magnetostriction in the 2H VS 2 monolayer. These results provide a theoretical reference for practical applications involving valley polarization and magneto-optic Kerr effects in 2D ferrovalley materials.},

We determine the magnon propagation length with microfocused Brillouin light scattering over a broad range of excitation powers and detect a decrease in the attenuation length at high powers. This is consistent with the onset of nonlinear four-magnon scattering. Hence, it is critical to remain in the linear regime when deriving damping parameters from the magnon propagation length. Otherwise, the intrinsic nonlinearity of magnetization dynamics may lead to a misinterpretation of magnon propagation lengths and, thus, to incorrect values of the magnetic damping of the system.},

  abstract     = {In the field of spintronics, charge-to-spin conversion without a ferromagnetic material has attracted intense interest from researchers seeking to realize a fully electrical spin device because this design obviates the need for magnetic field control of magnetization. Instead of spin injection from a ferromagnetic source, spin-Hall-induced pure spin current has recently attracted considerable interest for transferring spin information into the semiconductor channel. In the present work, the spin is injected from a platinum electrode via the direct spin Hall effect and is subsequently detected in a strong Rashba channel via the inverse spin Hall effect. Before being detected, the spin state is modulated by a gate voltage; the signal observed with various channel lengths and gate voltages demonstrates this Rashba precessional modulation. The addition of Zeeman precession induced by an external magnetic field provides the signal-elucidating definite spin motion in the channel and clear interplay between the Rashba and Zeeman processions. Our approach opens a fascinating possibility for realizing a ferromagnet-free system for use in low-power and high-temperature spin transistors.},

Temperature effects often have a significant influence on the spin-polarization properties of Heusler alloys. To incorporate the contributions of temperature effects, we first consider lattice vibrations and spin fluctuations. Using CPA, we can replace them with random displacements due to local phonons and local magnetic moment disorders, respectively. In the Co 2 MnSi Heusler alloy, we found that the band structures are smeared by the electronŌĆōphonon scattering process and the half-metallic property is eliminated by magnon excitations from the spin-up to spin-down states. Furthermore, we can estimate the electrical resistivity as a function of temperature in the scheme of linear response theory. Including the local phonon disorder, local moment disorder, and MnŌĆōCo antisite disorder in CPA, we can reproduce the temperature-dependent resistivity observed by experiments.},

In a harmonic excitation of the vortex gyrotropic motion, it has been known that the chirality determines its phase to the driving force. From our micromagnetic simulations, we find an additional role of chirality in the harmonic excitation of the vortex gyration. The shear deformation of the three-dimensional structure of the vortex core is determined by the chirality of the vortex. We confirm that this is due to the gyrotropic field. For the same vortex core motion with the same polarization but with opposite chirality, it turns out that the opposite gyrotropic field is formed at the spiral magnetization in the vicinity of the vortex core structure.},

The results show that the power factor can be enhanced by incorporation of MgO nanoparticles at high temperature due to the optimized carrier concentration and remarkable energy filtering effects, and the reduced lattice thermal conductivity is obtained owing to interface scattering. Consequently, the sample Pb 0.995 Bi 0.005 Te + 0.3 wt.\% MgO presents the largest ZT value, reaching 1.4 at 773 K, indicating that incorporation of MgO in Pb 0.995 Bi 0.005 Te is an effective approach to improve its thermoelectric performance.},

Metal Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy was used to grow all samples, with a p-type modulation doping scheme using Mg as the dopant. The samples were characterized using x-ray diffraction and room-temperature Hall measurements, and energy band-diagram simulations were carried out using STR FETIS ® and Silvaco packages. For higher doped samples (Mg &gt; 1.5 × 10 19 cm −3 ) with thinner AlN interlayers (≤0.7 nm), the total sheet charge measured using Hall measurements agreed with the value observed in standard simulations without invoking any traps, whereas for lower doped samples (Mg &lt; 1.5 × 10 19 cm −3 ) and those with thicker AlN interlayers (≥ 0.7 nm), the measured charge was very high compared to the value obtained from simulations and higher than the Mg doping in the films. The higher charge was attributed to the existence of an acceptor trap at positive polarization interfaces, which became ionized at lower doping and/or at higher AlN thicknesses. A consistent ionization energy of the trap was obtained by comparing the energy band diagram with and without acceptor traps with the experimental results. This work also elucidates the source of charge balance in p-type samples with insufficient or no Mg doping.},

Specifically, InAs-on-oxide with mobilities reaching 5100 cm 2 /V s at 100 K, and ∼3200 cm 2 /V s at room temperature has been demonstrated. The excellent electronic performance is due to the single crystallinity of the grown material and creates new avenues for the monolithic direct integration of high-performance materials on non-epitaxial substrates, including silicon, and amorphous substrates, such as glasses and metals.},

  abstract     = {GaN-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have demonstrated high frequency power amplification with considerably larger output power densities than that available from amplifiers based on other material systems such as GaAs or InP. To further increase the operating frequency while maintaining the high output power in HEMTs, the gate-to-channel distance needs to be reduced significantly. This leads to a reduced two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density (n s ) and mobility ( μ ) in Ga polar HEMT structures resulting in a larger sheet resistance. This work demonstrates that by proper design of the back-barrier in N-polar GaN-based scaled-channel HEMT structures, a high 2DEG density can be maintained while scaling the channel thickness. Scaled-channel GaN-based HEMT structures with an AlN/GaN (0.5 nm/1.5 nm) digital alloy as the back-barrier were grown on an on-axis N-polar GaN substrate via plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. A record high electron mobility of 2050 cm 2 /vs was achieved on an N-polar HEMT structure with a 10 nm-thick channel, while maintaining 8 × 10 12 cm −2 2DEG density. By modifying the barrier structure, we demonstrated a combination of 2DEG density and a mobility of 1.7 × 10 13 cm −2 and 1420 cm 2 /V s, respectively, leading to a record low sheet resistance of ∼258 Ω/□ on 7 nm-thick channel N-polar HEMT structures.},

Essentially, we developed an entirely in situ annealing protocol, which is superior to the conventional ex-situ routine that requires multi-hour annealing to stabilize the proper pyrochlore structure. The morphological quality of the films has been confirmed by x-ray diffraction, reflectivity, and reciprocal space mapping, demonstrating their high crystallinity with a pure pyrochlore phase and an expected epitaxial relation to the substrate. Strikingly, below the magnetic phase transition, the temperature dependence of resistivity shows a power-law behavior with the power exponent of ∼3/2, characteristic of a Weyl semimetal in the presence of impurities and electron–electron correlations. Below 10 K, the magneto-transport measurements reveal the emergence of a non-saturated negative magnetoresistance up to 9 T with a small “valley” around zero field. These findings are further interpreted in relation to the weak anti-localization effect and the non-collinear antiferromagnetic ordering on the Ir sublattice.},

  abstract     = {Thin film resistors with near-zero temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) are key passive elements in analog integrated circuits (ICs). State-of-the-art near-zero TCR technology is based on sputtered compounds of Si, Cr, B, and C, which require annealing at temperatures higher than 500 °C, making it incompatible with back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) processes. We report here that near-zero TCR resistors can be obtained by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiN-AlN nano-laminates at BEOL-compatible deposition temperature. The resistivity and the TCR can be tuned by varying the ratio between AlN (insulating) and TiN (metallic) in the Ti X Al 1−X N thin film. The TCR changes from positive to negative as the AlN content is increased, allowing for optimization to zero TCR. The ALD method provides ultimate control of the thickness, composition ratio, coverage, and uniformity. Microstructure analysis shows that the film consists of metallic TiN crystallites embedded in the semiconducting Ti y Al 1−y N amorphous matrix, suggesting that the electrical behavior is similar to that of SiCr-based compounds. These results pave the way toward BEOL-compatible near-zero TCR thin film resistors, which can significantly reduce capacitance and minimize design complexity of passive analog IC components.},

A reversible pressure-induced phase transition (cubic to tetragonal) is observed in MgAl 2 O 4 nanocrystals under non-hydrostatic pressure at room temperature, in contrast to the previously reported structural transition of MgAl 2 O 4 at high pressure and high temperature. It is also found that the compressed MgAl 2 O 4 microcrystals do not fracture further below 60 nm, suggesting a plastic deformation mechanism transition. MgAl 2 O 4 with a grain size above ∼60 nm exhibits normal cracking behaviors, but shows metal-like plastic deformation behaviors below this critical size.

We found out that NiO films produced from additive-free solution demonstrate a higher concentration of by-products in the form of Ni(OH) 2 . The additives enhanced the NiO concentration in final films, reducing the Ni(OH) 2 concentration and improving morphology and crystallinity of the upper perovskite layer. The possible chemical reactions for NiO formation with and without additives were proposed and proved by the results of XPS and Zeta potential studies. After adding additives, with the decrease in the Ni(OH) 2 concentration, the amount of by-product NiOOH had been increased, and both Ni(OH) 2 and NiOOH influence the final amount of NiO in the resulting films. The effects of the NiO concentration and additives such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine have been studied for the planar MAPbI 3 perovskite solar cell performance. The best devices based on additive-free NiO films of 25 mg/ml concentration exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 11.02\%, while NiO with diethanolamine additive films demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 15.4\%.},

The results reveal the maximal SHG yield for the isolated nanobump correlated with its geometry-defined electromagnetic near-field enhancement at fundamental frequency. Additional (up to 110-fold) SHG enhancement with respect to the signal from a smooth Au film is achieved via a positive feedback provided through proper arrangement of the resonant nanobumps into the array supporting surface plasmon polariton resonant excitation near the fundamental frequency. Our results substantiate the laser-printed nanobumps as an inexpensive and flexible platform for nanoscale infrared-to-visible light conversion that can be applied for nonlinear plasmonics.},

We show that the complex component κ i can be experimentally extracted from a simple output power vs current measurement.

  abstract     = {Photonic engineering of the terahertz emission from a quantum cascade laser (QCL) is fundamental for the exploitation of this unique source in a myriad of applications where it can be implemented, such as spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing. Active control of the frequency, power, polarization, and beam profile has been achieved through a variety of approaches. In particular, the active control of the emitted frequency, which is difficult to determine a priori , has been achieved through the integration of a photonic structure and/or by using external cavity arrangements. In this work, an external cavity arrangement, which implements a metamaterial/graphene optoelectronic mirror as an external feedback element, is proposed and demonstrated. The reflectivity and dispersion properties of the external active mirror were tuned via electrostatically gating graphene. It was possible to electronically reproduce the mode-switch occurring in a QCL emitting ∼2.8 THz by mechanically changing the external cavity length formed by an Au mirror. The external cavity arrangement was investigated and described in the framework of the self-mixing theory. These results open a way for the all-electronic engineering of the QCL emission by the use of a fast reconfigurable external mirror. This approach can uniquely address both power and frequency control, with ∼100 MHz reconfiguration speeds, using an integrated external element. Furthermore, the metamaterial/graphene mirror&#39;s strong dispersive properties might be implemented for the active mode locking of THz QCLs. Finally, this approach offers a unique opportunity to study the laser dynamics and mode competition in THz QCLs in the self-mixing feedback regime.},

Therefore, YAP is a promising material for optical refrigeration and radiation balanced laser. We measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of ytterbium (Yb)-doped YAP and compared them with those of Yb-doped YAG. The estimated ideal laser cooling efficiencies of Yb-doped YAP and Yb-doped YAG were comparable at 300 K. Based on the temperature-dependent anti-Stokes PL, we found that the laser cooling power of Yb-doped YAP at 470 K is 14.3 times higher than that at 200 K. This enhancement at higher temperatures is 3.2 times larger than that observed for Yb-doped YAG. We attributed the higher laser cooling power of Yb-doped YAP to a lower multi-phonon relaxation rate (and/or a higher energy transfer rate) and an antenna effect caused by the energy transfer from Yb ions that are located at the Y-site to Yb ions that are surrounded by an inhomogeneous alloy structure. The calculated small signal gain of (Yb:Y)AP is 3.5 times larger than that of (Yb:Y)AG. The larger small signal gain of (Yb:Y)AP arises from its strong absorbance and small Stark splitting width.},

This approach attains a phase-only (lossless) pupil function, which can be implemented as a multi-level diffractive flat lens that achieves achromatic focusing and imaging. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate imaging using a single flat lens of diameter &gt; 3 mm and focal length = 5 mm (NA = 0.3, f/1.59) that is achromatic from λ = 450 nm (blue) to 1 μ m (NIR).

Alzheimer&#39;s disease is an example where traditional approaches thus far have been proven unsuccessful. With bacteria becoming resistant to more and more antibiotics, potential membrane based antibiotics provide an alternative route with great potential. Here, we provide a perspective on the basic mechanisms how physical membrane properties can affect diseases and the therapeutic potential of changing membrane lipid composition and properties to target those diseases.

  abstract     = {Quantum-intensity-correlated twin beams of light can be used to measure absorption with precision beyond the classical shot-noise limit. The degree to which this can be achieved with a given estimator is defined by the quality of the twin-beam intensity correlations, which is quantified by the noise reduction factor. We derive an analytical model of twin-beam experiments, incorporating experimental parameters such as the relative detection efficiency of the beams, uncorrelated optical noise, and uncorrelated detector noise. We show that for twin beams without excessive noise, measured correlations can be improved by increasing the detection efficiency of each beam; notwithstanding, this may unbalance detection efficiency. However, for beams with excess intensity or other experimental noise, one should balance detection efficiency, even at the cost of reducing detection efficiency—we specifically define these noise conditions and verify our results with statistical simulation. This has application in design and optimization of absorption spectroscopy and imaging experiments.},

  abstract     = {Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an established technique for non-invasive surgery and has recently attracted considerable attention as a potential method for non-invasive neuromodulation. While the pressure waves in FUS procedures have been extensively studied in this context, the accompanying shear waves are often neglected due to the relatively high shear compliance of soft tissues. However, in bony structures such as the skull, acoustic pressure can also induce significant shear waves that could propagate outside the ultrasound focus. Here, we investigate wave propagation in the human cranium by means of a finite-element model that accounts for the anatomy, elasticity, and viscoelasticity of the skull and brain. We show that, when a region on the scalp is subjected to FUS, the skull acts as a waveguide for shear waves that propagate with a speed close to 1500 m/s, reaching off-target structures such as the cochlea. In particular, when a sharp onset of FUS is introduced in a zone proximal to the intersection of the parietal and temporal cranium, the bone-propagated shear waves reach the inner ear in about 40 μ s ⁠ , leading to cumulative displacements of about 1 μ m ⁠ . We further quantify the effect of ramped and sharp application of FUS on the cumulative displacements in the inner ear. Our results help explain the off-target auditory responses observed during neuromodulation experiments and inform the development of mitigation and sham control strategies.},

The thermal conductivity was evaluated using the equilibrium molecular dynamics technique for porous systems made of spherical voids or water-filled cavities. We revealed large thermal conductivity enhancement in the nano-hybrid systems as compared to their dry porous counterparts, which cannot be captured by effective media theory. This rise of thermal conductivity is related to the increase in the specific surface area of the liquid/solid interface. We demonstrated that the significant difference, more than two folds, in thermal conductivity of pristine porous silicon and “porous silicon liquid–composite” is due to the liquid density fluctuation close to the “solid–liquid interface” (layering effect). This effect is getting more importance for the large specific surface of the interfacial area. Specifically, the enhancement of the effective thermal conductivity is 50\% for a specific surface area of 0.3 (1/nm), and it increases further upon the increase in the surface to volume ratio. Our study provides valuable insights into the thermal properties of hybrid liquid/solid nanocomposites and into the importance of confined liquids within nanoporous materials.},

In a previous study, we have numerically found that, when the acoustic wave propagates along the boundary of a single structure, the selection of the boundary type plays a decisive role in tailoring the frequency range covered by the edge state. We here experimentally verified the tailoring function of the different types of boundaries. In particular, it was shown that the attenuation of acoustic waves changes remarkably with the boundary type, which is of great significance in tailoring the propagation path. The present experimental study, along with our previous simulation results, provides solid guidance for the design of topological acoustic devices with diverse wave propagation paths.},

  abstract     = {Multilayer rhenium disulfide (ReS 2 ) has recently attracted significant attention because of the decoupled van der Waals interaction between its adjacent layers that leads to a much higher interlayer resistivity than that in other layered materials. Although the carrier transport in multilayer materials is well described by the interlayer resistance and Thomas–Fermi charge screening length (λ) in theoretical resistor network models, the understanding of the effect of electric field-dependent interlayer tunneling barrier (E int ) on current fluctuation in two-dimensional (2D) multilayer materials is limited. Herein, we report the effects of E int on carrier transport and charge fluctuation in multilayer ReS 2 . The electrostatic back-gate (V BG )- and drain bias (V D )-dependent E int causes channel migration along the c-axis in 2D multilayer systems and consequently results in two plateaus in the transconductance curve, thereby allowing us to determine the top and bottom carrier mobilities of multilayer ReS 2 separately. Furthermore, the strong correlation between E int and the Coulomb scattering parameter in multilayer ReS 2 is elucidated via low-frequency noise spectroscopy. The results of our study provide a clear insight into the origins of carrier transport and current fluctuation in 2D multilayer devices.},

Such devices require organic semiconductors (OSCs) that intrinsically possess high carrier mobility and air stability. In addition, the demand for low-voltage operation and low power consumption has been increasing because the potential power sources for actual devices are implementable energy harvesters that supply low power and low voltages. Based on recently developed high-performance single-crystal p-type and n-type OSCs, this work demonstrated air-stable, high-mobility OFETs with low-voltage operation by using an insulating polymer-blend printing method. By comparing two acrylic polymers poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(adamantyl methacrylate) (PADMA), having remarkably different thermal properties, we found that PADMA showing a high glass transition temperature &gt;200 °C was suitable for device fabrication, enhancing the flexibility of OSC materials. Also, PADMA spontaneously produced good charge-transport interfaces with the OSC single crystals, leading to high carrier mobilities of 6.6 and 2.2 cm 2 V −1 s −1 in p-channel and n-channel OFETs at ≤1.5 V, respectively. The current electron mobility was the highest among low voltage-operation OFETs reported so far. These high-mobility OFETs were integrated into a complementary inverter, for which a low static power consumption of 6.6 pW was confirmed. Therefore, this study reports an advantage of polymer-blend printing for OFETs with enhanced processability and performance suitable for IoT applications.},

The experimental determination is based on a data-driven spectral analysis technique, including the virtual substrate method and the reverse Monte Carlo method. The theoretical determination is performed within the dielectric formalism, using the energy-loss function calculated in the time-dependent density functional theory. The experimental and theoretical results show that the IMFP for monolayer graphene is almost constant (about 1 nm) in the energy range of 6–100 eV.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors have risen as an important material class for novel nanoelectronic applications. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) is the most representative TMD compound due to its superior stability and attractive properties for (opto-) electronic devices. However, the synthesis of single-crystalline and functional MoS 2 across large-area substrates remains crucial for its successful integration in semiconductor industry platforms. Therefore, this work focuses on the study of MoS 2 epitaxy via two well-established industry-compatible synthesis methods, promising for the large-area and single-crystalline integration of van der Waals (vdW) materials. These methods are molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) and have studied MoS 2 quasi-vdW heteroepitaxy on reconstructed sapphire substrates and MoS 2 vdW homoepitaxy on exfoliated MoS 2 flakes. By examining the MoS 2 structural properties using diffraction and spectroscopy techniques, the epitaxial relation and crystal quality are assessed, which reveals insights into the prevalence of inter- and intragrain defects such as grain boundaries and sulfur vacancies. The MBE method yields superior epitaxial MoS 2 registry on both sapphire and MoS 2 surfaces as compared to MOVPE, although inferior defectivity arises from the typical lower MBE growth temperature and chalcogen partial pressure. Moreover, both synthesis methods generate high densities of twinned MoS 2 grain boundaries, which hamper defect-free integration. As a result, this challenging integration might become an important bottleneck for industrial TMD-based applications with a low tolerance for material defects.},

  abstract     = {Ferrimagnetic spinel compounds AB 2 X 4 (A and B are the magnetic transition elements) are considered to be promising candidates for multiferroics with large magnetization and polarization. In this work, we synthesize polycrystalline spinel MnCr 2 S 4 and characterize the magnetic and ferroelectric properties. Two well-defined ferroelectric phase transitions are demonstrated. The first one occurs at the Cr 3+ ferromagnetic phase transition temperature of T C = 65 K, and the other takes place at the Yafet–Kittel (YK) magnetic phase transition temperature of T YK ≈ 5 K. It is suggested that ferroelectricity in the YK phase is driven by the noncollinear triangular YK spin orders and can be greatly tuned by an external magnetic field. Between T YK and T C ranges, another opposite electric polarization sublattice appears, which is enhanced by the external magnetic field just near T C , revealing that this opposite electric polarization is likely related to magnetostriction and the magnetic field can enhance the lattice distortions near T C . Thus, this work paves the way for exploiting ferrimagnetic multiferroicity although more studies are needed to clarify the ferroelectricity mechanism in the Cr 3+ ferromagnetic phase.},

CBNO primarily shows mixed p -type and ionic conduction due to a trace of oxygen vacancies (V O •• ). Both bulk resistivity ( ρ b ) and activity energy ( E a ) for conduction are dramatically increased by the co-substitution in Ca 0.92 (Li 1/2 Nd 1/2 ) 0.08 Bi 2 Nb 2− x (W 3/4 Mn 1/4 ) x O 9 [CBNO-LN- x (WM), x = 0–0.02]. Consequently, the modified compositions almost show an intrinsic conducting mechanism due to a significant suppression of the V O •• concentration. Furthermore, the synergetic effect of Li/Nd at the A site and W/Mn at the B site greatly improves the piezoelectricity coefficient ( d 33 ), which is up to ∼21.1 pC/N in the optimized composition [CBNO-LN-10(WM)]. This combined with a high Curie temperature ( T C = ∼946 °C) and high resistivity indicates that CBNO-LN-10(WM) is a good promising material in high-temperature piezoelectric applications.},

As such, stress-induced phase transformations, in addition to the lattice deformation and domain switching, are the contributing factors for the observed macroscopic mechanical behavior of LKNN6a. The in situ stress-dependent diffraction data also demonstrates a method to mechanically modulate the polymorphic phase transition temperature ( T PPT ) to a higher temperature, as observed by the temperature-dependent permittivity measurements under a constant bias stress. The external uniaxial compressive stress increases the stability of the lower symmetry monoclinic phase, shifting T PPT to a higher temperature by 60 °C for the maximum uniaxial compressive stress of 300 MPa in the studied composition. Importantly, the stress-induced stabilization of the room-temperature ferroelectric phase can be useful to optimize the phase transition region, as well as increase the temperature stability of lead-free KNN.},

The study reveals that nitrogen infusion affects only the first few tens of nanometers below the native oxide layer. The typical high-field Q-slope behavior of electropolished cavities is indeed completely recovered after a dozen hydrofluoric acid rinses. The reappearance of the high-field Q-slope as a function of material removal was modeled by means of London&#39;s local description of screening currents in the superconductor, returning good fitting of the experimental data and suggesting that a layer of interstitial impurities with diffusion length on the order of tens of nanometers can mitigate high-field Q-slope.},

In this work, we report the synthesis of high-quality epitaxial (0001) FeSn films by magnetron sputtering. Using FeSn/Py heterostructures, we show a large exchange bias effect that reaches an exchange field of 220 Oe at 5 K, providing unambiguous evidence of antiferromagnetism and strong interlayer exchange coupling in our films. Field cycling studies show steep initial training effects, highlighting the complex magnetic interactions and anisotropy.

For comparison, the cellular domains observed in an Fe–Ga single crystal specimen of rectangular prism shape are also presented.

In this work, we employ ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic properties of these compounds as a function of composition x . We obtain the effective band structures of intermediate alloys by constructing special quasi-random structures (SQSs) and unfolding their band structure to the corresponding primitive cell. Furthermore, we show that the indirect bandgap of the ST12 Ge end-member can be tuned to become direct at x Si ≈ 0.16 ⁠ . Finally, our investigations also demonstrate that the BC8 modification, on the other hand, is insensitive to compositional changes and is a narrow direct bandgap semiconductor only for the case of pure Si.},

In our experiments, direct charge transfer by the Landau damping of the plasmons of metal shell significantly enhances the excited state population that results in an unprecedented ultrafast third-order nonlinear optical response as a function of the plasmon-excitation detuning wavelength. The single step photo-induced charge transfer analogous to the intramolecular electronic transition in molecules is probed by ultrafast transient absorption, which reveals that the electrons are directly transferred from the Fermi level of Au to the unoccupied levels of Sb 2 Se 3 in less than 150 fs. First principles density functional theory calculations indicate that the hybridized eigenstates of the strongly coupled system are delocalized across the metal–semiconductor interfaces.

Unlike previous studies, our device (1) uses an in situ gate, which allows a very short period superlattice in high mobility, shallow heterostructures and (2) enables independent control of the carrier density and the superlattice modulation potential amplitude over a wide range. We characterize this device design using low-temperature magneto-transport measurements and show that the fabrication process caused minimal damage to the system. We demonstrate the tuning of potential modulation from weak (much smaller than Fermi energy) to strong (larger than the Fermi energy) regimes.},

Comparing the Ga hf constants determined by EPR with corresponding values calculated for different Ga vacancy-related defects, the IR1 defect is assigned to the double negative charge state of either the isolated Ga vacancy at the tetrahedral site (V 2− Ga(I) ) or the V Ga(I) –Ga ib –V Ga(I) complex.},

To solve this problem, a piezoelectric inertial rotary actuator based on a special wiring scheme is proposed. By changing the pair of piezoelectric vibrators in the traditional actuator to have opposite connection modes, the proposed actuator implements a two-step operating mode over one cycle and suffers no backward motion. Thus, the proposed actuator essentially eliminates the backward motion phenomenon under all conditions. Compared with other methods for controlling backward motion, which typically require additional friction-control or complex signal-control systems, the proposed wiring method has the advantages of simplicity of structure, ease of control, and high stability.},

In this Letter, we report a strong correlation between thermal conductivity and the speed of sound within two families of modified oxide glass formers, in agreement with phonon-gas-theory predictions for crystalline materials. Based on calculations of diffuson-mediated heat transport, we then show that thermal conductivity in borate glasses is dominated by diffusive vibrational modes, while both diffusive and propagative modes contribute to heat conduction in silicate glasses. This fundamental difference in the heat propagation mechanism originates from differences in the phonon mean free path of low-frequency modes caused by the inherent variation of atomic rigidity between silicate and borate glasses.},

  abstract     = {This work provides evidence that plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) of SiO 2 , a widely applied process and a cornerstone in self-aligned multiple patterning, is strongly influenced by ions even under mild plasma conditions with low-energy ions. In two complementary experimental approaches, the plasma ALD of SiO 2 is investigated with and without the contribution of ions. The first set of experiments is based on microscopic cavity structures, where part of the growth surface is shielded from ions by a suspended membrane. It is observed that a lower growth per cycle (GPC) and a better material quality are obtained when an ion contribution is present. Without any ion contribution, a GPC of 1.45 ± 0.15 Å/cycle and a wet etch rate of 4 ± 1 nm/s (in 30:1 buffered HF) are obtained for a deposition temperature of 200 °C. With an ion contribution, these values decrease, where the magnitude of the decrease appears to be determined by the supplied ion energy dose. For extended ion doses, the GPC decreases to 0.85 ± 0.05 Å/cycle and the wet etch rate to 0.44 ± 0.09 nm/s, approaching the value for a thermal oxide. The important role of ions is confirmed by the second experimental approach, which is based on ion-selective quartz crystal microbalance measurements. By these results, it is demonstrated that ions have a stronger impact on the plasma ALD of SiO 2 than usually considered, providing essential insights for tailoring the film growth.},

This method takes advantage of the improved performance of bottom-tunnel junction LEDs over their top-tunnel junction counterparts, while allowing for strong gate control on a low-cross-sectional area fin or wire without sacrificing the LED active area as in lateral integration designs.

This method makes it feasible to optimize coupling efficiency in detection and broaden the scope of application in dissipative sensing. The transmission spectrum exhibits a distinct phenomenon under a long optical path of sensing arm, including quasi-sinusoidal modulation and profile split. Based on that, transmission characteristics are analyzed by theoretical stimulations and the subsequent experiments are in good agreement with the theory. In addition, we estimate the sensing performance of this device and that the sensitivity can reach −4.76 dB/(10 −7 RIU) with a 1 m sensing arm theoretically when applied in monitoring the refractive index change, which is almost an order of magnitude larger than the previously reported data.

Multi-apertures sampling in the hologram plane can achieve a large FOH. Sparse sensor aperture array uses the synthetic method to achieve higher spatial resolution than any single aperture, which can be used to a large-size scene imaging. However, accurate reconstruction is substantially degraded when there is a large gap between apertures. As a result, the entire scene could not be recovered from FOH. We present a self-restoration method that restores for gaps between sparse apertures. Constraints based on the object energy distribution and absorption characteristics are applied to extract the object function from existing defective reconstruction with a gap. The lost diffraction order can be reproduced and the original object function can be recovered by the iterations between object and hologram. Our iterative process allows a faithful recovery of the gap information to be extracted from the sub-holograms to achieve full-field imaging. The entire complex-value field that contains both the sampling and gap zones in the detection plane is finally retrieved. This faithful reconstruction using a sparse sensor array provides an effectively enlarged hologram for high-resolution digital holography.},

In this work, we introduce a parity-time-reciprocal scaling ( ⁠ PTX ⁠ )-symmetric structure, which can offer a promising avenue for tailoring the resonance frequency and line shape of electronic circuits. We have theoretically studied the resonance behavior of such a PTX -symmetric electronic system, particularly for dependencies of resonant peaks and line-shapes on the non-Hermiticity, coupling coefficient, and the scaling coefficient introduced by the reciprocal scaling ( ⁠ X ⁠ ) transformation.

  abstract     = {Molecular electronics has improved tremendously over the past 20 years, but it remains challenging to develop molecular switches that operate well in two-terminal tunnel junctions. Emerging technologies demand multi-functional junctions that can switch between different operations within a single molecule or molecular monolayer. Usually the focus is placed on molecules that shift the junctions between high and low conductance states, but here we describe molecular junctions with dual-functional switching capability. We discuss the operating mechanism of such switches and present examples of “two-in-one” junctions of a diode placed in series with an additional switch, which can operate either as an electrostatic or a memory on/off switch. We propose guidelines for future designs of such dual-function molecular switches and provide an outlook for future directions of research.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, semiconductor quantum dots have demonstrated their potential to reach the goal of being an ideal source of single and entangled photon pairs. Exciting reports of near unity entanglement fidelity, close to unity photon indistinguishability, and high collection efficiency in nanophotonic structures have been demonstrated by several distinct groups, showing unequivocally the maturity of this technology. To achieve the required complexity and scalability in realistic quantum photonic implementations, two-photon interference of photons from multi-sources must be reached. While high indistinguishability values have been observed for photons generated from the same source within a relatively short time separation, achieving similar visibility for larger time separation or in multi-source experiments still requires intensive efforts. In fact, the coupling to the particular mesoscopic environment of charge carriers confined in the quantum dot leads to decoherence processes, which limit the quantum interference effects to a short time window. Here, we discuss the progress in studying the dynamics of this decoherence, which crucially depends on the evolution of line broadening in high-quality self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots. Characterization of line broadening mechanisms is the first fundamental step to be able to counteract them. Optimization of the growth and active and passive control of the radiative transitions are crucial for the technological readiness of non-classical light sources based on semiconductor platforms.},

We detail a method to extract quantitative information from dual-color measurements by considering two models: a single spectral component model for peak wavelength determination and a dual spectral component model for relative strength determination. The former model is useful for spectral characterization and establishing heterogeneity within an emitter species, while the latter model is useful for analyzing energy transfer efficiency. Both models are formalized to yield probability distributions that reflect uncertainties due to shot noise. We applied these analysis tools to single-particle measurements of CdSe/CdS quantum dots. Isolated emitters had narrow spectral-intensity distributions that reflected their static emission profiles and fluorescence stability. Small assemblies of mixed donor/acceptor particles exhibited dynamic behavior where emission configuration changes reveal different spectral characteristics due to energy transfer.},

Realizing this experimentally is technologically demanding, as it requires coincident single-photon detection proportional to the number of photons involved, which represents a severe challenge for achieving a practical quantum advantage over classical methods. Here, we exploit advanced quantum state engineering based on superposing two photon-pair creation events to realize a new approach that bypasses this issue. In particular, optical phase shifts are probed with a two-photon quantum state whose information is subsequently effectively transferred to a single-photon state. Notably, without any multiphoton detection, we infer phase shifts by measuring the average intensity of the single-photon beam on a photodiode, in analogy to standard classical measurements. Importantly, our approach maintains the quantum advantage: twice as many interference fringes are observed for the same phase shift, corresponding to N = 2 path-entangled photons. Our results demonstrate that the advantages of quantum-enhanced phase sensing can be fully exploited in standard intensity measurements, paving the way toward resource-efficient and practical quantum optical metrology.},

We employ non-destructive coincidence elastic recoil detection analysis using different projectile ions in the MeV range to simultaneously quantify the lithium depth distribution in the whole stack with resolution better than 50 nm by simulations of experimental data. Experiments were performed while charging and discharging the stack. 5 MeV 7 Li primary ions were employed to extract the Li depth distribution in an ∼3.6 μ m thick Ti/LMO/LIPON/NbO/Ti thin film battery. To show the versatility of the approach, a coincidence experiment was also performed using 4 MeV He ions for an ∼3.4 μ m thick Ti/LMO/LIPON/NbO/Ti battery. Our results illustrate, for example, lithium accumulation in the 90 nm thick NbO layer upon charging with +3 V. We could also show the transport of large amounts of Li from the LMO/LIPON interface to the LIPON/NbO interface upon overcharging with +5 V. Altogether, these experiments demonstrate the potential of the employed technique, enabling in-operando high resolution composition depth profiling of Li and other light elements (e.g., H, He, C, N, and O) in ultrathin all-solid state batteries.},

Traditionally, the capacitor in 1T1C devices is grown on the drain, and such a structure is a type of dynamic memory. Such a structure, however, is prone to the leakage current phenomenon, which causes the amount of charge stored in the capacitor to be insufficient, leading to inaccurate data reading. To solve this problem, an alternative 1T1C structure placing the capacitor on the gate terminal has been proposed. For these alternative 1T1C FeRAM devices, our experimental results indicate that the deposition temperature of the ferroelectric layer has a significant effect on the basic electrical properties.

  abstract     = {The early stage degradation of electrical properties in AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) under fast neutron irradiation is studied. After the 1 MeV neutron irradiation at a low fluence of 1 × 10 14 neutrons/cm 2 , the reverse leakage current decreases while the output and transfer characteristics remain unchanged, which cannot be explained by the previously reported high-fluence degradation model. By employing temperature-dependent gate leakage current measurements, we show that the dislocation related Poole–Frenkel (PF) emission dominates the gate leakage mechanism before and after irradiation whereas the barrier height for electron emission to conductive dislocation increases after the neutron irradiation. A model with the evolution of dislocation from the V Ga -decorated configuration to the pure configuration is proposed to describe the degradation of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs at the low-fluence early stage neutron irradiation. This model enriches the understanding of the degradation mechanism of neutron irradiated AlGaN/GaN HEMTs.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the electronic transport properties of Au-contacted graphene on Ge/Si(001). Kelvin probe force microscopy at room temperature with an additionally applied electric transport field is used to gain a comprehensive understanding of macroscopic transport measurements. In particular, we analyze the contact pads including the transition region, perform local transport measurements in pristine graphene/Germanium, and explore the role of the semiconducting Germanium substrate. We connect the results from these local scale measurements with the macroscopic performance of the device. We find that a graphene sheet on a 2 μ m Ge film carries approximately 10\% of the current flowing through the device. Moreover, we show that an electronic transition region forms directly adjacent to the contact pads. This transition region is characterized by a width of &gt;100 μ m and a strongly increased sheet resistance acting as the bottleneck for charge transport. Based on Rutherford backscattering of the contact pads, we suggest that the formation of this transition region is caused by diffusion.},

  abstract     = {We proposed a method for measuring undercut etching based on contact resonance atomic force microscopy (CR-AFM). Suspended undercut structures were fabricated through isotropic wet etching on a patterned SiN x /Si architecture. The materials beneath the SiN x masks with circular and rectangular shapes were partially etched to form center-supported thin plates. A clear contrast was observed between the supported and suspended regions by CR-AFM amplitude imaging, enabling accurate determination of the undercut boundary and the corresponding etched length. CR-spectroscopy measurements of the undercut dimensions were also applied by acquiring the contact stiffness distribution and by further fitting with models of analyzing the plate deflection. The etching rates given by both the imaging and spectroscopy measurements were in close accordance. The theoretical measurement error induced by finite CR-frequency to stiffness sensitivity was evaluated to be around 5\% under our experimental settings. This work paves the way for in situ and real-time detection of undercut etching at the nanoscale and benefits relevant micro- and nano-fabrications.},

We here experimentally and theoretically investigate triangular vacancies in (unconventional) Bernal-stacked AB- h -BN formed using a high-energy electron beam. Due to the geometric configuration of AB- h -BN, triangular pores in different layers are aligned, and their sizes are controlled by the duration of the electron irradiation. Interlayer covalent bonding at the vacancy edge is not favored, as opposed to what occurs in the more common AA′-stacked BN. A variety of monolayer, concentric, and bilayer pores in the bilayer AB- h -BN are observed in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and characterized using ab initio simulations. Bilayer pores in AB- h -BN are commonly formed and grow without breaking the bilayer character. Nanopores in AB- h -BN exhibit a wide range of electronic properties, ranging from half-metallic to non-magnetic and magnetic semiconductors. Therefore, because of the controllability of the pore size, the electronic structure is also highly controllable in these systems and can potentially be tuned for particular applications.},

Here, we found that the chirality of SWNT on an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrate can be obtained in a quick and concise manner through measuring the aligning direction and the diameter of SWNT. Additionally, Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy is conducted to confirm the obtained chirality.

We hypothesize that since this layer has structural properties distinct from the bulk, it would undergo a different property degradation than the bulk during cyclic electrical loading or fatigue. First, we show the existence of a surface layer by comparing X-ray diffraction patterns of the ceramic surface and powders. Then, we show that fatigue damage is mainly localized in the surface layers, and thus, property degradation due to fatigue can be recovered on removing the affected surface layer. We also show that ion migration may be occurring in the surface layer during fatigue experiments using secondary ion mass spectroscopy, where the ion sources may be the sample itself, the electrode layer or the insulating oil in which the experiment is performed. Finally, we show that permanent fatigue damage such as microcracks is dependent on the choice of electrodes. While permanent damage was observed for Pt electrodes, it was not present for oxide electrodes, suggesting that oxygen permeation and accumulation at the electrode/surface interface may play a role in the formation of observed microcracks. In summary, we have shown that fatigue is influenced by the surface layer, and surface layer damage can be controlled using the selection of electrodes.},

  abstract     = {The analysis of the shapes of Barkhausen pulses (BPs) was used for the detailed characterization of the domain merging process in congruent lithium niobate LiNbO 3 (CLN) crystals. The BPs in ferroelectrics manifest themselves as the sharp peaks in a switching current during polarization reversal by the application of a constant or slow-varying external electric field. Three mechanisms of the BPs were previously proposed: domain nucleation, interaction of the domain walls with the pinning centers, and domain merging. We have revealed the domination of the domain merging mechanism for the generation of the BPs in CLN and classified the scenarios of domain structure evolution after merging in terms of the appearance and transformation of short-lived fast and superfast domain walls. We have shown that the input of merging events reaches 80\% of the whole switching process. Two revealed types of BPs corresponding to the merging events considerably differ by duration and shape, thus opening the way for solution of the inverse problem—extracting the quantitative information about the domain kinetics by the analysis of the BPs. This analysis allows extracting the velocities of the fast and superfast walls and provides the possibility to go beyond the temporal resolution of the in situ imaging system in studying the superfast domain wall motion. The proposed analysis is applicable for the faceted growth of polygonal domains in any ferroelectric. It is necessary to point out that the analysis of the BPs allowed characterizing the main part of the domain evolution process in CLN as the fast domain transformations after merging prevail during the polarization reversal.},

Lower interfacial oxidation of the ALD TiN BE as a result of the smaller grain boundary area of the ALD TiN induced a lower defect density in the HZO film.

In this work, we design vdW and lateral MTJs formed by a ferromagnetic (FM) CrI 3 barrier and two half-metallic Li 0.5 CrI 3 electrodes, respectively, and investigate the TMR effect of these MTJs using the non-equilibrium Green&#39;s function combined with density functional theory. Interestingly, it is found that due to the half-metallicity of the Li 0.5 CrI 3 electrode, the total conductances of vdW and lateral MTJs for the parallel configuration (PC) of magnetizations of two electrodes are about 12 and 11 orders of magnitude larger than those for the antiparallel configuration (APC) of magnetizations of two electrodes, respectively. Consequently, the ultrahigh TMR ratios of up to 1.48 × 10 14 and 2.86 × 10 12 are achieved in the designed vdW and lateral MTJs, respectively. Remarkably, the TMR ratio of 1.48 × 10 14 is the highest ratio in MTJs based on 2D materials. Moreover, due to the CrI 3 barrier in vdW MTJs becoming FM half-metal, the majority-spin conductance of vdW MTJs for PC of magnetizations of two electrodes is about 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of lateral MTJs, and thus, the TMR ratio of vdW MTJs is about 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of lateral MTJs. Our results suggest that vdW and lateral MTJs formed by the FM CrI 3 barrier and half-metallic Li 0.5 CrI 3 electrodes hold great potential for applications in spintronic devices.},

Its interlayer magnetic ordering is coupled to structural layer stacking, implying that the charge density distribution mediating van der Waals interactions plays a key role in the magnetic interaction between the layers. Using polarization-dependent x-ray spectroscopy, we investigated the response of the electronic environment around Cr and I sites to structural changes of layer stacking order. The highly anisotropic nature of the Cr local environment is significantly enhanced and is accompanied by changes in the valence band, in the rhombohedral phase. Magnetic spectroscopy measurements reveal a sizable iodine orbital moment, indicating the iodine contribution to magnetic anisotropy.

  abstract     = {We investigated magnetization reversal of (Sm, Ce) 2 (Co, Fe, Cu, Zr) 17 magnets as per x-ray magnetic circular dichroism microscopy. Magnetization reversal initially occurs at the ferromagnetic grain boundaries or in the vicinity of nonmagnetic Sm oxides. As the demagnetization field increases after magnetization reversal, the reversal region extends into the grain from these areas by the magnetic domain wall motion. Energy-dispersive x-ray analysis using an electron probe micro-analyzer shows that, at the grain boundaries, the Fe concentration is higher and the Cu concentration is lower compared to that inside of the grains; and concentrations of Sm, Co, Fe, and Cu vary in the vicinity of Sm oxides. By measuring the Co L 3 absorption intensity, we verified that local coercivities in these areas are very low compared to those inside of the grain. These results imply that the magnetization reversal that occurs in these areas is induced by the variation in the composition. The results obtained in our research will be useful for improving the magnetic properties of Sm–Co magnets.},

  abstract     = {All-optical switching (AOS) of the magnetization in synthetic ferrimagnetic Pt/Co/Gd stacks has received considerable interest due to its high potential toward integration with spintronic devices, such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), to enable ultrafast memory applications. Post-annealing is an essential process in the MTJ fabrication to obtain an optimized tunnel magnetoresistance ratio. However, upon integrating AOS with an MTJ in prospect, the annealing effects on single-pulse AOS and domain wall (DW) dynamics in the Pt/Co/Gd stacks have not been systematically investigated yet. In this study, we experimentally explore the annealing effect on AOS and field-induced DW motion in Pt/Co/Gd stacks. The results show that the threshold fluence ( F 0 ) of AOS is reduced significantly as a function of annealing temperature ( T a ) ranging from 100 °C to 300 °C. Specifically, a 28\% reduction of F 0 can be observed upon annealing at 300 °C, which is a critical T a for MTJ fabrication. Finally, we also demonstrate a significant increase in the DW velocity in the creep regime upon annealing, which is attributed to annealing-induced Co/Gd interface intermixing. Our findings show that the annealed Pt/Co/Gd system facilitates ultrafast and energy-efficient AOS, as well as enhanced DW velocity, which is highly suitable toward opto-spintronic memory applications.},

Recently reported magnetic logic with reconfigurable logic operation and built-in nonvolatile memory can potentially bridge this gap. However, its high-frequency performance is not well studied. Here, we first perform experimental and theoretical investigation on the switching time of magnetic logic-memory devices combining magnetic units and negative differential resistance (NDR) of semiconductors. It is found that the switching time of S-type NDR (transistor circuits) in logic operations is ∼300 ns and determined by the transistor&#39;s internal turn-on properties. We then propose a magnetic logic-memory device by coupling the anomalous Hall effect in magnetic materials and the insulator-to-metal transition in VO 2 . Our device realizes reliable output (output ratio &gt; 1000\%), a low work magnetic field (&lt;20 mT), and excellent high-frequency performance (switching time = 1–10 ns).},

We observe that the modest spin current injection triggers the conventional single peak oscillating behavior of the STO. As the spin current is further increased to enter the non-linear regime, we find the transition of the spectrum from a single peak to a multipeak structure whose frequency spacing is constant. This behavior can be primarily explained by the extremely broadened peak of the STO, which is accompanied by the frequency-dependent filtering by the transmission line. To explain the observation more quantitatively, we also discuss that the multipeak may reflect the characteristics of the intrinsic dynamics of the STO in the non-linear regime.},

  abstract     = {Spin waves have the potential to be used as a next-generation platform for data transfer and processing as they can reach wavelengths in the nanometer range and frequencies in the terahertz range. To realize a spin-wave device, it is essential to be able to manipulate the amplitude as well as the phase of spin waves. Several theoretical and recent experimental works have also shown that the spin-wave phase can be manipulated by the transmission through a domain wall (DW). Here, we study propagation of spin waves through a DW by means of micro-focused Brillouin light scattering microscopy ( μ BLS). The 2D spin-wave intensity maps reveal that spin-wave transmission through a Néel DW is influenced by a topologically enforced circular Bloch line in the DW center and that the propagation regime depends on the spin-wave frequency. In the first regime, two spin-wave beams propagating around the circular Bloch line are formed, whereas in the second regime, spin waves propagate in a single central beam through the circular Bloch line. Phase-resolved μ BLS measurements reveal a phase shift upon transmission through the domain wall for both regimes. Micromagnetic modeling of the transmitted spin waves unveils a distortion of their phase fronts, which needs to be taken into account when interpreting the measurements and designing potential devices. Moreover, we show that, by means of micromagnetic simulations, an external magnetic field can be used to move the circular Bloch line within the DW and to manipulate spin-wave propagation.},

Unlike metallic counterparts, the magnetic insulators are characterized by the imaginary part of the interfacial spin mixing conductance as well in a bilayer with heavy metals, and it is responsible for the field-like toque in spin–orbit torque devices. Here, we study the underlying theoretical constructs and develop a general strategy to determine the complex spin mixing conductance from the experimental results of ferromagnetic resonance and spin pumping. The results show that the imaginary part of the spin mixing conductance can be one order more than the real part and it matches the critical trend of spin mixing conductance with thickness of the heavy metal. The interpretation of experimental results also indicates that at small thicknesses, the interface contribution becomes significant and a bulk diffusion model cannot explain the results. A thickness-dependent spin diffusion length is necessary too that is tantamount to the Elliott–Yafet spin relaxation mechanism in the heavy metals. Also, we effectively explain the experimental results while inserting a copper layer with varying thicknesses in between the magnetic insulator and the heavy metal using spin-circuit formalism.},

Those memory cells composed of two-dimensional materials present a suppressed resistance drift in their amorphous phase. The drift exponent ν is reduced to 0.05 for 3 nm GeTe layers. Combined with Raman spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the structural relaxation process is described as the decay of tetrahedral-bonded sites. Tetrahedrons in ultrathin films are more stable than those in bulk materials. The local motifs of amorphous GeTe ultrathin films are covalently bonded and highly ordered in a short range. The majority of highly ordered tetrahedral clusters prevents spontaneous structural relaxation and leads to high stability in amorphous states, which helps to stop intrinsic fluctuations in physical properties of SET and RESET states, without an extra processing cost.},

The study reveals that the external magnetic field dependence of the spin-flip scattering rates for the three excitonic features shows an increasing tendency of saturation at high fields as the density of these defects increases in these layers. This suggests that the signals must be stemming from defects which are ferromagnetically coupled with each other.

Band diagram and current density–voltage ( J–V ) simulations are conducted in one-dimensional and three-dimensional schemes, with the latter including compositional fluctuations within the alloy AlGaN barrier layer. The simulation results using a self-consistent Poisson-drift diffusion scheme, incorporating the Localization Landscape theory, indicate a large asymmetric barrier to the hole transport by UID AlGaN. The asymmetric J–V characteristics are attributed to the asymmetric band diagrams calculated for the unipolar structure. The simulation results are verified by experiments using unipolar vertical hole transport structures enabled by n- to -p tunnel junctions (TJs) grown by ammonia molecular-beam epitaxy. The TJ structures are utilized to minimize the issues with the high spreading resistance of p- regions and to eliminate the need for its dry etching, which normally results in degraded p- contacts. The experimental results show that even a thin UID Al x Ga 1−x N (x = 14\%, 13 nm) introduces an asymmetric barrier to the hole transport; a nearly 100\% increase in the voltage drop induced by a thin UID AlGaN at 50 A/cm 2 in the reverse direction is observed compared to an only 25\% corresponding increase in the forward direction. Furthermore, p- type doping of the AlGaN layer results in a drastic drop in the potential barrier to hole transport in both directions.

  abstract     = {In this Letter, high-performance vertical NiO/ β -Ga 2 O 3 p–n heterojunction diodes without any electric field managements were reported. The devices show a low leakage current density and a high rectification ratio over 10 10 (at ±3 V) even operated at temperature of 400 K, indicating their excellent thermal stability and operation capability at high temperature. Given a type-II band alignment of NiO/ β -Ga 2 O 3 , carrier transport is dominated by the interface recombination at forward bias, while the defect-mediated variable range hopping conduction is identified upon strong reverse electric field. By using the double-layer design of NiO with a reduced hole concentration of 5.1 × 10 17 cm −3 , the diode demonstrates an improved breakdown voltage ( V b ) of 1.86 kV and a specific on-resistance ( R on,sp ) of 10.6 mΩ cm 2 , whose power figure of merit ( V b 2 / R on,sp ) has reached 0.33 GW/cm 2 . The high breakdown voltage and low leakage current are outperforming other reported Ga 2 O 3 based p–n heterojunctions and Schottky barrier diodes without field plate and edge termination structures. TCAD simulation indicates that the improved V b is mainly attributed to the suppression of electric field crowding due to the decreased hole concentration in NiO. Such bipolar heterojunction is expected to be an alternative to increase the breakdown characteristics of β -Ga 2 O 3 power devices.},

By depositing a thin AlN seed layer on the Si substrate before the pattern process, a high quality AlN film with a thickness of 2 μ m has been obtained. The full width at half maximum values of X-ray diffraction rocking curves are as low as 409 and 677 arc sec for AlN (002) and (102) planes, respectively. Further experimental results indicate that the AlN seed layer can suppress the misorientation of the adjacent grains, as revealed by the lower twist and tilt angles of the mosaic structure, and thus only a few dislocations generated during the grain coalescence. In addition, the migration of Al adatoms is enhanced on the Al terminated surface of the AlN seed layer, which accelerates the coalescence process. All these improvements are attributed to the lower binding energy and diffusion barrier for Al adatoms on the Al terminated surface than that on the Si surface. Our results demonstrate an effective approach to obtain high quality AlN films for high performance ultraviolet light-emitting diodes on the Si substrate.},

For example, the Landé g -factor in GaAs two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs) is expected to change from its bulk value g ≃ −0.44 to zero and even to positive values under sufficiently large hydrostatic pressure. Although this presents an intriguing platform to investigate electron-electron interaction in a system with g = 0, studies are quite limited because the GaAs 2DES density decreases significantly with increasing hydrostatic pressure. Here, we show that a simple model, based on pressure-dependent changes in the conduction band alignment, quantitatively explains this commonly observed trend. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decrease in the 2DES density can be suppressed by more than a factor of 3 through an innovative heterostructure design.},

It is interesting to find that the sulfur incorporation will lead to an accordant evolution on the boron doping efficiency, hole mobility and concentration, crystal quality, surface morphology, and growth rate. In the presence of sulfur with appropriate dosage, for a boron-to-carbon ratio of only 2.5 ppm in gas phase during growth, a very high doping concentration of 1.2 × 10 19 at/cm 3 has been achieved, indicative of a very efficient boron doping. Besides, the hole mobility of the sample is 853 cm 2 /V s at 300 K, which is better than the state of the art for p-type doping in diamond. The regulation mechanism of the sulfur addition will be discussed from the point of view of sulfur-induced plasma change and possible B–S complex formation.

Hence, the ultrasonic guided wave energy is focused in the axial direction of the pipe and amplified at the focal point of the lens. Refractive indices are calculated using dispersion curves obtained from the finite element simulations of the stubbed unit cells, and the curved lens is designed for the second longitudinal wave mode of the pipe, which is commonly used in guided wave testing. The proposed lens design is implemented on a steel pipe, which is typically used in the distribution networks utilized in cities, and simultaneous focusing of longitudinal wave modes in a broad frequency range is verified through both numerical models and experimental measurements.},

Dielectric spectroscopy was performed, and the soft-segmental α 2 -relaxation was extracted and fit with a Havriliak–Negami function. The α 2 -relaxation frequency at 115 °C correlates well with an order-of-magnitude estimate of the equivalent frequency of deformation. This work further supports the importance of the dynamical T g as an important consideration in the design of impact resistant materials.},

More interestingly, the silicone PR-FZP can be stretched, and the focal length increases gradually with the unchanged full width at half maximum as the PR-FZP is stretched. The aforementioned performance aspects are verified in both experiments and simulations.

These processes are associated with improved varistor performance in single-crystalline ZnO nanowires. Quantitative strain measurements revealed the formation of a strong tensile strain of up to 4.4\% in the region of the ZnO quantum dots. Electron energy loss spectroscopy demonstrated a rapid increase in oxygen vacancies in ZnO under electron beam irradiation. These two major changes greatly decreased carrier transport, resulting in a 34\% reduction in leakage current after irradiation at a beam voltage of 2 MeV.

Thermal conductivity was measured using laser flash analysis between room temperature and 325 °C. Etch pit techniques and ultra-high voltage electron microscopy afford quantification of dislocation density. Experimental results were compared to predictions by the Debye-Callaway model.

One is based on square-law detection near the peak and valley points of the negative differential conductance (NDC) region, with the detection bandwidth determined by an integrated slot antenna. The other is based on detectable current changes induced by injection locking within the NDC region when the frequency of the incident THz-wave radiation to be detected is coincident with that of the bias-dependent RTD self-oscillation between 0.74 and 0.81 THz, resulting in a minimum noise equivalent power (NEP) of 7.7 pW/√Hz at 0.78 THz at room temperature.

  abstract     = {Governed by the Malus law, nanopolarizer-based metasurfaces can continuously modulate the intensity of incident linearly polarized (LP) light pixel-by-pixel, which has been applied to display metaimages with ultracompactness and high resolution. One unique characteristic of the Malus-assisted image display technique is that no matter the polarization direction of incident LP light, the image with different contrast always appears, which would affect the security of a metaimage. Here, inspired by the orientation degeneracy of the Malus law, we show that metaimage displays can be controlled in two fixed polarization directions, merely by reconfiguring the orientations of nanopolarizers. Specifically, for each metaimage pixel, there are two options for the orientation angle of the nanopolarizer corresponding to an equal grayscale value. By randomly selecting the orientation angle among two choices, the metaimage will be blurred or even hidden, except for the polarization direction of 0° for the original image and 90° for its contrast reversed partners. We experimentally demonstrate this concept by encoding a Lena image with pixels of 1000 × 1000 into a silver nanopolarizer-based metasurface and decoding/encrypting it in a polarization-controlled optical setup. The proposed metaimage display with the encryption functionality has advantages such as continuous grayscale modulation, ultrathinness, and high density, which can be applied in ultracompact image displays, high-end anti-counterfeiting, high-density optical information storage, information encryption, etc.},

  abstract     = {Light emitting diodes (LEDs), with active blue and green emitting and sacrificial multi-quantum well layers, were epitaxially grown using metal organic chemical vapor deposition on free-standing semipolar ( ⁠ 20 2 ¯ 1 ⁠ ) GaN substrates. NanoLEDs were then fabricated and released into solution using an approach based on forming a mm-scale mesa, Au–Au thermocompression bonding to a submount, large-area photoelectrochemical etching, and colloidal lithography. Photo- and cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements demonstrated that nanoLEDs were optically active after fabrication and released into the solution. Monte Carlo simulations of the electron trajectory through GaN/InGaN were performed to understand the patterns shown in CL images. The fabrication process developed herein could provide a viable route to highly efficient, nanoscale blue and green light emitters for applications in next-generation display technologies.},

The polarization state is determined by the orientation and the phase relationship between the antennas. The antenna array is carefully designed to efficiently extract the THz radiation and not to induce field oscillation in the array or influence the mode oscillation in the DFB section. Each demonstrated device exhibits single-mode emission with a side mode suppression ratio of ∼26 dB and a single-lobed beam with a low divergence of ∼23°×30°. Realized in different devices, the degree of linear or circular polarization reaches as high as 97.5\% or 99.3\%.

We also report both the longest wavelength emission observed from BGaInAs (1.4 μ m) and electrically injected photoemission from a dilute-boride active region.

Realized through the two-photon additive manufacturing, the device possesses a continuous surface with a diameter of 100 μ m. Using the generator, arbitrary OAM modes were demonstrated, including the axial position, the number of topological charges, and the direction of rotation. The unique optical characteristics were mutually verified experimentally and through simulation. Vortex beams carrying multiple OAMs will provide more degrees of freedom to manipulate light for exciting applications such as optical communications, micromanipulation, and quantum optics.},

Moreover, the viscosity was measured under reduced gravity conditions to benchmark ground-based data. The self-diffusion coefficients were probed by incoherent, quasi-elastic neutron scattering. All measurements were combined with electrostatic or electromagnetic levitation, in order to process these highly reactive Titanium-based melts. From the measured density, the packing fraction was calculated as a function of temperature.

Bending recovery measurements were carried out on cantilevered nanowires deflected by optical tweezers in a liquid environment. The assumption of purely elastic cantilever response (as defined by Young&#39;s modulus of the polymer material) fails to explain the observed overdamped oscillatory motion. A mechanical model is proposed to account for the nanowire viscoelastic behavior. The experimental data indicate that the origin of the nanowire viscous component is twofold. Both the partially cross-linked polymer structure and the solvent penetrating the polymer network contribute to frictional forces inside the nanowire.

Modeling the temperature dependence of the specific contact resistance with the thermionic field emission mechanism allowed extracting a doping concentration of 8.5 × 10 19 cm −3 below the metal/4H-SiC interface, in excellent agreement with the value independently obtained by the SCM depth profiling.

  abstract     = {A silicon-avalanche shaper/sharpener is a fast-closing semiconductor switch. For positive voltages, it is activated by a high-voltage pulse at its cathode, and, when turned on, the current through the device rises rapidly. Using Synopsys TCAD software, a p + − n − n + diode is numerically studied. It was shown that for the case of a high-doped active n region, 10 14 cm −3 , the breakdown process exhibits a fast electric field propagation, as expected. For a low doped active n region, &lt; 10 11 cm −3 , the electric field spreads uniformly along the structure. For this case, we show that the rise time, of the order of 100 ps, is not limited by the active region thickness, allowing the use of a thicker substrate in order to increase the operating voltage. A p + − n − n + diode was fabricated on a thick, 525 μ m, float-zone n -type Si (100) substrate, with a resistivity of 10 4 Ω cm. The active region, n &lt; 10 12 cm −3 , was 517 μ m. When a stack of five, 8 mm 2 , diodes was driven by an ∼ 100 kV, 2.26 ns rise time pulse, the output voltage was 46 kV with the rise time and rise rate per diode of 215 ps and 38.4 kV/ns, respectively. When a single, 4 mm 2 , diode was driven by a 14 kV, 1 ns rise time pulse, the output on a 50 Ω load was around 8 kV, 100 ps, with a rise rate of 57 kV/ns. These results exceed the present state-of-the-art diodes. Furthermore, the thick active region eliminates current fabrication process difficulties such as deep diffusion or thick epitaxial layers.},

  abstract     = {Exploring a quantum topological phase, such as the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect and quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), has been attracting significant attention. In this study, we propose to realize a topological phase transition via NO 2 adsorption in a recently synthesized two-dimensional Ni-hexaaminobenzene [Ni 3 (HAB) 2 ]. First-principles calculations show a QSH state of the pristine Ni 3 (HAB) 2 nanosheet. However, when NO 2 molecules are adsorbed on the Ni 3 (HAB) 2 surface, the system changes to a ferromagnetic state and the time-reversal symmetry is broken. We find that the NO 2 -adsorbed Ni 3 (HAB) 2 exhibits an intrinsic QAH state with the Fermi level exactly located within a topologically nontrivial bandgap. The calculated gapless edge states and quantized Hall conductance further confirm the QSH-to-QAH phase transition. Our finding offers an alternative approach of tuning the topological phase transition in a real MOF material.},

In sufficiently aligned samples with θ = 0 ° or θ = 60 ° and δ ≲ 3 ° ⁠ , we observe an interlayer shear mode (ISM), which is a clear sign of a commensurate bilayer structure, i.e., the layers must undergo an atomic reconstruction to form R-type or H-type stacking orders. We find slightly different ISM energies of about 18 cm –1 and 17 cm –1 for H-type and R-type reconstructions, respectively, independent of the exact value of θ ± δ ⁠ . Our findings are corroborated by the fact that the ISM is not observed in samples with twist angles, which deviate by δ &gt; 3 ° from 0 ° or 60 ° ⁠ . This is expected since, in such incommensurate structures, with the possibility of Moiré-lattice formation, there is no restoring force for an ISM. Furthermore, we observe the ISM even in sufficiently aligned heterobilayers, which are encapsulated in hexagonal Boron nitride.

  abstract     = {The typical two-dimensional semiconductors, group IIIA chalcogenides, have garnered tremendous interest for their outstanding electronic, mechanical, and chemical properties. However, so far, there have been rare reports on boron monosulfides (BS) binary material. Here, four two-dimensional BS sheets, namely, the α -, β -, γ -, and δ -BS sheets, are proposed and discussed from first principles calculations. State-of-the-art calculations reveal all these structures are thermally and dynamically stable, indicating the potential for experimental synthesis. Specifically, for α -BS, it has a calculated exfoliation energy of 0.96 J m −2 , suggesting that the preparation of α -BS is feasible by the exfoliation of bulk rhombohedral-BS. Our results show that α -, β -, and γ -BS are semiconductors, whereas δ -BS is a metallic system. Remarkably, our calculations indicate that δ -BS is a superconductor with a large electron-phonon coupling ( λ ≈ 1.51), leading to a high superconducting critical temperature ( T c ≈ 21.56 K), which is the interesting property with intrinsic superconducting among all two-dimensional group IIIA chalcogenides. The potential of semiconducting BS monolayers as the gas-sensor or thermoelectric materials is also demonstrated.},

This pure CNT forest cantilever is electrostatically actuated to characterize its resonance using a laser Doppler vibrometer, revealing a resonant frequency and quality factor of 7.95 kHz and 51.3, respectively, at room temperature. The measurement result fitted to a free vibrating microcantilever model indicates that the CNT forest, an anisotropic bulk material, has an in-plane Young&#39;s modulus of 3.8 MPa, which matches well with previously reported levels of the modulus. A preliminary test of the cantilever as a resonant-mode sensing device shows real-time temperature tracking, suggesting the device&#39;s potential for not only temperature sensing but also other sensing applications.},

We show that simultaneous doping of Bi along with Fe into BaTiO 3 effectively enhances the magnetoelectric (ME) multiferroic response (both ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity) at room temperature, through careful tuning of Fe valency along with the controlled recovery of the ferroelectric-tetragonal phase. We also report a systematic increase in large dielectric constant values as well as reduction in loss tangent values with relatively moderate temperature variation of the dielectric constant around room temperature with increasing Bi doping content in Ba 1 − x Bi x Ti 0.90 Fe 0.10 O 3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.10), which makes the higher Bi–Fe codoped sample ( x = 0.08) promising for use as a room-temperature high- κ dielectric material. Interestingly, the x = 0.08 (Bi–Fe codoped) sample is not only found to be ferroelectrically (∼20 times) and ferromagnetically (∼6 times) stronger than x = 0 (only Fe-doped) at room temperature, but also observed to be better insulating (larger bandgap) with indirect signatures of larger ME coupling as indicated from anomalous reduction of the magnetic coercive field with decreasing temperature. Thus, room-temperature ME multiferroicity has been engineered in Bi and Fe codoped BTO (BaTiO 3 ) compounds.},

The frustrated skyrmionium has a size of about 10 nm, which can be further reduced by tuning perpendicular magnetic anisotropy or the magnetic field. It is found that the nanoscale skyrmionium driven by the damping-like spin-orbit torque shows directional motion with a favored Bloch-type helicity. A small driving current or magnetic field can lead to the transformation of an unstable Néel-type skyrmionium to a metastable Bloch-type skyrmionium. A large driving current may result in the distortion and collapse of the Bloch-type skyrmionium.

Such behavior results from the fact that the compensation of the carbon acceptor level increases with the carbon concentration. It is accepted that carbon is amphoteric impurity in GaN, creating an acceptor as well as a donor state, which leads to self-compensation. The analysis of existing electron paramagnetic resonance results is extremely important. It enabled us to determine the compensation ratio as a function of carbon concentration.

To investigate this, we perform first-principles total-energy electronic-structure calculations for various Mg and dislocation complexes. We find that threading screw dislocations (TSDs) indeed attract Mg impurities, and that the electronic levels in the energy gap induced by the dislocations are elevated toward the conduction band as the Mg impurity approaches the dislocation line, indicating that the Mg-TSD complex is a donor. The formation of the Mg-TSD complex is unequivocally evidenced by atom probe tomography in which Mg condensation around the [0001] screw dislocation is observed in a p–n diode. These findings provide a picture in which the Mg, being a p-type impurity in GaN, diffuses toward the TSD and then locally forms an n-type region. The appearance of this region along the TSD results in local formation of an n–n junction and leads to an increase in the reverse leakage current.},

The (B x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 ternary alloys of monoclinic and orthorhombic phases with the B-content covering the full composition were studied using first-principles density functional theory calculations. The effect of the B-content on the structural and electronic properties of (B x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys is discussed. The formation enthalpy of the ternary alloys has been investigated, indicating the feasibility of synthesizing (B x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys depending on the specified growth temperature condition. In addition, the increase in the B-content in (B x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys generally leads to the decrease in lattice constants, implying possible tensile strain if grown on the Ga 2 O 3 substrate. Our analysis on the electronic properties shows that all (B x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys exhibit indirect gap property, in which the bandgap increases from 4.83 eV to 6.86 eV in the monoclinic phase and from 5.32 eV to 11.27 eV in the orthorhombic phase when the B-content increases from 0\% to 100\%. The band alignment between Ga 2 O 3 and B 2 O 3 in the (100)-direction is also presented, showing a type-II and type-I alignment for monoclinic-based and orthorhombic-based alloys, respectively. Our results showed an extremely large conduction band offset of 5.76 eV between orthorhombic-based Ga 2 O 3 and B 2 O 3 alloys. Our studies regarding the electronic and structural properties provide important insight regarding the potential of (B x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys for III-oxide-based electronic and optoelectronic device applications.},

  abstract     = {Certain undesired phenomena are observed in n-GaN layers grown by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) due to the unavoidable C-induced carrier compensation. They are a drastic reduction in carrier mobility, called mobility collapse, and significant non-uniformity in the carrier concentration due to the off-angle dependence of the C-incorporation efficiency of the process. These phenomena are particularly severe for low doping levels between 10 15 and 10 16 /cm 3 , which are suitable for fabricating drift layers used in vertical-type GaN power devices that operate in the range of a few kilovolts to tens of kilovolts. However, the C-related undesired characteristics are absent in homo-epitaxial n-GaN layers grown by quartz-free hydride vapor phase epitaxy (QF-HVPE), recently developed by us. The utilization of C-free raw materials alongside quartz-free parts enables the growth of highly pure GaN crystals with negligible Si, C, and O incorporations. These crystals exhibited an electron concentration in the low-10 15 /cm 3 range with the highest reported room temperature electron mobility, μ , of 1470 cm 2 /V s among GaN crystals, whereas n-GaN layers with similar carrier concentrations but containing C-compensation, as in the case of those grown by MOCVD, exhibited a severe mobility collapse ( μ = 288 cm 2 /V s). High uniformity in the carrier concentration with a small standard deviation of 4.0\% was observed in a 2-in. n-GaN wafer grown by QF-HVPE on a GaN substrate with an off-angle variation of 0.3°. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the carrier concentration in wafers grown by MOCVD was approximately 17\% because of the off-angle-dependent C-incorporation.},

By fabricating n- and p-type regions on the plane of the GeSn film using the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology of ion implantation, a low dark current density is revealed and attributed to the low defect density of the film and current flow suppression around the diode periphery. This yields a specific 1550-nm detectivity of ∼10 10 cm Hz 1/2 W −1 , an order of magnitude higher than that of conventional vertical GeSn-based diodes and comparable to that of commercially available Ge-based diodes.

In this work, La 0.04 Ba 0.96 SnO 3 /0.7Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 –0.3PbTiO 3 heterostructures with varying film thicknesses were prepared in order to understand both charge and strain&#39;s contributions to the electric-field induced resistance change. The relative resistance change to the lattice strain remains almost unchanged in those thicker films, while increases a little bit in those thinner films. This slight increase is related to the substrate constraint near the interface and follows Freund&#39;s strain relaxation model during the dynamic strain induced by the piezoelectric switch. A depletion layer model was also established to simulate the electroresistance variation from the interfacial charge effect. The depletion layer involves an equilibrium between capture and release of electrons by the acceptor-like defects near the interface region. The resistance change vs electric field evolves from a butterfly-like shape to a square-like when decreasing the film thickness, due to the joint effect of strain and interfacial polarization screening charge. This study provides an insight into understanding heteroepitaxial coupling and exploring their potential applications in oxide electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Transformation acoustics correlates complex material properties in physical space with distorted wave manipulations in virtual space, such that wave propagation patterns can be determined by mathematical coordinate transformations. These transformations allow for accurate modeling of acoustic propagation in complex materials. Such models are relevant for both biomedical ultrasound therapies and integrated on-chip systems, where muscle fibers and piezoelectric substrates act as effective anisotropic media, respectively. Without considering the anisotropic density of these sophisticated media, attempts to beamform acoustic patterns by phase engineering result in a heavily distorted signal. This distortion is detrimental to the performance of high intensity focused ultrasound acoustic tweezers for noninvasive surgeries, cell trapping, and cell sorting. Here, we demonstrate that the distortion effects can be corrected by transformation acoustics in which the phased array profile is adjusted to account for the corresponding anisotropy. We perform experiments to verify this transformation acoustic correction for arbitrary focused and self-bending beams with two-dimensional anisotropic spoof surface acoustic waves. The benefit of transformation acoustics in suppressing undesired anisotropic effects on beamformed waves improves the precision and efficacy of medical treatments that facilitate noninvasive ultrasound therapies and integrated on-chip applications.},

Phenomenally speaking, only the temperature profiles with allowed frequencies can propagate stably in a thermal convection-diffusion crystal, and those with forbidden frequencies try to change their frequencies for stable propagation. As an application of thermal convection-diffusion crystals, we further design a thermal frequency modulator to manipulate wave-like temperature profiles.

At room temperature, the thermal conductivity decreases by more than 75\% as the stoichiometry is changed from lithium deficient to excess and increases with increasing temperature, indicative of defect-mediated transport in the spark plasma sintered materials. The phase transformations and their stabilities are examined by x-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry and indicate that the Y 3+ substitution of Zr 4+ is effective in stabilizing the ionically conductive rhombohedral phase over the entire temperature range measured, the mechanism of which is found through ab initio theoretical calculations.

Combined nanocalorimetry and time-resolved synchrotron x-ray diffraction studies are utilized to address this range of heating rates for multilayers with an overall composition of 10 at.\% Ni and a bilayer thickness of 220 nm. It was found that a two-stage phase formation of Al 3 Ni proceeds up to a heating rate of 1000 K/s. The two growth stages occur in the solid-state and are kinetically separated. The activation energy of the first growth stage is determined to be 137 kJ/mol, which agrees well with the literature data at low heating rates. At 1000 K/s, a transition to a runaway reaction is observed. Unusual for metallic multilayers, the reaction proceeds completely in the solid-state which is also known as “solid flame.” Using nanocalorimetry, a critical input power density for ignition of 5.8 × 10 4 W/cm 3 was determined. The rapid succession of the two Al 3 Ni formation stages was identified as the underlying mechanism for the self-sustaining reaction.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, metasurfaces enabling a slow light effect in the terahertz band have seen considerable achievement. However, most of these advances demonstrated so far are polarization sensitive. In this work, we demonstrate polarization-insensitive terahertz slow light at spoof surface plasmon-induced transparency windows. Two types of metasurfaces based on different lattice layouts, a C 2 and a C 4 lattice symmetry, are compared. On the one hand, the metasurface with C 2 lattice symmetry displayed a 5 ps slow light effect in a transparency window around 0.3 THz. On the other hand, the metasurface with a C 4 lattice layout achieves a maximum of 28 ps slow light at 0.3 THz. The coupling coefficient and the damping ratio in the transparency window in the metasurface with C 4 lattice symmetry are 5 times higher than in the metasurface with C 2 lattice layout. Two eigenmode mode constructive interference introduces a positive group delay in the transparency window in the metasurface with C 4 lattice symmetry, whereas the superposition of two eigenmodes in the metasurface with C 2 lattice symmetry forms the transparency window without distinct coupling. Our results show that the point group symmetry or lattice structure of a metasurface has a huge impact on the group velocity of terahertz pulses and therefore introduces flexibility in the design of polarization-insensitive slow light devices for terahertz telecommunication application.},

  abstract     = {We report on the demonstration of InGaN photonic nanocrystal light emitting diodes (LEDs), which operate in the green wavelength (∼548 nm). The devices are designed to operate at the Γ point of the photonic band structure and exhibit a spectral linewidth ∼4 nm, which is nearly five to ten times narrower than that of conventional InGaN quantum well LEDs in this wavelength range. Significantly, the device performance, in terms of the emission peak and spectral linewidth, is nearly invariant with injection current, suggesting the insusceptibility to quantum-confined Stark effect commonly seen in InGaN quantum wells. The external quantum efficiency is characterized by a sharp rise with increasing current and reaches a maximum at ∼5 A/cm 2 , which is comparable to conventional blue quantum well LEDs. A relatively small (∼30\%) efficiency droop was measured at an injection current density over 200 A/cm 2 at room temperature without any active cooling.},

  abstract     = {Optical vortices (OVs) carrying orbital angular momentum have been an emerging research area due to their widespread applications ranging from optical communication to particle trapping. However, conventional OV generators suffer from bulky configurations and limited performance. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate high-efficiency focused OV generation by using geometric gap-surface plasmon metalenses with spin-flipped focal planes, where the polarization states, positions, and corresponding topological charges of the OVs can be controlled by changing the spin of incident circularly polarized light, reproducing thereby the combined functionalities of a lens and a q-plate. The fabricated dual-polarity OV metalens features the polarization conversion ratios above 88\% and efficiencies exceeding 50\% for both right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized light in a wide wavelength range of 850 to 1000 nm. We further extend this approach to realize a multiple-focal OV metalens with distinct and spin-multiplexed OVs at four different longitudinal focal planes. Compared to conventional OV generators, the proposed OV metalenses are compact, ultrathin, and multiplexed, therefore opening an innovative avenue for advanced research and applications aiming at multiple functionalities and dense integration in photonics.},

However, its nonlinear susceptibility has not been experimentally studied; thus, it is not yet possible to evaluate its potential in nonlinear optics. In this work, we investigate third harmonic generation (THG) in a 100 nm thick Cd 3 As 2 film using broadband infrared femtosecond lasers (across 1500–2350 nm). The χ 3 of Cd 3 As 2 (2.30 × 10 −19 m 2 V −2 ) is obtained by comparing the THG spectra with a glass substrate, graphene, and monolayer MoS 2 . We further demonstrate a simple approach to enhance the THG signal by introducing an underlying planar micro-cavity. An enhancement of about 420 times in the THG signal was recorded at ≃1560 nm. Our results indicate that Cd 3 As 2 thin films can provide a similar platform for nonlinear optics with respect to graphene and may offer unique potential in the mid-infrared due to its broadband light–matter interaction and excellent tunability.},

Both the Stage-II experiment, reported in this paper, and the Stage-I experiment were conducted using MTM structures, which are all-metal periodic structures with the period being much smaller than the wavelength. Differences between the two experiments include (1) structure length (Stage-I 8 cm and Stage-II 20 cm); (2) number of bunches used to excite the structure (Stage-I with two bunches, up to 85 nC of total charge; Stage-II with eight bunches, up to 224 nC of total charge); and (3) highest peak power measured (Stage-I 80 MW in a 2 ns pulse and Stage-II 380 MW in a 10 ns pulse). High-power radio frequency pulses were generated by reversed Cherenkov radiation of the electron beam due to the negative group velocity in the MTM structures. Because the radiation is coherent, a train of bunches with a proper spacing can build up to achieve a high peak power. The observed output power levels are very promising for future applications in direct collinear wakefield acceleration or in transfer to a second accelerator for two-beam acceleration.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we demonstrate a miniature energy harvesting wind velocity sensor of simple, low-cost construction, based on a single-degree-of-freedom galloping structure. The sensor consists of a prismatic bluff body with a triangular cross section attached to the free end of a cantilever incorporating a commercial polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric film. In the wind, the bluff body causes vibration of the cantilever based on galloping, and the piezoelectric film converts the vibration energy into an electrical signal. We have observed a negative correlation between the wind velocity and the vibration frequency, and we demonstrate that this relationship can be used to detect wind velocity directly with useful accuracy. A simple theoretical model indicates that the frequency shift can be accounted for by the effect of the axial loading due to form drag. The model shows close agreement with the experimental results. In wind tunnel tests, a prototype wind velocity sensor based on this principle could measure wind velocities from 4.45 to 10 m/s, with the measured velocity typically being within 4\% of the reference value obtained using a Pitot tube.},

The temperature dependencies of the angular distributions at fixed idler frequencies are analyzed using a theoretical Klyshko–Kirchhoff approach with account of thermal field fluctuations and inherent crystal absorption at terahertz frequencies. Although all the measurements are performed in the optical range, we demonstrate how such analysis enables to predict the temperature behavior of the total number of spontaneous parametric downconversion-generated idler photons in the terahertz range, the temperature variation of the optical-terahertz biphoton function, and to study the contributions of classical thermal and pure quantum field fluctuations to parameters of biphotons. It is shown that the temperature-induced growth of the numbers of signal and idler photons and their non-normalized correlation function is provided by overwhelming increase in classical fluctuations, while the pure quantum contributions to these parameters are not so sensitive to the crystal temperature.},

Characterization of the mechanical modes reveals residual tensile stress in the GaAs device layer. This stress results in higher mechanical frequencies than in unstressed GaAs and can be used for strain engineering of mechanical dissipation. Simultaneously, we find that the finite waist of the incident optical beam leads to a dip in the reflectance spectrum. This feature originates from coupling to a guided resonance of the photonic crystal, an effect that must be taken into account when designing slabs of finite size. The single-layer and sub- μ m-spaced double-layer slabs demonstrated here can be directly fabricated on top of a distributed Bragg reflector mirror in the same material platform.

This Letter proposes a method to reduce the rise time of galloping flow energy harvesters by passively manipulating the flow near the trailing edge. To this end, the rear face of the square prism typically used in galloping energy harvesting is augmented with Y-shaped fins of different lengths and fork angles. The addition of the fins is shown to significantly increase the rate at which the magnitude of the normal force coefficient grows with the angle of attack. This, in turn, can reduce the rise time of the harvester by as much as 75\% when compared to the finless square prism. The addition of the fins has no detrimental influence on the steady-state performance of the harvester. On the contrary, the steady-state voltage of the harvester can also be improved for some fin geometries.},

Recently reported new generation direct current TENG (DC-TENG) based on the air breakdown effect exhibits unique advantages over conventional modes of TENG devices, such as free-of-rectification and intrinsic switching behavior. However, owing to different working mechanisms and output characteristics, existing theory and power management strategies are not suitable for in-depth understanding and further advancement of air breakdown DC-TENG. Herein, a theoretical study and experimental verification that systematically investigate the physics, output characteristics, and power management strategy of air breakdown DC-TENG is presented. A general simulation model is then proposed and verified through a statistical analysis method. Contrary to previous understanding of a highly conductive breakdown pathway, a huge resistance is observed and causes inevitable energy loss, which is regarded to be caused by corona discharge.

  abstract     = {Acoustic tweezers (ATs) have been extensively exploited in physics, biology, chemistry, and medical medicine. However, previous ATs are limited by complex designs and cumbersome configurations, and the stable manipulation of Mie particles remains challenging. Here, an AT based on acoustic focused petal beams (AFPBs) is proposed to realize 2D stable manipulations of both Rayleigh and Mie particles in water. The AFPBs are generated by artificial structure plates (ASPs) engraved with two kinds of discrete curved slits. It is found that the bright petals of AFPBs are flexibly modulated by arranging the sectors of curved slits on ASP, and the central zero-intensity region encircled by bright petals is increased with the number of petals. Then, the acoustic radiation forces of the AFPBs with 2 and 10 petals acting on the Rayleigh and Mie particles are further studied, respectively, and a force equilibrium position is found in both cases. Finally, two ASP samples are fabricated to experimentally verify the generations of AFPBs, and the 2D stable trappings and movements of both Rayleigh and Mie particles are realized by AFPBs. This miniaturized AT is beneficial to practical applications in material fabrication, drug delivery, and tissue engineering.},

BICs have been experimentally observed in acoustic resonators, photonic crystal slabs, and optical waveguides. Herein, we constructed a topological inductor–capacitor (LC) circuit to observe BICs; the circuit consists of two identical LC Su–Schrieffer–Heeger chains coupled using a middle chain with capacitors. In addition, a BIC in a non-Hermitian system was also experimentally observed by adding different resistances to the original LC circuit. Our experimental and simulation results thus prove that an electrical circuit could be used as a platform to realize BIC. Furthermore, we believe that such a circuit can be extended to two- and three-dimensional models and higher frequencies, making it suitable for electrical device applications, such as antennae, filters, and radio frequency devices.},

In the spectra of Sc, La, Nd, Er, and Tm compounds, only broadened bands of the ligands peaked about 450 nm are observed. A similar spectrum gives anthracene, which is used as a reference compound. In contrast, the emission spectra of Eu and Tb compounds contain only the narrow bands of f–f transitions characteristic of these metals.

  abstract     = {High-crystalline halide perovskite nanostructures [such as nanowires and nanoplates (NPs)] provide good potential in realizing nanoscale solid light sources for on-chip optical communication, high-density storage, and life science applications. However, it remains a great challenge to fabricate nanoscale perovskite light-emitting devices using traditional fabrication methods because the perovskite nanomaterials will be dissolved in polar solvents. Developing new device configurations to enhance radiative recombination efficiency as well as device stability is one of the most important research topics in nanoscale perovskite light-emitting devices. Here, we demonstrate nanoscale perovskite electroluminescence (EL) using a single-crystalline CsPbBr 3 NP as the active layer. The device is based on a hybrid capacitance structure, where an underlying few-layer graphene (FLG) electrode, a single-crystalline CsPbBr 3 NP, a thin hexagonal boron nitride ( h BN) flake, and another FLG top electrode are stacking in sequence, forming a van der Waals heterostructure. A strong EL emission peak with a narrow linewidth (∼1.09 nm) is observed at 2 K. Alternating current voltage/frequency-dependent EL spectra are studied in detail. We attribute the superior EL behavior of the as-fabricated nanoscale perovskite light-emitting devices to (1) the high-quality single-crystalline CsPbBr 3 NPs synthesized, (2) the h BN encapsulation, which enhances the device stability by providing a large heat dissipation pathway for CsPbBr 3 NP and protecting it from the polar solvents, (3) the capacitance structure, which facilitates the injection of both electrons and holes. Our work demonstrates a method to construct nanoscale perovskite (with well-defined geometry) light sources, providing an opportunity for realizing a nanoscale electrically driven perovskite laser.},

Here, we present the optical absorption properties of atomically flat antimonene for which the directional bonds between Sb atoms appear to be analogous to C–C bonds in graphene. The results, based on first-principles density functional theory calculations, predict the absorbance in multilayer antimonene to be comparable or higher than that calculated for multilayer graphene. Specifically, the IR absorption in antimonene is significantly higher with a prominent band at about 4 μ m associated with the dipole-allowed interband transitions. Furthermore, a strong dependence of absorbance on topology is predicted for both antimonene and graphene which results from the subtle variations in their stacking-dependent band structures. Our results suggest multilayer antimonene to be a good candidate material for optical power limiting applications in the IR region.},

Our findings are explained based on the established segregation enthalpy profiles for oxygen vacancies and interstitials, providing a microscopic model for previous, seemingly disconnected observations ranging from insulating to conducting behavior. In addition, we observe variations in conductance between different nominally neutral walls that we attribute to deviations from the ideal charge-neutral structure within the bulk, leading to a superposition of extrinsic and intrinsic contributions.

This work establishes a correlation between the quenching temperature and salient electrical (conductivity, piezoelectric and dielectric) properties of two NBT x BT variants. The impact of quenching on the mechanical properties is quantified in terms of changes in Young&#39;s modulus. The perspective for application is interrogated using a variation in the sample thickness and separating the sample interior from the sample surface. An in situ measurement of surface temperature during the quenching treatment is applied to validate the simulation for thickness-dependent thermal transport in the material and ensuing transient thermal stresses. The calculated stress intensity factor is then compared with the fracture toughness of the material. This study asserts that air quenching can be conducted without mechanical degradation. Thus, it can be an important alternative to existing industrial strategies to enhance the thermal stability of the piezoelectric properties of relaxor NBT x BT.},

The spin-polarized electron transport and the faster transport of the electrons as compared to the holes generate the residual majority electron spins in the QDs. A reversal of the optical spin polarity was observed at the ground state of the QDs, depending on the excitation powers. A rate equation analysis considering the individual spin-flip times between spin-split QD states indicates that the polarity reversal originates from the asymmetric spin-flip process at the excited state of the QDs. The asymmetric spin relaxation is associated with the selective relaxation of the spin-flipped electron and hole to the unoccupied ground state, which is induced by the existence of the residual majority electron spin at this state. In addition, we observed a clear recovery of the optical spin polarity by eliminating the existence of the residual electron spin through heavy p-doping. These findings are important to attain a fundamental understanding of the spin relaxation mechanism within the QDs and provide an insight into the manipulation of the optical spin polarity by controlling the residual electron spins in the QDs.},

At low fields, skyrmions are metastable and display an elliptical instability in which along the short axis, the spin texture approaches that of the spin-spiral phase and the long axis expands in order to go back to the spin-spiral ground state. At high fields, we observe round skyrmions of finite size up to the collapse field B c , where they are destroyed and the topological charge is annihilated. We estimate B c via numerical methods based on magnetization dynamics simulations parametrized by density functional theory calculations and compare it to experimental scanning tunneling microscopy observations obtained at ≈ 30 mK.},

  abstract     = {The response of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in a liquid to an alternating magnetic field is complicated because the rotational motions of both the magnetic moment in the MNP (internal rotation) and the MNP itself (physical rotation) affect each other. It is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of these rotation behaviors for the success of the recent bio-applications of MNPs. However, the experimental technique for the observation of the physical rotation has been lacking. In our previous work, we demonstrated that the physical rotation of MNPs could be measured quantitatively from the absorbance change with a Faraday configuration. Then, it was revealed that the ten nm-sized maghemite MNP kept aligning to some extent with small oscillation. This behavior is consistent with the “magnetic mode” that Usov and Liubimov proposed from their numerical simulation. In the present study, we improved the apparatus to measure the induced linear dichroism with a Voigt configuration. This improvement increased the signal-to-noise ratio by about 100 times and allowed us to investigate the dependence of the physical rotation on the size of magnetite MNPs. It was shown that smaller MNPs (11 nm and 13 nm) rotated in the magnetic mode. By contrast, the rotational motion of the biggest MNP (25 nm) had different features compared to the smaller ones. These differences can be explained with “viscous mode” that Usov and Liubimov also predicted. Furthermore, we suggest a dimensionless parameter as a useful criterion for the transition of these modes.},

Experiments are performed on FePt/FeNi bilayered films that are formed with square arrays of FeNi disks on top of a continuous FePt film in a topological spin distribution. The observation of topological Hall effect was made in the FePt/FeNi film without a nanoscale Hall-bar device.

This is demonstrated for the Heusler compound Co 2 MnSi, which has a crystallographic transition from a B2 to an L2 1 structure with increasing annealing temperature T a . We investigated a set of Co 2 MnSi thin films deposited on MgO(001) substrates and annealed from 300 to 500 °C. The amplitude of LinMOKE and QMOKE spectra, detected in the extended visible spectral range of 0.8–5.5 eV, scales linearly with T a , and this effect is pronounced at the resonant peaks of the QMOKE spectra below 2.0 eV. Furthermore, the spectra of the magneto-optic (MO) parameters, which fully describe the MO response of Co 2 MnSi up to the second order in M , are obtained depending on T a . Finally, the spectra are compared with ab initio calculations of a purely L2 1 -ordered Co 2 MnSi Heusler compound.},

We induced a range of internal compressive strain in five samples from −0.90\% to −2.07\% by varying the composition during the growth and mechanically induced a similar range of internal strain in analogous quantum well membrane samples.

In this study, the optical constants, absorption coefficients, and interband electron transitions of MAPb 1− x Sn x I 3 ( x = 0, 0.4, 0.8, and 1) films have been analyzed by spectroscopic ellipsometry in the photon range of 1 eV–5 eV.

With the increase in Sn, the s–p antibonding coupling becomes stronger, and the bandgap energy decreases, owing to the shallower and more active lone-pair states of Sn-5s than Pb-5s near the valence band maximum (VBM). According to the x-ray diffraction patterns, doping Sn does not change the material structures, which makes the shape of VBM more fluctuating, resulting in a similar band structure. Moreover, band structures and interband electron transitions of all four samples are discussed in terms of solid-state physics and can be assigned to the direct transition between the valence band and the conduction band at R, M, and X symmetry points.},

The generation of such fields is vital to a diverse range of applications in physical acoustics. However, at present, the application of acoustic holograms is severely hindered by the static nature of the resulting fields. In this work, it is shown that by intentionally reducing the diffraction efficiency of each hologram, it is possible to create stackable acoustic holograms that can be repositioned to reconfigure the combined acoustic field. An experimental test-case consisting of two holograms, each designed to generate a distinct distribution of acoustic foci, is used to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Field scans taken for four different positions of the two holograms confirm that the individual patterns for each hologram can be arbitrary translated relative to one another. This allows for the generation of a much greater range of fields from a single transducer than could be created using a single hologram.},

The comparable nature of defects in thin film and bulk crystal material implies that there is minimal impact of polycrystallinity in Sb 2 Se 3 supporting the concept of benign grain boundaries.},

In terms of the transmission of the picture information, then the multiple degrees of freedom (e.g., wavelength, polarization, and spatial mode) of the photon mean that high amounts of information can be encoded such that the many pixel values of an image can, in principle, be communicated by a single photon. However, the number of photons required to transmit the image information is not necessarily, at least technically, the same as the number of photons required to image an object. Therefore, another equally important question is how many photons does it take to measure an unknown image?},

This study proposes a single-shot multi-planar wave-front measurement with multi-focal Fibonacci sieves to reconstruct the wave-front distribution of small transmissive objects. A Fibonacci sieve was designed to simultaneously capture multi-planar diffraction patterns at a single recording plane; thus, a multi-planar CDI algorithm can be used to reconstruct the test wave-front by a set of extracted sub-graphs. Its feasibility was proved in the optical region experimentally. Since diffractive optical elements used in the experiment are amplitude-only elements, the proposed wave-front measurement method opens up the possibility of practical real-time and on-line wave-front measurement ranging from x rays to terahertz.},

We measure the dissociation rate-constants of ion clusters for several ionic liquids. It is found that ion cluster dissociation occurs on timescales of the order of 1–5 μ s and follows a constant-rate equation in the region outside the ion source. Using the measured rate-constants, we estimate the post-emission ion cluster temperatures. We also qualify the way the electric field enhances the rate-constants.

Previous works on entangled TPA with spontaneous parametric downconversion light sources found a linear dependence on the input photon-pair flux, but are limited by low optical powers, along with a very broad spectrum. We report that by using a high-flux squeezed light source for TPA, a fluorescence enhancement of ∼ 47 is achieved in fluorescein biomarkers as compared to classical TPA. Moreover, a polynomial behavior of the TPA rate is observed in the the laser dye 4-dicyanomethylene-2-methyl-6-(p(dimethylamino)styryl)-4H-pyran in dimethyl sulphoxide.},

We are surprised to find that sunlight irradiation does not always enhance droplet evaporation, which is against the common sense that “Sun accelerates water evaporation.” This is true at least for short-time evaporation. A whole droplet lifetime consists of two regimes of evaporation: a light induced deterioration regime and an acceleration regime. The deterioration regime is explained by the decreased temperature difference from the droplet bottom to apex, weakening Marangoni flow to hinder conduction heat transfer from the substrate to the droplet. The enhanced regime is explained by the reduced light energy reflection via the droplet surface. The substrate conduction heat transfer and radiation heat transfer of light are coupled to dominate evaporation. The two mechanisms create opposite contributions, resulting in a constant evaporation rate for sunlight irradiation on a droplet. However, natural light decreases the evaporation rate vs time. Hence, evaporation rates with and without sunlight irradiation cross at a specific time. Our work enhances the fundamental understanding of droplet evaporation and provides a useful guideline for efficient solar energy utilization.},

In the studied solar cells, we observe near full-scale shot noise, indicating the dominance of noise generation by a single source, likely the interface between the perovskite and the spiro-organic 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di- p -methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene hole-transport layer. We argue that the strong 1/ f noise term has contributions from both the perovskite layer and interfaces. It displays a non-ideal dependence on photocurrent, S ∝ I 1.4 (instead of usual S ∝ I 2 ⁠ ), which is likely due to current-induced halide migration. Finally, we observe generation–recombination noise. We argue that this contribution is due to bimolecular recombination in the perovskite bulk absorption layer. Extrapolating our results, we estimate that at standard 1 sun illumination, the electron–hole recombination time is 5 μ s.},

Therefore, control over the repellency requires modifying surface chemistry and liquid properties to obtain the desired rate of film retraction. Here, we report how the dynamics of a receding thin liquid stripe to a spherical cap droplet can be controlled by programming surface repellency through a non-contact electrostatic method. We observe excellent agreement between the expected scaling of the dynamics for a wide range of voltage-selected final contact angles. Our results provide a method of controlling the dynamics of dewetting with high precision and locality relevant to printing and directed templating.},

  abstract     = {During pool boiling, a significantly high heat flux leads to the transition from nucleate boiling to film boiling, where a vapor film forms over the boiling surface, drastically increasing thermal resistance. This transition at the critical heat flux (CHF) results in an abrupt increase in surface temperature and can lead to catastrophic failure of the boiler. However, reported CHF values vary greatly, even for smooth surfaces of the same material; for example, the CHF values on flat silicon and silicon dioxide surfaces vary across studies by up to 49\% and 84\%, respectively. Here, we address this discrepancy by accounting for hydrocarbon adsorption on boiling surface. Hydrocarbon adsorption on smooth boiling surfaces decreases surface wettability, hindering the ability to maintain liquid contact with the surface and, thus, lowering the pool boiling CHF. To investigate hydrocarbon adsorption kinetics under ambient conditions and the subsequent effect on CHF, we cleaned flat silicon dioxide samples with argon plasma to remove hydrocarbon contaminants and then exposed them to laboratory air for different periods of time before conducting pool boiling experiments. Pool boiling results along with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data showed that the amount of adsorbed hydrocarbon increased with exposure time in air, which resulted in a decrease in wettability and, accordingly, a decrease in CHF. This work has important implications for understanding the spread in CHF values reported in the literature and may serve as a guideline for the preparation of boiling surfaces to achieve consistent experimental results.},

If the effect of confinement alone on freezing is well known, water is never pure and solutes depressing the freezing point are naturally found. However, the combination of confinement and solute is poorly understood. Here, we study in situ the freezing of water in a model porous medium made of densely packed particles with various salt (KCl) concentrations. We demonstrate a synergistic effect of solute with confinement: the freezing front, initially heterogeneous due to confinement, drives solute enrichment in the remaining liquid, further depressing its freezing point. This increases the local freezing point depression and results in much larger mushy layers where ice and liquid water coexist. We compare our experimental freezing profile with theory and estimate the local solute concentration to increase by more than one order of magnitude through the freezing process. These results imply that even low solute concentrations may have important effects on the distribution of water in frozen porous media and should help explain the variety of freezing patterns observed experimentally. This may be critical for cryo-tolerance of construction materials and organisms and will help understanding solute precipitation and redistribution in soils.},

  abstract     = {Superfocusing of acoustic and elastic waves is generally achieved by the combination of negative refraction and the enhancement of the evanescent waves. Here, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the bifunctionality of a superlens that can simultaneously focus acoustic and flexural waves beyond the diffraction limit. The designed structure is composed of a two-dimensional arrangement of pillars that act as rigid scatterers for the sound waves and as resonant scatterers for the flexural waves. The band structure presents modes with negative dispersion bands allowing negative refraction for both types of waves within the frequency range of 6.9–7.4 kHz, which is induced by the Bragg scattering effect. Edge modes that enhance the evanescent waves through resonant coupling appear around 7.2 kHz for the flexural and sound wave. The simultaneous superlensing is then observed at this frequency. Our finding will enlighten multiphysical and multifunctional wave manipulations and could have pragmatic applications involving multiwave devices.},

While these drift coefficients measured in the dark are similar to commonly observed drift coefficients (∼0.1) at and above room temperature, measurements under light show a significantly lower drift coefficient (0.05 under illumination vs 0.09 in the dark at 150 K). Periodic on/off switching of light shows a sudden decrease/increase in resistance, attributed to photo-excited carriers, followed by a very slow response (∼30 min at 150 K) attributed to contribution of electron traps and slow trap-to-trap charge exchanges. A device-level electronic model is used to relate these experimental findings to gradual charging of electron traps in amorphous Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 , which gives rise to growth of a potential barrier for holes in time and, hence, resistance drift.},

Obvious degradation was observed under initial light exposure not only at the device level but also at the film morphology and electronic structure level. Device performance parameters, such as short-circuit current (J SC ), power conversion efficiency, fill factor, and hysteresis effect, were aggravated with an initial light exposure of less than ∼8 h at 1 sun intensity. Meanwhile, the deteriorated crystallinity and electronic structure of the MAPbI 3 film were also detected with x-ray diffraction, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy. The observed degradation is rationally related to the light-induced decomposition of MAPbI 3 . However, the degradation can be partly recovered with the following light exposure resulting in self-healing of the devices and MAPbI 3 films. The self-healing behavior should be ascribed to the conversion of decomposition products back to MAPbI 3 , because the intermediates are wrapped tightly in the photoactive layer by the compact coverlayers of HTLs and ETLs and some reversible reactions occur consequently. The mechanism of self-healing is discussed by introducing the trapped states derived from ion migration. The PSCs prepared here imply a good optical stability and thus a good performance facilitated by tight wrapping of the active MAPbI 3 .},

  abstract     = {The use of metal nanoparticles (NPs) that can trigger localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is an effective method for improving the performance of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Currently, most plasmonic NPs are based on noble metals, including gold and silver; their high cost limits their commercial applications in the cost-effective OPVs. Herein, copper (Cu) NPs, which are more abundant and cheaper, are adopted to fabricate OPVs. To avoid oxidation of Cu NPs, they are positioned at the cathode interface, so that their fabrication could be implemented in an inert environment. The resulting OPVs exhibited improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) under illumination at 1 sun, and the device enhancement could be attributed to the LSPR effects of Cu NPs. Further, their potential to enhance the performance of OPVs under indoor lighting conditions is evaluated. The enhancement factor of PCEs was higher, while the light source had a lower color temperature. It could be due to the fact that the main plasmonic band of the Cu NPs is localized in the red spectral range. The results reveal the consideration of matching between the LSPR spectral range and the emission spectra of the artificial light sources is very critical for indoor applications.},

  abstract     = {Recently, two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have emerged as promising candidates for resistive switching (RS) devices. However, challenges in controllable conversion of RS types in such 2D materials still remain. Here, we report the experimental realization of reversible transition between non-volatile bipolar resistive switching (BRS) and volatile threshold switching (TS) in 2D layered III–VI semiconductor gallium selenide (GaSe) nanosheets through appropriately setting the compliance current ( I cc ). Under a relatively high I cc value of 1 mA, the device shows non-volatile BRS performance with a high ON/OFF ratio of nearly 10 4 , a long retention time of 12 000 s, and a high endurance of 1200 switching cycles. Furthermore, under a relatively low I cc (lower than 10 μ A), the volatile TS behaviors can be observed. For the former, the large I cc can generate stable conductive filaments (CFs) of Ga vacancy. Thus, the breakage of the stable CFs needs a high reverse voltage to re-align the Ga vacancy. For the latter, the low I cc generated unstable CFs can be broken by the current induced Joule heat. This study establishes the feasibility of integrating different RS types in 2D layered semiconductor nanosheets and understanding the underlying physical mechanism of different RS types in the 2D platform.},

We probe the Coulomb diamonds of the gate-induced quantum dot exhibiting a charging energy of ∼ 2.5 meV and orbital excitation energies up to 0.3 meV. The gate hysteresis for sweeps covering 5 Coulomb diamonds reveals an energy hysteresis of only 60 μ eV between upward and downward sweeps. Charge noise is studied via long-term measurements at the slope of a Coulomb peak revealing a potential fluctuation of ∼1 μ eV/ Hz at 1 Hz. This makes h-BN a dielectric with the currently lowest gate hysteresis and lowest low-frequency potential fluctuations reported for low-gap III–V nanowires.

Fine and complex domain structures were also observed inside the rectangular domains. The RSM results also indicated that the crystal had rhombohedral-like symmetry, although several discrepancies were observed, such as unexpectedly split diffraction peaks and distortion-related diffraction distribution in the reciprocal space. The structural behavior observed in the TEM images and 2D and 3D RSM images suggested that the symmetry of the 72BF–28BT specimen was lower than rhombohedral and may have been monoclinic.

Here, we propose a coupling between ferromagnetic and diamagnetic layers. We used this diamagnetic coupling to improve the exchange bias field of a diamagnet/ferromagnet/anti-ferromagnet hetero-structure by up to 212\%, as evidenced in the experiments presented here. Since diamagnets have very special properties, including temperature independent negative magnetic susceptibilities, this coupling could be a powerful tool in future synthesis of solid state nanostructures such as exchange bias systems, spintronic devices, magnetic random access memories, sensors, and multiferroics.},

After a forming-gas anneal at 700 °C, the MOCVD film is highly conducting, with a room-temperature carrier concentration of 2 × 10 20 cm −3 , a mobility of 20 cm 2 /V s, and direct bandgap absorptions at 3.65 eV and 4.60 eV. Under the same annealing conditions, the PLD film is semi-insulating, with a direct bandgap absorption at 5.25 eV. The phonon structure, important for electrical and thermal conduction as well as superconductivity and other quantum phenomena, is very complicated due to the large number of atoms (and, thus, phonon branches) in the unit cell. However, we show that the phonon contributions to electron mobility ( μ ph ) can be directly measured by quantum-based magnetoconductivity over the temperature span T = 10–200 K. From an approximate analytical formula, μ ph = function (T ph , T), we calculate an effective phonon energy kT ph (T) that takes account of all phonon contributions at temperature T. For T = 10–200 K, the value of kT ph ranges from about 10 to 90 meV, consistent with the energy range of the ZnGa 2 O 4 phonon density of states (at 0 K) calculated by density functional theory. The total measured mobility can then be modeled by μ tot −1 = μ ii −1 + μ ph −1 , where μ ii is the mobility due to ionized-impurity scattering. With a high bandgap, controllable conductivity, high breakdown voltage, and bulk-growth capability, ZnGa 2 O 4 offers opportunities for high-power electronics and UV detectors.},

  abstract     = {The integration of GaN on Si as large scale substrates still faces many hurdles. Besides the large difference in the lattice constant and the high thermal mismatch existing between GaN and Si, spiral hillock growth phenomena are common problems in the development of thick GaN layers. In this work, hexagonal hillocks were observed on GaN/AlGaN high-electron-mobility transistor heterostructures grown on Si(111) by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The presence of these morphological and structural defects is attributed to the presence of localized contamination at the AlN/Si interface. These carbon-based defects cause highly defective regions in the AlN seed layer, which propagate through all the AlGaN buffer layers inducing the formation of V-shaped pits at the AlGaN interfaces. In hillock regions of the wafers, Raman spectroscopy indicates disturbed two-dimensional electron gas characteristics resulting from GaN/AlGaN interface roughness and a decreased amount of free carriers in the potential well. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy reveals Ga accumulation inside the V-pits and in nanopipes below, which is responsible for defective areas and the increased GaN growth rate resulting in hillock formation. Photoluminescence measurements confirm the presence of Ga-rich material reducing the inherent gallium vacancy concentration. Here, the reduced amount of Ga-vacancies acting as a shallow acceptor suppresses the ultraviolet luminescence band from donor–acceptor pair transition.},

  abstract     = {For the design of duct silencers, one should satisfy the essential constraints on the sound attenuation band, additional volume, and backpressure. For wideband sound attenuation, various acoustic metamaterials (AMM) using multiple resonators have been proposed. However, they often do not satisfy the spatial constraint, and the blocking of the conduit makes them impractical. This study proposes a compact silencing AMM unit for wideband sound reduction without deteriorating the mechanical performance. Previous works on the stacked micro-perforated panels (MPP) with different backing air gaps provide the basic idea of this work, which reveals the benefit of multiple resonators in adjusting the bandwidths to attain a wideband attenuation characteristic. The resistive element is also exploited in the MPP for suppressing the acoustic transparency of the detuned resonators. The formulated theoretical design method is tested by using a resonant unit cell configured with a serial connection of quadruple MPP layers, each air gap with a length of 30 mm and a uniform sectional area of 8 × 8 mm 2 . For minimizing the occupied volume, each cell surrounds the outer periphery of the main duct by folding, and the cell entry is flush-mounted on the duct wall. The test is conducted with the main duct of 30 × 30 mm 2 , and the attached 50 cells are arranged periodically with a 10-mm interval. The additional width of the duct is less than 1\% of the wavelength. The measured power transmission coefficient is less than 0.2 for the range of 0.4–4.05 kHz, which agrees well with the prediction.},

  abstract     = {Bialkali photocathodes, such as cesium potassium antimonide (CsK 2 Sb), can generate a high-brightness electron beam using a high-power green laser. These photocathode materials have potential applications in advanced accelerators and electron microscopes. It is known that the quantum efficiency (QE) of these photocathodes is affected severely by their substrates; however, reusability of the substrates is not well known. Here, we use graphene, silicon (Si), and molybdenum (Mo) substrates to evaluate the effects of substrates on the QE of redeposited CsK 2 Sb photocathodes after thermal cleanings. We found that the QE of CsK 2 Sb photocathodes redeposited on a graphene substrate after thermal cleaning at 500 °C remained largely unchanged. On the other hand, the QE of redeposited photocathodes on Si and Mo substrates after thermal cleaning at the same temperature decreased drastically. We used x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to quantitatively evaluate the residues of photocathodes after thermal cleaning at 400 °C and 500 °C. We found that Sb, K, and Cs are removed by thermal cleaning at 500 °C for the graphene substrate, but all or the majority of these elements remained on the Si and Mo substrates. The results were consistent with our density functional theory calculations for the case of Si, which we investigated. Furthermore, our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on graphene indicated that its intrinsic electronic structure is preserved after photocathode deposition and thermal cleaning at 500 °C. Hence, we attributed the difference in the amount of photocathode residue to the unique dangling-bond-free surface of inert graphene. Our results provide a foundation for graphene-based reusable substrates for high-QE semiconductor photocathodes.},

  abstract     = {Flexible transparent conductors made from networks of metallic nanowires are a potential replacement for conventional, non-flexible, and transparent conducting materials such as indium tin oxide. Cu nanowires are particularly interesting as cost-effective alternatives to Ag nanowires—the most investigated metallic nanowire to date. To optimize the conductivity of Cu nanowire networks, the resistance contributions from the material and nanowire junctions must be independently known. In this paper, we report the resistivity values ( ρ ) of individual solution-grown Cu nanowires ⟨ ρ ⟩ = 20.1 ± 1.3 nΩ m and the junction resistance ( R jxn ) between two overlapping Cu nanowires ⟨ R jxn ⟩ = 205.7 ± 57.7 Ω. These electrical data are incorporated into an electro-optical model that generates analogs for Cu nanowire networks, which accurately predict without the use of fitting factors the optical transmittance and sheet resistance of the transparent electrode. The model&#39;s predictions are validated using experimental data from the literature of Cu nanowire networks composed of a wide range of aspect ratios (nanowire length/diameter). The separation of the material resistance and the junction resistance allows the effectiveness of post-deposition processing methods to be evaluated, aiding research and industry groups in adopting a materials-by-design approach.},

  abstract     = {Elastocaloric cooling utilizes the latent heat associated with stress-induced reversible phase transformations to achieve cooling. Currently, the key barrier to this technology is its prohibitive cost due to the high elastocaloric material cost and the large stress required to drive the cooling cycle. Vanadium (IV) oxide (VO 2 ) is a good candidate, and it is relatively cheap. Our calorimetry study shows it exhibits a reversible phase transformation with a large latent heat of 31.5 J/g as well as excellent functional stability. Its transformation temperature and latent heat are tunable via heat treatment. We demonstrate that VO 2 powders can be cyclically compressed in a steel tube using a steel plunger to drive the elastocaloric effect. The application of relatively low stress of 300 MPa is sufficient to result in a reversible temperature change of 0.5 °C on the powder compact. Further improvement of reversible temperature change to 1.6 °C under 300 MPa is achieved by adding conductive copper powders. Future efforts should focus on improving material properties such as heat capacity and thermal conductivity for candidate ceramic oxides to maximize elastocaloric effects.},

However, the decolorization reaction hinders the formation of optical bi-stable states of the oxides. Here, we deposit WO 3 nanoparticles into ZnO nanowire arrays to form a multi-site heterojunction. The heterojunction micro-interface acts as a spatially dispersed hole transport channel to suppress the WO 3 carrier recombination and to prolong the relaxation time more than 10 4 s. The photochromic response range covers the whole visible-NIR regions, and the absorption modulation amplitude is improved significantly. Persistent holographic fringes with alternated arrangement of WO 3 and H x WO 3 show a diffraction efficiency reaching 1.1\% even at a very low writing power. This work is expected to be one of the most pursued application strategies for the integration of storage and the display of high-density information.},

Substrates decorated with parallel microgrooves, or striations, presenting the advantage of homogeneous chemical properties yet varying the topological characteristics on either side of a straight-line boundary, are considered in this study. The basic type of geometry consists of hydrophobic micro-striations/rails perpendicular to the boundary, with the systematic variation of the width to spacing ratio, thus changing the solid–liquid contact fraction and inducing a well-defined wettability contrast across the boundary. Droplets in the Cassie–Baxter state, straddling the boundary, move along the wettability contrast in order to reduce the overall surface free energy. The results show the importance of the average solid fraction and contrasting fraction in a wide range of given geometries across the boundary on droplet motion. A unified criterion for contrasting striated surfaces, which describes the displacement and the velocity of the droplets, is suggested, providing guidelines for droplet manipulation on micro-striated/railed surfaces.},

Here, we report on studying the structure of interfaces between YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-δ thin films and SrTiO 3 substrates by means of aberration-corrected ultrahigh-resolution electron microscopy. Employing advanced imaging and spectroscopic techniques, shifts of atoms at the interface away from the regular lattice sites are measured, leading to the interfacial polarity. The local polarization induced by the atomic shifts directs toward the cuprate films and is estimated to be about 36.1 μ C/cm 2 . The observed interfacial polar layer is understood by the special atomic configuration across the interface, which could modulate the electrical properties in superconducting devices that are based on the ferroelectric / superconductor heterosystems.},

Density function supercell calculations find this effect is due to localized defect interface states located on the mis-coordinated atoms of these interfaces that pin their SBHs at very different energies for each termination as determined by the anion sublattice bonding. Band offsets of semiconducting ScN/GaN interfaces also depend on their termination as determined by the same defect interface states. This pinning mechanism dominates any MIGS mechanism when it arises. Nonpolar (110) interfaces have little change in bonding, so they have no defect interface states, and we find their SBH is pinned by MIGS at the charge neutrality level. Hence, traditional MIGS models should be extended to include such interface states in a more general description.},

Peak EQEs increased from 8\%–10\% to 12\%–13.5\% for mesa diameters from 100 μ m to 2 μ m, respectively, and no measurable leakage currents were seen in current density–voltage ( J – V ) characteristics. The position and shape of EQE curves for all devices were essentially identical, indicating size-independent ABC model (Shockley–Read–Hall, radiative, and Auger recombination) coefficients-behavior that is not typical of microLEDs as the size decreases. These trends can be explained by enhancement in light extraction efficiency (LEE), which is only observable when sidewall defects are minimized, for the smallest LED sizes. Detailed ray-tracing simulations substantiate the LEE enhancements.},

The ps electric transients applied to the quantum dot in a diode structure result in ultrafast Stark shifts of the exciton energy on time scales below the decoherence time of the exciton. We experimentally demonstrate that the tailored electric chirp of the exciton energy leads to a controlled rapid adiabatic passage, which results in a robust state preparation of the exciton. Our experimental results are confirmed by a theoretical analysis of the chirped coherent manipulation of the exciton two level system.

We also present the technical challenges that must be overcome in order to extend the capability of current acoustic levitation devices and, finally, we point out future directions for acoustic levitation.},

This study presents an experimental characterization of the so-called “length scale parameter” in couple stress theory and surface elasticity. E eff is retrieved from the measured pull-in voltage, of the clamped-clamped beams with different dimensions, via an electromechanically coupled equation. Measurement results show a strong size dependence of E eff for the Al beams in small sizes. The Young&#39;s modulus increases monotonously as the beams become thinner. The experimental observations are consistent with the published modeling results of the size effects, in which couple stress theory and surface elasticity theory are taken into consideration. The presented experimental method has substantial advantages such as precise adjustable magnitude of the non-contacting force and a lower cost over the other approaches used for characterization of micro-/nanoelectromechanical systems. This simple and reproducible method can be extended for characterization of various materials with different sizes and boundary conditions.},

The current generation of AVD can render simple vector graphics in real-time, but larger and complex graphics require 10 s or more to render. Here, we present a generalized model of an AVD and use this to understand its performance limits; in particular, we answer the question of how large a display (1:1 raster screen) can be created. We show that AVD performance is affected by the size and properties of the particle, along with the viscosity of the surrounding fluid. Optimal performance is achieved when the viscous drag force and inertial force are minimized relative to the acoustic radiation force. Our model suggests that, for expanded polystyrene particles ( ⁠ ρ p = 19 kg m − 3 ⁠ ), a screen size of up to 117 mm by 117 mm can be rendered at 10 Hz with an acoustic frequency of 20 kHz and an acoustic pressure amplitude of 25 kPa.},

  abstract     = {Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is an emerging modality, which combines the high optical absorption contrast of biological chromophores with centimeter imaging depths and sub-millimeter resolution of ultrasonic (US) waves. However, PA imaging through cortical bone remains an unmet challenge. Cortical bone is an anisotropic medium, which is not accurately modeled using existing PA image reconstruction methods. In this Letter, we address the PA source localization problem for imaging through a cortical bone-mimicking layer. Our approach accounts for both refraction and elastic anisotropy to accurately reconstruct US and PA images in the presence of a cortical bone replica. We demonstrate our technique using a PA and US experiment, where we image a 700 μ m diameter target beneath a cortical bone-mimicking plate. Pulse-echo US experiment is used to estimate the wavespeed in each layer and create an anatomical image of the bone replica, and the PA source is reconstructed using the wavespeed model defined with US. We compute the thickness of the plate with less than 1\% error, whereas isotropic assumptions overestimate the thickness by 20\% or more. Incorporating both refraction and anisotropy accurately localizes the target with PA and US at the true depth, whereas isotropic assumptions blur the lateral dimension and mislocate the target depth by 1.5–4 mm.},

Its motion direction is not related to the surface temperature of the substrate, although the condensation strongly depends on the surface temperature. This Letter reports a self-excited thermocapillary motion during condensation on a heterogeneous slippery liquid-infused porous surface without an externally imposed tangential temperature gradient, where the droplet moves directionally toward cold areas on the surface. The spontaneous thermocapillary motion is driven by the thermocapillary force originating from the local nonuniform temperature distribution on the surface, which is several orders of magnitude larger than the capillary force for a millidroplet. Even a millidroplet could move on such a heterogeneous surface and move upward against the gravity on an inclined surface. In addition to the spontaneous motion directly related to the temperature of the cooling substrate, the dropwise condensation rate may be significantly increased up to two times compared to that of a homogenous slippery surface.},

The backlighted images of the imploding shocks were recorded using a streak camera. Using different diameter wires, the explosion of arrays, characterized by critically damped and under-damped discharges, was studied. The experiments revealed that an array explosion in a 92\% H 2 O 2 /H 2 O solution results in the second strong shock generated after the peak of the deposited electrical power, a solid indication of H 2 O 2 detonation.

  abstract     = {Wet thermoacoustic engines (WTEs) are simple, robust energy conversion devices that employ a condensable vapor to generate acoustic power from heat. While previous studies focused on the potential of WTE technology to convert low-grade heat to power, this work focuses on the WTE&#39;s dependence on the working gas mixture, unique mass transport, and low working temperature properties, which make it a potential candidate for thermally driven separation processes, e.g., distillation and water desalination. In a set of experiments, the steady-state behavior of a water-based, standing-wave WTE was studied. The results highlight a remarkable trait of this system—a WTE is capable of producing a substantial flux of water vapor while exhibiting an operating hot-side temperature significantly lower than the boiling point. This “limiting temperature” is independent of the heat input to the system—theoretically predicted in systems that have no external “load” that consumes the acoustic power. In addition, the results suggest that the characteristics of the working gas play an important role in determining the device behavior. It was shown that in the tested range, a heavier, more complex-structured gas has significantly improved the steady-state performance of the engine. Specifically, a WTE working with SF 6 as its working gas exhibited a vapor mass flux nearly three times greater than simple evaporation at the same heating power while maintaining a temperature as low as 57 °C. The link between gas characteristics and engine behavior is outlined. In conclusion, potential applications of the device and future research avenues are discussed.},

To advance the application of diamagnetically levitating resonators, it is important to characterize their dynamics in the presence of both magnetic and gravitational fields. Here we experimentally actuate and measure rigid body modes of a diamagnetically levitating graphite plate. We numerically calculate the magnetic field and determine the influence of magnetic force on the resonance frequencies of the levitating plate. By analyzing damping mechanisms, we conclude that eddy current damping dominates dissipation in mm-sized plates. We use finite element simulations to model eddy current damping and find close agreement with experimental results. We also study the size-dependent Q -factors ( Q s) of diamagnetically levitating plates and show that Q s above 100 million are theoretically attainable by reducing the size of the diamagnetic resonator down to microscale, making these systems of interest for next generation low-noise resonant sensors and oscillators.},

Relying on the intrinsically ultrafast temporal response (∼140 fs) and highly localized evanescent field (optical penetration depth of ∼185 nm) of the SPPs, the SP sensing can respond ultrasounds with the gigahertz frequency band theoretically, which, however, is far higher than the bandwidth in practical PA detection. We reveal that, due to acoustic interference, the finite lateral probing dimension in the SP sensor imposes an ultimate constraint on the accessible ultrasonic cutoff frequency, representing good agreement with the experimental results by acquiring PA impulses from an optically absorbing graphene film using our SP sensor. The theoretical framework enables analyzing the SP response characteristics of ultrasonic/PA pressure transients, which, therefore, offers guidelines for configuring the SP sensor with adequate sensitivity and bandwidths to access various biomedical PA applications, including volumetric imaging and spectroscopic analysis.},

  abstract     = {Viable power supply methods capable of replacing the need for batteries are a key design factor for realization of emerging technologies and platforms based on self-sustainable standalone electronics. Hence, alternate possibilities should arise by developing semiconductor devices with an inherent energy source, i.e., a device that simultaneously exhibits energy-converting as well as amplifying-modulating properties. In the present Letter, we report a proof-of-concept photo-thermoelectric modulator. Thereby, an optical signal is reproduced by the thermoelectric voltage generated by modulating, with a light beam, the free carrier concentration of a photoconductive PbS film that is under a temperature gradient. Experimental results unveil that photo-generated electrons affect more electrical conductivity than thermal conductivity, giving rise to a drastic change in thermoelectric power. Consequently, it induces significant changes in the thermoelectric figure of merit of the device, and thus, signal modulation is mainly awarded to photo-generated electrons rather than thermal effects. Therefore, the device developed here establishes the basis for the development of an elementary batteryless photo-thermoelectric transistor and opens alternative avenues for self-powered devices that are driven by temperature gradients via a photo-thermoelectric effect.},

However, the residual aberration of the probe may give rise to considerable deviations from the perfect imaging, especially in polyphase transition metal dichalcogenides. Here, we clarify the misleading imaging artifact of opposite subdomains in monolayer MoS 2 through both image simulations and experimental in-plane rotation series. This non-honeycomb imaging artifact turns out to be caused by both probe residual threefold astigmatism and local sample tilt or fluctuation. Our results suggest that the direct STEM imaging should be cautiously treated to achieve accurate phase assignment.},

To separate the elastic and plastic deformation, loading–unloading cycles were performed with increasing load in each consecutive cycle. The storage of the first four geometrically necessary dislocations of [ 01 1 ¯ ] ( 111 ) slip system is observed in the vicinity of both clamping points, which might be attributed to the local rotations induced by the rigid Si support. At later stages of the deformation, additional slip systems are activated either by the torsion of the nanowire or by unintentional indentation from the AFM tip. The cyclic loading–unloading approach combined with Laue microdiffraction thus allows to study the onset of plasticity in defect-scarce nanostructures deformed by bending, offering additional possibilities in studying the dislocation nucleation process in bent nano-objects, which are essential for future applications, e.g., in flexible electronics and nano-electromechanical systems.},

Different from standard metal/ferroelectric/metal capacitors, the depletion and inversion phenomena in semiconductor substrates have to be carefully taken into account when evaluating the ferroelectric properties using fast voltage sweep as input. The non-equilibrium deep depletion is found to be the limiting factor for the accurate evaluation of ferroelectric properties in metal/ferroelectric/semiconductor capacitors. By connecting the source, the drain, and the substrate of the FeFET together during the polarization measurement, the deep depletion can be suppressed and the ferroelectricity of the ferroelectric gate can be accurately evaluated. The present technique is a powerful method for capturing the polarization states in FeFETs, enabling new approaches for device characterization and fundamental study, and overcomes the limitation found in the conventional polarization measurement on two-terminal metal/ferroelectric/semiconductor capacitors.},

[N(CH 3 ) 4 ][FeBrCl 3 ] exhibited peak-to-peak strains of 0.1\% and saturated ferroelastic switching at fields of 170 kV/cm. Above 170 kV/cm, rates of field increase were too fast for domain switching, resulting in reduced strain rates during the switching cycle. Leakage currents had larger contributions at higher field amplitudes. This was also reflected in the switching behavior at higher frequencies, 100 Hz, in which hysteresis was asymmetric and switching incomplete. The dielectric constant and loss exhibited a butterfly-like shape during application of DC bias electric fields indicative of domain switching, but showed a small dielectric tunability of 0.038 and no signs of dielectric stiffening, with the relative permittivity from 16.9 to 17.3 at fields from 0 to 120 kV/cm. The present findings provide insight into the domain switching kinetics and dielectric properties of [N(CH 3 ) 4 ][FeBrCl 3 ] that will assist with further development of plastic crystal ferroelectrics.},

The calculated results reveal that the ferromagnetic (FM) order is the magnetic structure of the ground state and the total energy of ↑↑↓↓-type order is close to that of the FM order. The electric polarization is calculated to be 0.78 μ C/cm 2 along the crystallographic b -axis for U Ni = U Mn = 3 eV. In addition to the exchange-striction mechanism, a more noticeable contribution from redistribution of polarized charge is found in our study. Magnetic hysteresis loops show the ferromagnetism in Y 2 NiMnO 6 , which can be explained by magnetic field-induced spin flop transition from the E-type to FM order. Our DFT + U theoretical investigations also proposed a switching adiabatic path of magnetoelectric coupling, in which the 180° reverse of electric polarization is driven by rotation of spins.},

Despite hairpin turns and a large number of squares (up to 10 4 ) in the device, the dark count rate was measured to be ∼10 3 cps at 99\% of the switching current. This value is about two orders of magnitude lower than the results reported recently for short MoSi devices with shunt resistors. We also found that 5 nm thick MoSi detectors with the same geometry were insensitive to single near-infrared photons, which may be associated with different levels of suppression of the superconducting order parameter. However, our results obtained on 3 nm thick MoSi devices are in good agreement with predictions in the frame of a kinetic-equation approach.},

The method solves principally quantitative scanning by increasing magnetic tip durability and introducing its calibration. We show that nature itself gives us a sharp, durable, and calibrated magnetic probe. It is represented by a narrow magnetic vortex core located in the center of a ferromagnetic disk placed at the apex of a scanning tip. Such a tip offers potentially high spatial resolution—the vortex core is magnetically sharp (the vortex diameter is &lt; 20 nm for Permalloy), but at the same time, the disk is geometrically blunt and therefore durable. The magnetic moment of the vortex core is independent of the disk diameter and can be tuned smoothly by the disk thickness. We describe here the basic properties of the VC tip, its technology, and sensitivity to the magnetic field and show its durability. The first results obtained on hard disk drive are promising—from the analysis of data tracks, the spatial resolution of the VC tip is only a bit worse than the one of the standard MFM tips. We believe that the VC tip could be a sensor of choice for magnetic field imaging for scientific areas mentioned above.},

The recent availability of multiferroic materials provides an opportunity to directly couple the change in spin states of a magnetic memory to a charge change in a semiconductor transistor. In this work, we propose and analyze the spin–orbit torque field-effect transistor, a device with the potential to significantly boost the energy efficiency of spin-based memories and to simultaneously offer a palette of functionalities.},

  abstract     = {L1 0 -orderd FeNi alloy films with a high degree of order ( S ) and a large uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy ( K u ) were realized by denitriding FeNiN films. FeNiN films with the a -axis perpendicular to the film plane were epitaxially grown on SrTiO 3 (001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy by changing the growth temperatures ( T S ) to 200, 250, and 350 °C. The a -axis oriented epitaxial L1 0 -FeNi films were fabricated by annealing the FeNiN films in a H 2 gas atmosphere at 300 °C. S and K u of the denitrided L1 0 -FeNi films were characterized by anomalous x-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation and magnetic torque measurements, respectively. A high S of 0.87 and a K u of 5.9 × 10 5 J/m 3 were realized in the L1 0 -FeNi film with a T S of 350 °C. This high S value exceeds the values reported on L1 0 -FeNi to date, but the K u value was comparable to those of c -axis oriented L1 0 -FeNi films with S ∼ 0.5 grown by alternate monoatomic deposition of Fe and Ni layers. A possible origin for the suppressed macroscopic K u in a -axis oriented L1 0 -FeNi films is discussed, and denitriding FeNiN is a promising method for the fabrication of L1 0 -FeNi with a high S and a large K u .},

However, the origin of the THE-like features is still under debate. Here, we present the observation of THE-like features in synthetic antiferromagnetic [Pd/Co]/Ru/[Co/Pd] and synthetic ferromagnetic [Pd/Co]/NiO/[Co/Pd] structures. The Pd-rich alloys, which are formed due to the heterogeneous component and the gradual intermixing at the Co/Pd interface, result in a negative anomalous Hall effect coefficient, causing the peak and dip features in transport measurements. By changing the external magnetic field from out-of-plane to in-plane, the magnitude and width of the bump feature in THE curves can be modified, which is caused by the different anisotropy energy of the components in the heterogeneous ferromagnets. The present work broadens the perception of THE-like features and may add a different dimension to understand the magnetization reversal in magnetic multilayers.},

He + ion irradiation through a mask has been used to reduce locally the effective perpendicular anisotropy at a Hall cross. Anomalous Hall effect measurements combined with Kerr microscopy indicate that the switching process is dominated by domain wall (DW) nucleation in the irradiated region followed by rapid domain propagation at a current density as low as 0.8 MA/cm 2 with an assisting in-plane magnetic field. Thanks to the implemented strong pinning of the DW at the transition between the irradiated and the non-irradiated region, an intermediate Hall resistance state is induced, which is further verified by finite element simulations. Such a method to control electrically multi-level resistances using He + ion irradiation shows great potential in realizing neuromorphic and memristor devices.},

The anomalous mode at approximately 13 meV was observed directly using inelastic x-ray scattering along the Γ–X ([00 q ]) direction. The phonon dispersion relations of the anomalous mode indicate that there was no momentum dependence, similar to those of the longitudinal and transverse optical modes (Ge–Ge, Si–Ge, and Si–Si modes). In contrast to the acoustic and optical phonon modes, the energy of the anomalous mode shows no Ge fraction dependence. The molecular dynamics simulation corroborates that the Ge–Ge pairs or Ge atom clusters, which are surrounded by Si atoms, provide the anomalous mode, which is unique to the alloy structure. It has been suggested that such a localized vibration mode with no propagation significantly affects the acoustic modes, leading to low thermal conductivity in the SiGe alloy.},

To clarify the Mg diffusion and activation along TDs, we have performed a systematic characterization of a Mg-implanted homoepitaxial GaN layer grown on a freestanding substrate. Active-Mg related donor–acceptor pair (DAP) emission from certain TDs is identified by cathodoluminescence (CL). Dislocations with and without DAP emission are investigated structurally and compositionally based on etch pits, transmission electron microscopy, and atom-probe tomography. Direct evidence of Mg distribution around edge- and mixed-type TDs is obtained. There exists a significant difference in the Mg concentration and incorporation states between different types of TDs.},

To completely prohibit sound waves in a given frequency range in rods, for example, all axially propagating acoustic eigenmodes must exhibit strong damping. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and by simulation a metamaterial rod made from a single material that can simultaneously shut out all elastic-wave polarizations, namely longitudinal, flexural, and torsional modes, in a band in the sub-kHz range. We first bond five acrylic building blocks together to make a subwavelength resonator and then fix an array of these inside an acrylic tube to form a cylindrical metarod that inhibits sound transmission in the metamaterial bandgap frequency range.

In particular, there exist three families of canonical waveguides. The theory reveals that for those (i) the frequency spectra are periodic and the periodicity depends on the canonical frequencies, (ii) a set of multiple periodic orbits exists at frequencies that differ from the canonical ones, and (iii) perturbation of the periodic orbit and linearization of the trace map define a scaling parameter, linked to the golden ratio, which governs the self-similar structure of the spectra.

  abstract     = {This study presents a test method and its theoretical framework to determine the acoustic nonlinearity parameters ( ⁠ α , β , δ ⁠ ) of material using thermal modulation of ultrasonic waves. Temperature change-induced thermal strain excites the nonlinear response of the material and modulates the ultrasonic wave propagating in it. Experimental results showed a strong correlation between the relative wave velocity change and the temperature change. With a quadratic polynomial model, the acoustic nonlinearity parameters were obtained from the polynomial coefficients by curve fitting the experimental data. Their effects on thermal-induced velocity change were discussed. The parameters α , β , and δ govern the hysteretic gap, average slope, and curvature of the correlation curve, respectively. The proposed theory was validated on aluminum, steel, intact and damaged concrete samples. The obtained nonlinear parameters show reasonable agreement with values reported in the literature. Compared to other nonlinear acoustic methods using vibration or acoustic excitation, the thermal modulation method generates more uniform, slow changing, and larger strain field in the test sample. Employing the thermal effect as the driving force for nonlinearity instead of an undesired influencing factor, this method can measure the absolute values of α , β , and δ with good accuracy using a simple ultrasonic test setup.},

  abstract     = {Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been extensively investigated in opto-electronic applications, such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). SAMs are used to tune the energy level alignment by allowing Ohmic contact at the interface between electrodes and organic semiconductors. To achieve the required energy level alignment and modify the electrode work function, molecules carrying a permanent dipole are chemically grafted at the electrode surface. Typically, the electrodes are modified by choosing one specific molecule carrying the appropriate dipole to achieve the desired (discrete) work function value. In this contribution, we propose a simple way to continuously tune the work function over almost 1 eV and demonstrate this on the most commonly used transparent electrode, namely, indium tin oxide (ITO). The continuous tuning is achieved by selecting two molecules able to form SAMs, each carrying a different permanent dipole. Solutions comprising the molecules are mixed at different relative concentrations and deposited on the ITO surface. The composition of the resulting densely packed mixed SAM is directly related to the composition of the initial mixing in solution. The effect of the SAM on the ITO electronic landscape was analyzed by various surface sensitive measurements. Furthermore, the differently functionalized transparent electrodes have been integrated in prototypical OLEDs. Through electrical characterization, we confirm the ability to continuously tune the carrier injection and thereby improve the luminescence.},

  abstract     = {Antimony selenide (Sb 2 Se 3 ), emerging as a promising photovoltaic material, has achieved over 9\% efficiency within only 6 years. Various kinds of buffer materials are employed for Sb 2 Se 3 solar cells to construct heterojunctions with distinctive device performance. Herein, we introduce in situ high resolution photoemission spectroscopy (HRPES) to investigate the interfacial properties between Sb 2 Se 3 and three types of widely adopted buffer layers: CdS, ZnO, and TiO 2 . HRPES results and theoretical thermodynamic calculations reveal that in the initial stage, the deposited Sb 2 Se 3 reacts with buffer materials in terms of activity in the following order: CdS ≥ ZnO &gt; TiO 2 . Distinct transition layers are formed at CdS/Sb 2 Se 3 and ZnO/Sb 2 Se 3 interfaces, whereas it is nearly absent at TiO 2 /Sb 2 Se 3 . Our results suggest that the CdS/Sb 2 Se 3 heterojunction shows spike-like conduction band offsets (CBOs), whereas ZnO/Sb 2 Se 3 demonstrates a cliff-like CBO, and TiO 2 /Sb 2 Se 3 is almost flat. The transition layers and band alignments at the interface could be the reasons for the stability and performance of Sb 2 Se 3 photovoltaic devices with different buffer materials. Our investigation deepens the understanding of Sb 2 Se 3 heterojunction formation and can benefit further development of Sb 2 Se 3 thin-film solar cells.},

The NSOM probe was composed of a circular nanohole formed in a thick gold film that was deposited on a tapered cone fiber. The near-field signal, when coupled through the nanohole to the fiber, was split and analyzed using a combination of a quarter-wave plate and a polarizer to extract the two circular polarization components of the signal. This allowed us to characterize the out-of-plane SAM component, which was determined using the relationship S z ∝ I RCP − I LCP . Using the developed system, we mapped the SAM distributions of a variety of tightly focused cylindrical vector vortex beams and thus validated the system&#39;s effectiveness. The proposed spin-resolved NSOM could be a valuable tool for studies of both near-field spin optics and topological photonics.},

Spatial light modulator (SLM) is one of the key devices in THz single-pixel near-field imaging. Combined with a Digital Micromirror Device to shape the optical pump beam, a photo-induced tunable high-efficiency, ultra-thin, and fast THz SLM is presented by integrating designed subwavelength metallic grating into silicon on sapphire. In the experiments, the SLM is demonstrated with an over 60\% THz peak amplitude modulation depth and broad bandwidth under a relative low pump fluence (80 μ J/cm 2 ). The measurements, simulations, and calculations agree well with each other. Meanwhile, sub-nanosecond decay time extracted by fitting the |ΔT| curve suggests a fast response device. A two-dimensional grating is also explored, and the polarization-independent feature makes it easier to use. Finally, an imaging demonstration is conducted to verify the usability of the designed device. These results demonstrate the feasibility of realizing super-resolution and even real-time imaging simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Non-invasive optical focusing inside scattering media is still a big challenge because inhomogeneous media scatter incoming photons for focusing and outgoing photons for observation. Various approaches, utilizing non-linear fluorescence or ultrasound, have been reported to address this difficulty. However, implementation of these methods is complicated and highly expensive, as ultrafast laser systems or photo-acoustic equipment must be employed. Here, we demonstrate a wavefront shaping technique to achieve non-invasive focusing inside scattering media using only a linear fluorescent signal. The contrast and mean of incoherent speckles, produced by the linear fluorescence, are utilized as feedback signals to optimize the input wavefront. While increasing speckle contrast makes the focus tighter and increasing the speckle mean enhances the intensity, fine-tuning the contribution of these two factors in our two-step optimization is essential. An optimal wavefront is found to achieve simultaneously both a micrometer focal spot size (down to 20 μ m diameter) and high intensity (more than a 100-fold enhancement) inside the scattering media. Our method promises a route in life science toward focusing, imaging, or manipulating deep into biological tissues with linear fluorescent agents.},

It also exhibits larger amplification thanks to enhanced interaction between the incident radiation and the QC-gain material. We demonstrate devices that produce several milliwatts of continuous-wave power in a single mode at ∼4.6 THz and dissipate less than 1 W of pump power. Use of different output couplers demonstrates the ability to optimize device performance for either high power or high operating temperature.

X-ray diffraction is used to measure lattice strains, and velocity interferometry is used to infer shock and particle velocities. These measurements, combined with density-dependent elastic constants calculated using density functional theory, enable determination of material strength above the Hugoniot elastic limit. Our results indicate that diamond retains approximately 20 GPa of strength at longitudinal stresses of 150–300 GPa under shock compression.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to their high brightness, field emitters are the electron sources of choice in most high-end electron microscopes. Under typical operating conditions, the available emission current from these emitters is largely limited by practical considerations, and extracting significantly larger currents is usually not possible without reducing the lifetime of the emitter or even damaging it. Such limitations may, however, not apply if the emitter is only briefly subjected to extreme operating conditions so that damage can be outrun. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to temporarily operate a Schottky emitter far outside its stable operating regime and significantly increase its emission current. We do so by locally heating the tip of the emitter with a microsecond laser pulse, which boosts the emission current by a factor of 3.7 to nearly 450 μ A. We believe that the generation of intense microsecond electron pulses from a field emitter will particularly benefit the atomic-resolution imaging of fast processes that occur on the microsecond timescale.},

To this end, we propose an approach of introducing thin achromatic coating layers that can be easily assembled into the front and rear regions of the acoustic GRIN PC lens. A systematic design method based on topology optimization (TO) is developed to inversely design the achromatic coating components. The topology-optimized achromatic coating components are fabricated using 3D printing and coupled with the acoustic GRIN PC lens for acoustic characterization. Both numerical simulation and experimental characterization demonstrate the achromatic focusing capabilities of the GRIN PC lens with the designed achromatic coating layers in a wide range of frequencies (2.5 kHz–5.5 kHz). The proposed concept of applying achromatic coating layers along with the TO-based design method is expected to provide remarkable versatility to design GRIN PC lens-based applications such as energy harvesting, acoustic imaging, and acoustic wireless power transfer in broadband operation.},

Despite that omnidirectional functionality is a key factor to alleviate the directivity dependence issues, the concept has not yet been incorporated into acoustic energy harvesting. In this work, a symmetrical GRIN PnC structure consisting of cylinders with variation in filling fractions has been presented to tailor the spatial acoustic refractive index, thus enforcing the acoustic waves in any direction toward the targeted center area for focusing purposes. Both a numerical simulation and experimental validation confirm substantial sound energy amplification of the designed GRIN PnC over a broad frequency range from 250 Hz to 1 kHz. Notably, the maximum sound amplification occurs at the hybrid resonant frequency of the GRIN PnC structure and the acoustic duct system used to generate incident plane waves. Numerical simulation reveals that the cavity resonance and the refraction of the GRIN PnC mainly contribute to enhanced sound amplification in addition to the reflection from the acoustic duct. The GRIN PnC structure coupled with the acoustic duct system leads to enhanced harvesting output performance when integrated with a piezoelectric energy harvesting device.},

Extensive studies have been conducted to study droplet wetting behavior on plain and micro/nanostructured surfaces, with a particular focus in the recent literature on heated surfaces, where evaporation beneath the droplet impacts the apparent wettability. In previous literature, the peak droplet lifetime and minimum heat transfer on heated surfaces were observed at the Leidenfrost point. In this study, however, we report the existence of two distinct peaks for droplet lifetime on heated surfaces structured with silicon micropillar arrays. Initially, droplets exhibit complete wetting at low surface temperatures, but as surface temperature increases, the wetting state transitions first to a contact non-wetting state (i.e., a Cassie–Baxter-like state) and then to the non-contact Leidenfrost state; two distinct local maxima in droplet lifetime are observed, one corresponding to each transition. The contact non-wetting transition temperature and Leidenfrost point increase with larger micropillar pitch and taller height, which we attribute primarily to the resulting lower effective thermal conductivity of the micropillar array beneath the droplets, in agreement with the analytical force-balance-based modeling. This study provides a comprehensive investigation of the effect of surface structuring on contact non-wetting and Leidenfrost phenomena and will serve as design guidelines in controlling the contact non-wetting and Leidenfrost temperatures for specific applications.},

Although the DMD is much more cost-effective than the SLM, it was previously restricted in association with incoherent light sources, as its diffractive orders are related to the incident angle and the wavelength of coherent incidence. To extend its application with coherent illumination, here, we model the DMD as a blazed grating and simulate the effect with DMD pattern changes in the SIM. With careful analysis of the illumination contrast along different angles and phases, we report a fast, high-resolution, and cost-efficient SIM with DMD modulation. Our home-built laser interference-based DMD-SIM (LiDMD-SIM) reveals the nuclear pore complex and microtubule in mammalian cells with doubled spatial resolution.

The highest-pressure measurement was made at 1.67 GPa, considerably deeper into the supercompressed regime than previously reported. The effect of the isotopic composition is investigated with samples of normal water, heavy water, and partially deuterated water. When data below 0.25 GPa are excluded, a free volume model fits the observed viscosities well, yielding a theoretical glass transition density close to that observed in very-high-density amorphous ice. The improved fit above 0.25 GPa coincides with the loss of other anomalous behaviors in liquid water caused by hydrogen bonding and represents a transition to properties closer to those of a simple liquid.},

A minimized mechanical and magnetic free energy model of clamped–clamped resonators revealed that for a two-dimensional structure, both bending and torsional modes are allowed, but would have have very different resonance shift behavior with the applied field. A post-anneal of the structure confirms this case by increasing the stress-induced anisotropy of CoFe, which selectively enhances the contribution of the torsional mode and creates the non-saturating field-induced frequency shift. By using the resonance shift in this device in a potential magnetic field sensing paradigm, such a non-saturating torsional mode may be useful for applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance or MRI, which specifically requires sensitive detection of small fluctuations in high magnetic fields.},

  abstract     = {We report time-resolved measurements of magnetization switching by spin–orbit torques in the absence of an external magnetic field in perpendicularly magnetized magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Field-free switching is enabled by the dipolar field of an in-plane magnetized layer integrated above the MTJ stack, the orientation of which determines the switching polarity. Real-time single-shot measurements provide direct evidence of magnetization reversal and switching distributions. Close to the critical switching voltage, we observe stochastic reversal events due to a finite incubation delay preceding the magnetization reversal. Upon increasing the pulse amplitude to twice the critical voltage, the reversal becomes quasi-deterministic, leading to reliable bipolar switching at sub-ns timescales in zero external field. We further investigate the switching probability as a function of dc bias of the MTJ and external magnetic field, providing insight into the parameters that determine the critical switching voltage.},

We further observe an enhancement of DMI constant in a three to four layer MoS 2 /Py system (by 56\%) as compared to that in two layer MoS 2 /Py, which is caused by a higher density of MoO 3 defect species in the case of three to four layer MoS 2 ⁠ .

Because high oxygen pressure during deposition is necessary to obtain useful properties, pulsed laser deposition has been used to fabricate NiCo 2 O 4 films. In this study, we investigated the physical properties of NiCo 2 O 4 films synthesized by reactive molecular beam epitaxy and annealing in a high-pressure oxygen atmosphere. The characteristics of the films strongly depended on the oxygen pressure, and a larger pressure tended to give larger magnetization and higher conductivity. Crystal structure analysis by x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the films consisted of a rock salt (Ni,Co)O phase and a spinel NiCo 2 O 4 phase. This phase separation caused the small magnetization and large electric resistance because the rock salt phase was an antiferromagnetic insulator.},

The temperature independence of C P / T = f ( T ) is observed in the temperature range of 95–160 K, which can be attributed to the excitation of the Wigner glass phase. The magnetocaloric effect [i.e., the adiabatic temperature change, Δ T ad ( T , H )] is assessed through a direct measurement or an indirect method using the C P ( T , H ) data. Owing to its strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy, an anisotropic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) or the rotating MCE [Δ T ad rot ( T )] is observed in Cu 2 MnBO 5 .

  abstract     = {The control of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of magnetic metals on a platform of perovskite oxides, especially on widely used SrTiO 3 substrates, is of technological importance in integrating conventional metal spintronic devices with multifunctional perovskite oxides. In this work, we tuned the magnetic anisotropy of Co/Pt on SrTiO 3 (001) substrates by inserting an interfacial calcium titanate layer with an amorphous state. The crystallinity and device microstructure were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The Hall effect and magnetic measurement show that the PMA was achieved with the inserting layer. The electronic structure analysis by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy corresponds to the appearance of a significant density of Co–O bonding and a reduction of the Ti valence state in the calcium titanate layer. It is indicated that the amorphous calcium titanate layer could serve as an effective oxygen source to modify the chemical environment of the interfacial Co and Ti, resulting in the tuning of hybridization between Co and oxygen as well as the magnetic anisotropy. This work paves the way to engineer the magnetic anisotropy of metallic spintronic devices on the platform of perovskite oxides via oxygen diffusion for possible application in multifunctional spin orbital torque memory devices.},

As a consequence, the peak power for a 140 nm nano-constriction is about an order of magnitude higher than that for an 80 nm nano-constriction.

Beyond the critical current, background impurity scattering in the suspended two-dimensional channel regions dominates with stochastic, resonant-like features in the conductivity.

However, the type of conductivity and formation mechanism of the parasitic channel remains controversial. Here, we report unambiguous evidence of Al diffusion at the AlN/Si interface and its effect on RF loss. Hall measurements reveal p -type conductivity at the interface. By combining with secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements, the p -type conductivity is attributed to the Al diffusion from the AlN layers into the Si substrates, with Al being an acceptor in Si. Experimental data and simulations are in good agreement. We also demonstrate that substrate nitridation can indeed promote the formation of an amorphous silicon nitride layer, which plays a role in suppressing the Al diffusion and, thus, reducing the RF loss.},

Schottky barrier diodes based on wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising for the high-frequency applications owing to short reverse recovery time that minimizes the energy dissipation during the switching. In this study, we report dynamic characteristics of Schottky junctions composed of a layered oxide metal PdCoO 2 and an n -type β -Ga 2 O 3 substrate. Rectifying current–voltage characteristics with reasonably small hysteresis were demonstrated up to a high frequency of 3 MHz in the PdCoO 2 / β -Ga 2 O 3 Schottky junctions. For the on-state to off-state switching with the current ramp rate of approximately −2 × 10 10 A/scm 2 , the reverse recovery time was as short as 11 ns. The short reverse recovery time was constantly obtained in the operation temperature range of 25–350 °C, showing low-loss switching properties of the PdCoO 2 / β -Ga 2 O 3 Schottky junctions. The Schottky barrier height of ∼1.78 eV and the ideality factor of ∼1.06 were maintained after the 10 8 -times on–off switching cycles. The fast switching with less energy dissipation and high durability of the PdCoO 2 / β -Ga 2 O 3 Schottky junctions would be suitable for application in high-frequency power devices operating at high temperature.},

We find that increasing the Al content decreases lattice constants linearly, but that the increase in bandgaps and conduction-band offsets is non-linear, with a bowing of 1.41 eV. Structurally, there is a strong energetic preference of Al atoms to occupy octahedrally coordinated sites, and of Ga atoms to occupy tetrahedral sites. Ga will also occupy pentahedral sites, but at a small energy cost. The formation enthalpy of alloys is smaller than that of the pure materials, with ordered alloys with 50\% Al having especially low formation enthalpies. These quantitative results can be used to guide experimental device design.},

By performing a simulation of the x-ray reciprocal space maps measured in the vicinity of an asymmetrical reflection, we determined the strong correlation between the strain relaxation, density of MDs, and Sn content in the GeSn alloy for a compositional range of 4 to 15 at.\%. Herein, we quantitatively describe the phenomenon of strain-suppressed Sn incorporation in GeSn, leading to the formation of top Sn-rich, middle compositionally graded, and bottom Sn-poor regions at fixed growth conditions. It is shown that the thicknesses of the bottom Sn-poor region at which the composition spontaneously changes are correlated with the theoretically predicted critical thickness for the nucleation of MDs. Depending on the degree of strain relaxation in the bottom GeSn layer, the density of MDs at the GeSn/Ge interface varies in the range of ∼ 2–5 × 10 5 cm −1 as the Sn content increases from 4 to 12 at.\%. The thickness of the compositionally graded region, 160 ± 25 nm, corresponds to the thickness at which the GeSn layer fully relaxes through the interaction/multiplication of MDs. These results contribute to the fundamental understanding that strain engineering is not only crucial to tune the bandgap of Sn-containing group-IV semiconductors but also a key factor for the growth of Sn-rich metastable GeSn layers for mid-infrared photonic devices.},

In the early stage of grating decay, the surface diffusion coefficients were estimated as varying in the range of 10 −20 to 10 −18 m 2 /s and the corresponding average activation energy is about 0.67  eV. During longer annealing, times the surface grating decay rate slowed down significantly. The slowing of the initial decay was a result of the surface dynamics and influenced by the surface segregation of silicon at a long time, which induced a surface crystallization of a silicon-rich phase.},

Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited Si-rich oxide films were annealed at elevated temperatures to form Si nanocrystals of varying diameters. A typical redshift in the photoluminescence peak is observed with increasing annealing temperature, confirming the formation of quantum confined Si nanocrystals. The carrier transport and light emission mechanism have been studied in detail through current–voltage characteristics and ultrafast transient spectroscopy, respectively. The origin of electroluminescence and the size-tunable emission peak have been analyzed and attributed to the radiative recombination of carriers within Si nanocrystal quantum wells. The fabricated Si nanocrystal-based metal oxide semiconductor light emitting diode and the resultant size-dependent tunable electroluminescence are very attractive as a potential CMOS compatible optical source for future photonic integrated chips.},

Quantum devices are fabricated using in situ electron beam lithography in combination with thermocompression bonding to realize a backside gold mirror. Our structures are based on InGaAs/GaAs heterostructures, where the QD emission is redshifted toward the telecom O-band at 1.3 μ m via a strain-reducing layer. QDs pre-selected by cathodoluminescence mapping are embedded into mesa structures with a backside gold mirror for enhanced photon-extraction efficiency. Photon-autocorrelation measurements under pulsed non-resonant wetting-layer excitation are performed at temperatures up to 40 K, showing pure single-photon emission, which makes the devices compatible with stand-alone operation using Stirling cryocoolers. Using pulsed p-shell excitation, we realize single-photon emission with a high multi-photon suppression of g (2) (0) = 0.027 ± 0.005, an as-measured two-photon interference visibility of (12 ± 4)\%, a post-selected visibility of (96 ± 10)\%, and an associated coherence time of (212 ± 25) ps. Moreover, the structures show an extraction efficiency of ∼5\%, which is comparable to values expected from numeric simulations of this photonic structure.

However, their electrical and optical engineering is still a challenging task owing to multiple obstacles, including the absence of fast and easy-to-use methods for the determination of SWCNT film properties. Here, we present a rapid, contactless, and universal technique for accurate estimation of both SWCNT film thicknesses and their dielectric functions. The approach combines broadband optical absorbance and highly sensitive spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements. The observed linear dependence of the film thickness on its absorbance at 550 nm provides a time-effective and contactless method of thickness assignment, which is of significant importance to the practical implementation of SWCNT films in optoelectronic devices. Additionally, our approach revealed that a simple procedure of film densification allows to controllably alter the dielectric response by at least 40\% and, thus, to add extra fine-tuning capabilities during material property engineering. Therefore, this express technique as a whole offers an advanced metrological tool for current and next-generation SWCNT-based devices.},

We determined the equilibrium constant in the Saha equation from the temperature dependence of the free-carrier density measured at chemical equilibrium.

An annular stratification occurs in the acoustically levitated and severely flattened ATPS drops, where the AMS-rich phase is horizontally encircled by the PEG-rich phase. This is different from the conventional top-bottom layered stratification usually taking place in test tubes or levitated oblate drops. Calculation of the total surface and interface energy of a biphasic drop based on two simplified geometric models of stratification demonstrates that the annular structure is more stable than the top-bottom one if the drop is flattened enough. Two stages of phase separation are revealed through videographic and statistical analyses on the PEG-rich globules that are spontaneously formed inside the ATPS drops. The first stage is characterized by rapid reduction in the population of small PEG-rich globules, which is governed by frequent collision and coalescence and can be speeded up by drop oscillation and acoustic streaming during levitation. The second stage shows a slow reduction in the population of PEG-rich globules, a process controlled by integration of those globules into the already-formed bulk PEG-rich layer.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic asymmetric focusing (AAF) has a great potential application in medical ultrasound imaging, focused ultrasound therapy, and nondestructive testing. The advancement of acoustic metamaterials and metasurfaces has provided various mechanisms to design AAF lenses. However, due to the existence of a certain difficulty in realizing sound focusing and asymmetric transmission simultaneously, the realization of the AAF lens with a broad bandwidth and an integrative planar structure still remains a challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate an integrative planar AAF lens based on a type of mode-conversion meta-atom composed of two types of phased unit cells with a phase difference of π and a step waveguide. The meta-atom can realize the conversion between the zero-order and first-order waves and asymmetric sound transmission, which arises from the phase modulation and the cutoff frequency of the first-order wave, respectively. Based on the proposed mode-conversion meta-atoms, we design a broadband AAF lens with high performance, in which its fractional bandwidth can reach about 0.19 and the focus size is only about 0.38 λ . The proposed mode-conversion meta-atom and its associated AAF lens provide diverse routes for designing asymmetric multi-functional sound devices with promising applications.},

In this work, we investigate epigraphene Hall sensors where epigraphene is doped across the Dirac point using molecular doping. Depending on the carrier density, molecular-doped epigraphene Hall sensors reach room temperature sensitivities of S V = 0.23 V/(VT) and S I = 1440 V/(AT), with magnetic field detection limits down to B MIN = 27 nT/√Hz at 20 kHz. Thermally stabilized devices demonstrate operation up to 150 °C with S V = 0.12 V/(VT), S I = 300 V/(AT), and B MIN ∼100 nT/√Hz at 20 kHz.

Both temperature-accelerated and voltage-accelerated time-dependent gate breakdown stress experiments are performed. The p -GaN gate exhibits a shorter time-to-failure at a lower temperature. It is found that the time-to-failure at “use conditions” predicted by acceleration tests at high gate bias stress could be overestimated at low temperatures. Such a discrepancy stems from the distinct dominant gate leakage mechanisms at high/low gate bias stress conditions. The dominant physical mechanism of the low-temperature gate leakage current is identified to be Poole–Frenkel emission at low gate bias and Fowler–Nordheim tunneling at high bias. From the physical model, a more accurate lifetime projection can be obtained for given use conditions.},

  abstract     = {MoS 2 thin films prepared via sulfurization of molybdenum films have attracted great attention due to their advantage for scalable synthesis with a large area coverage. However, the MoS 2 thin films are typically more resistive than their exfoliated and co-evaporation chemical vapor deposition based counterparts. The ability to modulate the electrical property of MoS 2 thin films will have a significant impact on scalable device applications in electronics, sensors, and catalysis. Here, we report the tuning of electrical transport properties of large area MoS 2 thin films with different oxygen plasma exposure times. The electrical transport measurements of the pristine and plasma treated samples reveal that with increasing oxygen plasma treatment, the resistance of the MoS 2 thin films first decreases by almost an order of magnitude and then increases again. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that the S:Mo ratio continuously decreases with increasing plasma exposure time. For a short plasma exposure time, the resistance decrease can be explained due to the creation of sulfur vacancies leaving unsaturated electrons with molybdenum (Mo) atoms which act as electron donors. With increasing plasma exposure, more sulfur vacancies and hence more Mo atoms are created, many of which get converted to insulating MoO 3 resulting in an increase in the resistance of the MoS 2 thin film. The results presented here are a major step forward in realizing the overreaching goals of MoS 2 thin films for practical device applications.},

From the Clausius–Mossotti (CM) model, dielectric polarizability of each cation-oxygen constituent was determined from the permittivity and molar volume. The silicon–oxygen polarizability of silica glass (5.24 Å 3 ) is significantly higher than that of crystalline quartz (4.87 Å 3 ), suggesting that additional polarization modes contribute to glass permittivity. A full range of alkali species (Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) were then added as glass network modifiers through a series of binary silicate glasses, and the silicon–oxygen polarizability increased to 5.38 Å 3 . A similar trend was observed for alkaline-earth aluminosilicate glasses in which the polarizability increased with the addition of cationic modifiers to 5.89 Å 3 . CM analysis provides a method to explore the fundamental relationship between the glass structure and its unique polarization response in the microwave frequency range. Microwave permittivity values are predicted over broad compositional ranges for alkali and alkaline earth-modified silicate glasses using the CM relationship.},

A 310- μ m-thick multilayer piezoelectric film and a 300- μ m-thick Al plate were used for the PUT. It was found that the flexural modulus of the Al plate was decreased slightly from 3.73 GPa to 3.41 GPa by the effect of the embossed surface morphology, having an array of Al bumps with dimensions of 800 nm × 800 nm and a height of 320 nm. The decreased flexural modulus had a strong effect on the decrement of the acoustic resonant frequency and on the enhancement of the sound power radiation for the PUT. In comparison to a sound pressure level (SPL) of 117.8 dB at 30 cm away from a flat PUT at 41.4 kHz, the embossed PUT could result in a significantly enhanced SPL of 121.7 dB at the secondary resonant frequency of 40.5 kHz for the implementation of a smaller transducer.

  abstract     = {Spin transfer torque-driven dynamic properties of spins in a bilayered nano-strip system composed of a layer with in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) and a layer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) were studied using a micro-magnetic simulation method. It is demonstrated that a domain wall (DW) can nucleate in the IMA layer at the end of the nano-strips and propagate with a large speed toward the other end under a perpendicular current. With DW annihilation and nucleation at either end of the nano-strips, their back and forth motion induces a magnetization oscillation whose amplitude and frequency can be easily manipulated by the current density, the dimensions and material of the nano-strip, and a perpendicularly applied magnetic field. Considering that the oscillation amplitude can be greatly amplified by the simultaneous oscillations of a large number of nano-strips in an array and the simple structure of the each element, this kind of IMA/PMA bilayered nano-strip may have important applications in magnetic nano-oscillators.},

  abstract     = {An ultra-thin (∼2.5 nm) non-magnetic Cu underlayer was found to have a significant effect on the microstructure, magnetic softness, and magnetostriction of sputter-deposited Fe 81 Ga 19 (FeGa) thin films. Compared to the experimental control where FeGa was deposited directly on Si without an underlayer, the presence of Cu increased the in-plane uniaxial anisotropy of FeGa and reduced the in-plane coercivity by nearly a factor of five. The effective Gilbert damping coefficient was also significantly reduced by a factor of four, between FeGa on Si and FeGa on a Cu underlayer. The FeGa films on Cu also retained a high saturation magnetostriction comparable to those without an underlayer. The enhancement of the desirable magnetic properties for microwave applications is attributed to the Cu underlayer, promoting the (110) film texture and increasing the compressive film strain. The results demonstrated that the structural control is viable to simultaneously achieve the necessary magnetic softness and magnetostriction in FeGa for integration in strain-mediated magnetoelectric and microwave devices.},

The accurate measurement of SOT effective fields and their thickness dependence is the basis for understanding this issue. In this work, we measured the SOT effective fields for Pt/NiFe bilayers by utilizing the harmonic longitudinal voltage (HLV) method with a Wheatstone bridge structure. Benefiting from the elimination of the linear resistance in the bridge structure and the large magnetoresistance difference resulting from the large length–width ratio of the bridge element, we achieved very high measurement accuracy for both field-like and damping-like effective fields in the Pt/NiFe bilayers. On this basis, we demonstrated the possibility of the SOT measurement with a relatively low current density (∼10 9 A/m 2 ) by utilizing the HLV method with a Wheatstone bridge structure and found that the method we proposed is also applicable to the Pt/CoFeB system with a low anisotropic magnetoresistance ratio.},

The defect density in the SQW is controlled by tuning the thickness of an InAlN underlayer. When the defect density is increased, apart from Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) and standard Auger recombination, introducing an extra defect-assisted Auger process is required to reconcile the discrepancy observed between the usual ABC model and experimental data. We derive a linear dependence between the SRH coefficient and the bimolecular defect-assisted Auger coefficient, which suggests that the generated defects can act as scattering centers responsible for indirect Auger processes. In particular, in defective SQWs, the defect-assisted Auger recombination rate can exceed the radiative one. Our results further suggest that the defect-assisted Auger recombination is expected to be all the more critical in green to red III-nitride light-emitting diodes due to their reduced radiative rate.},

At first, by developing an in situ cyclic metal layer oxidation method, we realized the formation of an Al 2 O 3 /4H–SiC gate stack without substrate oxidation, which was verified using conventional X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Then, the amount of byproducts on the 4H–SiC surface was controlled by chemical etching of thermally oxidized 4H–SiC. The results showed that the D it near the E C of 4H–SiC for the Al 2 O 3 /4H–SiC gate stack increased with the amount of byproducts until it fully covered the 4H–SiC surface; thereafter, it did not increase. For the sample with byproducts below the detection limit of XPS, a D it value as low as 5 × 10 11 cm −2 eV −1 at around E C − 0.15 eV of 4H–SiC was obtained.},

To elucidate this idea, this paper examines Ge doping as a function of Al-content in AlGaN and finds a different behavior: for Al compositions below 40\%, Ge behaved as a shallow donor with an ionization energy below 20 meV, while for Al compositions above 40\%, above DX transition, it emerged as a deep donor. The ionization energy of this deep state increased with increasing Al content and reached 150 meV for 60\% AlGaN. Around the DX transition, a continuous change from the shallow to deep donor was observed. In contrast to the density functional theory predictions, acceptor-type states corresponding to a DX-type transition were not observed. This finding may have profound technological consequences for the development of AlGaN- and AlN-based devices as it offers a feasible pathway to high n-conductivity in these compounds.},

  abstract     = {Off-state leakage current of AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) with implant and mesa isolation was studied. Comparison of isolated pad structures with HEMTs shows that isolation leakage flowing through contact pads is the major leakage source in the studied GaN-based HEMTs whose gate finger is connected to an Ohmic contact pad. Then, circular metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor devices were used to identify this isolation leakage path as surface isolation leakage at the SiN/nitride interface rather than bulk leakage in the buffer layer or implanted region. The temperature-dependent measurement shows that the two-dimensional variable range hopping mechanism dominates both the implant and mesa isolation leakage current. Mesa isolation results in a larger hopping probability and isolation leakage current than implant isolation. The isolation leakage current through gate and drain contact pads results in a non-zero switch of gate current in rectangular devices with either a Schottky gate or a metal-oxide-semiconductor gate, which is not observed in circular devices. Gate voltage for the switch of gate leakage current is linearly correlated with drain bias voltage, and the slope of the linear model represents the influence of drain bias on gate leakage current. This empirical model is independent of the fabrication process, provided that the same layout is used. With an increase in the source–drain distance from 4 μ m to 10 μ m, the ratio of gate–drain isolation resistance to gate–source isolation resistance increases from 1.38 to 2.33, leading to a decrease in the slope of empirical lines from 0.42 to 0.30.},

However, the strong interlayered anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) coupling hinders the practical applications without applying a magnetic field. Thus, how to adjust the magnetism of this compound under zero field is essential. Here, we theoretically and experimentally study the magnetic properties of two new promising intrinsic MTI candidates MnBi 4 Te 7 and MnBi 6 Te 10 , formed by intercalating the Bi 2 Te 3 layer into MnBi 2 Te 4 . The first-principles calculations reveal that the relative energy between ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM states is greatly reduced by Bi 2 Te 3 intercalations. The calculated energy barriers for the spin flipping process also point out that the metastable FM state is more easily retained by intercalation. Meanwhile, we also experimentally carry out magnetic and transport measurements on these materials. By increasing Bi 2 Te 3 intercalations, the AFM coupling becomes weaker, and an almost fully polarized FM state can be preserved in MnBi 6 Te 10 at low temperatures, which are consistent with our calculations. We believe that the demonstration of the intrinsic MTI preserving zero-field FM state and the in-depth investigation for the mechanism behind pave the way for investigating the high-temperature QAHE and the related physics.},

We then detect the mismatch strain from experiments based on the digital-image correlation method and explore the effect of the substrate nano-SiO 2 mass fraction on the strain mismatch over a wide temperature range. The strain mismatch coefficient (SMC) is proposed to better evaluate the degree of strain mismatch between the metal interconnect and the hybrid substrate. Experimental results show that pure PDMS results in relatively large temperature-induced SMC values than nano-SiO 2 hybridized substrates and hybridization of nano-SiO 2 particles significantly decreases the film SMC value. At a constant temperature, e.g., 20 °C, the SMC value is observed to decrease as the mass fraction of nano-SiO 2 in the flexible substrate increases, which turns to be the lowest SMC value as the content of nano-SiO 2 reaches 8 wt.\%.

  abstract     = {Traditional memristors based on metal/insulator/metal sandwich structures generally require the operation voltages of several volts to switch the device between different resistance states. In this work, we report the ultralow set and reset voltages of 14 mV and 0.3 V in a simple bilayer device, respectively, which is composed of the widely used indium tin oxide (ITO) solely. Such low operation voltages might be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the loose porous structure in the upper ITO layer deposited by electron beam evaporation, the amorphous interface between two ITO layers, and the formation of an oxygen concentration gradient triggered by an initiation process. Based on the superior resistive switching properties of this kind bilayer device, synaptic functions and image memorization are achieved by applying ultralow electrical stimulus. The prototype device not only paves the way for simplifying the device structure and the fabrication process but also offers possibilities to develop transparent multifunctional devices with low power consumption.},

In this Letter, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene micro-ribbon-based metasurface that allows us to tailor and dynamically tune the transmission and polarization rotation spectra of impinging THz pulses. This is achieved by controlling the geometry of the ribbon pattern and the applied DC magnetic field, both of which strongly influence the magnetoplasmonic response of the metasurface. The properties of the metasurface can be accurately modeled using an effective medium approach that considers the capacitive interaction of the ribbons resulting from the THz electric field. Our results highlight the promise of graphene-based THz devices that leverage the strongly enhanced light–matter interactions resulting from patterning.},

Here, we introduce atomic-layer graphene onto the silicon nanophotonic platform to leverage its unique nondegenerate two-photon absorption and ultrafast carrier dynamics, demonstrating broadband and fast bitrate transmission through cross-absorption modulation. Multichannel error-free optical transmission across telecommunication C- and L-bands is demonstrated with 10 −12 bit-error rates at a data transmission rate of 1 Gbps. The bandwidth of the hybrid silicon–graphene structure is demonstrated at least up to 25 GHz.

Here, we report on a class of vector beams with elliptical symmetry where the spatial DoF is encoded in the Ince–Gaussian modes of the cylindrical elliptical coordinates. We outline their geometric representation on the higher-order Poincaré sphere, demonstrate their experimental generation, and analyze the quality of the generated modes via Stokes polarimetry.

In quantum metrology, sub-shot-noise quantum imaging (SSNQI) and sensing methods can provide genuine quantum enhancement in realistic situations. However, wide-field SSNQI schemes realized so far suffer a trade-off between the resolution and the sensitivity gain over a classical counterpart: small pixels or integrating area are necessary to achieve high imaging resolution, but larger pixels allow a better detection efficiency of quantum correlations, which means a larger quantum advantage. Here, we show how the SSNQI protocol can be optimized to significantly improve the resolution without giving up the quantum advantage in sensitivity. We show a linear resolution improvement (up to a factor 3) with respect to the simple protocol used in previous demonstrations.},

Similar to gyrotrons, the presence of a cutoff wave in the feedback loop improves significantly the selectivity of the resonator at large values of the oversize factor and facilitates a stable single-mode oscillation regime in short wavelength bands. Proof-of-principle experiments conducted at the induction linac LIU-3000 (Dubna) demonstrate the operability of the FEM with the proposed modification of the Bragg resonator. At the transverse oversize factor of about 5, stable narrow-band generation was achieved with an output power of up to 7 MW and the oscillation frequency of about 80 GHz corresponding to the frequency of the cutoff mode excited in the advanced Bragg reflector. These investigations encourage the application of the advanced Bragg resonators for the development of high-power long-pulse FELs driven by induction linacs and operating in the subterahertz to terahertz frequency range.},

Whispering-gallery-modes (WGMs) are effectively excited through evanescent field coupling between the silica microsphere and one of the input tube waveguides of negative curvature fiber. The WGM spectrum with the Q-factor of ∼2.56 × 10 3 and the extinction ratio of ∼15.2 dB is achieved. The transmission spectra evolution for 5 h reveals the long-term stability of WGM excitation. The experimental results indicate that the in-fiber integrated resonator has the advantages of high stability, high integration, robustness, alignment-free assembly structure, and low cost, motivating potential applications in the lab-in-fiber platform.},

SiC x N y films were deposited on the aluminum (Al) substrates using plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) method. The effects of SiC x N y chemical structure with respect to resistive switching characteristics have been studied, and the results suggest that the resistive switching mechanism is dominated by the interfacial Schottky junction with SiC x N y composition. This work not only demonstrates a PEALD method in fabricating SiC x N y -based electronics active devices but also provides additional insights into the interaction between the electrical and chemical structures in bi-functional resistive switching or threshold switching behavior. A demonstrated PEALD tool with simple single-precursor for SiC x N y deposition shows excellent feasibility to be used as functional memory and selector devices, further giving the potential pathway for advanced BEOL process integration.},

Compared to the Hermitian grating without losses, the positive first order diffracted wave with negative incidence will be suppressed perfectly, but the negative first order diffracted wave with positive incidence will be enhanced counterintuitively in the lossy diffraction grating. The physical mechanism is that losses can modulate the magnitudes of Bloch wave vectors through the interplay with the real modulation of the refractive index.

Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies were employed to study and probe radiation-induced changes to the samples after exposure to intense gamma radiation (from a 60 Co source) in a high-vacuum environment (∼1 × 10 −6 Torr) and with various exposure times to vary the total accumulated dosage (up to ∼56 Mrad). In general, very small changes in optical or vibrational properties were observed compared to pristine samples, suggesting noteworthy stability even for high dosages of gamma radiation. Moreover, we found that WSe 2 monolayer samples exhibited higher tolerance to gamma radiation compared to WS 2 samples. These findings highlight the inherent stability of these 2D quantum materials in harsh radioactive environments, which motivates further investigation of their optical, electrical, and structural properties and exploration for use in future space, energy, and defense applications.},

Here, we investigate the conductivity behavior and angle-magnetresistance (MR) properties of a 1.4 nm-thick ultrathin PtSe 2 film. The observed insulating behavior is dominated by nearest-neighbor hopping and variable-range hopping (VRH) of the localized carriers throughout the measured temperature. At low temperatures, a crossover from the Mott-VRH to Efros-Shklovskii (ES)-VRH conducting process is observed in the conductivity data, suggesting the existence of the Coulomb gap around the Fermi level. In this strong localized regime, the observed negative MR under a perpendicular magnetic field is ascribed to the quantum interference among random hopping paths between hopping sites. When the field aligns with current, the appearance of positive MR can be considered as a consequence of the reduction in hopping probability due to field-induced modification of the charger wavefunction at impurity or defect centers. The charge transport research of ultrathin PtSe 2 is of great significance for both fundamental physics and nanoscale electronic applications.},

An SEB is a two-terminal device composed of “leaky,” C j ⁠ , and “non-leaky,” C g ⁠ , nanoscaled capacitors in series. At low temperatures, the charge at the common node is quantized and can only be changed near energy-population degeneracy points, resulting in periodic oscillations of the SEB admittance as a function of voltage applied to C g ⁠ . In comparison to the SETs, SEBs have higher operating temperature, are electrostatic discharge tolerant, and have a much smaller footprint. To monitor the SEB admittance, Radio Frequency reflectometry can be used. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, limited by the small change in admittance in an SEB, multiple devices sharing the same source and gate electrodes are connected in parallel to form arrays of SEBs. Due to unavoidable random offset charges, the signal boost for an array of N SEBs is expected to be ∼ N ⁠ . We experimentally demonstrate that by carefully choosing the operating point, the response to the voltage on the sensing gate can be enhanced, for small arrays scales, by a factor approaching N and, thus, provides a method by which these devices can be used in practical sensing applications, such as a scanning probe.},

The heater causes a microscale protrusion by thermal expansion such that its surface approaches the substrate until contact occurs. Meanwhile, the metal wire located near the center of the protrusion surface measures the temperature of the protrusion, which is dependent on the size of the gap, the substrate material, and the ambient conditions. We study the nanoscale heat transfer using three different substrates and find that their thermal conductivity plays an essential role. Finally, the experiments are conducted under different relative humidity (RH) conditions. The results show that the ambient humidity can also affect the nanoscale heat transfer when RH &gt; 75\%.},

Consequently, reversal of the electric polarization by an electric field gives rise to an immediate and lasting optical response when an appropriately aligned FLC is observed between crossed polarizers, with one field direction yielding a dark image and the opposite direction yielding a bright image. Here, this peculiar electro-optic response is used to image, with high optical contrast, 180° ferroelectric domains in a crystalline substrate of magnesium-doped lithium niobate. The lithium niobate substrate contains a few domains with upward electric polarization surrounded by regions with downward electric polarization. In contrast to a reference non-chiral liquid crystal that is unable to show ferroelectric behavior due to its high symmetry, the FLC, which is used as a thin film confined between the lithium niobate substrate and an inert aligning substrate, reveals ferroelectric domains as well as their boundaries, with strong black and white contrast. The results show that FLCs can be used for non-destructive readout of domains in underlying ferroelectrics, with potential applications in, e.g., photonic devices and non-volatile ferroelectric memories.},

  abstract     = {Gilbert damping is of crucial importance for spintronic devices due to its practical effect on the response time and energy consumption. Lower damping would enable more energy-efficient excitations and, thus, less current is needed. The Gilbert damping constant of the Co 2 FeAl film, a half-metal material important for spintronics with its 100\% spin polarization at the Fermi level, has shown an abnormal increase at the thin film limit due to the inter-diffusion of Al atoms. Here, we report that the Gilbert damping of ultra-thin Co 2 FeAl 1 + x films of nanometer thicknesses can be effectively tuned by delicately controlling the stoichiometric ratio during the growth. Gilbert damping has been found to be the lowest of 0.065 in Co 2 FeAl 1 + 0.1 ⁠ , which is deduced by ∼ 50\% compared to that in Co 2 FeAl. We have further found that the damping constant of the ultra-thin Co 2 FeAl 1 + 0.1 film is restored to the value of 0.062 of the nominal stoichiometric Co 2 FeAl by compensating the Al composition deficiency, as supported by 10.37\% of composition change from scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive-spectroscopy. This work offers a unique path to manipulate the Gilbert damping constant in ultra-thin Co 2 FeAl films by Al concentration control.},

Light-induced demagnetization of the ferromagnet launches a pulse of spin current into the heavy metal, wherein it bifurcates into a radiative charge transient due to the ISHE. The influence of temperature on this combined effect should depend on both the magnetic phase diagram and the microscopic origin of spin Hall conductivity, but its exact dependence remains to be clarified. Here, we experimentally study the temperature dependence of an archetypal spintronic emitter, the Co/Pt bilayer, using electro-optic sampling of the emitted THz pulses in the time domain. The emission amplitude is attenuated with decreasing temperature, consistent with an inverse spin Hall effect in platinum of predominantly intrinsic origin.},

  abstract     = {With a Curie temperature just above room temperature, AlFe 2 B 2 is a useful magnetocaloric material composed of earth-abundant elements. We employ temperature-dependent high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction to establish with high certainty that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition in AlFe 2 B 2 is of second order, showing no discontinuity in lattice parameters or cell volume. Nevertheless, the lattice parameters undergo anisotropic changes across the transition with distinct differences in the thermal expansion coefficients. While the a and b lattice parameters show a positive thermal expansion, c shows a negative thermal expansion. We link these changes to the respective interatomic distances to determine the contribution of magnetism to the anisotropic structural evolution. The work underpins the possible role of magnetostructural coupling in driving the magnetocaloric effect in AlFe 2 B 2 .},

Within the 30–40\% range of Co concentrations, an experimental effective magnetic anisotropy on the order of 100 kJ/m 3 and a computational uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy of 567 μ eV/atom have been observed. First-principles calculations revealed that the lattice strain promotes a strong d -orbital degeneracy near the Fermi level for 40\% of Co concentration, leading to an enhanced magnetic anisotropy energy.},

Here, we report a 10-times enhancement of magnetization dynamics excitation of single nanomagnets using focused surface acoustic waves (SAWs), compared to conventional optical excitation. SAWs are generated via ultrafast optical excitation of an arc-shaped phononic grating and focused onto a single nanomagnet located at the focal spot of the grating. Thanks to the robust resonance excitation, we observe the strain-controlled ultrafast magnetization dynamics in a sub-100 nm single nanomagnet. This improved excitation efficiency was applied to exciting SAWs in four sets of gratings with different pitches using a single laser spot. This enabled selective excitation of any one of four identical nanomagnets at different frequencies simply by tuning an external magnetic field. This all-optical technique provides a method of addressing individual magnetic nano-oscillators and studying their intrinsic magnetization dynamics.},

  abstract     = {During selective epitaxial growth of diamond through SiO 2 masks, silicon terminations were formed on a diamond surface by replacing oxygen terminations under the masks. The high temperature of selective growth and its reductive atmosphere possibly allowed Si atoms in SiO 2 to interact with the diamond surface, resulting in silicon terminated diamond (C–Si diamond) composed of a monolayer or thin multi-layers of carbon and silicon bonds on diamond. Diamond metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), with a C–Si diamond channel and selectively grown undoped or heavily boron-doped (p + ) source/drain (S/D) layers, have been fabricated. Both the MOSFETs with undoped and p + S/D exhibited enhancement mode (normally off) FET characteristics. The drain current ( I DS ) of the undoped device reached −17 mA/mm with threshold voltage ( V T ) −19 V; the p + device attained a high I DS −165 mA/mm with a V T of −6 V being one of the best normally off diamond FETs. Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy confirmed the presence of C–Si diamond under the SiO 2 masking area. The field effect mobility and interface state density at the C–Si/SiO 2 (220 nm)/Al 2 O 3 (100 nm) MOS capacitor are 102 cm 2 V −1 s −1 and 4.6 × 10 12 cm −2 eV −1 , respectively.

Here, we propose an active region strategy by introducing bunching effect to form self-assembled sidewall quantum wells (SQWs) with much stronger carrier confinement, resulting in a significant enhancement of internal quantum efficiency (from 46\% to 59\%) compared to the commonly adopted multiple quantum wells (MQWs) due to the lower sensitivity to TDD. As a demo, an AlGaN-based DUV light-emitting diode (LED) with the proposed active region involving both SQWs and MQWs presents dual-band emission and a consequent 68\% enhancement in light output power compared to the DUV-LED with only MQWs as the active region, suggesting that the proposed architecture is fully suitable for the development of high performance DUV light-emitting devices even based on poor or medium quality materials.},

Density functional theory calculations reveal that V B and Mg B both behave as a shallow acceptor for p-type conduction of h-BN. The N-rich condition is found to promote the formation of V B as a low-barrier site for Mg B incorporation. Experimentally, Mg p-type doping is achieved in a h-BN monolayer under N 2 (or NH 3 ) gas flow through a chemical vapor deposition method. The surface current of Mg-doped h-BN has been enhanced by three times up to 32 μ A under a 8 V external voltage.

This study reports on variations in thermally induced oscillations and on underdamping behavior in the regime of high pump power. Dynamic data related to the thermal behavior can be used to study the balance between driving forces (pumping and thermal stresses) and damping losses (cooling and output coupling). The non-invasive nature of the proposed scheme along with its sub-100-nm axial resolution, sub-millisecond time resolution, and simple configuration makes it widely applicable for studying heat-related phenomena within laser crystals. The preliminary results show that such non-invasive methods could be used to detect thermally induced nanoscale deformations in integrated circuits, high-power optoelectronic devices, and optical devices with high-power illumination.},

In particular, the coupling effect and parity–time (PT) symmetry have been found to jointly determine the transition of topological edge states, which have yet to be detected directly in coupled PT-symmetric waveguides. In this work, we use a finite waveguide array described by the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model to explicitly reveal the relation between the topological states and PT symmetry and unveil the condition for the coexistence of topological edge states and PT phases. Microwave-near-field experiments have revealed non-trivial edge states in both exact- and broken-PT phases in ultrathin corrugated metallic coupled waveguide arrays. This work thus establishes an integrated microwave waveguide platform based on which more interesting physics and functional devices related to topological photonics and PT symmetry may be developed.},

The GaN n–i–p diode fabricated on a free-standing GaN substrate showed robust avalanche, which has not been observed on any GaN avalanche photodiodes (APDs) grown on foreign substrates. Both electrical and optical characterization studies were conducted to validate the occurrence of avalanche in these devices. The device showed a positive temperature coefficient of breakdown voltage, which follows the nature of avalanche breakdown. The positive coefficient was measured to be 3.85 × 10 −4 K −1 (0.1 V/K) at a measurement temperature ranging from 300 K to 525 K. The avalanche-induced electroluminescence is also reported here in GaN APDs.

Finger-like electrodes are used to excite a plasmonic mode to enhance light absorption of the devices. The measured bandwidth of this device was ∼4.5 GHz. An improved bandwidth of about 17 GHz was achieved in an alternative electrode design which has smaller capacitance. The photodetector was stable, and maintained similar performance after several months&#39; exposure to air. The PtSe 2 is an attractive 2D material for high-speed optoelectronic devices and is a viable alternative to graphene and black phosphorus, potentially offering even better performance in certain applications because of its longer term stability and non-zero bandgap.},

We obtain a heralding efficiency of 90\% at a brightness of 0.039 photons/pulse. The purity of the source is checked by two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with a visibility of 95 ± 6\% (after correcting Raman scattering and multi-pair events). Our investigation indicates that the heralded source of single photons produced by the three-stage nonlinear interferometer has the advantages of high purity, high heralding efficiency, high brightness, and flexibility in wavelength and bandwidth selection.},

  abstract     = {The effect that barrier material has on the temperature dependence of photoluminescence of InAs/AlGaInAs/InP quantum dots in the telecom C-band (∼1550 nm) is reported. Increasing Al content in the barrier material, (Al x Ga 1-x ) 0.53 In 0.47 As, creates less temperature sensitivity and enhances the high temperature relative quantum yield. Three samples, with x = 0.51, 0.75, and 1, have room temperature relative quantum yield values of 2.0\%, 3.7\%, and 41.0\%, respectively, when compared to low temperature values. Determination of thermal activation energies shows that the loss of relative quantum yield is due to thermal escape of holes from the quantum dots to the barrier. More aluminum-rich barriers require higher temperatures to depopulate the ground state of the quantum dots, which leads to better high temperature emission. These results can guide future designs of telecom C-band quantum dot devices.},

The scallop surface modulation with a period of 55–110 nm on 200 nm diameter nanowires was created using top-down deep-reactive-ion-etching. The measured thermal conductivity was 15.13 W m −1 K −1 , 34\% lower than those of nanowires fabricated by metal-assisted-chemical-etching with a similar diameter, and 60\% lower than the Casimir limit. An analysis using the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and radiation analogy of ballistic phonons shows that this drastic reduction stems from the phonon backscattering at the scallop surface. The thermal conductivity measured at 300–500 K showed a nearly temperature-independent trend suggesting that the structural control can overcome a material limit. Our results provide a systematic nanostructure control approach to improve the thermoelectric efficiency more than the limit imposed by a material.},

Microneedles with tunable lengths and tips are produced by controlling the rheology and fracture of metallic glass. The same drawing process can generate solid and hollow microneedles simply by varying the thickness of metallic glass. The mechanism of thickness dependent transition from solid to hollow profiles is described by the viscous buckling of metallic liquid.

We build on the uniaxial Gent formulation and, under the conditions of equi-biaxial strain, derive an expression for bulge deformation vs pressure. A circular bulge test methodology is developed to experimentally measure the mechanical response of the silicone membranes. The Gent model captures both neo-Hookean and strain-stiffening behaviors and gives predictions that are in agreement with experimental measurements. Membranes with different thinner fractions are characterized over nearly one order of magnitude variation in shear modulus. Stiffer membranes are observed to harden at lower stretch ratios due to the increased fraction of polymer chains in them. The present approach offers a simple and cost-effective procedure for characterizing soft membranes under commonly encountered biaxial deformation conditions.},

  abstract     = {Electrifying both stationary and mobile systems requires ultra-compact, lightweight power electronics and electric machines. Increasing the volumetric and gravimetric density of these systems is constrained, however, by the capacity to remove heat from these assemblies. A promising method for extracting heat is jumping droplet condensation, which can address both spatially and temporally changing hotspots. Yet, disagreement exists in the literature about the maximum attainable heat flux for water-based, droplet jumping devices such as vapor chambers, with values ranging from 5 to 500 W/cm 2 . Here, using thermal measurements and optical imaging in pure vapor conditions, we directly observe the hydrodynamics occurring inside of a jumping droplet vapor chamber. Our experiments show that flooding is the key obstacle limiting jumping droplet mass flux to hot spots, limiting heat transfer to less than 15 W/cm 2 . These results indicate that past works reporting high heat fluxes benefited from other hot spot cooling pathways such as previously observed liquid bridges formed due to flooding. To test our hypothesis, we characterize progressive flooding on a variety of structured surfaces ranging in length-scale from 100 nm to 10 μ m. Progressive flooding was delayed by decreasing the length-scale of the surface structures, which supports recent observations in the literature. Our work not only helps to understand the wide variability of past results quantifying droplet jumping heat transfer, but also provides design guidelines for the development of surfaces that are capable of maintaining enhanced jumping droplet condensation.},

Compared against that of our control design, which is a conventional n + - n - p + double hetero-junction LED, the dopant profile near the n - p + hetero-structure of the design displaces the built-in electric field in such a way that the J 02 space charge recombination current is suppressed.

Despite many research activities carried out, the charge transport mechanism in Si 3 N 4 -based memristors is still unclear. Metal–nitride–oxide–silicon structures that exhibit memristor properties were obtained using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition at 700 °C. The fabricated metal–nitride–oxide–silicon memristor structure does not require a forming procedure. In addition, the metal–nitride–oxide–silicon memristor has a memory window of about five orders of magnitude. We found that the main charge transport mechanism in the metal–nitride–oxide–silicon memristor in a high resistive state is the model of space-charge-limited current with traps. In a low resistive state, the charge transport mechanism is described by the space-charge-limited current model with filled traps. Trap parameters were determined in the Si 3 N 4 -based memristor in the high resistive state.},

  abstract     = {Defect behaviors in the degradation of AlGaN-based UV-C light emitting diodes (LEDs) under constant current stress have been intensively investigated in this work. It is found that both the reduction of the optical power and the increase in the leakage current are derived from the newly generated Ga vacancy (V Ga ) along dislocation, based on the evidence of a strong “yellow” emission peak at 515 nm in the photoluminescence spectra and an energy level of 0.25–0.38 eV. More importantly, the defect evolution behind it was determined through the deep level transient spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements, and density functional theory. V Ga is found to be generated by the departure of the unintentionally doped Mg from Mg Ga along dislocation in the Si-doped region. The high activity of the unintentionally doped Mg under electrical stress can be an essential factor in the degradation of UV-C LEDs. This study not only provides an in-depth insight into the electrical stress-induced degradation in UV-C LEDs but also sheds light on the way for fabricating AlGaN-based devices with high reliability.},

This dependence is found to be a consequence of substrate induced charge transfer, extra scattering centers, and electronic localization. Through fitting the experimental results with the Drude–Smith formula, we can determine the key sample parameters (e.g., the electronic relaxation time, electron density, and electronic localization factor) of ML WS 2 on different substrates. The temperature dependence of these parameters is examined.

Simulation, experimental, and calculation results indicate that the absorption spectrum can be tailored by surface plasmon resonances (SPRs) of different interfaces and Si-groove resonance. Visible-light absorption is caused by Si-groove resonance, SPRs of the Au–air interface, and high-frequency mode SPRs of the Au–Si interface. NIR absorption is induced by the SPRs of the Au–Si interface. Moreover, out-of-plane coupling between upper and lower Au gratings gives rise to an enhanced electric field and broadened SPR absorption. The respective photoresponsivity in the visible and NIR band is more than 7 and 3 mA/W without an external bias, with a maximum responsivity of 13 mA/W at 535 nm. The photoresponse of such ASGM-based dual-band photodetectors can be modulated so that they may be used in various fields like medical imaging, optical communication, and aerography.},

Here, we investigated the electrical properties of another type of inorganic nanotube, namely, WSe 2 nanotubes, and revealed their ambipolar transistor properties through the development of a facile synthesis method. WSe 2 nanotubes were synthesized by the selenization of solution-synthesized tungsten oxide nanowires.

However, metal TCR is much degraded in nanometer-thin films due to strong surface scattering, preventing their use as fast thermal sensors, which simultaneously require low thermal mass and large TCR. In contrast, here we show that the TCR of doped two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is large (∼0.3\% K −1 at 300 K in MoS 2 and MoTe 2 ) even at sub-nanometer thickness. This is larger than that of any metals with thicknesses up to ∼35 nm and larger than that of ∼95 nm thick Cu lines (0.25\% K −1 ) at 300 K. At 100 K, the TCR of these 2D materials is doubled, ∼0.6\% K −1 . Comparison with detailed 2D transport models suggests that the TCR could be further enhanced (up to 0.45\% K −1 at 300 K and ∼2.5\% K −1 at 100 K) by reducing the density of Coulomb impurities and scattering centers. Such high TCR in atomically thin 2D semiconductors could lead to the design of fast thermal sensors.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal dichalcogenides can be epitaxially grown at the single layer limit, which also adopt a variety of structural polymorphs with significantly different electronic properties. Lateral heterostructures of different polymorphs can be further synthesized for emergent functionality. Here, we selectively grow semiconducting 1H and metastable 1T′ phases of WSe 2 on epitaxial graphene/SiC(0001) by molecular beam epitaxy and further show that the 1T′ phase is a two-dimensional topological insulator. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we determine that 1T′–WSe 2 exhibits a large bulk bandgap of 120 meV, and edge states at the 1T′–1H lateral heterojunction extend within 1.6 nm from the heterointerface at the 1T′ side. These edge states are robust and persist regardless of the fact that if the edge is (1 × 1) zigzag or (3 × 1) reconstructed, confirming their topological nature. This further facilitates the epitaxial growth of 1T′–1H lateral junction superlattices with multiple helical edge channels, underpinning ultrahigh-density 2D topological nano quantum devices.},

  abstract     = {The apex-field enhancement factor (aFEF) is regarded as a meaningful parameter to characterize field electron emission (FE) devices. If experimentally extracted from orthodox current–voltage characteristics, this parameter reliably quantifies how much the emitter&#39;s sharp tip locally magnifies the applied external electrostatic field. Many experimental works have reported FE from arrays of carbon nanotubes with fixed spacing ( c ) between nearest-neighbor emitters, fixed apex-radii ( r ), and various height ( h ) and claimed the existence of an aspect ratio ( h / r ) at which a local maximum effective aFEF is achieved. Hereafter, it is shown that those results are not consistent with simulations using basic electrostatics for both finite or infinite regular square arrays of emitters. Quite interestingly, our results show that the aFEF ( γ a ), for an emitter in an infinity regular array, simply saturates at γ s for h ≳ 0.7 c ⁠ . Additionally, we found a universal behavior in which γ a scales as γ a ∼ γ s ( h / c ) 0.84 ⁠ , when h ≲ 0.7 c ⁠ , for h / r ≳ 50 ⁠ . These results provide a practical rule for the design of large arrays of field emitters, which can be used to build FE nanoelectromechanical resonators with both mechanical strength and reduced Joule losses.},

  abstract     = {We examine different cases of heterostructures consisting of WS 2 monolayers grown by chemical vapor deposition as the optically active material. We show that the degree of valley polarization of WS 2 is considerably influenced by the material type used to form the heterostructure. Our results suggest that the interaction between WS 2 and graphene (WS 2 /Gr) has a strong effect on the temperature-dependent depolarization (i.e., decrease in polarization with increasing temperature), with polarization degrees reaching 24\% at room temperature under near-resonant excitation. This contrasts with hBN-encapsulated WS 2 , which exhibits a room temperature polarization degree of only 11\%. The observed low depolarization rate in the WS 2 /Gr heterostructure is attributed to the nearly temperature independent scattering rate due to phonons and fast charge and energy transfer processes from WS 2 to graphene. Significant variations in the degree of polarization are also observed at 4 K between the different heterostructure configurations. Intervalley hole scattering in the valence band proximity between the K and Γ points of WS 2 is sensitive to the immediate environment, leading to the observed variations.},

For their application in piezoelectric transducers for medical imaging, the beam mode vibration of PMN-0.25PT single crystal resonators after ACP was investigated by combining experimental impedance measurements and finite element simulation. The complete material coefficients of PMN-0.25PT single crystals were obtained by using pulse-echo ultrasound and inverse impedance spectroscopy. Compared to traditional direct current poling (DCP), the beam mode electromechanical coupling coefficient ( ⁠ k 33 ′ ⁠ ) of PMN-0.25PT for ACP reaches up to 89.1\% from 84.5\% of DCP. As the attribution of the special periodic stripe domain structure (109° domain), the lateral vibration will be suppressed effectively in the array transducer.

It is found that the low-resistance state (ON state) current decreases with the DE thickness, while the high-resistance state (OFF state) current decreases first and then increases. The largest tunneling electroresistance (TER) effect is observed for the 3 nm-thick DE layer, which corresponds to the lowest OFF-state current. Studies on the electron transport mechanisms show that direct tunneling dominates the ON-state tunneling behaviors for all FTJs as well as the OFF state for the thinnest DE layer of 1 nm. While Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling plays a significant role in the OFF-state electron transport for thicker DE thicknesses and reinforces its role with the increasing DE thickness, the weak FN tunneling-assisted low OFF-state current for the 3 nm-thick DE layer relative to the DE layer of 4 nm contributes to the largest TER effect.},

Fine process control was conducted to ensure optimal magnetic properties. Organic dispersants, i.e., isobutylene and maleic anhydride, were employed to achieve maximum densities. Crystallographic structure, characterized by x-ray diffraction, revealed that the dopants did not adversely affect the crystal structure and phase purity of the Z-type hexaferrite. An increase in permeability and size reduction factor is shown to be linearly proportional to the ionic radii of the dopants. This trend is consistent with local bonding distortions giving rise to increased exchange energy (J) as predicted by the Goodenough–Kanamori–Anderson rules and superexchange theory. We posit that these distortions increase the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy affecting the frequency dependent complex permeability. For Mo doping of x = 0.05, a bandwidth of 400 MHz exists at a center frequency of 650 MHz where the permittivity and permeability are very nearly equal, i.e., Z = 377 ± 5 Ω. These results give rise to low loss, i.e., tan δ ε / ε ′ = 0.0006 and tan δ μ / μ ′ = 0.038 at 650 MHz, with considerable size reduction (×9).

Using broadband spin-wave spectroscopy, we demonstrate bandgap widening in a 260-nm-thick YIG crystal when the grooves are deepened from half to full film thickness. Importantly, low-loss spin-wave transmission in the allowed bands of the magnonic crystal is almost unaffected by the patterning of fully discrete YIG stripes. Downscaling of the YIG film thickness to 35 nm decreases the bandgap size through a flattening of the spin-wave dispersion relation. We show that a reduction in the lattice constant effectively compensates for this trend. Our experimental results are corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, providing relevant information for the design of ultrathin YIG-based magnonic crystals with optimized bandgaps and spin-wave transmission properties.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic field noise from magnons can reduce the lifetimes of proximate spins and degrade the performance of spin based technologies. However, spatial and temporal averaging over the area of typical field sensors makes measuring magnetic field noise challenging. Here, we use an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) point-defects in diamond to measure the spectral profile of thermally excited spinwave noise at room temperature as a function of the distance away from a 20 nm thick Permalloy (Py) thin film. We systematically vary the separation between the NV and Py layers using a silicon-dioxide wedge and measure the longitudinal relaxation rate of the NV center m s = 0 state as a function of the separation. The measured spinwave-induced relaxation of an ensemble of NV centers is well described by a magnetostatic model of dipole fields from the spinwaves. We furthermore find that our all-optical, nonperturbative measurements of the spinwave noise can be used to extract information about the ferromagnetic source, such as magnetization, damping, and fluctuating amplitude. This technique is amenable to application with stand-off from ferromagnetic elements and from buried structures.},

The compressive strained epitaxial growth of ZGO on MgAl 2 O 4 (100) and the tensile strained epitaxial growth of ZGO on MgO (100) without any misfit or threading dislocations were confirmed by the reciprocal space map and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. The electrical transport properties were demonstrated through TFTs based on ZGO as the channel layer, Al 2 O 3 as the gate oxide, and Sn-doped In 2 O 3 as the source, drain, and gate electrodes. When the Zn/Ga ratio is slightly lower than the ideal value of 0.5 on MgO substrates, the ZGO TFT showed the highest mobility of 5.4 cm 2 /V s.

Remarkably, some Bi-induced Raman modes were strongly enhanced when the laser energy was selected near an optical transition for the 5.8\%Bi sample.

As expected, the spectrally determined values of V l vary linearly with the applied bias ( ⁠ V ⁠ ) and reveal a large reduction in the local electric field due to electrostatic non-uniformity. The built-in bias ( ⁠ V b i ⁠ ) is estimated by extrapolating V l at V = 0 ⁠ , which, when compared with independent C-V measurements, indicates an overall ±0.31 V accuracy of V l ⁠ .

  abstract     = {Beta-phase gallium oxide (β-Ga 2 O 3 ), the most thermally stable phase of Ga 2 O 3 , has stimulated great interest in power electronics due to its ultra-wide bandgap (∼4.9 eV) and high breakdown electric field. The relatively low thermal conductivity of β-Ga 2 O 3 , however, limits the device performance due to excessive temperature driven by self-heating. Recently, integrating β-Ga 2 O 3 thin films on substrates with high thermal conductivities has been proposed to improve heat rejection and device reliability. In this work, we prepare high-quality single-crystal β-Ga 2 O 3 thin films by mechanical exfoliation of bulk crystals and study their thermal transport properties. Both the anisotropic thermal conductivity of β-Ga 2 O 3 bulk crystals and the thickness-dependent thermal conductivity of β-Ga 2 O 3 thin films are measured using the time-domain thermoreflectance technique. The reduction in the thin-film thermal conductivity, compared to the bulk value, can be well explained by the size effect resulting from the enhanced phonon-boundary scattering when the film thickness decreases. This work not only provides fundamental insight into the thermal transport mechanisms for high-quality β-Ga 2 O 3 thin films but also facilitates the design and optimization of β-Ga 2 O 3 -based electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Electrolyte-based transistors utilizing ionic liquids/gels have been highly successful in the study of charge-density-controlled phenomena, particularly in oxides. Experimental probes beyond transport have played a significant role, despite challenges in their application in electric double-layer transistors. Here, we demonstrate the application of synchrotron soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) as operando probes of the charge state and magnetism in ion-gel-gated ferromagnetic perovskite films. Electrochemical response via oxygen vacancies at positive gate bias in LaAlO 3 (001)/La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3−δ is used as a test case. XAS/XMCD measurements of 4–25 unit-cell-thick films first probe the evolution of hole doping (from the O K -edge pre-peak) and ferromagnetism (at the Co L -edges), to establish a baseline. Operando soft XAS/XMCD of electrolyte-gated films is then demonstrated, using optimized spin-coated gels with a thickness of ∼1 μ m and a specific composition. The application of gate voltages up to +4 V is shown to dramatically suppress the O K -edge XAS pre-peak intensity and Co L -edge XMCD, thus enabling the Co valence and ferromagnetism to be tracked upon gate-induced reduction. Soft XAS and XMCD, with appropriate electrolyte design, are thus established to be viable for the operando characterization of electrolyte-gated oxides.},

Theoretical calculations and optical and magnetic measurements have suggested that λ -Ti 3 O 5 is a metal. However, its electrical transport properties have not been directly measured to date because λ -Ti 3 O 5 has so far been synthesized only as nanocrystals or aggregates thereof. In this study, we synthesized (100)-oriented λ -Ti 3 O 5 epitaxial thin films on perovskite LaAlO 3 (110) substrates by pulsed laser deposition. Precise control of oxygen supply during the growth and introduction of a MgTi 2 O 5 seed layer with a pseudobrookite structure enabled epitaxial growth of λ -Ti 3 O 5 . These λ -Ti 3 O 5 epitaxial thin films showed a lower electrical resistivity ρ (∼7.9 × 10 −2 Ω cm) than bulk single crystals of β -Ti 3 O 5 (high resistance phase) at 300 K. On the other hand, the ρ value of the λ -Ti 3 O 5 thin films exhibited a semiconducting temperature dependence with negative d ρ /d T .},

Here, we report on the effects of the resistive switching of Ge–Te/Sb–Te superlattices in the presence of an external magnetic field at elevated temperature. In addition to the unique thermal dependence of the switching behavior, a new resistance level was found. This resistance level, once initiated, could be then obtained without a magnetic field. The observed phenomena are associated with the structural reconfiguration of domains at the superlattice interfaces and grain boundaries. It has been proposed that these effects may be caused by the localization of spin-polarized electrons generated by a combination of electric and magnetic fields in the ferroelectric phase of the superlattice.},

  abstract     = {Recently, optical vortices (OVs) have attracted substantial attention because they can provide an additional degree of freedom, i.e., orbital angular momentum (OAM). It is well known that the fractional OV (FOV) is interpreted as a weighted superposition of a series of integer OVs containing different OAM states. However, methods for controlling the sampling interval of the OAM state decomposition and determining the selected sampling OAM state are lacking. To address this issue, in this Letter, we propose a FOV by inserting multiple fractional phase jumps into whole phase jumps (2π), termed as a multi-fractional OV (MFOV). The MFOV is a generalized FOV possessing three adjustable parameters, including the number of azimuthal phase periods (APPs), N ; the number of whole phase jumps in an APP, K ; and the fractional phase jump, α . The results show that the intensity and OAM of the MFOV are shaped into different polygons based on the APP number. Through OAM state decomposition and OAM entropy techniques, we find that the MFOV is constructed by sparse sampling of the OAM states, with the sampling interval equal to N . Moreover, the probability of each sampling state is determined by the parameter α , and the state order of the maximal probability is controlled by the parameter K , as K * N . This work presents a clear physical interpretation of the FOV, which deepens our understanding of the FOV and facilitates potential applications, especially for multiplexing technology in optical communication based on OAM.},

  abstract     = {Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagating on a metal–dielectric interface suffer from inevitable energy losses originating from metals, especially in a visible regime, which degrades the quality of SPP-based devices. However, if the size of the devices is sufficiently miniaturized, we can thereby limit the propagation length of the signals and effectively circumvent the problems of large propagation losses. Anderson localization is a possible approach to squeeze SPPs. In this Letter, we experimentally demonstrate the Anderson localization of SPPs at optical frequencies in two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures. By increasing the positional disorder of the silver nanohole arrays on a glass substrate, strong 2D localization of SPPs appears with an exponentially decreased electric field, reduced propagation length, and the rapid disappearance of the autocorrelation coefficient. Moreover, we manage to realize the localized SPP-exciton interactions in the 2D disordered silver nanoarrays combined with fluorescent dye molecules. Due to the disorder in the nanoarray, the collected photoluminescence from fluorescent dye molecules is enhanced by over three orders of magnitude compared to that on the silver film without nanostructures. Our study extends Anderson localization of SPPs at the visible regime to 2D disordered systems and provides a unique way to enhance light–matter interaction in SPP-based nanodevices.},

The optical system consists of two cylindrical lenses with the opposite focal length. It produces a rotating position—spatial frequency transformation of phase modulation by changing the angle between the two cylindrical lenses. With this feature, the method can flexibly measure the OAM states of the vortex beams with different beam waists. The OAM states are determined by the number and direction of dark stripes of the diffraction pattern. The measurements of the topological charge and the radial index of Laguerre–Gaussian mode are demonstrated.

A total of 12 well- and barrier-doped samples with intersubband transition energies in the range of 220–320 meV (wavelength range 3.8–5.6 μ m) were grown. The intersubband absorption lines of the m- plane samples were 10–40\% narrower than those of the a- plane samples, and a very narrow intersubband absorption linewidth of 38 meV (full width at half maximum) at a transition energy of approximately 250 meV (5 μ m wavelength) was observed in an m- plane sample. Narrower intersubband absorption linewidths of m- plane samples can be explained by more abrupt heterostructure interfaces revealed by structural characterization, which is attributed to a higher stability of the m- plane compared to the a- plane. No significant difference in the intersubband absorption linewidth was observed between the barrier- and well-doped samples.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the excited-state dynamics of hydrogen (H) atoms in flames by using a femtosecond (fs) pump-probe scheme and measuring directional emission signals. An approximately 100-fs pump pulse at 205.1 nm excites H atoms through a two-photon process (n = 3 ←← n = 1), which is followed by detection of the forward emission signals induced by a broadband fs probe pulse near 656 nm. Above a certain threshold, we observe a quadratic dependence of the emission signal on the pump laser energy. Moreover, the linewidth of the forward emission signal varies with the probe delay and the probe laser energy. This behavior can be explained in terms of superradiance. We perform a theoretical analysis and compare the experimental results with the theory, and conclude that, within the conditions of our experiment, the behavior of the atomic system involves atomic coherence, which is produced non-adiabatically and corresponds to a superradiant process. Variations in the duration of the gain time window and lifetime of the excited-state H atoms in flames are explored at different flame conditions (i.e., equivalence ratio and heights above the burner). The fs pump-probe technique demonstrated here can also be extended to characterize the time-resolved population dynamics and the corresponding collisional energy transfer rates for energy levels involved in laser-induced fluorescence detection of H atoms in flames relevant to practical combustion applications.},

Interband cascade lasers (ICLs) are power-efficient laser sources emitting in the mid-infrared range. This work unveils the low phase noise characteristics of distributed feedback ICLs driven by a battery source. We show that the measured spectral linewidth of ICLs is as narrow as 284 kHz (at a 1 ms observation time), which is smaller than those of common quantum cascade lasers. On the other hand, raising the pump current reduces the intrinsic linewidth down to 12 kHz. The linewidth broadening factor is in the range of 2.0–3.0, leading to a Schawlow–Townes linewidth as narrow as 1.6 kHz. This work suggests the high potential of developing battery-driven, high-resolution gas spectroscopy instruments using ICLs.},

However, the realization of many properties found in nature, such as switchable and hierarchical chirality, which allows electromagnetic control of the polarization of light and enhancement of mechanical properties, in man-made structures has remained a challenge. Here, we present helical structures with switchable and hierarchical chirality inspired by origami techniques. We propose eggbox-based chiral units for constructing homogeneous and heterogeneous chiral structures and demonstrate a theoretical approach for tuning the chirality of these structures by modulating their geometrical parameters and for achieving chirality switching through mechanism bifurcation. Finally, by introducing a helical tessellation between the chiral units, we design hierarchical structures with chirality transferring from construction elements to the morphological level and discover a helix with two zero-height configurations during the unwinding process. We anticipate that our design and analysis approach could facilitate the development of man-made metamaterials with chiral features, which may serve in engineering applications, including switchable electromagnetic metamaterials, morphing structures, and bionic robots.},

However, current OM technology relies on destructive mechanical methods to hold the samples, such as embedding samples in gel or attaching them to a needle to permit orientation control. A non-contacting alternative is to levitate the sample. Until now, levitation methods have lacked orientation control. We enable omnidirectional access to the sample by introducing a method to control acoustic levitation that provides precise orientation control. Such control around three axes of rotation permits rapid imaging of the sample from any direction using a fixed camera and subsequent 3D shape reconstruction. The control of non-spherical particles is achieved using an asymmetric acoustic field created with a phase-controlled transducer array. Our technology allows robust 3D imaging of delicate samples and their study in a time-lapse manner. We foresee that the described method is not limited to microscopy and optical imaging, but is also compatible with automated sample handling, light-sheet microscopy, wall-less chemistry, and non-contacting tomography.},

However, there still exist a lot of questions regarding how to understand the nonequilibrium dynamical behavior of quantum many-body systems, which are not accessible with the thermodynamic description. Experiments in quantum simulators are opening up a route toward the generation of quantum states beyond the equilibrium paradigm. As an example, in closed quantum many-body systems, dynamical quantum phase transitions act as phase transitions in time, with physical quantities becoming nonanalytic at a critical time, extending important principles such as universality to the nonequilibrium realm. Here, in a solid-state quantum simulator, we report the experimental detection of out-of-time-order correlators in the presence of nonequilibrium phase transitions with the transverse field Ising model, which are a central concept to quantify quantum information scrambling and quantum chaos. Through measuring the multiple quantum spectra, we eventually observe the buildup of quantum correlation. Further applications of this protocol could potentially enable studies of other exotic phenomena such as many-body localization and tests of the holographic duality between quantum and gravitational systems.},

When material properties are constant or slowly varying with T , a higher ZT ensures a higher maximum conversion efficiency of thermoelectric materials. However, as material properties can vary strongly with T , efficiency predictions based on ZT can be inaccurate, especially for wide-temperature applications. Moreover, although ZT values continue to increase, there has been no investigation of the relationship between ZT and the efficiency in the higher ZT regime. In this paper, we report a counterintuitive situation by comparing two materials: although one material has a higher ZT value over the whole operating temperature range, its maximum conversion efficiency is smaller than that of the other. This indicates that, for material comparisons, the evaluation of exact efficiencies as opposed to a simple comparison of ZT s is necessary in certain cases.},

Alloying high-solubility MnTe (∼15\%) leads to substitutional defects for reducing lattice thermal conductivity and band convergence for enhancing electronic performance, and thus, an improvement of thermoelectric performance of SnTe is realized. However, there is no evidence that the electronic and phonon transport properties are fully optimized in SnTe-15\%MnTe thermoelectrics, especially for the near-room-temperature (&lt; 573 K) thermoelectric performance, which still needs a sufficient promotion. Here, the substituted 2\% Bi in SnTe-15\%MnTe alloys dramatically increases the near-room-temperature zT and peak zT to ∼0.72 (at 550 K) and ∼1.3 (at 850 K), respectively. Combining the experimental evidence and the first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the prominent enhancement of electronic performance arises from the Bi-doping-driven transport valence band alignment and the carrier concentration optimization. Furthermore, the Debye–Callaway model verifies that the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity is dominated by the Bi substitutional defects. The present findings reveal the importance of transport engineering in achieving high thermoelectric performance particularly near room temperature.},

  abstract     = {The deep understanding of the electrochemical behavior of active materials is essential for the design of high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices. Herein, nanostructured FeCo 2 S 4 electrodes with different dimensional morphologies [i.e., one dimensional nanoneedles (1D FeCo 2 S 4 ), two dimensional nanosheets (2D FeCo 2 S 4 ), and three dimensional structures consisting of nanosheets grafting on nanoneedles (3D FeCo 2 S 4 )] were in situ grown on carbon cloth via a robust hydrothermal strategy. Subsequently, the electrochemical charge storage behavior of such three FeCo 2 S 4 electrodes was carefully investigated and analyzed through several electrochemical methods. It was revealed that the 3D FeCo 2 S 4 electrode exhibited a considerable higher specific capacity (92.88 mAh g −1 ) as compared with 1D (58.42 mAh g −1 ) and 2D (26.00 mAh g −1 ) electrodes at a current density of 1 A g −1 , which was mainly due to the superior charge transport characteristic from the rational combination between 1D and 2D units. Additionally, the 3D FeCo 2 S 4 electrode indicated great stability in the cycling tests (∼82\% capacity retention after 11200 cycles at 5 A g −1 ). Moreover, the quantitative calculation of the capacitive and diffusion-controlled contribution of three electrodes was performed to deep distinguish their electrochemical behavior based on different architectures. Thus, the design of 3D nanostructured electrodes will be an effective strategy to exploit high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices.},

Experiments were performed with nanocrystalline diamond films of approximate thickness 184 nm grown on glass substrates. By removing portions of the substrates after growth, suspended films with circular boundaries of radius 30–811 μ m were fabricated. Due to residual stresses, the portions of the film bonded to the substrate are of approximate compressive prestrain 11 × 10 − 4 and the suspended portions of the film are azimuthally wrinkled at their boundary. Measurements show that λ decreases monotonically with κ , and a simple model that is in line with this trend is proposed. The model can be applied to design devices with functional wrinkles and can be adapted to gain insight into other systems such as plant leaves. A method for measuring residual compressive strain in thin films, which complements standard strain characterization methods, is also described.},

  abstract     = {Condensation is significantly enhanced by condensing vapor as droplets (instead of a film), which rapidly shed-off. Electrowetting (EW)-induced coalescence and shedding of droplets have been recently shown to accelerate condensation. This work studies the influence of AC electrowetting fields on short-duration droplet shedding on hydrophobic surfaces. Experiments involve tracking the shedding of an ensemble of water droplets under the influence of EW fields, with three parameters being varied (voltage, AC frequency, and device geometry). Significant physical insights into EW-induced droplet shedding are obtained. First, EW enables almost complete removal of water (dry area fraction ∼98\%) in very short time durations (∼ 1 s). Second, while the dry area fraction does depend on the applied voltage, significant water shedding can be achieved without needing to apply voltages significantly higher than the threshold voltage. Third, the frequency of the AC waveform does not influence the dry area fraction (for voltages above the threshold voltage); however the time constant associated with droplet shedding strongly depends on the AC frequency. Fourth, the orientation of the device influences water removal due to electrostatic pinning of droplets. Importantly, the measured water removal fluxes immediately after the application of an EW field are two orders of magnitude higher than those measured over a long-duration condensation experiment; this highlights the benefits of intermittent EW fields as opposed to continuous EW fields. Overall, these results suggest that EW on hydrophobic surfaces offers benefits comparable to those offered by superhydrophobic surfaces.},

Among these materials, the well-known Si nanocrystals (NCs) have demonstrated to exhibit RS properties, which add to the wealth of phenomena that have been studied on this model material platform. In this work, we present ZnO/Si NCs/ p -Si resistive switching devices whose resistance state can be electrically read at 0 V under the application of low-power monochromatic illumination. The presented effect is studied in terms of the inner structural processes and electronic physics of the device. In particular, the creation of conductive filaments through the Si NC multilayers induces a low-resistance path for photogenerated carriers to get extracted from the device, whereas in the pristine state charge extraction is strongly quenched due to the insulating nature of the NC-embedding SiO 2 matrix. In addition, spectral inspection of the generated photocurrent allowed unveiling the role of Si NCs in the reported effect. Overall, the hereby shown results pave the way to obtain memories whose RS state can be read under low-power conditions.},

They provide insights into small variations in the density of states near the chemical potential, complementing electron transport measurements. Here, we report combined resistance and thermoelectric power measurements of vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ), a prototypical correlated electron material, under ionic-liquid (IL) gating. We show that under our gating conditions, the charge transport below the metal-to-insulator-transition (MIT) temperature remains in the thermally activated regime, while the Seebeck coefficient exhibits an apparent transition from semiconducting to metallic behavior. The contrasting behavior indicates changes in the electronic structure upon IL gating, due to the formation of oxygen defect states. The experimental results are corroborated by numerical simulations based on a model density of states incorporating a gating-induced defect band. Our study reveals thermoelectric measurements to be a convenient and sensitive probe for the role of defect states induced by IL gating in suppressing the MIT in VO 2 , which remains benign in charge transport measurements, and possibly for studying defect states in other materials.},

The magnetic anisotropy of the nanosample can be inferred through quantitatively correlating the main features in the evolution of the magnetic energy with frequency shifts in dynamic cantilever magnetometry measurements. Magnetometry data taken at 280 K exhibit hybrid magnetic anisotropy, including uniaxial anisotropy and cubic anisotropy. Low-temperature measurements further confirm the previously reported single-domain state and indicate that the cubic anisotropy is mainly magnetocrystalline anisotropy, while uniaxial anisotropy is likely to be induced by the interface between the CoFe 2 O 4 pyramid and the BiFeO 3 layer. The analysis provides an alternative interpretation for dynamic cantilever magnetometry data, which may extend the application of magnetometry.},

Various MX 2 monolayers usually show a distinct bandgap and spin-splitting size. Here, we realized the molecular beam epitaxial growth of monolayer Mo x W 1 −x Se 2 alloys with a controllable stoichiometric ratio x . Combining with the in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopic and x-ray photoemission spectroscopic measurements, we determined the evolution of the valence band dispersion and the spin-splitting size with the change in the Mo ratio x . We found that the energy difference of both the valence band between the Γ and K points and the spin-splitting size at the K point reduce monotonically with the increasing Mo ratio x . The growth of Mo x W 1 −x Se 2 monolayer alloys and the method to control the stoichiometric ratio of Mo/W atoms provide an effective way to engineer the band structures in the two-dimensional MX 2 materials.},

Here, we demonstrate an alternative way to control the binary states of ferroic orders by locally applying pressure and electric field in ferroelectric bi-domains confined in single BFO nanoislands. The study of the electronic transport properties and domain orientations using atomic force microscopy (AFM) based techniques enabled us to determine the electric and mechanical parameters at which ferroelectric and ferroelastic resistive switching can be observed. Nanoislands exhibited binary high and low resistance states without scaling effect, with high performance switching characteristics. Positive-forward rectifying behavior at high tip force was interpreted by the formation of a subsurface non-conductive interface due to the strain gradient. Ferroelastic switching at the surface was associated with a symmetry-breaking induced by electromechanical coupling between the AFM tip and the BFO thin film. It led to out-of-plane polarization pinning that allows performing only in-plane switching accompanied by nucleation and propagation of a conductive domain wall. The control of ferroic binary states by the electric field and pressure may pave the way for multilevel data storage devices.},

The leakage current density vs electric field ( J – E ) tests were conducted using the device structures with Pt top electrodes and Nb-doped SrTiO 3 bottom electrodes. The conduction mechanism of the films and the J – E characteristic that changed from the asymmetric structure to the relative symmetric structure were investigated. Analysis of the thin film leakage behavior suggests that, at low electric field, the conduction mechanisms are mainly bulk-limited Ohmic and space-charge-limited current. When the electric field is higher, the interface-limited Schottky emission and the Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling as the dominant conduction mechanism occur for the films with a thickness below 166 nm and only FN tunneling for the films with the thickness of 300 and 400 nm. In addition, the asymmetric structure is strongly dependent on the large relative value of the Schottky barrier height between the positive and negative biases. Moreover, increasing the electric field range used to generate the bulk-limited conduction behavior and decreasing the current density induced by the interface-limited conduction through increasing the film thickness are beneficial for the films to obtain a high breakdown strength and a large energy storage density, as well as excellent efficiency.},

To better understand the phase stability across the HfO 2 –ZrO 2 compositional range, we investigate the structural evolution of HZO thin films in situ via high-temperature x-ray diffraction (HTXRD) for five different compositions [ZrO 2 , (Hf 0.23 Zr 0.77 )O 2 , (Hf 0.43 Zr 0.57 )O 2 , (Hf 0.67 Zr 0.33 )O 2 , and HfO 2 ]. The real-time monitoring of HZO crystallization reveals a competing driving force between the tetragonal and monoclinic phase stabilities for HfO 2 -rich vs ZrO 2 -rich compositions. Additionally, we confirm an XRD peak shift toward lower 2 θ with increasing temperature in ZrO 2 , (Hf 0.23 Zr 0.77 )O 2 , and (Hf 0.43 Zr 0.57 )O 2 films, which we ascribe to the appearance of a metastable orthorhombic phase during heating. A monotonic trend for the onset crystallization temperature is reported for five compositions of HZO and reveals an increase in onset crystallization temperature for HfO 2 -rich compositions. Relative intensity fraction calculations suggest a higher fraction of monoclinic phase with increasing annealing temperature for (Hf 0.67 Zr 0.33 )O 2 . This study of phase stability and onset crystallization temperatures offers insight for managing the thermal budget for HZO thin films, especially for temperature-constrained processing.},

  abstract     = {The morphology of vortex lattice domains in bulk type-II/1 superconductors is of central interest for many areas such as fundamental condensed matter physics, engineering science, and the optimization of materials for high transport current superconductivity applications. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental study of a single crystal niobium in the intermediate mixed state and Shubnikov phase with two complementary neutron techniques: high resolution polarized neutron imaging and small-angle neutron scattering. In this way, we were able to identify and visualize the occurrence of compensating currents, the flux line closure, and the freezing of the vortex spacing during the process of field cooling and high field cooling. With the combination of complementary neutron techniques, it was possible to add insights into the quest for the understanding of the flux pinning and nucleation of vortices in type-II/1 superconductors during the process of field cooling and high field cooling.},

  abstract     = {We investigate electronic thermal rectification in ferromagnetic insulator-based superconducting tunnel junctions. Ferromagnetic insulators coupled to superconductors are known to induce sizable spin splitting in the superconducting density of states and also lead to efficient spin filtering if used as tunnel barriers. The combination of spin splitting and spin filtering is shown to yield a substantial amount of self-amplification of the electronic heat diode effect due to breaking of the electron-hole symmetry in the system, which is added to the thermal asymmetry of the junction. Large spin splitting and large spin polarization ( ⁠ ≳ 90\% ⁠ ) can potentially lead to thermal rectification efficiencies exceeding ∼ 5 × 10 4\% for realistic parameters in a suitable temperature range, thereby outperforming up to a factor of ∼ 250 ⁠ , the heat diode effect achievable with conventional superconducting tunnel junctions.

A fluence of 7 × 10 15 ions/cm 2 at 40 keV lead to amorphization of the Sb 2 Te 3 surface, with chromium predominantly incorporated in the amorphous layer. Heating to 200 °C caused the amorphous region to recrystallize and led to the formation of a thin chromium-rich interfacial layer. Near-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates a uniform valence state of Cr 3+ throughout, with no evidence of metallic clustering.

The transition was reasonably speculated as Γ 3 (C x , F y , A z ) → Γ 4 (G x , A y , F z ). Exchange bias effect could be found in the magnetization hysteresis loops, revealing the relationship of interaction between Fe 3+ and R 3+ (Dy 3+ and Er 3+ ) sublattices in EDFO single crystal. Additionally, when the magnetic field along the a-axis increased to 70 kOe, the magnetic phase transition took place at around 40 K, suggesting that an external field can trigger spin reorientation transition along a special axis.

It is demonstrated that the minimal energy path (MEP)—related to the thermal stability of the system—does not necessarily follow the same trajectory as the current-induced switching. The MEP can be by uniform rotation (UR) or by domain walls (DWs), whereas the current-induced switching can be by UR, DWs, or bubble formation depending on geometrical and stack parameters. The bubble formation is further affected by the direction of switching, i.e., parallel to antiparallel vs antiparallel to parallel switching. We demonstrate the existence of different regimes where the energy barrier and the figure of merit, defined as a ratio between the energy barrier and switching current, show characteristic dependencies and even optimum points depending on the device diameter and the stack parameters.

The results show that magnetic skyrmions move along the propagation direction of SWs in a specific frequency range (50–175 GHz). It is evidenced that there is a linear relationship between the response resonance frequency ( f r ) of local magnetization and the skyrmion velocity (v), and the motion of skyrmions could also be manipulated by controlling the amplitude and location of the exciting source.

Variations between devices originating from the fabrication process and inherently random physical features are detrimental to memory and logic devices; however, they are potential entropy sources for hardware security primitives. Here, we demonstrate two types of spin–orbit torque (SOT)-based reconfigurable physically unclonable functions (rPUFs) that are based on process-induced SOT switching current variations and SOT-induced domain wall (DW) nonlinear dynamics, respectively. The experimental results show that both rPUFs have excellent performance in terms of reliability and uniqueness, and the performance is sustained after reconfiguring. Furthermore, the DW nonlinear dynamics-based rPUF can be reconfigured for an unlimited number of times with high uniformity.

This is achieved by stacking two distinct ferromagnetic layers with a platinum interlayer. In this device, the orientation of the spin polarized electrons accumulated at the top and bottom interfaces of the platinum layer is switched upon changing the polarity of the direct current. As a result, the effective anti-damping required to drive large amplitude auto-oscillations can appear either at the top or bottom magnetic layer. Tuning of the auto-oscillation frequencies by several gigahertz can be achieved by combining two materials with sufficiently different saturation magnetizations. Here, we show that the combination of NiFe and CoFeB can result in 3 GHz shifts in the auto-oscillation frequencies.

To capture the full topological physics of the magnetic semiconductor under periodic driving, we adopt ab initio Wannier-based tight-binding methods for the Floquet–Bloch bands, with the light-induced bandgap closings and openings being obtained as the light field strength increases. The calculations of slabs with open boundaries show the existence of chiral edge states. Interestingly, the topological transitions with branches of chiral edge states changing from zero to one and from one to two by tuning the light amplitude are obtained, showing that the topological Floquet phase of high Chern number can be induced in the present Floquet–Bloch systems.},

Specifically, electron holography analyses reveal the spin configurations of Bloch-type, zero-field-stabilized magnetic bubbles in 20-nm-thick Fe 3 GeTe 2 nanolayers at cryogenic temperature. In situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements further provide detailed magnetic phase diagrams of noncollinear spin textures, including magnetic spirals and bubbles in Fe 3 GeTe 2 as a function of temperature, applied magnetic field, and specimen thickness. We further estimate the micromagnetic parameters of Fe 3 GeTe 2 , such as anisotropy energy density and magnetization at specific specimen temperature using the critical thicknesses measured from Lorentz microscopy measurements. Our experimental results of magnetic domain structures in Fe 3 GeTe 2 nanolayers reveal that due to their intrinsic highly uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy, a very thin film of tens of nanometers of Fe 3 GeTe 2 can support the spontaneous and stable formation of zero-field magnetic bubbles.},

From the field-dependent behavior of SMR amplitude, two distinct domain reversal mechanisms are found for those NiO films. In the epitaxial films, the conventional monodomain formation against the destressing field due to the magneto-elastic coupling is observed. On the other hand, the thermally assisted domain reversal is dominant in the polycrystalline films. Based on our thermal assisted model, the effective values of domain pinning potential and the number of spins contributing to domain reversal in polycrystalline films are determined. These values are quite important to design AF spin memory devices. This study contributes to building a method to determine the key parameters in AF spintronics with polycrystalline thin films, which are free from the lattice mismatching problem.},

Five samples are grown at various stages of conditioning of a freshly installed MOCVD tool with stainless steel gas lines. Without conditioning, Cp 2 Mg flow induced Fe and Mn impurities with concentrations of 3 × 10 15 and 3 × 10 14 cm −3 , respectively. These contaminants introduce nonradiative recombination centers with lifetimes on the order of nanoseconds. These impurities also induce indium-clustering related phenomena such as low energy shoulder at low temperature and a strong S-curve shift in emission energy with increasing temperature. Through successive cycles of chamber conditioning, the Fe and Mn concentrations decrease to below their detection limits, and the nonradiative recombination lifetime (+8 ns), internal quantum efficiency (+26\%), microphotoluminescence nonuniformity (−4.7\%), and S-curve shift (−26 meV) of the MQWs improved. The suppression of the transition metal ion contamination in the MOCVD chamber is shown to be crucial for high performance MQWs and blue light emitting diode growths.},

Employing a thin buffer layer deposited at a lower temperature (160 °C) prior to the main growth, the maximum growth temperature is elevated up to 240 °C, resulting in a significant improvement in the crystallinity as verified by sharp x-ray diffraction peaks as well as a step-and-terrace structure observed by atomic force microscopy. Optimum films show more intense free exciton emission in photoluminescence spectra than others, implying the suppression of defects. These results indicate that the fabrication process developed in this study is quite effective at realizing high-quality CuI thin films.},

  abstract     = {Amorphous Se is a well-known photoconductor from its early applications in xerography and ultra-sensitive photodetectors like the High-gain Avalanche Rushing Photoconductor (HARP) device. The established way of fabricating the photoconductor for the HARP is rotational thermal evaporation using multilayers of Se and As 2 Se 3 . However, the electronic effects of multilayering have not yet been clarified. In this report, we investigated the multilayer structure as a superlattice of Se and As 2 Se 3 fabricated using rotational evaporation and show that the superlattice structure results in the uniformization of the defect levels in the base materials. We found four energy levels associated with defects in As 2 Se 3 and three levels in amorphous Se. In comparison, the superlattice structure of the two materials shows two clear energy levels at E C , S e − 0.533 eV and E V , S e + 0.269 eV. The resulting two occupied energy levels explain the photoelectronic and transport properties observed in multilayer amorphous Se. This result “reinvents” the multilayer structure as a material with observed quantum effects, which significantly improves the material performance in photodetection.},

The temperature-dependent reverse leakage characteristics are analyzed by a numerical reverse leakage model, which includes both the image-force lowering and doping effects. We found that the reverse leakage current is near-ideal and dominated by Schottky barrier tunneling throughout the entire range of the surface electric field from 0.8 MV/cm to 3.4 MV/cm. The extracted barrier height from the reverse leakage model is consistent with the values extracted from the forward current–voltage and capacitance–voltage measurements. The practical maximum electric field, defined by the maximum allowable reverse leakage current levels, is calculated as a function of the barrier height. These results suggest that it is possible to approach the intrinsic breakdown electric field in β-Ga 2 O 3 SBDs, as long as a sufficiently high barrier height (∼2.2 to 3 eV) is employed.},

To identify the single atom materials, a combination of high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and synchrotron radiation-based extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) is typically used. However, the present work reveals that EXAFS is not sensitive enough to identify single atoms in many cases, which may easily confuse the contributions from small clusters or nanoparticles due to the polydispersity and disorder effects. Also, HAADF-STEM measures very limited regions, which may easily miss other compositions. The real catalytic sites in various reactions could be significantly different from the single atom sites due to the complicated compositions in the so-called “SACs,” which may also lead to misunderstanding of the working mechanism.},

Specifically, focused radiosity of a representative cylindrical emitter in a preferential direction is attained by optimizing the layout of high and low thermally conductive materials within the solid in combination with an angularly varying emissivity surface profile. The relationship between the multi-body view factor scene and the thermal metamaterial design is clarified by way of numerical experiments. Subsequent gradient-based co-optimization of the thermal composite confirms the working principles of the device and reveals non-intuitive material and surface coating layouts that further enhance the directional radiative intensity of the emitter. The principles are extendable to the engineering of arbitrarily shaped advanced composites for thermal protection systems, energy conservation, or spacecraft low-energy deep-space maneuvering by way of radiation/conduction heat flow control.},

However, it may be expected that the h-BN encapsulation may also affect the vibration properties of TMDs due to an atomically flat surface of h-BN layers. In order to study its effect on interlayer interactions in few-layer TMDs, we investigate low-energy Raman scattering spectra of bi- and trilayer MoTe 2 . Surprisingly, three breathing modes are observed in the Raman spectra of the structures deposited on or encapsulated in h-BN as compared to a single breathing mode for the flakes deposited on a SiO 2 /Si substrate. The shear mode is not affected by changing the MoTe 2 environment. The emerged structure of breathing modes is ascribed to the apparent interaction between the MoTe 2 layer and the bottom h-BN flake. The structure becomes visible due to a high-quality surface of the former flake. Consequently, the observed triple structure of breathing modes originates from the combination modes due to interlayer and layer–substrate interactions. Our results confirm that the h-BN encapsulation substantially affects the vibration properties of layered materials.},

The waveguide based on a triangular air-hole motif with broken inversion symmetry is fabricated from the suspended germanium layer. We observed the launching and guiding of the transverse-magnetic edge mode along the boundary between topologically distinct domains with opposite valley Chern indices.

In this work, by using a home-made strain apparatus, we obtained out-of-plane buckled cadmium selenide nanoribbons, resulting in a single-mode lasing at the curved part of the nanoribbons. Taking into consideration the bending structure of nanoribbons, we speculate that deformation-induced light confinement and strain-driven carrier&#39;s redistribution contributed mainly to the single-mode lasing. Moreover, a periodic out-of-plane bending of nanoribbons is realized by thermal controlling deformation of the elastic substrate and cadmium selenide, in which single-mode lasing at each crest part can be obtained. Our work opened an alternative avenue to realize nanoscale single-mode lasers, which was quite useful for flexible optoelectronic devices.},

These changes modify the transmittance through the metasurface, which is fabricated monolithically atop the detector, allowing for spectral control of light reaching the detector. Importantly, this structure provides a fabrication-controlled alignment of the metasurface filter to the detector pixel and is entirely solid-state. Using single pixel devices, relative changes in the spectral response exceeding 8\% have been realized.

  abstract     = {Second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy is useful for visualizing interfaces and sub-structures within a wide range of materials due to the propensity for SHG to occur in non-centrosymmetric environments. However, since SHG is a nonlinear process generally necessitating small focal sizes for higher peak powers, a raster scanning approach is usually needed to build an SHG image over a significant sample size. While raster scanning is effective, there is a cost in terms of the time needed to acquire the image and, also, some materials cannot withstand the higher optical intensities within the small focal volume. In order to address this, we describe a SHG microscopy approach based on ghost imaging (GI), which enables imaging data to be collected in parallel rather than sequentially as in raster scanning techniques. We experimentally demonstrate the approach and combine GI-SHG with compressive sensing to make further substantial gains in reducing the amount of sampling required for image reconstruction. Furthermore, GI-SHG is shown to have significant advantages for imaging in highly scattering environments, partly because GI is a background-free approach requiring spatial correlations between photons that travel two paths, with one path entirely devoid of sample interaction. This basic property of GI means that only the photons that travel unimpeded through the sample preserve the spatial correlations needed to reconstruct the image, while more scattered photons do not contribute to the overall GI signal. Finally, we compare the image quality and sampling properties of three different reconstruction algorithms used for compressive sensing.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting quantum devices provide excellent connectivity and controllability, while semiconductor spin qubits stand out with their long-lasting quantum coherence, fast control, and potential for miniaturization and scaling. In the last few years, remarkable progress has been made in combining superconducting circuits and semiconducting devices into hybrid quantum systems that benefit from the physical properties of both constituents. Superconducting cavities can mediate quantum-coherent coupling over long distances between electronic degrees of freedom such as the spin of individual electrons on a semiconductor chip and, thus, provide essential connectivity for a quantum device. Electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots have reached very long coherence times and allow for fast quantum gate operations with increasing fidelities. We summarize recent progress and theoretical models that describe superconducting–semiconducting hybrid quantum systems, explain the limitations of these systems, and describe different directions where future experiments and theory are headed.},

  abstract     = {In current long-distance communications, classical information carried by large numbers of particles is intrinsically robust to some transmission losses but can, therefore, be eavesdropped without notice. On the other hand, quantum communications can provide provable privacy and could make use of entanglement swapping via quantum repeaters to mitigate transmission losses. To this end, considerable effort has been spent over the last few decades toward developing quantum repeaters that combine long-lived quantum memories with a source of indistinguishable single photons. Multiple candidate optical spin qubits in the solid state, including quantum dots, rare-earth ions, and color centers in diamond and silicon carbide (SiC), have been developed. In this perspective, we give a brief overview on recent advances in developing optically active spin qubits in SiC and discuss challenges in applications for quantum repeaters and possible solutions. In view of the development of different material platforms, the perspective of SiC spin qubits in scalable quantum networks is discussed.},

  abstract     = {Thin films of two-dimensional MXene (Ti 3 C 2 T x ) are evaluated in terms of their conductivity over the radio frequency (RF) range of 1–10 GHz using a custom designed test fixture. A contactless method is developed for extracting the conductivity of MXene films of various thickness (1.0–4.3 μm) at RF frequencies. Open ended MXene transmission lines with various thicknesses are spray-coated on polyethylene terephthalate substrates capacitively coupled to a copper transmission line test fixture realized on a RT/duroid (filled polytetrafluoroethylene composite laminate) substrate to provide solderless repeatable RF connection. The extraction process is based on the least squares error method of curve fitting to minimize the difference between the full wave numerically simulated scattering parameters and the measured values of the test circuit for various samples. RF characterization was performed for three MXene samples, with thicknesses of about 1.0, 1.5, and 4.3 μ m to extract the corresponding conductivity. Moreover, MXene performance was compared against copper and graphite films. The highest conductivity of 1.2 × 10 6 S/m was extracted for the 4.3 μm thick Ti 3 C 2 T x film. The extracted MXene conductivity is used to predict the quality factor and efficiency of antennas. This study suggests that MXene films are attractive for RF applications and can be used as conductive layers on 3D-printed RF circuits.},

The radial basis function algorithm is employed to reconstruct the magnetic field from the contour lines.

Our method utilizes the size-dependent fluid rheology- and inertia-induced lift forces that first align larger particles along the sidewalls of the straight uniform channel section and then drive them toward the microscale vortices developed inside the cavity because of the fluid shear thinning effect. It works effectively at the Reynolds number that is one order of magnitude smaller than the reported inertial vortex trapping for similar-sized particles. Our proposed particle trapping and sorting method in shear thinning fluids will be useful for applications processing medium-volume samples, which may fill the gap between the high-throughput inertial vortex-based passive technique and the usually low-throughput external force-based active techniques.},

  abstract     = {A distinctive feature of hybrid perovskite light-absorbing materials is the non-negligible ionic conductivity influencing photovoltaic performance and stability. Moving ions or vacancies can naturally accumulate at the outer interfaces (electrode polarization) upon biasing. Contrary to that approach, a modulation of conductive or recombination properties could manifest as an alteration in the low-frequency part of the impedance response, either producing inductive or large capacitive features. Under this last view, capacitances are not the response of polarized structures or charging mechanisms, but result from the modulation of currents. This work intends to provide pieces of evidence that assist us in distinguishing between these two dissimilar mechanisms, namely, real charge polarization and delayed current effects under bias in the dark. The analysis relays upon an experimental technique based on transient charging signals using the Sawyer-Tower circuit. Instead of applying an alternating small perturbation over a steady-state voltage (differential capacitance method), transient charging measures the resulting polarization upon a large bias step under the suppression of dc currents. Our findings reveal that real steady-state charge is indeed induced by the applied voltage in the dark, easily interpreted by means of charged real capacitors with values much larger than the geometrical capacitance of the film. The connection between that polarization and the charging of perovskite/contact interfaces is highlighted.},

The switch consists of a suspended diaphragm with electric moving coil and a magnetic field, shunted by an essentially passive analog circuit. We show that electrically mediated damping is extremely large, and its mechanism as a powerful wave stopper can be very broadband, which contrasts with most resonance-based devices in the literature. We also show that a serial shunt capacitor introduces a mechanical mass that softens the diaphragm spring at low frequencies, while a shunt inductance is an electromagnetic spring that pacifies mechanical inertia at high frequencies. By manipulating the dynamic mass, stiffness, and damping electronically to enhance or defy the mass law and stiffness law, a switch effective in over one octave and working at a deep subwavelength scale is realized, and the maximum switch ratio is as high as 28 dB. As circuits can be miniaturized and easily tuned, these illustrated physics point to a versatile tool for digital control of sound waves.},

In this paper, we propose a method to extract the bandgap of black phosphorus using capacitance measured at various temperatures and frequencies. From the transition frequency or transition temperature, where C–V changes from high-frequency to low-frequency behavior, we can extract the bandgap information. Using this method, we extracted the bandgap of black phosphorus with a thickness of 50 nm to be 0.30 eV. For comparison, we also extracted the bandgap of black phosphorus using minimum conductance and threshold voltage methods, and the results are consistent with those of the C–V method. This C–V method can overcome the wavelength limitation of the photoluminescence measurement and spatial resolution limitation of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Another advantage of this C–V method is that the extracted bandgap is unaffected by the contact resistance and device area, making it reliable and convenient in determining the bandgap of narrow bandgap materials.},

  abstract     = {Thickness-dependent bandgap and carrier mobility of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials make them a promising material as a phototransistor that detects light signals and converts them to electrical signals. Thus far, to achieve a high photoresponsivity of 2D materials, enormous efforts have been made via material and dielectric engineering, as well as modifying device structure. Nevertheless, understanding the effect of interplay between the thickness and the carrier mobility to photoresponsivity is little known. Here, we demonstrate the tunable photoresponsivity (R) of 2D multilayer rhenium disulfide (ReS 2 ), which is an attractive candidate for photodetection among 2D vdW materials owing to its layer-independent direct bandgap and decoupled vdW interaction. The gate bias (V G )-dependent photocurrent generation mechanism and R are presented for the channel thickness range of 1.7–27.5 nm. The high similarity between V G -dependent photocurrent and transconductance features in the ReS 2 phototransistors clearly implies the importance of the channel thickness and the operating V G bias condition. Finally, the maximum R was found to be 4.1 × 10 5 A/W at 14.3 nm with the highest carrier mobility of ∼15.7 cm 2 ⋅V −1 ⋅s −1 among the fabricated devices after excluding the contact resistance effect. This work sheds light on the strategy of how to obtain the highest R in 2D vdW-based phototransistors.},

It is shown that, at low temperature (&lt;160 K), a semiconductor depletion forms in Ge near the interface, resulting in an increase in coercive voltage by about 2 V, accompanied by a distortion of the ferroelectric hysteresis with subloop asymmetric behavior, which becomes more severe at higher frequencies of measurement. At higher temperatures, the Ge surface near the ferroelectric is easily inverted due to the low energy gap of Ge, providing sufficient screening of the polarization charge by minority free carriers, in which case, nearly ideal, symmetric hysteresis curves are recovered. The depolarization field is experimentally extracted from the coercive voltage and the capacitance measurements, is found to be ∼ 2.2 MV/cm in the low temperature range, comparable to the coercive field, then rapidly decreases at higher temperatures, and effectively diminishes at room temperature. This makes Ge MFSs good candidates for FeFETs for low voltage non-volatile memory with improved reliability.},

To understand more about this system and to explore features that might contribute to these remarkable functional properties, we have mapped the polarization microstructure on the nanoscale using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) (scan sizes less than 700 nm). Our study reveals an extremely fine-scale pattern, with individual domains typically 20–50 nm in size, all of which exhibit both out-of-plane and in-plane polarization components. In-plane vector PFM polarization maps show strongly charged quadrant-lattice domain arrays with fourfold domain wall junctions (vertices). The existence of fourfold vertices in ferroelectrics is rare but can be explained via the “Ashkin-Teller” model, in which very large interfacial lattice mismatch strains and local electric fields play a role. This ultra-tetragonal ferroelectric system was expected to contain straightforward c-axis out-of-plane 180° domains, but instead shows an extremely rich nanoscale domain tiling pattern; these unusual nanodomains may be important in facilitating the extremely high switchable polarization values previously reported.},

With the applied electric field, the pseudo-cubic relaxor phase reversibly transforms to a ferroelectric state. The reversibility is still preserved after 10 4 bipolar electric field cycles. A Rietveld refinement with a structure, strain, and texture analysis using a model based on the atomic scale was applied for four frequencies from 10 −4 to 10 1 Hz. The analysis allowed us to separately determine the two coexisting phases, their electric field dependent evolution, and the underlying strain mechanisms. For all the applied frequencies, we showed that domain switching is the only strain mechanism appearing in the tetragonal phase and the lattice strain is the only mechanism in the rhombohedral phase. The coercive field of the tetragonal phase (4 kV/mm) is found to be higher than that of the rhombohedral phase (3 kV/mm). This divergence has not been observed in previously investigated lead-containing materials and cannot be detected solely using macroscopic strain and polarization experiments. Moreover, the domain strain abruptly starts to occur only after a threshold field value and exhibits high hysteresis. The lattice strain, on the other hand, starts nearly from the beginning and increases more linearly during the bipolar field cycle. It could, therefore, be demonstrated that complex structural mechanisms underlie the apparent clear and continuous macroscopic strain curve. These findings are crucial for all actuator materials undergoing a relaxor to ferroelectric phase transformation and provide approaches and strategies to optimize lead-free materials for tailored applications.},

  abstract     = {Adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic is a highly energy-efficient superconductor logic family. Traditionally, AQFP circuits have relied on the four-phase clocking scheme, which uses a pair of ac current sources with a 90° phase difference. The operation of each logic gate thus takes a quarter clock cycle, leading to a relatively long latency for some applications. In this Letter, we propose a low-latency clocking scheme for AQFP logic based on microwave power dividers (PDs). The whole circuit is powered by a single excitation current, which is equally split for each logic stage by a serial-type PD. As a result, the latency between adjacent logic stages is determined by the transmission line length (propagation delay) inside the PD, which can be much shorter than a quarter clock cycle. Note that the low-latency performance is independent of the horizontal length of the AQFP circuit, and thus, the proposed clocking scheme is applicable to large-scale designs where a large number of gates are horizontally placed in a single stage. For validation, several numerical simulations are conducted and a six-stage AQFP test circuit is demonstrated using the proposed power-dividing clocking scheme (with a designed latency of 20 ps per gate) at a temperature of 4.2 K.},

Using a single frequency radiation source allows us to measure the frequency response of the FP around 350 GHz and deduce its losses. We show that the loss is dominated by radiation loss inside the CPW line that forms the FP and that it decreases with the decreasing linewidth and increasing kinetic inductance as expected. The results can be quantitatively understood using SONNET simulations. The lowest loss is observed for a CPW with a total width of 6 μ m and corresponds to a Q-factor of ≈ 15 000 ⁠ .},

  abstract     = {The modulation of antiferromagnetic (AFM) material and thermal annealing treatment on the magnetic damping of various AFM/CoFeB (CFB) samples have been systematically studied with the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. It is found the saturated magnetic damping factor α s increases considerably after introducing a thin MnIr or MnPt AFM layer. As a thin Al spacer of t Al = 0–2 nm is inserted, α s is found to decrease rapidly, reaching nearly the same value as that of the single CFB film at t Al = 2 nm. The result suggests that the AFM layer is not a good spin sink material and the surprisingly strong decrease in the damping factor is mainly attributed to the reduced direct exchange coupling between CoFe and Mn spins at the AFM/FM interface. Moreover, in spite of the exchange bias effect occurring or not, a similar monotonic increasing trend of α s with the increasing AFM layer thickness is observed for the as-deposited and annealed AFM/CFB samples, indicating that the enhanced magnetic damping at an elevated annealing temperature is mainly related to the increased interface roughness and atomic diffusion. These findings provide deeper insights into the role of the AFM/FM interface in magnetization dynamics, which will be helpful for future spintronic applications.},

  abstract     = {The suppression of a thermally excited electron-spin relaxation in InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) using p-doped capping layers toward enhanced room-temperature (RT) spin polarization has been demonstrated, in which the electron-spin polarization in QD excited states (ESs) was measured through time-resolved spin-dependent photoluminescence. We revealed that the p-doping of QDs can enhance the emission intensity of QD-ES by approximately twofold to threefold over a wide temperature range. An electron-spin relaxation time of 106 ps was observed at 293 K for p-doped QDs, which is approximately three times longer than the radiative lifetime of 36 ps, relative to the shorter electron-spin relaxation time of 71 ps for undoped QDs. The increased electron-spin lifetime was mainly attributed to the suppressed relaxation of the electron spin reinjected from the p-doped capping barrier after thermal escape from an ES, where the D&#39;yakonov-Perel&#39; spin relaxation in the barrier was potentially weakened through impurity scattering. These results suggest that InGaAs QDs with p-doped capping layers have a significant advantage for use in spin-functional optical active layers with a higher spin polarization toward RT.},

To best isolate the measured transport to the superlattice, device fabrication entails flip-chip bonding and backside device processing to remove the substrate material and deposit contact metal directly to the bottom of an etched mesa. High-resolution mobility spectrum analysis is used to calculate the conductance contribution and corrected mixed vertical-lateral mobility of the two carrier species present. Combining the latter with lateral mobility results from in-plane magnetotransport measurements on identical superlattice material allows for the calculation of the true vertical majority electron and minority hole mobilities; amplitudes of 4.7 × 10 3 cm 2 /V s and 1.60 cm 2 /V s are determined at 77 K, respectively. The temperature-dependent results show that vertical hole mobility rapidly decreases with decreasing temperature due to trap-induced localization and then hopping transport, whereas vertical electron mobility appears phonon scattering-limited at high temperature, giving way to interface roughness scattering at low temperatures, analogous to the lateral electron mobility but with a lower overall magnitude.},

These observations clearly demonstrated that reductions in the carrier density were correlated with the extent of PID. Depth profile measurements showed that the solar cells were affected by PID to a significant depth of approximately 90 μ m, equal to almost half the cell thickness. This result suggests that the Na + migration is readily induced by the application of a high voltage. Super-higher-order-SNDM was also employed to obtain a more precise analysis of the depletion layer distributions in monocrystalline silicon solar cells with and without the application of a high voltage. The data showed that the depletion layer of a sample without PID was thinner than that of a sample exhibiting PID, indicating that the carrier concentration in the former sample was higher. This finding was in good agreement with the results produced by direct quantitative dopant measurements using SNDM.},

Step-flow growth mode, resulting in smooth film surfaces and high crystalline quality, could only be achieved if the diffusion length on the film surface corresponds approximately to the width of the terraces. Otherwise, 2D islands or step-bunching is obtained, which results in a deteriorated crystalline quality and reduced Hall mobility of the electrons. By varying the growth parameters such as the O 2 /Ga ratio, Ar push gas flow, and chamber pressure, the diffusion length could be adjusted so that step-flow growth mode could be achieved at all miscut angles. Furthermore, the growth rate could remarkably be increased from 1.6 nm/min to 4.3 nm/min. For homoepitaxial β -Ga 2 O 3 films grown in step-flow growth mode, TEM measurements revealed a high crystalline quality, which is correlated with a high Hall mobility of 131 cm 2 /V s at a carrier concentration of 1.6 × 10 17 cm −3 , which is comparable with β -Ga 2 O 3 single crystal bulk values. This study clearly points out the high potential of β -Ga 2 O 3 films for high performance MOSFETs if the influence of the deposition parameters on the structural and electrical properties is well understood.},

Here, we demonstrate the low-temperature (120–350 °C) synthesis of nanocrystalline p- and n-type Si 1− x Ge x ( x : 0–1) layers using the layer exchange technique with a Zn catalyst. Pure Zn formed p-type SiGe layers (hole concentration: 10 20 cm −3 for x ≥ 0.8) due to the shallow acceptor level of Zn in Ge. Conversely, As-doped Zn allowed us to synthesize n-type SiGe layers (electron concentration: 10 19 cm −3 for x ≤ 0.3) at the lowest ever temperature of 350 °C, owing to the self-organized As doping to SiGe during layer exchange. The resulting p-type Si 0.2 Ge 0.8 and n-type Si 0.85 Ge 0.15 layers exhibited the largest ever power factors (280 μ W/mK 2 for the p-type and 15 μ W/mK 2 for the n-type), for SiGe fabricated on a flexible plastic sheet.

In order to achieve high stability and excellent electrical performance simultaneously even in high ionizing radiation damage ambient, different concentrations of tungsten dopant have been introduced for the TFT device fabrication. It is interesting that the high energy ionizing radiation may significantly increase the conductivity and influence the total concentration of oxygen vacancy in the transparent amorphous oxide semiconductor material, which may be completely different from the traditional radiation damage effect for silicon based CMOS devices. However, that abnormal phenomenon will be effectively suppressed by the powerful carrier suppressor, tungsten, which may have a high oxygen bond dissociation energy. Therefore, IWO devices with a 4\% tungsten oxide dopant might be the optimized result even after high dosage ionizing radiation exposure. Hence, it may provide a promising radiation hardness approach to improve both the electrical characteristics and reliability for next generation displays, which can be used in the control system of nuclear power generation or space technology.},

  abstract     = {NbO 2 is a promising candidate for resistive switching devices due to an insulator-metal transition above room temperature, which is related to a phase transition from a distorted rutile structure to an undistorted one. However, the electrical resistivity of the NbO 2 thin films produced so far has been too low to achieve high on-off switching ratios. Here, we report on the structural, electrical, and optical characterization of single-crystalline NbO 2 (001) thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition on MgF 2 (001) substrates. An annealing step reduced the full width at half maximum of the NbO 2 (004) x-ray Bragg reflection by one order of magnitude, while the electrical resistivity of the films increased by two orders of magnitude to about 1 kΩcm at room temperature. Temperature-dependent resistivity measurements of an annealed sample revealed that below 650 K, two deep-level defects with activation energies of 0.25 eV and 0.37 eV dominate the conduction, while above 650 K, intrinsic conduction prevails. Optical characterization by spectroscopic ellipsometry and by absorption measurements with the electric field vector of the incident light perpendicular to the c -axis of the distorted rutile structure indicates the onset of fundamental absorption at about 0.76 eV at room temperature, while at 4 K, the onset shifts to 0.85 eV. These optical transitions are interpreted to take place across the theoretically predicted indirect bandgap of distorted rutile NbO 2 .},

We performed computational fluid dynamics modeling to study the effect of the carrier gas choice on the thermal profile within the reactor and how that influences the degree of AsH 3 decomposition. The modeling suggests that the lower thermal conductivity of the nitrogen carrier gas minimizes the amount of AsH 3 that thermally decomposes before reaching the wafer surface and the heavier atomic mass decreases the likelihood that AsH 3 will reach the heated reactor walls, leading to a growth rate enhancement relative to the hydrogen carrier case in a hydride-enhanced growth regime.},

In the one-dimensional (1D) regime with only one subband in the QPC, the in-plane g* perpendicular to the current is evidently larger than the parallel one. The in-plane anisotropy can be attributed to the Rashba spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in the narrow confinement. The reason that the anisotropy can be observed in this work, but not in conventional III–V semiconductors studied previously, is due to the fact that the Al 0.25 Ga 0.75 N/GaN-based QPCs have larger polarization-field-induced Rashba SOC and much stronger 1D constriction.},

In this paper, we report a facile method to break the superstructure of ZrV 2 O 7 for realizing the NTE property of ZrV 2 O 7 to room temperature by partial substitution of Mo for V atoms. The detailed structure information and the phase transition process are revealed by high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, and high pressure Raman spectral analyses. It is found that the incorporation of Mo prompts the V-O2-V/Mo angles to expand from 160° to 180°, which enables the NTE property at room temperature. Different from most open framework structures where NTE is dominated by low energy phonons, here several high energy phonon modes are found to have negative Grüneisen parameters and contribute to the negative thermal expansion.},

They can form a lattice state due to competing magnetic interactions and are commonly found in a small region of the temperature—magnetic field phase diagram. Recent work has demonstrated that these magnetic quasi-particles fluctuate at the μ eV energy scale. Here, we use a coherent x-ray correlation method at an x-ray free-electron laser to investigate these fluctuations in a magnetic phase coexistence region near a first-order transition boundary where fluctuations are not expected to play a major role. Surprisingly, we find that the relaxation of the intermediate scattering function at this transition differs significantly compared to that deep in the skyrmion lattice phase. The observation of a compressed exponential behavior suggests solid-like dynamics, often associated with jamming. We assign this behavior to disorder and the phase coexistence observed in a narrow field-window near the transition, which can cause fluctuations that lead to glassy behavior.},

In this work, we investigate the coupling of polarization orientations of the ferroelectric BaTiO 3 layers sandwiching the metallic SrRuO 3 layer with different thicknesses. Measured by the electric field for switching the polarization orientation of the upper BaTiO 3 , it is found that the coupling of the polarization orientations increases as the SrRuO 3 thickness decreases and the interaction length is determined to be 8 monolayers of SrRuO 3 . The transport properties of the SrRuO 3 layer sensitively depend on the parallel/antiparallel orientation configuration of BaTiO 3 , with the resistivity changing by as much as 250\% for the 6-monolayer sample. This work provides the fundamental knowledge of ferroelectric interactions in oxide sandwich structures toward their potential applications of nonvolatile memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Fe 3 O 4 films on Si substrates have been intensively studied for the realization of resistance random access memory composed of only ubiquitous elements. The biggest issue for the application of Fe 3 O 4 film/Si in small-scaled devices is the low Off/On resistance ratio. For the enhancement of the Off/On resistance ratio, we propose epitaxial Fe 3 O 4 films including hemispherical small metal α-FeSi 2 nanocrystals on Si substrates, where an electric field is concentrated at the interface between Fe 3 O 4 /α-FeSi 2 . The concentrated electric field largely promotes the movement of oxygen ions, contributing to resistive switching. As a result, the Fe 3 O 4 films including hemispherical small α-FeSi 2 nanocrystals exhibit the largest Off/On resistance ratio (∼200) in Fe 3 O 4 -based nanomaterials. Finite element method simulations proved that the introduction of metal nanocrystals into films caused the enhancement of electric field intensity near the interface between nanocrystals and films. This significant enhancement method will open an avenue for realizing high-performance ubiquitous-element resistive switching materials in the next-generation information society.},

  abstract     = {Recent experimental studies have revealed an unusual temperature dependence of the radiative recombination rate in polar InGaN/GaN quantum wells. We show, by direct atomistic evaluation of the radiative recombination rate, that the experimentally observed trend of an increasing rate with increasing temperature results from the population of energetically higher lying electron and hole states with dipole matrix elements larger than those of the band edge states relevant to low temperature studies. Given that the overall evolution of this recombination rate is tightly linked to the energetic distribution of localized states, we investigate the hole density of states and absorption spectra. Based on the calculated absorption spectra, Stokes shift energies are extracted for InGaN quantum wells with In contents ranging from 5\% to 25\%. Here, good agreement with experimental literature results is found. We provide also hole tail state characteristic energies as a function of the In content, a quantity that indicates the localization character of the ensemble of hole states and which serves often as a key component in modified continuum-based models to capture carrier localization effects in transport or optical gain calculations.},

Optical characterization at room temperature demonstrates a 5.8-fold enhancement of Er luminescence due to coupling to the cavity mode of the 2D-PC nanocavities. This enhancement of Er luminescence is supported by a finite-difference time domain simulation where an enhancement of 4.1 times is found, which is in reasonable agreement with the observed experimental results.

However, the transport of information encoded in the phase through a standard MMF has not been achieved due to strong mode coupling, hindering direct data transfer using light beams endowed with orbital angular momentum (OAM). Here, we present a computational light field imaging technique to achieve OAM-multiplexed transmission through a commercial MMF. Such a technique enables the retrieval of the incident field from the speckle intensity at the distant end of the fiber. Based on the recovered field, the extraction of the transferred data by addressing all the OAM channels can be achieved. Experimentally, light field imaging through a MMF is demonstrated by recovering a structured light field and a phase picture. For optical transmission, the crosstalk between OAM channels is tested first, and then we demonstrate high-fidelity image data transfer via 24 multiplexed OAM channels through a commercial MMF.},

The system consists of a 3D microwave cavity and a gallium arsenide optomechanical crystal, which has been placed in the microwave electric field maximum. This allows the microwave cavity to actuate the gigahertz-frequency mechanical breathing mode in the optomechanical crystal through the piezoelectric effect, which is then read out using a telecom optical mode. The gallium arsenide optomechanical crystal is a good candidate for low-noise microwave-to-telecom transduction, as it has been previously cooled to the mechanical ground state in a dilution refrigerator.

Herein, we show a significantly improved thermoelectric performance in p-type SnTe through NaBiTe 2 alloying, by which carrier concentration optimization, band structure engineering, and thermal conductivity reduction are simultaneously realized.

  abstract     = {Solid-state materials containing rotatable polyanions, such as B 12 H 12 2 − ⁠ , constitute a peculiar class of ionic conductors due to their unique transport behavior, where rotating polyanions promote phase transitions to disordered phases with several orders of magnitude enhancement in cation conductivities. A major drawback is the high temperature required to activate rotation and thereby low conductivities at room temperature. Here, we elucidate a mechanism to drastically reduce the temperature based on the use of pseudorotation in high-H coordination hydride complexes. We demonstrate this mechanism for an existing complex transition metal hydride Li 5 MoH 11 containing MoH 9 3 − ⁠ , and we present a strong potential of this material to unprecedentedly exhibit a high lithium ion conductivity of 7.9 × 10 –2 S cm −1 at room temperature.},

  abstract     = {Monodisperse lipid-coated microbubbles are a promising avenue to unlock the full potential of ultrasound contrast agents for medical diagnosis and therapy. However, their formation by microfluidic flow-focusing is non-trivial. The lipid monolayer shell around the freshly formed bubbles is initially loosely packed, resulting in gas exchange between bubbles through Ostwald ripening, eventually leading to the formation of large, potentially thrombogenic, foam bubbles. Here, we show that by formulating a gas mixture of a low- and a high-aqueous solubility gas, a microbubble suspension can be formed that is not only monodisperse and highly stable, but it can also be synthesized without foam bubble formation at clinically relevant concentrations. The optimal gas volume fraction and resulting gas composition of the stable bubbles are modeled and were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data. This physics approach to an interfacial chemistry problem therefore opens a route to bedside production of stable, safe, and readily injectable monodisperse bubbles for medical applications.},

These performance enhancements are attributed to the localization of the conductive region after using a dual layer with different defect concentrations. Moreover, the W/AlOx/AlOy/Pt memristor exhibits stable III-bit multilevel storage capability by varying the amplitude of negative pulses.

In this work, we investigate and experimentally demonstrate the application of this concept to enable subthermionic ISFETs with enhanced current sensitivity and low power operation.

In order to quantify the interface states, we measured the parallel conductance of the ReRAM devices as a function of frequency, which gives an accurate picture of the spread of D it along the bandgap of silicon. Analysis of interface state density before and after the breakdown process reveals that the Si ⟨111⟩ surface is more prone to generate defects than Si ⟨100⟩ surfaces, and its elucidation is done by analyzing the pre-breakdown current behavior of the devices. Finally, the influence of the interface states on the thickness scaling is shown, where the thinner devices are inclined to have an earlier breakdown (Set voltage) due to the strong coupling with interface states.},

The graphene layer is then grown on top of it by large-scale chemical vapor deposition. A step-by-step study, including structural and magnetic analyses by x-ray diffraction and Kerr microscopy, shows that the measured FePd properties are preserved after the graphene deposition process. This scheme provides a graphene protected perpendicular spin electrode showing resistance to oxidation, atomic flatness, stable crystallinity, and perpendicular magnetic properties. This, in turn, opens the way to the generalization of hybrid 2D-materials on optimized PMA platforms, sustaining the development of spintronics circuits based on perpendicular spin-sources as required, for instance, for perpendicular-magnetic random-access memory schemes.},

In this study, the incorporation of a small amount of MgO nanoparticles, i.e., 5 wt.\% MgO nanofillers, was proven to effectively improve the degradation of pure PVDF in the charge–discharge cycling test. The PVDF-5 wt.\% MgO nanocomposites showed excellent stability after 1500 charge–discharge cycles at room temperature and 50 °C. Using the pulsed electro-acoustic method, the space charge suppression effect was observed in PVDF-5 wt.\% MgO nanocomposites, which indicated that there was no distortion in the local electric field and helped enhance breakdown strength. At the same time, dielectric loss and AC conductivity were also significantly reduced, particularly at elevated temperatures.

However, it has been discovered that the electromechanical response originates not only from piezoelectricity but also from other factors such as the electrostatic effect. In this study, we explore the dependence of off-field PFM hysteresis loops on the surface-potential-induced electrostatic effect in a prototypical ferroelectric thin film by applying an external voltage to the bottom electrode during the measurement. We simplify the situation by equating the surface potential to the direct current voltage waveform variations and predicting the contribution of the surface-potential-induced electrostatic effect to the PFM hysteresis loops. The experimental results approximately match our prediction—the coercive voltage linearly decreases with the surface potential, whereas the saturated amplitude and piezoresponse remain nearly constant owing to the relatively large piezoelectric coefficient of the ferroelectric thin film.},

The ferrimagnetic ordering temperature and magnetic anisotropy are retained even after proton irradiation. From the fluence dependence of magnetization, electron paramagnetic resonance spectral parameters (g-value and signal width), and Raman data, we show that the magnetic exchange interactions (Mn–Te–Mn) are significantly modified at this fluence.

The latter is electrically detectable and can be used to identify these magnons. Considering two disks coupled via the dipole interaction, angular momentum tunneling is demonstrated. The predictions are based on a transparent analytical model and are confirmed by full numerical simulations. As the orbital angular momentum of the magnon is robust to damping, the current findings endorse the potential of twisted magnons for two-dimensional planar integrated spin-wave circuits.},

  abstract     = {Circular photogalvanic currents are a promising approach for spin-optoelectronics. To date, such currents have been induced in topological insulator flakes or extended films. It is not clear whether they can be generated in nanodevices. In this paper, we demonstrate the generation of circular photogalvanic currents in Bi 2 Se 3 nanowires. Each nanowire shows topological surface states. Here, we generate and distinguish the different photocurrent contributions via the driving light wave. We separate the circular photogalvanic currents from those due to thermal Seebeck effects through controlling laser light polarization. The results reveal a spin-polarized surface-Dirac electron flow in the nanowires arising from spin-momentum locking and spin–orbit effects. The second photocurrent contribution described in this Letter is caused by the thermal Seebeck effect. By scanning the photocurrent, it can be spatially resolved; upon reversing the gradient direction along the nanowire, the photocurrent changes its sign, and close to the gold contacts, the amplitudes of the different photocurrent contributions are affected by the proximity to the contacts. In the center of the nanowires, where the effects from the gold contact/topological insulator stacks vanish, the spin-polarized current remains constant along the nanowires. This allows the all-optical spin current generation in topological insulator nanowires and hybrid structures on the nanoscale, one goal of spin-orbitronics.},

However, compared to a single-interface CoFeB/MgO MTJ, its more complicated film stacks and interfaces are more vulnerable to irradiation-induced swift heavy ions. We have studied the irradiation effects of Ta/Kr ions on double-interface CoFeB/MgO MTJs. Structural and physical analyses are performed through transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry. 1907 MeV Ta-ion irradiation damages the interfaces of the double-interface MTJ, resulting in the irreversible decrease in coercivity, while 2060 MeV Kr-ion irradiation damages the bulk properties of the MTJ, leading to the decrease in saturation magnetization. However, the electronic properties of the double-interface MTJ are almost immune to Kr-ion irradiation.},

This study shows that Al-assisted in situ deoxidation is effective in removing native oxides on AlN, providing a clean surface to enable homoepitaxial growth of AlN and its heterostructures; furthermore, it is more attractive over thermal deoxidation, which needs to be conducted at much higher temperatures due to the strong bonding strength of native oxides on AlN.},

We perform first-principles calculations to find that the non-dispersive nature of the valence band maximum with a Mexican-hat-like band in monolayer α -PbO can be as a prototype to realize either ferromagnetism or ferroelasticity under p -type doping. Remarkably, a multiferroic phase coexisting with ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity can be obtained for hole densities in the range of 1.22–3.48 × 10 14 cm −2 . Also, the Curie temperature, structural stability, and exfoliation energy of α -PbO are discussed.

In situ reflection high energy electron diffraction and detailed scanning transmission electron microscopy studies confirm the epitaxial registry of the AlN epilayer with the underlying template. Detailed studies further suggest that the large-scale parallel epitaxial relationship for the AlN epilayer grown on graphene with the underlying template is driven by the strong surface electrostatic potential of AlN. The realization of high-quality AlN by van der Waals epitaxy is further confirmed through the demonstration of AlGaN deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes operating at ∼260 nm, which exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 4\% for an unpackaged device.

The targeted material is hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) that is in high demand for electronic and optoelectronic applications. The synthesis of high crystalline quality h-BN films over large areas still remains a challenge. In this study, a nanosecond pulsed high voltage is applied between two electrodes separated by a dielectric layer, with the whole system being drilled by a 400 μ m diameter hole (micro hollow cathode structure). This geometry allows for an efficient dissociation of N 2 gas, a particularly important asset for the synthesis of nitride materials, which normally requires very high deposition temperatures (∼1300 °C). In this work, we report the growth of h-BN on 2-in. silicon substrates at temperatures below 1000 °C, with a growth rate of about 30 nm/h, using this approach. The deposited films are characterized by Raman and electron energy loss spectroscopies and transmission electron microscopy to evaluate the phase purity, the quality, the surface morphology, and the crystallinity of the material. The films exhibit a stoichiometry very close to 1 with a crystalline domain size of about 3 nm.},

  abstract     = {The temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) was systematically investigated in La (Fe, Al) 13 compounds with an Al atomic content from 3.40 to 3.70. We find that the local extremum of the TCR is obtained in LaFe 9.45 Al 3.55 , which is −20.914 ppm/K over 5–300 K. It is rare for TCR to stay at such a low level over such a wide temperature range below 300 K. Our work revealed that all compounds remain the same structure of cubic NaZn 13 -type (space group: F m 3 ¯ c ⁠ ) based on synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) tests. The magnetization–temperature curves indicate that all samples are ferromagnet. We analyzed the effect of structure on the performance from the perspective of the Fe–Fe atomic distance. These peculiar behaviors are possibly due to the competitive effect by magnetic scattering and e–p scattering.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we demonstrate simplified equivalent circuit models to effectively approximate responses of recently reported waveform-selective metasurfaces that distinguish different electromagnetic waves even at the same frequency depending on their waveforms or pulse widths. Compared to conventional equivalent circuit models that represent behaviors of ordinary metasurfaces in the “frequency” domain, the proposed models enable us to explain how waveform-selective metasurfaces respond in the “time” domain. Our approach well estimates not only time constants of waveform-selective metasurfaces but also their entire time-domain responses. Particularly, this study reports the importance of resistive components of diodes as well as the limitation of our models with respect to the power dependence although still the models effectively work when waveform-selective mechanisms are clearly exhibited with a sufficiently large input power. Thus, the idea of the proposed equivalent circuit models contributes not only to a greater understanding of waveform-selective mechanisms but also to facilitating the design process of such unique structures.},

The a - and m -face interface defects were found to be similar to a carbon-related interface defect (the P bC center) observed on the standard Si-face, but their amounts were significantly lower than those of the Si-face after the same NO POA. Such a reduction was correlated with a drastic increase in the field-effect mobility (80–90 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) of the a - and m -face metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors after NO POA. We also found that over-nitridation caused the formation of two types of nitrogen-related defects on the Si-face.

Unlike the electronically similar LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 heterostructures, where the polar discontinuity at the interface defines the accumulated carrier density, the LaTiO 3 heterostructures offer two means of carrier density control—changing the La doping level and utilizing the effect of surface depletion through the change in the SrTiO 3 capping layer thickness. Dynamic carrier tuning over a limited range is possible by the application of a back-gate bias, which primarily affects the depth distribution of carriers. We find that small changes in the pre-annealing conditions of a SrTiO 3 substrate can have a dramatic effect on the low-temperature sheet resistance of the heterostructures.},

Time-stretch interferometry from one femtosecond laser builds mapping from the optical frequency domain to the radio frequency regime. In experiment, the absorption line of a hydrogen cyanide cell is encoded in the probing arm of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The down-converted radio frequency comb is transformed from a periodically chirped waveform, which is the interferogram of the MZI with different dispersion values on two arms. In a single measurement, the optical frequency comb with a span of 112.5 GHz is down-converted to a range of about 20.8 GHz in the radio frequency domain with a comb spacing equal to the laser repetition frequency of 100 MHz. By turning the optical filter, a spectrum range around 2 THz is analyzed. The acquired optical spectrum resolution is 540 MHz.},

It was found that the coherence degree of white light emission of graphene differs depending on the excitation wavelength; however, no excitation power effect on the coherence degree was observed.

Here, we report on the optical properties of ErN crystals, grown by sublimation and probed by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Three transition lines were observed near 1 eV. Theoretically, ErN has a small indirect energy gap of around 0.2 eV with a conduction band minimum at the X-point of the Brillouin zone and a valence band maximum at the Γ-point. The predicted smallest direct energy gap is around 1 eV, with two valence bands at the X-point. Using the PL results together with the reported calculations, a coherent picture for the band structure at the X-point for ErN crystals has been derived. Experimental results revealed that ErN has a minimum direct bandgap of 0.98 eV and a total of two valence bands separated by about 0.37 eV at the X-point.},

These results are explained using first-principles transport calculations, which show that a 1 nm thick TaN layer is more effective in blocking electrons than a 1 nm thick Co layer. Measurements of time-dependent dielectric breakdown indicate that scaling either TaN or Co layers below 1 nm in thickness results in degraded reliability. These results suggest that there is minimal value in scaling the thickness of Co wetting layers below 1 nm, while scaling TaN diffusion barriers below 1 nm results in a trade-off between performance and reliability.},

With the sinusoidal voltage, two consecutive ionization waves were observed. With a special tailoring voltage, control of the guided streamer propagation in a stepwise mode was achieved. The observed second streamer and the second step of propagation could be regarded as a secondary ionization wave for both voltages. A change in the voltage waveform led to significant variations in the secondary ionization wave formation and streamer parameters.

Here, a microwave signal with an audio frequency modulation encodes information in an optical signal by exploiting an atomic microwave-to-optical double resonance and magnetic-field coupling that is amplified by a resonant high-Q microwave cavity. Using this approach, audio signals are encoded as amplitude or frequency modulations in a GHz carrier, transmitted through a cable or over free space, demodulated through cavity-enhanced atom-microwave interactions, and, finally, optically detected to extract the original information.

  abstract     = {AgCrSe 2 materials have shown the potential to be the promising thermoelectric materials due to the intrinsic ultralow lattice thermal conductivity enabled by the fluid-like motion of Ag ions in crystal structures. However, what important role the Ag point defects can play in promoting liquid-like conduction still remains a mystery. Moreover, understanding the electronic transport properties, specifically for clarifying the contribution of various impurity states, is of critical importance for improving the thermoelectric performance of AgCrSe 2 . Here, the thermoelectric properties of AgCrSe 2 with various Ag content have been systematically investigated. It is found that the carrier concentration can be modulated in a broad range by inducing deep level impurity states, enabling a transition from degenerate semiconductor to nondegenerate one and a reliable evaluation on the thermoelectric transport properties. The single parabolic band model gives a good clarification regarding the increased electronic performance. Furthermore, the enhancement of the liquid-like effect triggered by the Ag vacancies contributes to the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (∼0.25 W m −1 K −1 ). Eventually, a maximum figure of merit zT of ∼0.6 is realized in Ag 0.97 CrSe 2 at 750 K. The present findings may shed light on the improvement of thermoelectric performance in AgCrSe 2 materials.},

  abstract     = {The longitudinal surface plasmon resonance of light-irradiated gold nanorods (Au NRs) is generated to enhance the local electric fields of Au NR-based nano-dumbbells (NDs), tailored specifically by coating mesoporous silica at two poles of Au NRs and embedding photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) into the mesopores. The assembled NDs possess a superior uniformity and water dispersity with a strong plasmonic absorption around 800 nm. Time-domain finite-difference calculations indicate that the enhanced local electric field of NDs is predominantly distributed in the dumbbells at two poles of Au NRs, which improves the photonic performance of ICG significantly. Illuminated by an 800 nm laser, the fabricated NDs demonstrate an enhanced combination of photothermal and photodynamic effects in comparison to either Au NRs or ICG alone. Synergistic damaging of photothermal and photodynamic combination to nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells has been corroborated experimentally, thus causing substantial cell death under a lower incident near-infrared laser power. This study concludes that the plasmonic NDs combined synergistically with efficient photothermal and photodynamic effects are highly promising in cancer therapy.},

Currently, the prevailing opinion of an intense Debye-like relaxation in N -mono-substituted amides is that it originates from the slow dynamics of hydrogen-bonded supramolecular structures analogous to the Debye-like peak observed in monohydroxy alcohols. However, our results revealed that the high pressure behavior of NEA is different from that of monohydroxy alcohols. In contrast to monohydroxy alcohols, we found that the shape of dielectric loss spectra of NEA was unaffected by compression.

Here, the multiple order acoustic vortices are realized through a helical metasurface design that is geometrically compact, broadband, and tunable. The proposed metasurface consists of matched helices rotating into the corresponding helical channels, allowing us to modulate the reflected phase shifts of the individual units. The units are arranged in a compact circular configuration and then passively transform an incident plane wavefront into the desired spiral wavefront with a controllable topological charge. The reported theoretical, numerical, and experimental results evidence that multiple orders of OAM modes can be continuously generated by using only a single metasurface. The tunable vortex design is relevant to the pragmatic applications of metasurfaces in real-time acoustic communications, spanners, and tweezers.},

The passive Q -enhancement can be attained lithographically without adding to the power requirement of the system. A 500 nm thick piezoelectric material facilitates the inter-electrical-mechanical domain coupling, and the displacement generated at the transducer periphery drives the patterned 10 μ m thick single crystal silicon plate into various resonant modes. Using this topology, unexplored modes can be generated as well by the forced vibration feature of the interacting resonant tanks. Utilizing a multiport port excitation scheme, multiple modes are explored, while the primary focus is maintained on the Lamé mode of the array. In vacuum for an operational frequency of 58.56 MHz, an exceptionally high-quality factor of 58 276 is attained with a motional resistance of 1250 Ω and this is the record-high figure of merit ( f × Q = 3.4 × 10 12 ) attained for aluminum nitride-based TPoS based resonators. This successful demonstration of the energy coupling scheme paves a path for the study of existing and investigation of unexplored high- Q modes spanning over a wide range of frequency, making these devices a potential candidate for radio frequency front-end applications. The CMOS compatibility of aluminum nitride makes it an attractive solution for achieving low phase noise monolithically integrated CMOS–microelectromechanical systems oscillators.},

  abstract     = {Efficient injection of charge from metal electrodes into semiconductors is of paramount importance to obtain high performance optoelectronic devices. The quality of the interface between the electrode and the semiconductor must, therefore, be carefully controlled. The case of organic semiconductors presents specific problems: ambient deposition techniques, such as solution processing, restrict the choice of electrodes to those not prone to oxidation, limiting potential applications. Additionally, damage to the semiconductor in sputter coating or high temperature thermal evaporation poses an obstacle to the use of many device-relevant metals as top electrodes in vertical metal–semiconductor–metal structures, making it preferable to use them as bottom electrodes. Here, we propose a possible solution to these problems by implementing graphene-passivated nickel as an air stable bottom electrode in vertical devices comprising organic semiconductors. We use these passivated layers as hole-injecting bottom electrodes, and we show that efficient charge injection can be achieved into standard organic semiconducting polymers, owing to an oxide free nickel/graphene/polymer interface. Crucially, we fabricate our electrodes with low roughness, which, in turn, allows us to produce large area devices (of the order of millimeter squares) without electrical shorts occurring. Our results make these graphene-passivated ferromagnetic electrodes a promising approach for large area organic optoelectronic and spintronic devices.},

The transformation has been verified through micro-Raman spectroscopy on thin films subjected to Ga + -FIB irradiation under 5 kV and 30 kV. Inducing crystallographic transformations by FIB in a single-step process (without the need of resists), at a very high speed (low Ga + doses are required, in the range of 10 15 ions/cm 2 ), with very high spatial resolution (limited by the ion beam spot, of a few square nanometers) and with potential for upscaling using broad Ga + beams, this approach represents a significant forward step over previous methods using multistep lithographic or electrochemical procedures.

We study nondiffusive thermal transport by phonons at small distances within the framework of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and demonstrate that the transport is significantly affected by the distribution of phonons emitted by the source. We discuss analytical solutions of the steady-state BTE for a source with a sinusoidal spatial profile, as well as for a three-dimensional Gaussian “hot spot,” and provide numerical results for single crystal silicon at room temperature. If a micro/nanoscale heat source produces a thermal phonon distribution, it gets hotter than that predicted by the heat diffusion equation; however, if the source predominantly produces low-frequency acoustic phonons with long mean free paths, it may get significantly cooler than that predicted by the heat equation, yielding an enhanced heat transport beyond bulk heat conduction.},

In bulk quasi-1D materials, the narrow band noise was interpreted as direct evidence of charge-density-wave sliding. Despite the similarities, we argue that the nature of the MHz oscillations in 1T-TaS 2 is different from the narrow band noise. Analysis of the biasing conditions and current indicates that the observed oscillations are related to the current instabilities due to the voltage-induced transition from the nearly commensurate to incommensurate charge-density-wave phase.},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate that a Josephson junction with a half-metallic weak link integrated into the superconducting loop enables the pumping of magnetic flux piercing the loop. In such a junction, the ground state phase ψ is determined by the mutual orientation of magnetic moments in two ferromagnets surrounding the half-metal. Thus, the precession of magnetic moment in one of the two ferromagnets controlled, e.g., by the microwave radiation, results in the accumulation of the phase ψ and subsequent switching between the states with different vorticities. The proposed flux pumping mechanism does not require the application of voltage or an external magnetic field, which enables the design of electrically decoupled memory cells in superconducting spintronics.},

Efficient manipulation/gating of magnons on-chip is crucial for realization of logic circuitry and device integration. Here, we show a simple method for gating of the magnons in a magnetic wire based on the dipolar coupled chain of nanomagnets. Spin wave propagation has been directly measured using the micro-Brillouin light scattering technique. We observed a significant reduction of spin wave amplitude by switching the nanomagnets using microwave current through a coplanar waveguide, which was also used for spin wave generation. Microwave assisted magnetization switching has been probed using the magnetic force microscopy technique. The results have potential implications in the area of wave based devices for next generation high frequency communication technologies.},

One major obstacle for realistic applications is the lack of suitable room-temperature QAH systems, especially with both robust ferromagnetic (FM) order and large gaps. Here, based on first-principles, we report a long-sought high temperature QAH system in the Bi (111) film asymmetrically functionalized with nitrogen and oxygen. The FM Curie temperature is as high as 420 K, while the nontrivial bulk gap reaches up to 454 meV, rendering that the QAH effect can readily be observed at room temperature or even high temperature. Further analysis of the gapless chiral edge states, Chern number ( C = 1), and quantized QAH conductivity offers solid evidence of its nontrivial feature. Our work provides an opportunity for realizing the high-temperature QAH effect and fabricating energy-efficient spintronics operating at room temperature.},

In the T-type structure, an in-plane CoFeB layer is coupled to a perpendicular CoFeB layer via a Ta spacer. The spacer layer not only mediates exchange coupling but also generates strong SOT, which drives sharp switching between the low and high resistance states of the MTJ without any applied magnetic fields.

We present a charge-trapping model that explains the pulse shapes for its entire duration from radiation detectors containing multiple defect types. A piecewise continuous model, based on the movement of a large number of charge carriers rather than a single charge, has been proposed to explain the pulse shapes from planar room temperature nuclear detectors. An experimental method based on the model has been described to extract charge-trapping information. This model can be applied to similar semiconductor detectors with electrically active trap centers, in general, to extract information like pre-trapping drift times. Charge pulses from a CZTS planar detector, exposed to 5486 keV alpha particles emitted by a 241 Am source, were acquired using a digitizer, and the pulse shapes were explained based on the proposed model. The pre-trapping drift times for electrons as well as holes in CZTS were calculated and studied as a function of operating bias voltage, and a contrast between their bias dependent behaviors was noticed, indicating the behavioral difference of electron and hole traps.},

We fabricate two-dimensional quantum dot arrays using silicon-complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor technology with an alternating dual-standard gate oxide thickness. The quantum dots are designed to have an allowable operating voltage window of 0.2 V to control the number of electrons, which is a window one order of magnitude wider than that of previous works.

By repelling the negative charges at the metal/insulator interface, as recently reported for the (111) h-BN/diamond interface, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve high mobility values of the order of 3000 cm 2 /V s when a pure phonon scattering occurs.

Decreased residual in-plane stress resulting from the increased thickness of the underlying n-GaN layers improves the crystalline quality of the InGaN active region by allowing for a higher growth temperature. The electroluminescence intensity of the InGaN-based red LEDs is increased by a factor of 1.3 when the thickness of the underlying n-GaN layer is increased from 2 to 8 μ m. Using 8- μ m-thick underlying n-GaN layers, 633-nm-wavelength red LEDs are realized with a light-output power of 0.64 mW and an external quantum efficiency of 1.6\% at 20 mA.

  abstract     = {This paper reports an anomalous wave formation at an Al/Cu bimetallic interface produced by magnetic pulse welding. The mechanism of the anomalous wave formation is investigated using both metallurgical characterization and the interface kinematics. It reveals that the anomalous wave is formed with the combination of the intermediate zone and the interdiffusion zone with a thickness of 70 nm, wherein the intermediate zone is caused by the local melting due to the high shear instability, and the interdiffusion zone is formed below the melting point of aluminum combined with ultrahigh heating and cooling rates of about 10 13 °C s −1 . A multiphysics simulation of impact welding has been performed, and it is identified that the jetting kinematics and non-uniform distribution of shear strains during high-speed collision enable the formation of the anomalous wave. The numerical and experimental results comprehensively lead to understanding of the mechanism and the characteristics of the anomalous wave produced during an impact welding.},

  abstract     = {Exciton polaritons, quasiparticles that strongly integrate transition metal dichalcogenides with large exciton binding energies and optical fields, exhibit unique properties due to their strong excitonic nonlinearity. However, intrinsic absorption losses pose a fundamental obstacle to all-optical tunability in exciton-polaritons due to the relatively broad resonance spectra. Therefore, it is necessary to determine structural configurations based on transition metal dichalcogenides to enhance the field distribution. Herein, the experimental details of a narrow trapped-mode based on asymmetric WS 2 localized exciton-polaritons dual gratings are presented. The transmission value at the trapped mode wavelength can be tuned from 0.844 to 0.53 for an excitation power of 14.93 MWcm −2 with a pump wavelength of 366 nm. This is attributed to the narrow trapped-mode resonance and strong field enhancement in the asymmetric gratings. A relaxation time of approximately 35 ps is obtained, which is determined by the exciton lifetime of the WS 2 flake. This work provides a foundation for the application of exciton-polaritons in all-optical devices.},

The signal parameters for a number of heating regimes are quantified to confirm sensitivity to the generated magnetic field.

The electron bunch length is 540 ± 50 fs for photocurrents of &lt;1 electron/pulse, increasing to 700 ± 80 fs for 28 electrons/pulse, as measured by cross correlation with a 220 fs pulsed laser beam. The maximum 5D peak brightness is measured to be 6.8 × 10 13 A/(m 2 rad 2 ) at 28 electrons/pulse.

In this photovoltaic mode, the detector&#39;s noise is not dominated by a dark shot noise process, and therefore, performances are less degraded at high temperature with respect to photoconductive detectors. This work describes a 9 μ m QCD embedded into a patch-antenna metamaterial, which operates with state-of-the-art performances. The metamaterial gathers photons on a collection area, A coll , much larger than the geometrical area of the detector, improving the signal to noise ratio up to room temperature. The background-limited detectivity at 83 K is 5.5 × 10 10 cm Hz 1/2 W −1 , while at room temperature, the responsivity is 50 mA/W at 0 V bias. A patch antenna QCD is an ideal receiver for a heterodyne detection setup, where a signal at a frequency of 1.4 GHz and T = 295 K is reported as demonstration of uncooled 9 μ m photovoltaic receivers with a GHz electrical bandwidth.

Via control of typical pulse energies, the designed pattern was precisely written in the AlN film. The morphology of the patterned structures was characterized using a three-dimensional laser scanning confocal microscope and a scanning electron microscope; crystalline quality and film strain were analyzed using a Raman spectrometer and a transmission electron microscope. The results indicate that consistent morphologies were achieved with only slight changes to the crystalline quality. The tensile stress of the AlN film was released, and the film surface was slightly compressed after laser patterning. Thus, femtosecond etching has the potential to be an in situ patterning method during film growth.},

Generating high-quality joints between parts is crucial for the realization of a scalable quantum computer using the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) framework. In this paper, we adapt the technique of indium bump bonding to cQED to realize high-quality superconducting microwave joints between chips. We use this technique to fabricate compact superconducting cavities in the multilayer microwave integrated quantum circuit (MMIQC) architecture and achieve single photon quality factors over 300 × 10 6 or single-photon lifetimes approaching 5 ms. To quantify the performance of the resulting seam, we fabricate microwave stripline resonators in multiple sections connected by different numbers of bonds, resulting in a wide range of seam admittances. The measured quality factors combined with the designed seam admittances allow us to bound the conductance of the seam at g seam ≥ 2 × 1 0 10 / ( Ω m ) ⁠ . Such a conductance should enable the construction of micromachined superconducting cavities with a quality factor of at least a billion. These results demonstrate the capability to construct very high-quality microwave structures within the MMIQC architecture.},

  abstract     = {InGaAs single-photon avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are key enablers for high-bit rate quantum key distribution. However, the deviation of such detectors from ideal models can open side-channels for an eavesdropper, Eve, to exploit. The phenomenon of backflashes, whereby APDs reemit photons after detecting a photon, gives Eve the opportunity to passively learn the information carried by the detected photon without the need to actively interact with the legitimate receiver, Bob. While this has been observed in slow-gated detectors, it has not been investigated in fast-gated APDs where it has been posited that this effect would be lessened. Here, we perform the first experiment to characterize the security threat that backflashes provide in a GHz-gated self-differencing APD using the metric of information leakage. We find that, indeed, the information leakage is lower than that reported for slower-gated detectors, and we show that its effect on the secure key rate is negligible. We also relate the rate of backflash events to the APD dark current, thereby suggesting that their origin is the InP multiplication region in the APD.},

The majority of commercially available spray nozzles are designed for large throughput spray drying applications or uniform surface coating, but microfluidic nebulizers have recently been developed as small scale alternatives. Here, we explore the physical parameters that define the droplet size and formation under supersonic flow conditions commonly found in microfluidic spray drying systems. We examined the spray nozzle operation using high speed imaging and laser scattering measurements, which allowed us to describe the spray regimes and droplet size distributions. It was determined that by using this spray nozzle device, droplets with diameters of 4–8 μ m could be generated. Moreover, we show that the supersonic de Laval nozzle model can be used to predict the average droplet size. Our approach can be used as a platform for interfacing fluid microprocessing with gas phase detection and characterization.},

Recent developments of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) offer a range of materials whose energy gaps are suited for absorbing relatively narrow slices of the solar spectrum, thus easing requirements for current balance between sub-elements in multijunction stacks. Here, we demonstrate a solution-processed tandem organic solar cell comprising a binary, visible-absorbing sub-cell and a ternary near-infrared (NIR) absorbing sub-cell. The ternary NIR sub-cell utilizes a narrow energy gap NFA that enables a broadened and increased absorption compared to a binary NIR sub-cell. An isopropanol surface treatment is developed to connect the hydrophilic–hydrophobic surfaces in the charge recombination zone (CRZ) located between the sub-cells. The nearly optically and electrically lossless CRZ combined with an anti-reflection coating results in tandem organic photovoltaics with PCE = 15.9\% ± 0.2\% under AM 1.5G simulated illumination.},

Here, we present the printing process and the electrical characteristics of inkjet-printed top contact OSC in bottom-gate TFTs. We first fabricated polymer bottom-gate TFTs by printing in two different top- and bottom-contact configurations. The physical carrier mobility of the two TFTs was extracted from a gated-contact organic TFT model to exclude the effect of geometric contact resistance R C . When compared to assess the OSC film damage from the printing metallization, the two mobility values were almost identical. This result indicates that the metal nanoparticle ink used in this work formed a top metal contact on the OSC film without significant chemical damage. Furthermore, the printed top-contact TFT exhibited I–V characteristics almost identical to those of a thermally evaporated Ag top-contact TFT. This study suggests the possibility of inkjet-printed top metal contacts for organic thin-film devices such as transistors, solar cells, and diodes.},

The unique symmetry of atomic arrangement in C 3 B and C 3 N monolayers could induce interesting properties in the graphene/C 3 B (C 3 N) heterostructure. Based on the density functional theory calculation, we demonstrate that the bandgap near the Dirac cone depends sensitively on the stacking order in the graphene/C 3 B (C 3 N) vdW heterostructure. The bandgap is opened in the AB stacking order, but is completely closed in the AA stacking order. The bandgap closing is protected by the AA stacking order even under vertical strain, while the bandgap increases in the AB stacking order with a positive vertical strain. Based on the tight-binding model, the origin of the bandgap opening and closing is explained by the stacking-order dependent charge transfer. Moreover, the transport properties of the devices assembled by the graphene/C 3 B vdW heterostructures are investigated based on the non-equilibrium Green&#39;s function method plus the density functional theory. The conductance can be turned on or off depending on the stacking order. This finding is useful for the future design of on/off devices based on graphene/C 3 B (C 3 N) heterostructures.},

OMFTJs based on the PVDF:Fe 3 O 4 nanocomposite could open new functionalities in smart multiferroic devices via the interplay of the magnetism of nanoparticles with the ferroelectricity of the organic barrier.},

  abstract     = {The creation of the periodical domain patterns with a submicron period in lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) wafers is a key problem for nonlinear-optical applications, including second harmonic generation, backscattering optical parametric oscillator, etc. We have experimentally studied the domain formation and evolution during local polarization reversal in Z+ LNOI wafers with a metal bottom electrode. It has been shown that domain growth occurs by the formation of the spikes at the charged domain wall (CDW). The complicated shape of isolated domains with a jagged CDW has been revealed. The obtained weak domain–domain interaction has been attributed to effective bulk screening by charge injection. The revealed dependence of the domain sizes on humidity caused by the adsorbed water layer should be taken into account during periodical poling.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite ferroelectric oxides are usually considered to be brittle materials; however, recent work [Dong et al. , Science 366 , 475 (2019)] demonstrated the super-elasticity in the freestanding BaTiO 3 thin films. This property may originate from the ferroelectric domain evolution during the bending, which is difficult to observe in experiments. Therefore, understanding the relation among the bending deformation, thickness of the films, and domain dynamics is critical for their potential applications in flexible ferroelectric devices. Here, we reported the dynamics of ferroelectric polarization in the freestanding BaTiO 3 ultrathin films in the presence of large bending deformation up to 40° using phase-field simulation. The ferroelectric domain evolution reveals the transition from the flux-closure to a / c domains with “vortex-like” structures, which is caused by the increase in out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization. Additionally, by varying the film thickness in the identical bending situation, we found that the a / c phase with a vortex-like structure emerges only as the film thickness reached 12 nm or higher. The results from our investigations provide instructive information for the microstructure evolution of bending ferroelectric perovskite oxide films, which could serve as a guide for the future application of ferroelectric films on flexible electronic devices.},

In this work, a miniature, ring-shaped, linear piezoelectric ultrasonic motor operating in a single, in-plane E 01 mode (zero node line along the circumference and one node line along the diameter direction) is proposed. Experimental results show that it can produce a maximum driving force of 2.7 N, a no-load moving speed of ∼56 mm/s, and a high positioning resolution of 0.1 μ m in open-loop control. Advantages of simple structure, controllable micrometer-scale displacement, and large bidirectional working stroke indicate that the proposed linear motor has great potential for industrial applications, especially for precise actuations.},

It was revealed that all the ceramics have the coexistence of polar R3c and nonpolar Pnma phases.

A high remanent polarization of ≈51.54 μ C/cm 2 was achieved in the composition with 0.9 wt.\% MnO 2 doping, which is the maximum in the reported BFO-based ceramics. Meanwhile, a rather high remanent magnetization of ≈0.31 emu/g was obtained in the same compound.

Recently, multi-modal devices have been demonstrated as a promising candidate for small quantum processor units. Always on longitudinal coupling in such circuits leads to implementation of native high fidelity multi-qubit gates. We propose an architecture using such devices as building blocks for a highly connected larger quantum circuit. To demonstrate a quantum operation between such blocks, a standard transmon is coupled to the multi-modal circuit using a 3D bus cavity giving rise to small exchange interaction between the transmon and one of the modes. We study the cross-resonance interaction in such systems and characterize the entangling operation and the unitary imperfections and crosstalk as a function of device parameters. Finally, we tune up the cross-resonance drive to implement multi-qubit gates in this architecture.},

However, the necessary thickness for creating practical microwave devices cannot be readily achieved by increasing the FeCoB layer thickness or stacking FeCoB/Ru units due to dramatically deteriorated high-frequency performance. In this study, several 50-nm FeCoB/Ru/FeCoB OM units were stacked to form a superlattice structure, with 10-nm ZnO insulator spacers separating the units. It is interesting that the superlattice multilayers not only retain excellent high-frequency OM resonance performance comparable to the single OM unit but also increase the effective magnetic film thickness by a factor of 5. This can be attributed to the positive superposition of the almost identical OM units as well as the effective decoupling between them by thick ZnO spacers. This study provides a promising way to fabricate thicker films while still maintaining excellent OM resonance performance.},

This is much larger than the supergiant photoinduced SPs in antiferromagnetic europium chalcogenides, reported previously. The larger SP in ferromagnetic EuS, and still larger expected for EuO, is explained by a larger Bohr radius of the photoexcited electron state, which encircles and polarizes a greater number of lattice spins. However, because the wave function of the photoexcited electron spreads over a greater volume, the photoexcited electron&#39;s exchange interaction with individual lattice spins weakens, which makes the SP more easily quenched thermally.},

Via the magnetic field deposition, a 45° magnetic easy axis of the NiCo film was induced in the film plane. By using a strong converse magnetoelectric coupling between the NiCo film and the PMN-PT, the magnetic moments of NiCo can be modulated to [001] and [1-10] directions of PMN-PT by selecting an appropriate electric field (E-field). Consequently, large, medium, and small anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) values are obtained by fixing a measuring current along the [001] direction. The required E-field significantly reduces due to the initial direction of NiCo along the 45° direction. The tunability of the AMR ratio is as large as ∼87\%. These results indicate that an energy efficient approach to generate magnetic storage by using only a small E-field rather than a magnetic field with a high energy consumption was realized.

Solid-solution alloys of ScN with traditional III-nitrides such as Al x Sc 1−x N have demonstrated piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties and are actively researched for device applications. While most of these exciting developments in ScN research have employed films deposited using low-vacuum methods such as magnetron sputtering and physical and chemical vapor depositions for thermoelectric applications and Schottky barrier-based thermionic energy conversion, it is necessary and important to avoid impurities, tune the carrier concentrations, and achieve high-mobility in epitaxial films. Here, we report the high-mobility and high-thermoelectric power factor in epitaxial ScN thin films deposited on MgO substrates by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Microstructural characterization shows epitaxial 002 oriented ScN film growth on MgO (001) substrates. Electrical measurements demonstrated a high room-temperature mobility of 127 cm 2 /V s and temperature-dependent mobility in the temperature range of 50–400 K that is dominated by dislocation and grain boundary scattering. High mobility in ScN films leads to large Seebeck coefficients (−175 μ V/K at 950 K) and, along with a moderately high electrical conductivity, a large thermoelectric power factor (2.3 × 10 −3 W/m-K 2 at 500 K) was achieved, which makes ScN a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications. The thermal conductivity of the films, however, was found to be a bit large, which resulted in a maximum figure-of-merit of 0.17 at 500 K.},

Epitaxial films grown directly on sapphire, which are ∼100 nm thick, show X-ray diffraction (002) and (102) rocking curve peaks with full widths at half maximum of less than 150 and 1400 arc sec, respectively, which are the narrowest linewidths reported for AlN of this thickness.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigated the evolution of microstructural chemistry of metal organic chemical vapor deposition grown (010) (Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 films with varying Al contents, x = 0.10–1.0, using atom probe tomography (APT). At a low Al content ( x ≤ 0.25), the films are homogeneous, where layer inhomogeneity appears at a high Al content ( x &gt; 0.25). Further increasing the Al content up to x ≥ 0.60 results in a homogeneous (Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 layer. This change in microstructural features was linked to the phase transformation of (Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 using a manifold learning approach to capture the governing features hidden in the data dimensionality. Combining APT to unsupervised machine learning enables APT to be an independent material characterization tool to investigate the microstructure, chemical composition, and phase related information.},

The wurtzite structure is well maintained even at high growth temperatures up to 900 °C for Sc 0.2 Al 0.8 N. Smooth surface morphology (root mean square roughness less than 1 nm) and excellent crystal quality [(002) plane rocking curve full-width at half maximum below 450 arc sec] are achieved over the range of x ≤ 0.34. Optical absorption studies indicate a decreasing bandgap with increasing Sc with a linear relationship of E g ( x ) = 6.1 − 3.39 x , which is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction. A monotonically tunable refractive index between AlN and GaN is further measured for Sc x Al 1− x N with various Sc compositions. This work provides a viable path for the epitaxy of wurtzite Sc x Al 1− x N with high Sc compositions. The distinct effect of substitutional Sc on bandgap and refractive index could be used in designing high-performance optoelectronic, electronic, and piezoelectric devices, and III-nitride integrated photonics and optical cavities.},

However, it is not obvious whether such a concept can be extended to a quasi-periodic surface-wave system that lacks translational symmetry. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a surface-wave photonic quasicrystal that lacks short-range order can also exhibit a forbidden bandgap for surface electromagnetic waves. The lower cutoff of this forbidden bandgap is mainly determined by the maximum separation between the nearest neighboring pillars. Point defects within this bandgap show distinct properties compared to a periodic photonic crystal in the absence of translational symmetry. A line-defect waveguide, which is crafted out of this surface-wave photonic quasicrystal by shortening a random row of metallic rods, is also demonstrated to guide and bend surface waves around sharp corners along an irregular waveguiding path.},

We predict the existence of the dependence of the NFRHT on the drift-current velocity and the vacuum gap. It is found that the coupling of NSPPs at smaller and larger gap sizes exhibits different nonreciprocities. The findings may open promising pathways for highly efficient thermal management, energy harvesting, and subwavelength thermal imaging.},

  abstract     = {In the last few decades, bulk-acoustic-wave filters have been essential components of 3G-to-4G radios. These devices rely on the high electromechanical coupling coefficient ( k t 2 ∼ 7\%), attained by aluminum nitride (AlN) film-bulk-acoustic-resonators (FBARs), to achieve a wideband and low-loss frequency response. As the resonance frequency of FBARs is set by their thickness, the integration of multiple FBARs, to form filters, can only be attained through the adoption of frequency tuning fabrication steps, such as mass loading or trimming. However, as the ability to reliably control these steps significantly decays for thinner (or higher frequency) FBARs, manufacturing FBAR-based filters, addressing the needs of emerging IoT and 5G applications, is becoming more and more challenging. Consequently, there is a quest for new acoustic resonant components, simultaneously exhibiting high- k t 2 and a lithographic frequency tunability. In this work, a novel class of AlN resonators is presented. These radio frequency devices, labeled as two-dimensional-resonant-rods (2DRRs), exploit, for the first time, the unconventional acoustic behavior exhibited by a forest of locally resonant rods, built in the body of a profiled AlN layer that is sandwiched between a bottom un-patterned metal plate and a top metallic grating. 2DRRs exhibit unexplored modal features that make them able to achieve high- k t 2 , a significant lithographic frequency tunability, and a relaxed lithographic resolution, while relying on an optimal AlN crystalline orientation. The operation of 2DRRs is discussed, in this work, by means of analytical and finite-element-methods. The measured performance of the first fabricated 2DRR, operating around 2.4 GHz and showing a k t 2 in excess of 7.4\%, is also reported.},

Among TAOSs, amorphous (a-) SnO 2 has several advantages against current a-InGaZnO 4 such as higher μ FE and being indium-free. Although a-SnO 2 TTFT has been demonstrated several times, the operation mechanism has not been clarified thus far due to the strong gas sensing characteristics of SnO 2 . Here we clarify the operation mechanism of a-SnO 2 TTFT by electric field thermopower modulation analyses. We prepared a bottom-gate top-contact type TTFT using 4.2-nm-thick a-SnO 2 as the channel without any surface passivation. The effective thickness of the conducting channel was ∼1.7 ± 0.4 nm in air and in vacuum, but a large threshold gate voltage shift occurred in different atmospheres; this is attributed to carrier depletion near at the top surface (∼2.5 nm) of the a-SnO 2 due to its interaction with the gas molecules and the resulting shift in the Fermi energy. The present results would provide a fundamental design concept to develop a-SnO 2 TTFT.},

Two cells, with inner dimensions of 5 mm × 5 mm × 5 mm and separated by a baseline of 5 cm, are driven by one VCSEL, and the resulting Larmor precessions are probed by a second VCSEL through optical rotation. The off-resonant linearly polarized probe light interrogates two cells at the same time, and the output of the intrinsic gradiometer is proportional to the magnetic field gradient measured over the given baseline. This intrinsic gradiometer scheme has the advantage of avoiding added noise from combining two scalar magnetometers. We achieve a sensitivity better than 18 fT/cm/√Hz in the gradient measurement. Ultra-sensitive short-baseline magnetic gradiometers can potentially play an important role in many practical applications, such as nondestructive evaluation and unexploded ordnance detection. Another application of the gradiometer is for magnetocardiography (MCG) in an unshielded environment. Real-time MCG signals can be extracted from the raw gradiometer readings. The demonstrated gradiometer greatly simplifies the MCG setup and may lead to a ubiquitous MCG measurement in the future.},

We studied a method to investigate the effects of these vacuum chamber impurities after establishing the reproducibility of the device lifetimes. These device lifetimes were affected by the cleanliness of the exposure chamber. Increased exposure times led to shorter device lifetimes, even if the contact angle in the exposure chamber was reduced to less than 5° using plasma cleaning. Furthermore, the device lifetime did not degrade when the partial pressure of water within the exposure chamber was reduced using a cryotrap. We were also able to evaluate the Kapton tape and vacuum greases that were used and determined whether they affected the device lifetime. These results suggest that the influence of residual water and impurities can be separated and it would then be possible to evaluate the influence of the impurities alone on the device lifetime.},

The particulate multiferroic composite derived in this manner exhibits a favorable microstructure, wherein, although the volume fraction of the garnet phase is kept low (6\%), which helps in retaining the electrical insulating character of the specimen, the number fraction of the garnet grains vis-à-vis the ferroelectric grains is ∼1:1. The composite shows a nearly ∼50\% increase in saturation polarization at room temperature under a modest magnetic field of 1 T, suggesting a considerable improvement in ferroelectric domain switching due to the efficient strain transfer from the minority garnet grains to the majority piezoelectric grains.},

  abstract     = {We have investigated magnesium aluminum ferrite thin films with a range of iron concentrations and identified the optimal iron content to obtain high crystalline quality thin films with the low magnetic damping required for spin current-based applications. Epitaxial MgAl 2 − x Fe x O 4 films with 0.8 &lt; x &lt; 2.0 were grown by pulsed laser deposition on single crystal MgAl 2 O 4 substrates and were characterized structurally and magnetically. We find that the x = 1.5 composition minimizes the room-temperature magnetic damping with a typical Gilbert damping parameter of α eff = 1.8 × 10 − 3 ⁠ . This minimized damping is governed by a competition between the more robust magnetic ordering with increased iron content, x , and the more defective structure due to larger film-substrate lattice mismatch with increased iron content. The temperature-dependent magnetization curves indicate that T c is suppressed below room temperature for iron content x ≤ 1.2 and eventually suppressed entirely for x = 0.8. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism results indicate that for all x the magnetic moment is dominated by Fe 3 + cations distributed in a 60:40 ratio on the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, with minimal contribution from Fe 2 + cations. Films with x = 1.4 − 1.6 exhibit very strong ferromagnetic resonance and low Gilbert damping with α eff = ( 1.8 − 6 ) × 10 − 3 ⁠ , making them ideal candidates for microwave and spintronic applications.},

In this paper, we demonstrated that this effect is caused by the tensor light shifts of the linearly polarized probe light. This effect can be suppressed at a certain probe light polarization. We obtained this probe light polarization experimentally and reduced the impact of probe power on magnetic field compensation by 35 times. The impact of probe light frequency is also suppressed. Furthermore, the influence of the pump power, the static magnetic field, and the cell temperature on this optimized polarization was investigated. The tensor light shift can be suppressed at about 17 ° polarization under different conditions in our system. Moreover, the actual residual magnetic field in the magnetic shields can be obtained, which is useful for the magnetic field design of the co-magnetometer, and this method can also be extended to other atomic devices to suppress the tensor light shift.},

The transverse conductivity σ X Y A H vs the longitudinal conductivity σ X X shows distinct linear behavior in three regimes, which indicates different anomalous Hall effect (AHE) mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Néel-type magnetic skyrmions in multilayers are promising candidates for ultra-low power spintronic devices. To image the Néel-type skyrmions using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L-TEM), the samples must be tilted. Thus, the external magnetic field consists of both in-plane and out-of-plane components. To date, it is still not well known on the effect of the in-plane magnetic field on the L-TEM images, leading to ambiguities in retrieving the structure of Néel-type skyrmions. Here, Néel-type skyrmions in three [Pt/Co/Ta] 20 multilayer samples, with the easy magnetization axis being tuned from the out-of-plane to the in-plane direction by increasing the Co thickness from 1.8 to 2.2 nm, are imaged. When using a smaller defocus value (−2 mm) and a higher magnification (×9100) of L-TEM, a surprising dark-bright-dark-bright double contrasted pattern, instead of the previously reported dark-bright contrasted pattern, is observed. The additional dark-bright contrasted pattern becomes more evident for thicker Co layer samples in which the magnetization axis tilts more toward the in-plane direction. Further analysis, via a combination of magnetic force microscopy experiments, micromagnetic simulations, and micromagnetic analysis to Lorentz TEM simulation, shows that the additional dark-bright features originate from the deformation of the Néel-type skyrmions within an in-plane magnetic field.},

Enhanced PMA as high as 1.6 × 10 6 erg/cm 3 is obtained in the n = 1 superlattice, which is considerably higher compared to that in n = 4 and 5 SLs. Our systematic thickness-dependent studies reveal that the (SrIrO 3 )/(SrRuO 3 ) interface plays a crucial role in both electrical and magnetic properties.

By electrical injection of carriers into the N-related levels, EL emission is achieved at wavelengths significantly larger than for the QW emission ( λ ∼ 3 μ m), extending the output of the diode to λ ∼ 5 μ m. Furthermore, for applied voltages well below the flatband condition of the diode, EL emission is observed at energies much larger than those supplied by the applied voltage and/or thermal energy, with an energy gain Δ E &gt; 0.2 eV at room temperature.

More interestingly, GaN bonded on GC is stress-free and quite beneficial for device performance, the degradation of which is partially subject to the stress induced by the fabrication and packaging processes. Moreover, the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) across the GaN/GC interface is accurately estimated to be approximately 67 MW/m 2 K, based on the measured TBC between Ti and GC, in excellent agreement with the prediction using the corrected diffuse mismatch model. According to the finite element modeling results, the GaN-on-GC power transistor shows superiority and possesses greatly improved thermal performance due to the high thermal conductivity of GC and adequate TBC across the GaN/GC interface, compared to the commercially available GaN-on-SiC and GaN-on-Si transistors.

The crystalline h-BN has been confirmed by x-ray diffraction, Raman scattering, and atomic force microscopy measurements. This work demonstrates that HTA is a simple and effective way to achieve wafer-scale crystalline h-BN films, which have numerous potential applications in next-generation two-dimensional devices and flexible III-nitride optoelectronic devices.},

Moreover, our analysis of the quantum oscillation frequencies associated with nonzero Berry phase when the magnetic field is parallel to both the ab -plane and c -axis of TiSb 2 finds that the Fermi surface topology has a three-dimensional feature. The results are supported by first-principle calculations which reveal a symmetry-protected Dirac point along the Γ-Z high symmetry line near the Fermi level. On the (001) surface, the bulk Dirac points are found to project onto the Γ ¯ point with nontrivial surface states. Our finding will substantially enrich the family of 3D Dirac semimetals which are useful for topological applications.},

Our results place this level 0.65 eV (±0.05 eV) above the valence band, a position closer to the valence band than the predictions of several recent computational studies. The crystal used in this investigation was grown by the Czochralski method and contains large concentrations of Mg acceptors and Ir donors, as well as a small concentration of Fe ions and an even smaller concentration of Cr ions. Below room temperature, illumination with 325 nm laser light produces the characteristic EPR spectrum from neutral Mg acceptors ( ⁠ M g G a 0 ⁠ ). A portion of the singly ionized Ir 4+ donors are converted to their neutral Ir 3+ state at the same time. For temperatures near 250 K, the photoinduced EPR spectrum from the neutral M g G a 0 acceptors begins to decay immediately after the laser light is removed, as electrons are thermally excited from the valence band to the Mg acceptor. Holes left in the valence band recombine with electrons at the deeper Ir 3+ ions and restore the Ir 4+ ions. An activation energy for the thermal decay of the M g G a 0 acceptors, and thus a value for the (0/−) level, is obtained by using a general-order kinetics model to analyze a set of five isothermal decay curves taken at temperatures between 240 and 260 K.},

We further calculated the optical response using density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, considering quasiparticle and excitonic corrections. The computed values for the direct and indirect bandgaps (4.25 eV and 2.07 eV) agree well with the measured results (4.12 eV and 2.02 eV).

The nanoelectrochromic electrode also acts as a counterion to support redox induced color switching of Viologen in a solid state without any liquid electrolyte. A good color contrast between its yellow and blue states under different bias conditions has been observed, which leads to overall performance enhancement as quantified using device parameters such as coloration efficiency, color contrast, stability, and cycle life. The solid state device shows an improved efficiency of as high as 360 cm 2 /C and a switching time of as low as 500 ms. In situ spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that the bias induced redox activity of Viologen and metal oxide leads to the color change.

Following an extensive and intuitive exploration, we propose a model for this surface reconstruction based on an all-silicon over-layer forming an ordered honeycomb-Kagome network. This model is compared to the available scanning tunneling microscope (STM) topographies and conductance maps. Our STM simulations reproduce the three main characteristics observed in the measurements, revealing the underlying complex and hybrid passivation scheme. Indeed, below the ordered over-layer, the competition between two incompatible properties of silicon induces a strong disorder in the charge transfer between unpassivated dangling bonds of different chemistry. This effect in conjunction with the glassy-like character of the PES explains why it has taken decades to provide an accurate atomistic representation for this structure.},

Here, we demonstrate TFTs using solution-processed, ultra-thin ITO films with outstanding switching performance. These devices exhibit a mobility of up to 15 cm 2 V −1 s −1 and a high on-off ratio of 10 8 . Because the device exhibits significant instability under stress tests, moderate doping with Ga as a dopant is introduced to form Ga-doped ITO TFTs. The resulting device has much enhanced stability, near-zero turn-on voltage, and a high on-off current ratio of 10 8 . Through further involvement of an AlO x dielectric layer, the Ga-doped ITO TFTs exhibit a high apparent mobility of more than 40 cm 2 V −1 s −1 and operate at small gate voltages (3 V). Remarkably, the device maintains an on-off ratio of over 10 4 at drain voltages as small as 1 mV.},

  abstract     = {Topological insulators (TIs) are considered as ideal spintronic materials due to the spin-momentum-locked Dirac surface states. The photoinduced anomalous Hall effect (PAHE) is a powerful tool to investigate the spin Hall effect of topological insulators even at room temperature. In this Letter, the PAHE has been observed in three dimensional topological insulator Bi 2 Te 3 thin films grown on Si substrates at room temperature. As the thickness of the Bi 2 Te 3 films increases from 3 to 20 quintuple layer (QL), the PAHE first increases and then decreases, and it reaches a maximum at 7 QL. The sign reversal of the PAHE of the 3 QL sample after oxidation reveals that the PAHE of the Bi 2 Te 3 thin films is dominated by the top surface states, which is further confirmed by the circular photogalvanic effect under front and back illuminations. The photoinduced anomalous Hall conductivity excited by 1064 nm light is as large as 5.28 nA V −1 W −1 cm 2 in the 7 QL sample, much larger than that observed in InGaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells (0.445 nA V −1 W −1 cm 2 ) and GaN/AlGaN heterostructures (0.143 nA V −1 W −1 cm 2 ). By comparing the PAHE current excited by 1064 nm with that excited by 1342 nm, we reveal that the tremendous PAHE excited by 1064 nm light is due to the modulation effect of spin injection from Si substrates. The giant PAHE value observed in TI Bi 2 Te 3 may offer spintronic applications of TIs such as high-efficient light-polarization-state detectors.},

It requires phase-change memory scaling toward higher density for such applications. However, the scaling-down and interfacial impact in phase-change materials, which are the core of PCMs, are still unclear. In this paper, the phase transition properties and crystallization behavior of phase-change material Sb 2 Se were tuned intrinsically by reducing the thickness of the Sb 2 Se film and coverage of VO 2 . It is shown that the crystallization temperature increases from 209 °C to 224 °C, and 10-year data retention temperature enhances from 117 °C to 139 °C, as the thickness of the Sb 2 Se film decreases from 50 nm to 2 nm. The coverage of VO 2 could improve the thermal stability and crystallization rate of the Sb 2 Se film obviously, especially for smaller thickness. The kinetic exponent obtained by the JMA model indicates that the crystallization mechanism varies with film thickness, which could tune the crystallization rate of the Sb 2 Se film. This study provides a practical solution for on-going optimizing phase-change properties in terms of size and interfacial effects.},

IC comb devices are perfect candidates for this configuration, since they develop near-THz-wide optical frequency comb spectra from a millimeter-sized cavity, using a multi-stage structure that can also function as a very fast photodetector. In this work, we leverage IC photodetectors with a gigahertz bandwidth to demonstrate a self-contained, free-running, room-temperature DCS system in the mid-infrared. The DCS system used detection by the same bi-functional IC device structure to measure 1,1-difluoroethane over ∼600 GHz of optical coverage around 3.6 µ m.

Taking advantage of the 2D semiconductor van der Waals heterostructure, this work constructs a photovoltaic (PV) GeSe/MoS 2 and a photoconductive (PC) GeSe/graphene photodetector, respectively. The PC GeSe/graphene photodetector achieves relatively higher photoresponsivity ( R ), where R can reach up to 10 4 AW −1 . The PV GeSe/MoS 2 photodetector, by contrast, obtains a faster photoresponse speed. More importantly, the photoresponse properties of the PV GeSe/MoS 2 photodetector can remain constant under the reverse bias, due to the minority carrier conduction in its depletion region at this time. The different characteristics of the two type 2D photodetectors are explored in detail, which can play a guiding role in the construction of high-performance photodetectors.},

  abstract     = {Unique properties of graphene are combined to enable graphene plasmonic devices that could revolutionize the terahertz (THz) electronic technology. A high value of the carrier mobility allows us to excite resonant plasma waves. The graphene bipolar nature allows for different mechanisms of plasma wave excitation. Graphene bilayer and multilayer structures make possible improved THz device configurations. The ability of graphene to form a high quality heterostructure with h-BN, black phosphorus, and other materials systems supports advanced heterostructure devices comprised of the best properties of graphene and other emerging materials. In particular, using black phosphorus compounds for cooling electron–hole plasma in graphene could dramatically improve the conditions for THz lasing. High optical phonon energy allows for reaching higher plasma frequencies that are supported by high sheet carrier densities in graphene. Recent improvements in graphene technology combined with a better understanding of the device physics of graphene THz plasmonics and graphene plasmonic device designs hold promise to make graphene THz plasmonic technology one of the key graphene applications. Commercialization of plasmonic graphene technology is facing the same challenges as other graphene applications, which have difficulties in producing uniform large graphene layers, bilayers, and heterostructures of high quality and making good low resistance stable Ohmic contacts. The time projection for large scale graphene electronic device applications now extends into the 2030s. However, emerging graphene mass production technologies might bring commercial applications of the graphene plasmonic terahertz technology closer.},

The metastructure is orchestrated of multiple labyrinthine unit cells of different configurations in a hexagonal array, and broadband absorption has been achieved by the dissipation of incident propagating sound waves inside the labyrinthine zigzag channels. Furthermore, the unique design of the metastructure allows for simultaneous air circulation for facilitating natural ventilation and sound absorption. The proposed unique designs may find potential applications in architectural acoustics and noise shielding where simultaneous natural ventilation and noise mitigation are required.},

However, established acquisition protocols such as scanning small angle x-ray scattering and x-ray grating interferometry require long measurement time. In this Letter, a rapid x-ray scattering tensor tomography acquisition method is proposed. It is based on circular gratings, which provide single-shot 2D-omnidirectional information of the sample scattering properties. The main advantage of the presented method is the reduced data acquisition time compared to the existing protocols for x-ray scattering tensor tomography, paving the way toward rapid time-resolved studies.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic microrobots that swim through liquid media are of interest for minimally invasive medical procedures, bioengineering, and manufacturing. Many of the envisaged applications, such as micromanipulation and targeted cargo delivery, necessitate the use and adequate control of multiple microrobots, which will increase the velocity, robustness, and efficacy of a procedure. While various methods involving heterogeneous geometries, magnetic properties, and surface chemistries have been proposed to enhance independent control, the main challenge has been that the motion between all microswimmers remains coupled through the global control signal of the magnetic field. Katsamba and Lauga [Phys. Rev. Appl. 5 , 064019 (2016)] proposed transchiral microrobots, a theoretical design with magnetized spirals of opposite handedness. The competition between the spirals can be tuned to give an intrinsic nonlinearity that each device can function only within a given band of frequencies. This allows individual microrobots to be selectively controlled by varying the frequency of the rotating magnetic field. Here, we present the experimental realization and characterization of transchiral micromotors composed of independently driven magnetic helices. We show a swimming micromotor that yields negligible net motion until a critical frequency is reached and a micromotor that changes its translation direction as a function of the frequency of the rotating magnetic field. This work demonstrates a crucial step toward completely decoupled and addressable swimming magnetic microrobots.},

Herein, we develop a pulsed laser deposition technique to fabricate antimony selenosulfide films with flat and compact surface morphology and high crystallinity. The composition of the as-obtained films can be conveniently tuned via varying molar ratios of Sb 2 S 3 and Se in targets. At optimized conditions, we fabricate planar heterojunction solar cells and then obtain a significantly improved power conversion efficiency of 7.05\%.

When CaCl 2 was added to the mixture, the numbers of these three types of water molecules remained unchanged. In contrast, when MgCl 2 or FeCl 2 was added to the mixture, the number of tightly bound water molecules increased, while the number of loosely bound water molecules remained unaffected. These results are consistent with the x-ray diffraction results, which suggested that Mg 2 + and Fe 2 + ions bind near the phosphate groups and enhance the extent of hydration, while Ca 2 + ions bind near the glycerol groups with no significant effect on hydration water.

We investigated the effect of alloying Ni inner electrodes with various elements on the leakage current degradation of MLCCs. Fe, Cu, Zn, and Sn were chosen and added to Ni and co-fired with BaTiO 3 , from which Cu and Sn were alloyed with Ni. The leakage current degradation time of MLCCs using the Ni–Cu and Ni–Sn inner electrodes was longer than that of MLCCs using the Ni internal electrodes. In particular, the leakage current degradation of the MLCCs using Ni–Sn inner electrodes was significantly suppressed. This suppression effect increased as the thickness of the BaTiO 3 -based dielectrics decreased. This method of optimization of the Ni inner-electrode composition could lead to further miniaturization and increased capacity of MLCCs.},

Additionally, a large piezoresistive effect in the low-doped n-type 3C-SiC(100) thin film has been observed, which exceeds the previously reported values in any SiC thin films. The growth of the n-type 3C-SiC thin film was performed using the low pressure chemical vapor deposition technique at 1250 °C and the standard micro-electro-mechanical systems process is used for the fabrication of 3C-SiC piezoresistors. The piezoresistive effect was measured using the bending beam method in different crystallographic orientations. The maximum gauge factor is –47 for the longitudinal [100] orientation. Using the longitudinal and transverse gauge factors for different crystallographic orientations, the fundamental piezoresistive coefficients of the low-doped n-type 3C-SiC thin film are measured to be π 11 = ( − 14.5 ± 1.3 ) × 10 − 11 Pa −1 , π 12 = ( 5.5 ± 0.5 ) × 10 − 11 Pa −1 , and π 44 = ( − 1.7 ± 0.7 ) × 10 − 11 Pa −1 .},

One of the approaches to control domain structures is to form a solid solution with analogs in different symmetries. In this study, we investigate the influence of domain structures on the PV properties of ferroelectric thin films in the x BaTiO 3 –(1− x )BiFeO 3 (BT–BFO) solid-solution system ( x = 0.1 and 0.2). We found that a substitution of BT for BFO substantially decreases the domain size down to several tens of nanometers, leading to an enhanced PV response owing to a marked contribution of the domain-wall PV effect.},

The first two nanometers of thickness of the Mn 2.6 Ga thin films are highly strained to the substrate with a lattice mismatch of 9.54\%, playing the role of a template layer for the subsequent growth of relaxed L2 1 -Mn 2.6 Ga.

It is found that Ni 80 Fe 20 magnetization is directly coupled to the terahertz magnetic fields, in which the magnetic responses of Ni 80 Fe 20 are phase-locked with terahertz pulses. High efficiency of metallic spintronic-terahertz emitters in driving terahertz-induced magnetization dynamics is observed; the maximum precession amplitude of the out-of-plane component of the Ni 80 Fe 20 magnetization reaches over 10\% of its saturation magnetization. Analytical integrations of THz magnetic field pulses reproduce the experimental results, confirming that the underlying mechanism of the observed spin dynamics is the Zeeman coupling between the terahertz magnetic field and magnetization in the Ni 80 Fe 20 film. Our results open up possibilities for the studies of terahertz spin dynamics by integrating highly efficient low-cost metallic spintronic-THz-emitters into magnetic thin film elements.},

Interaction between magnons and the interfacial dissipation are studied by comparing three samples with different spin valve structures. Magnons with different intrinsic frequencies have strong interactions. In contrast, magnons with similar intrinsic frequencies have relatively weak interactions. Interfacial dissipations of magnons are increased by rare earth insertion, which can reduce the interactions between magnons indirectly.

  abstract     = {Acceptor doping CdTe with group-V elements is promising for increasing the power conversion efficiency of CdTe photovoltaic devices via an increased hole concentration and open circuit voltage (V OC ). In past work, we have investigated doping with As in Cd-rich CdTe single crystals grown using the Cd-solvent traveling heater method we have developed. In this study, we compare the doping parameters and stability of hole concentration in the light and dark for P, As, and Sb dopants in crystals cooled very slowly from the growth temperature to approximate thermal equilibrium. In contrast to older reports of a high acceptor ionization energy for Sb, our temperature dependent Hall effect experiments reveal an acceptor ionization energy slightly above 90 meV for Sb doping in the mid 10 16 cm −3 range. Room temperature hole concentrations above 10 16 cm −3 are observed for P, As, and Sb with each dopant type exhibiting only small changes in hole concentrations over 2 years&#39; time at room temperature. Crystals doped with P, As, or Sb exhibit increased conductivity after above-gap illumination, which decays over periods of minutes to hours depending on temperature. Analysis of the photoconductivity decay reveals a barrier attributed to hole capture of 190–280 meV for the series P, As, and Sb.},

  abstract     = {Hole self-localization into polaron states is a phenomenon characteristic of many wide bandgap compounds including transparent semiconducting oxide β -Ga 2 O 3 . While this effect has been recognized for some time, its dynamics remained elusive, and self-localization has often been considered instantaneous. In this work, using the two-color ultrafast pump–probe technique, we have measured the hole self-localization time in β -Ga 2 O 3 . At room temperature, this time has been found to be 0.5 ps increasing to 1.1 ps at 10 K. In terms of the configuration coordinate diagram, at room temperature, tunneling and thermal activation contribute to the process with similar weights. The hole self-trapping coefficient is estimated to be 6.4 × 10 −8 cm 3 /s.},

Thus far, symmetry-protected topological modes in hexagonal systems have primarily been studied in electromagnetism and acoustics, i.e., dispersionless media. Herein, we show experimentally how crucial geometrical properties of square structures allow for topological transport that is ordinarily forbidden within conventional hexagonal structures. We perform numerical simulations that take into account the inherent dispersion within water waves and devise a topological insulator that supports symmetry-protected transport along the domain walls. Our measurements, viewed using a high-speed camera under stroboscopic illumination, unambiguously demonstrate the valley-locked transport of water waves within a non-hexagonal structure. Due to the tunability of the energy&#39;s directionality by geometry, our results could be used for developing highly efficient energy harvesters, filters, and beam-splitters within dispersive media.},

Our HSE/-U method applies the hybrid functional for the whole interface supercell, but with an additional “reverse GGA+U” on the narrow gap semiconductor side, guaranteeing the correct bandgaps on both sides. Several supercell calculations of dielectric films including HfO 2 , ZrO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , and GaN on an insulating phase VO 2 are tested to verify it. All the studied oxides show the type-I band alignment with VO 2 , and the band edge line-up agrees well with the available experimental reports, supporting the reliability of the proposed hybrid calculation scheme.},

  abstract     = {Electron-surface interaction plays a fundamental role in surface science, which could evolve into an electronic avalanche under a high electrical field, resulting in devastating device failures. In the present study, using a thin polymer film approach, the effective surface layer, whose thickness is estimated to be about 200 nm, where the electron-surface interaction occurs is directly probed. The morphological evolution of thin polymer films with thicknesses from nanometers to micrometers is investigated with a focus on its influence on the electron avalanche process (or flashover) under a dc electric field in vacuum. It is found that the film thickness dependence of flashover is divided into three parts, i.e., fast increase, slow increase, and saturation, each of which has a dominant microscopic mechanism. The results indicate that the secondary electron emission (SEE) yield decreases significantly even when a discontinuous polymer layer is deposited, which varies little afterward. In contrast, the shallow surface traps develop into deep ones with the film thickness. The density ratio of deep traps increases exponentially after a continuous film is formed. The clear transition from SEE dominated to surface charge trap dominated flashover and their unique dependence on film morphology provide a deeper insight into the electron-surface interaction, which can be used for theoretical modeling, surface modification, and advanced functional devices.},

The coupling scheme relies on the combination of a phase grating generating multiple LO beams and a polycrystalline fiber delivering the demultiplexed LO signal to a superconducting mixer at 4 K in a closed-cycle cryostat. This scheme eases the use of a beam splitter in front of the mixer. Reflection phase grating generating 2 × 2 beams has been achieved with a total power efficiency of 64\% based on a gold covered etched silicon nanostructure. The diffraction beam has been readily coupled into a 2 m long polycrystalline fiber, where a single-lobe circular beam has been delivered at the fiber output. By aligning the fiber core position to the center of a superconducting hot electron bolometer mixer at the rear side, we demonstrate the application of a fiber coupled demultiplexed QCL source for pumping the superconducting mixer with adequate LO power.},

However, resonant optical modes in such cavities suffer from poor radiative characteristics due to their subwavelength transverse dimensions. Consequently, single-mode terahertz QCLs with metallic cavities and large ( ⁠ &gt; 100 mW ⁠ ) output power have only been realized in the surface-emitting configuration that affords a large radiating surface. Here, we demonstrate a method to enhance radiative outcoupling from such plasmonic lasers for high-power emission in the edge-emitting (end-fire or longitudinal) direction. Single-sided plasmon waves propagating in vacuum are resonantly excited in surrounding medium of metallic cavities with the QCL semiconductor medium. The vacuum guided plasmon waves with a large wavefront phase-lock multiple metallic cavities longitudinally, which leads to intense radiation in multiple directions, including that in the longitudinal direction in a narrow single-lobed beam. The multicavity array radiates predominantly in a single spectral mode. A peak-power output of 260 mW and a slope efficiency of 303 mW /A are measured for the end-fire beam from a 3.3 THz QCL operating at 54 K in a Stirling cooler.

  abstract     = {TATB (1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene) is a powerful explosive whose dynamical behavior is difficult to study because TATB is so insensitive to initiation by shock waves. We used a tabletop microscope equipped with 0–4.5 km/s laser-launched flyer plates to study shock initiation of TATB, which was fabricated in the form of an array of hundreds of plastic-bonded explosive minicharges (X-TATB = 80\% TATB + 20\% Sylgard 182 polymer). The 4 ns shocks from the flyer plates were not effective in initiating TATB, but we also developed a two-layer array where flyers first initiated a plastic-bonded PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate) charge (X-PETN = 80\% PETN + 20\% Sylgard), which drove an initiating 25 ns shock into the X-TATB. Thermal emission from shocked X-TATB was used to measure time-dependent temperature profiles with a resolution of 2 ns and to produce high-speed (5 ns) videos. In X-TATB, flyer plates produced 2500–3500 K hot spots and combustion at 2500 K. With X-PETN initiators, X-TATB had 3500–4000 K hot spots and a powerful volume explosion lasting a few nanoseconds. Prospects for producing TATB detonations on a tabletop are discussed.},

Modern fast pixelated detectors have enabled imaging of individual convergent beam electron diffraction patterns in a STEM raster scan at frame rates in the range of 1000–8000 Hz using conventional counting modes. Changing the bit depth of a counting detector, such that only values of 0 or 1 can be recorded at each pixel, allows one to decrease the dwell time and increase the frame rate to 12.5 kHz, reducing the electron exposure of the sample for a given beam current. Atomically resolved phase contrast of an aluminosilicate zeolite (ZSM-5) is observed from sparse diffraction patterns with isolated individual electrons, demonstrating the potential of binary ptychography as a low-dose 4D STEM technique.},

However, epitaxially growing CZTS on Si can be challenging. Here, we heteroepitaxially grow tetragonal Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (CZTS) thin films on single crystalline cubic Si (111) wafers with a 4° miscut by simple and low-cost radio frequency magnetron sputtering from a single target. The CZTS film displays a mirror-like surface with a surface roughness of 8.46 nm. The absorption coefficients of the epitaxial CZTS are over 10 4 cm −1 at 1.5 eV and 1.0 × 10 5 cm −1 at 2.1 eV. The bandgap is 1.45 eV, and the photoluminescence lifetime is 7.04 ns.

The fabricated biosensors demonstrate a good linear current/voltage response to a label-free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) target over a broad concentration range of 100 fg/ml to 10 ng/ml in both 0.1× and 1× phosphate buffered saline solutions. Specifically, the sensitivity variation approaches 8.7\% dec −1 at the critical concentration level of 2–8 ng/ml that enters the normal PSA region in the human body.

  abstract     = {The interaction between an acoustically driven microbubble and a surface is of interest for a variety of applications, such as ultrasound imaging and therapy. Prior investigations have mainly focused on acoustic effects of a rigid boundary, where it was generally observed that the wall increases inertia and reduces the microbubble resonance frequency. Here we investigate the response of a lipid-coated microbubble adherent to a rigid wall. Firm adhesion between the microbubble and a glass surface was achieved through either specific (biotin/avidin) or nonspecific (lipid/glass) interactions. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was used to verify conditions leading to either adhesion or non-adhesion of the bubble to a glass or rigid polymer surface. Individual microbubbles were driven acoustically to sub-nanometer-scale radial oscillations using a photoacoustic technique. Remarkably, adherent microbubbles were shown to have a higher resonance frequency than non-adherent microbubbles resting against the wall. Analysis of the resonance curves indicates that adhesion stiffens the bubble by an apparent increase in the shell elasticity term and decrease in the shell viscosity. Based on these results, we conclude that surface adhesion is dominant over acoustic effects for low-amplitude microbubble oscillations.},

  abstract     = {Supercooling has recently emerged as a highly promising, multi-scale technique for low-temperature preservation of organs and tissues, preventing damaging ice formation while requiring relatively low doses of added cryoprotectants. However, current supercooling techniques are not thermodynamically stable; mild agitations can cause rapid and destructive ice formation throughout the system, rendering them unsuitable for transportation and sharply limiting applicability outside the controlled laboratory environment. In this experimental study, we report a simple thermodynamic alteration to standard supercooling protocols, the use of constant-volume (isochoric) conditions, which substantially increases the stability of the system in the face of various macroscopic perturbations, including drop-impact, vibration, ultrasonication, and thermal fluctuation. We identify this effect as driven by a possible combination of thermodynamic and kinetic factors, including reduction of microscopic density fluctuations, elimination of the air–water interface, and significant resistance to cavitation.},

The film is embedded with fluorescent elastic microspheres that emit light under appropriate excitation. These microspheres can be compressed under external pressure, and they fully recover as pressure is released. This pressure-induced deformation causes variations in microsphere emission intensity, establishing a quantitative relationship between pressure and emission intensity. Furthermore, this film has the potential for shear-force sensing via the use of digital image correlation to measure the displacements of microspheres under shear force. This functional film has an impressively broad scope of sensing applications, such as in air-flows, underwater, and in tactile-based settings.},

The silicon chip transfers incident plane ultrasonic waves into a vortex beam, which traps particles in the center of the device and exerts torque on the particles simultaneously. As an illustration, we put living shrimp eggs inside the acoustic vortex and observe the acoustic driving rotation. The rotation frequency of the shrimp egg can be easily controlled, and its relationship between driving voltage and the egg size is established.

A specifically designed proximity-effect-correction algorithm is applied to mitigate the proximity effect occurring in the electron-beam lithography process. The IDTs with a period of 160 nm and a finger width of 35 nm are achieved, enabling a frequency of ∼30 GHz on lithium niobate based SAW devices. Both centrosymmetric type and axisymmetric type IDT structures are fabricated, and the results show that the centrosymmetric type tends to excite lower-order Rayleigh waves and the axisymmetric type tends to excite higher-order wave modes.

The strain values are estimated from high-resolution x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy in 4-cm bend-down and −4-cm bend-up test conditions. The strain-induced piezoelectric polarization can alter the charge density of the 2DEG in the channel at the AlGaN/GaN interface and thus modify the output characteristics of the flexible HEMTs. Accordingly, output characteristics show an increase in output current by 3.4\% in the bend-down condition and a decrease by 4.3\% in the bend-up condition. Transfer characteristics show a shift of threshold voltage, which also supports the 2DEG channel modulation during bending. Computational simulation based on the same structure confirms the same current modulation effect and threshold voltage shift. Furthermore, the electrical characteristics of the flexible HEMTs show a repeatable dependence on the strain effect, which offers potential for electro-mechanical device applications.},

Scanning TEM–EDX elemental analyses showed that the nanowire crystals were composed of tantalum and nitrogen with small amounts of oxygen. The presence of the melted ammonium halides combined with supercritical ammonia acting as a reactive flux at high pressure and temperature played a significant role in the nanowire crystal growth. Raman spectroscopy performed on several single crystal nanowires pointed toward metallic properties, and the temperature dependence of the magnetization measured by Superconducting Quantum Interference Device magnetometry suggested a superconducting transition about 6.2 K.

  abstract     = {Domain-wall dynamics under strong, super-coercive electric fields in polycrystalline bismuth ferrite (BiFeO 3 ) are not well established due to the experimental difficulties in processing high phase purity perovskite with low electrical conductivity. Overcoming these difficulties, here we present x-ray diffraction measurements carried out in situ during electrical poling with a trapezoidal electric-field to investigate the domain wall dynamics and lattice strain in this material. It is observed that during field ramping, microscopic strains, i.e., non-180° domain texture and lattice strain, increase simultaneously. During DC field dwell, however, a lattice strain decrease occurs over time, accompanied by an increase in the non-180° domain texture. This inverse time-dependent trend of microscopic strain mechanisms is speculated to be due to mobile charged defects residing in domain wall regions. The configuration of these charged point defects may also play a role in the observed post-poling relaxations of non-180° domain texture and macroscopic piezoelectric coefficients on removal of the field. Since conducting domain walls have been recently identified in a number of ferroelectrics, these results should significantly impact the understanding of strain mechanisms not only in BiFeO 3 but on a broader range of ferroelectric materials.},

Spin-polarized resonance states evolving between the foremost atom of a magnetic probe tip and the opposed magnetic surface atom are found to provide a loophole from the hitherto existing dilemma of losing spatial resolution when increasing the tip-sample distance in a scanning probe setup. Bias-dependent series of SP-STM images recorded via resonant tunneling reveal spin sensitivity at resonance conditions, indicating that the spin-polarized resonance states act as mediators for the spin contrast across the nm-spaced vacuum gap. With technically feasible distances in the nm regime, resonant tunneling in SP-STM qualifies for a spin-sensitive read-write technique with ultimate lateral resolution in future spintronic applications.},

  abstract     = {In this work, undoped semiconductors, germanium (Ge) and germanium tin (GeSn), were grown on ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films using ultra-high vacuum molecular beam epitaxy. The crystallinity of the structure was determined from x-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Both spin pumping and inverse spin Hall effects (ISHEs) of YIG/Ge and YIG/GeSn heterojunctions have been investigated with the help of broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). We observe that the spin mixing conductances of YIG/Ge (60 nm) and YIG/GeSn (60 nm) are 5.4 × 10 18 m −2 and 7.2 × 10 18 m −2 , respectively, responsible for giant spin current injection. Furthermore, it is found that spin pumping injects giant spin current from ferrimagnetic YIG into the Ge semiconductor. The infrared laser modulated ISHE was examined using heavy metal platinum as a spin current collector. Also, it has been noted that the variation in the power of laser irradiation significantly changed the ISHE voltage of YIG/Ge/Pt spin junctions, saturated magnetization, FMR linewidth, and Gilbert damping parameter of YIG, which could be attributed to the laser-induced thermal effect. The outcomes from this study are promising for the development of Ge-based spintronic and magnonic devices.},

From the correlation between these parameters and the switching current density for current-induced switching, we found that the reduction in switching current density by oxygen exposure is caused by the combined effect of enhancement in spin–orbit torque and lowering of the switching energy barrier required for incoherent switching with the latter playing a dominant role in large samples.},

In this work, we investigate the relationship between the skyrmion dynamics and the characteristics of injected current in a skyrmion-based spin torque nano-oscillator, where the excitation source is introduced from a point nano-contact at the center of the nanodisk. It is found that the skyrmion will move away from the center of the nanodisk if it is driven by a spin-polarized current; however, it will return to the initial position in the absence of stimulus. Therefore, we propose a skyrmion-based artificial spiking neuron, which can effectively implement the leaky-integrate-fire operation. We study the feasibility of the skyrmion-based spiking neuron by using micromagnetic simulations. Our results may provide useful guidelines for building future magnetic neural networks with ultra-high density and ultra-low energy consumption.},

After removal of the fixed charge effect, there was an anomalous negative shift of V FB on (0001) 4H–SiC, which would be attributed to the result of dipole layer formation at the interface. The effects of the dipoles were investigated from the perspective of the SiO 2 /4H–SiC band alignment shift. We could find the correlation between the shift of V FB and that of the band alignment between SiO 2 and the 4H–SiC interface; we concluded that stable Si–N bonds at the interface induce a dipole layer, and this is one of the reasons for the unexpected shift reported for V FB or threshold voltage of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, as well as the fixed charge effects. A significant difference in the band alignment on (0001) and (000–1) was also clarified, which would be one of the reasons for the disagreement of V FB on those faces.},

Owing to the lattice matching between InSb and CdTe, layer-by-layer 2D growth of InSb is observed from the initial growth stage. Both smooth surface morphology and low defect density of the as-grown InSb/CdTe heterostructures give rise to the enhancement of electron mobility when the InSb layer thickness is reduced below 30 nm as compared to the InSb/GaAs counterparts.

Understanding the influence of defects on electrical transport is of importance not only to resolve the long-standing question concerning the nature of TiS 2 , but also for the rational design of TiS 2 based devices for energy scavenging applications. In this study, we integrate photoemission spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical transport measurements to determine the chemical compositions dominated by defects and their influence on the doping and electrical properties. Our results demonstrate that TiS 2 is a heavily self-doped semiconductor with the Fermi level close to the conduction band, which serves as the conclusive experimental evidence regarding the semiconducting nature of TiS 2 . The doping effect is sensitive to the (subtle) changes in the chemical composition. The electron donation from the Ti interstitials (Ti i ) to the TiS 2 host explains the high carrier concentration. The Ti Frenkel pair (Ti F ) acting as the acceptor is responsible for the decrease in the electron carrier concentration and electrical conductivity. High conductivity maintains upon partial oxidization, indicating the oxidization-tolerance in terms of the electronic structure. Our results provide valuable insight into the evolution of electronic properties modulated by defects that reveal unambiguously the self-doped semiconducting nature of TiS 2 and chemical- and environment-tolerance of TiS 2 as an advanced energy scavenging material.},

Proton donors, such as hydrofluoric acid and superacids, are well known to provide highly effective short-term surface passivation. We demonstrate here that aprotic solutions based on bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)methane (TFSM) in hexane or pentane can also result in excellent passivation of (100)-orientation silicon surfaces. We show that the optimized TFSM-pentane passivation scheme can measure effective lifetimes up to 20 ms, with a surface recombination velocity of 1.7 cm s −1 at an excess carrier density of 10 15 cm −3 . Fitting injection-dependent lifetime curves requires chemical passivation and field effect passivation from a negatively charged layer with a charge density of 10 10 –10 11 q cm −2 . The slightly higher recombination velocity of 2.3 cm s −1 measured with TFSM-hexane can be explained by a lower charge density in the passivating layer, suggesting that the steric hindrance associated with the solvent size could play a role in the passivation mechanism. Finally, phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance experiments confirm that TFSM-based solutions have Lewis acidity without being superacids, which opens up opportunities for them to be used in materials systems sensitive to superacidic environments.},

In the present study, the focusing performance of an ellipsoidal mirror was evaluated using soft x-rays in the soft x-ray beamline BL25SU-a of SPring-8. The focus sizes were measured at photon energies of 300, 400, and 500 eV. A quantitative figure error of the ellipsoidal mirror was also evaluated by analyzing the wavefield of the focused beam retrieved using ptychography. The figure error distributions measured at different photon energies agreed with each other at a root mean square level of 1 nm. The developed focusing system can be used for various types of microscopy, allowing the use of a wide range of x-ray energies.},

Here, we propose an effective traveling photothermal mirror method to decouple the thermo-electronic effect for characterization of thermal properties of a semi-insulating GaAs wafer as a demonstration. A theoretical model is presented for describing the dynamic processes of the thermal and plasma waves in the sample as well as the heat coupling between the sample and the surrounding fluid under the excitation of a laser beam traveling at a constant velocity. Based on the solution to the diffusion equations, we obtain the phase shift introduced to another probe beam associated with the photothermal signal due to the thermoelastic and electronic-strain responses of the sample and the refractive index gradient of the fluid. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that the steady-state process in the laser–material interaction makes the electronic effect act as an insensitive constant background in the photothermal signal, and the thermodynamic process is governed by the thermal properties of the sample. The distinct advantage of the traveling photothermal signal being immune to the variation of the electronic transport parameters allows the thermal diffusivity of the sample to be accurately determined from the best fit to the signal, and the traveling excitation nature of the method provides a way for high-efficiency photothermal imaging to identify thermal defects.},

However, in a multiqubit device, the physical form of couplings between qubits is either an electric (capacitor) or magnetic field (inductor), and the associated quadratic field energy determines that only two-body interaction in the Hamiltonian can be directly realized. Here, we propose and experimentally synthesize a three-body spin-chirality interaction in a superconducting circuit based on Floquet engineering. By periodically modulating the resonant frequencies of the qubits connected with each other via capacitors, we can dynamically turn on and off qubit–qubit couplings and further create chiral flows of the excitations in the three-qubit circular loop. Our result is a step toward engineering dynamical and many-body interactions in multiqubit superconducting devices, which potentially expands the degree of freedom in quantum simulation tasks.},

Gradient S doping creating a cascade valence band structure in Sb 2 Se 3 simultaneously enhances its onset potential and fill factor.

Minor passivation drops limit the functioning of solar cells; however, they are not detected in devices with open-circuit voltages below 700 mV. In this work, simulations and experiments were used to show the effect of localized surface defects on the overall device performance. Although the defects did not significantly affect lifetime measurements prior to electrode deposition or open-circuit voltage measurements at standard-test conditions, they had a significant impact on the point of operation and, in turn, device efficiency (up to several percent efficiency drop). Furthermore, this study demonstrates that localized defects can have a detrimental effect on well-passivated areas located several centimeters away through electrical connection by the electrode. This leads to a low-injection lifetime drop after electrode deposition. Thus, commonly measured lifetime curves before metallization (and therefore internal voltage) are usually not representative of their respective values after metallization. The low-injection lifetime drop often observed after electrode deposition can be derived from such local surface defects and not from a homogeneous passivation drop.},

Replacing the normal MMF with a tapered MMF (MMF-taper) has enhanced the fluorescence (FL) collection efficiency from the diamond and achieved a high spatial resolution NV-based endoscope. The MMF-taper&#39;s high FL collection efficiency is the direct result of multiple internal reflections in the tapered region caused by silica, which has a higher refractive index (RI) than the surrounding air. However, for applications involving fluidic environments whose RI is close to or higher than that of the silica, the MMF-taper loses its FL collection significantly. Here, to overcome this challenge and achieve a high spatial resolution NV-based endoscope in a fluidic environment, we conceptually proposed a tapered ultra-high numerical aperture microstructured optical fiber (MOF) whose air capillaries at the tapered end are sealed. Since the end-sealed air capillaries along the tapered MOF (MOF-taper) have isolated the MOF core from the surrounding medium, the core retains its high FL collection and NV excitation efficiency in liquids regardless of their RI values. Replacing the MMF-taper with the MOF-taper will achieve a versatile NV-based endoscope that could potentially find widespread applications in fluidic environments where many biological processes and chemical reactions occur.},

When NaEuF 4 NPs were incorporated into TiO 2 mesoporous layers, PSCs achieved power conversion efficiencies of 14.51\%, which were better than those of the control PSCs. The use of NaEuF 4 NPs for improving PSC photovoltaic performance, as shown herein, could encourage the greater use of solar energy.},

  abstract     = {Encapsulates are, in general, the passive components of any photovoltaic device that provides the required shielding from the externally stimulated degradation. Here we provide comprehensive physical insight depicting a rather non-trivial active nature, in contrast to the supposedly passive, atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown Al 2 O 3 encapsulate layer on the hybrid perovskite [(FA 0.83 MA 0.17 ) 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 2.5 Br 0.5 ] photovoltaic device having the configuration: glass/FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au/(±) Al 2 O 3 . By combining various electrical characterization techniques, our experimental observations indicate that the ALD chemistry produces considerable enhancement of the electronic conductivity of the spiro-OMeTAD hole transport medium (HTM), resulting in electronic modification of the perovskite/HTM interface. Subsequently, the modified interface provides better hole extraction and lesser ionic accumulation at the interface, resulting in a significant lowering of the burn-in decay and nearly unchanged charge transport parameters explicitly under the course of continuous operation. Unlike the unencapsulated device, the modified electronic structure in the Al 2 O 3 coated device is essentially the principal reason for better performance stability. Data presented in this communication suggest that the ionic accumulation at the spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface triggers the device degradation in the uncoated devices, which is eventually followed by material degradation, which can be avoided by active encapsulation.},

Here, we propose a strategy to induce “single-atom ferromagnetism” in three-dimensional graphene by Cu anchoring, wherein the Cu atoms are isolated with Cu–N 4 moieties, as demonstrated by extended x-ray absorption fine structure and spherical aberration correction transmission electron microscope measurements. Superconducting quantum interference device and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements reveal the clear ferromagnetism of single-atom Cu-anchored graphene with saturation magnetization of 1.15 emu/g at 2 K and 0.05 emu/g at 300 K, suggesting its promising applications in spintronics. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that the Cu–N 4 group can produce net magnetic moments and that the system favors the ferromagnetic stable state. More importantly, our DFT calculations show that anchoring single atoms of other transition metals can also realize single-atom ferromagnetism in graphene.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectric materials reveal an ultra-high piezoelectric effect because of their spontaneous polarization and show high potential for applications. At present, the lead-free piezoelectric materials are in a great demand because of their environmentally friendly character, but their performance needs to be improved. Generally, in order to enhance the piezoelectric coefficients, researchers could rely on a phase boundary and/or to grow single crystals. Here, a Ta-doped (K, Na)NbO 3 (KNN) single crystal with the orthorhombic–tetragonal (O–T) phase boundary is grown via the top-seed solution growth method. Excellent piezoelectric coefficients ( d 33 ≈ 560 pC/N via the Berlincourt method and d 33 * ≈ 1353 pm/V derived from strain-electric field loops) are achieved in a K 0.40 Na 0.60 Ta 0.41 Nb 0.59 O 3 single crystal. What is more, with the electric field rising from 0.5 kV/cm to 4 kV/cm, the converse d 33 and the strain hysteresis level improve from 580 pm/V to 640 pm/V and from 0.052 to 0.104, respectively. Our results clarify that the high d 33 can be attributed to the high domain density and the labyrinthine-domain structure. In addition, the electric-field-induced phase transition is also observed, which is supposed to cause the high d 33 * . This work not only reports the ultra-high piezoresponse of the KNN-based single crystal but also provides strong evidence for its mesoscale origin.},

Limited by the optical bandgap, most of the reported ferroelectric perovskites respond only to UV light or weakly respond to visible light below 550 nm. Herein, the photostrictive performance of CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 (CCTO) ceramics, with a low bandgap of ∼1.5 eV (ideal for solar spectrum absorption), is comprehensively investigated. Although the compound presents no ferroelectricity, in general, a giant photostriction of ∼10 −3 with a large photostrictive efficiency of ∼10 −11 m 3 /W in CCTO ceramics is observed by applying purple (405 nm), green (520 nm), and red (655 nm) laser illumination. Evidenced by the XRD peak shifts under external laser illumination and the phonon mode shifts via the power-dependent Raman spectrum, the light-induced non-thermal deformation in CCTO is attributed to the enhanced stretching of O–Ti–O chains and the distortions of TiO 6 octahedrons. The excellent and uniform photostrictive performance of CCTO ceramics in the visible-light region makes them potential candidates for practical applications in next-generation photo-driven electromechanical devices.},

This has been verified in several synthetic non-collinear magnetic structures. A magnetically soft and hard ferromagnetic layer combination in a bilayer structure can function as a field tunable non-collinear magnetic structure, which may offer magnetic field tunability of singlet-to-triplet pair conversion. From magnetization measurements of Nb/Co/Py/Nb multilayers, we demonstrate a reversible enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature of 400 mK by measuring T c with and without a non-collinear magnetic structure between Co and Py. The sensitivity of T c in these structures offers the potential for realizing magnetic field tunable Josephson junctions in which pair conversion and Josephson critical currents are controllable using modest magnetic fields.},

One example of this type of material is NiZnCu ferrite, whose working frequency limit is 40 MHz. Above this frequency, its large magnetic loss angle tangent ( ⁠ tan δ m ⁠ ), approximately equal to 0.29 at 100 MHz, seriously impairs the property of transformers. Generally, the magnetic losses in the MHz frequency band result from eddy-current loss, domain wall resonance, and natural resonance, specifically the high natural resonance loss. A way to decrease it is by increasing the resonance frequency ( ⁠ f r ⁠ ). However, the increase in f r is very difficult for the uniaxially anisotropic NiZnCu ferrite due to the Snoek limit. We present a composite of oriented Ce 2 Fe 17 N 3 microflakes and polyurethane in this letter. Although its true permeability is not as high as that of NiZnCu, the f r reaches 7.5 GHz. As a result, the tan δ m at 100 MHz is decreased to 0.015. This indicates that our material has a higher working frequency than NiZnCu and should make fabrication of a 100 MHz transformer possible.},

We observed the refraction and reflection of magnetostatic spin waves at the DW and reveal their characteristics that include negative refraction.

In this report, we show that suppression in the dark current with the enhancement in the photocurrent of a 2D-based photodetector, which is a prerequisite for photoresponse enhancement, can be achieved by constructing an ideal p‐n junction based on functionalizing n-type 2D-MoS 2 with p-type quantum dots (QDs). Highly crystalline solution-processed manganese oxide QDs (MnO QDs) are synthesized via the pulsed femtosecond laser ablation technique in ethanol. The ablated MnO QDs are spray-coated on an exfoliated 2D-MoS 2 substrate with interdigitated Au electrodes through N 2 -assisted spraying. In the resulting MnO QD-decorated 2D-MoS 2 photodetector with a heterojunction, dark current is reduced and is accompanied by photocurrent enhancement, thereby markedly improving the photoresponsivity and detectivity of MoS 2 -based devices. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms contributing to this enhancement, power- and wavelength-dependent photoresponses, along with material characterizations based on spectroscopic, chemical, morphological measurements, and analyses, are discussed.},

  abstract     = {A cross-point memory architecture will be adopted to make the most of the suitability of resistance change memories for high integration. To achieve this, the development of a selector device that is connected in series to the memory and helps to remove the sneak path current flowing through unselected and half-selected cells is an urgent requirement. In this Letter, we developed a selector based on a simple sandwiched structure of Pt/CoO/ITO and confirmed the nonpolar threshold resistance switching that does not require the first fire process. The selector showed an excellent performance of a very small dispersion of the threshold voltages and resistance in the OFF state with the relative standard deviations of less than 2\% each, as well as the quick transition between the OFF and ON states within 50 ns. The scaling law was confirmed in the current, both in the ON and OFF states, I ON and I th ⁠ . It allows us to analyze I ON and I th ⁠ , based on which we can reduce the area of the device. The current conduction of the Pt/CoO/ITO selector is ruled by the trap-controlled space charge limited current (SCLC), and the threshold switching from ON to OFF states and vice versa is caused by the transition from the trap-unfilled to the trap-filled SCLC and vice versa , respectively.},

We consider a TE heterojunction circuit consisting of a central region sandwiched by source and drain regions. The energy flux transmission across the heterojunction can be tuned to exhibit perfect transmission near normal incidence (Klein tunneling) for one valley and perfect reflection (anti-Klein tunneling) for the other valley by controlling the WSM phases of the heterojunction. Perfect valley-polarized transmission occurs when the dispersion tilt to Fermi velocity ratio in the source region is reciprocal to that in the central barrier region. This unusual flux transmission is ascribed to two factors, i.e., perfect pseudospin (sublattice) polarization at normal incidence and complete decoupling of one of the sublattice polarizations at the critical velocity ratio. The emergence of anti-Klein tunneling by design in TE circuits suggests a possible realization of the effect in real WSM materials.},

The effect of electron-beam irradiation on the strength of a ZnO single crystal in the presence and absence of irradiation through scanning electron microscopy was investigated. The electron-beam irradiation significantly decreased the ZnO shear strength, but halting the irradiation restored the strength. A first-principles analysis indicated that the ideal shear strength was decreased by hole doping. Our results implied that the change in strength was due to a decrease in the bond strength caused by the presence of holes, thereby suggesting that material strength can be rewritten by controlling the excess electrons/holes.},

  abstract     = {The investigation of acoustic emission (AE) reveals mixing of avalanche processes in porous 316L stainless steel. One avalanche mechanism relates to the movement of dislocations, the other to crack propagation. Both mechanisms occur under different external tensions: small tension dislodges dislocations while crack propagation occurs at much higher tension close to the mechanical failure point. In an intermediate overlap regime, both effects occur simultaneously. The avalanche related power laws show a mixing behavior where the higher avalanche exponents form an upper limit for the mixing curve and the lower exponent is approached asymptotically for strong AE signals. The power law probability distribution functions, show a characteristic upwards bend near the crossover between the two mechanisms. The three regimes, namely, the dislocation movement, mixing, and crack propagation, are confirmed by other avalanche characteristics: the sparseness of the AE spectra, the avalanche exponents of energy, amplitude, and duration. Only the crack propagation follows mean field predictions, while the dislocation movements (in confined spaces) deviates significantly from mean field behavior with much greater exponents than those predicted in this approximation. We demonstrate that apparent deviations from scale invariance are, in reality, the result of two superimposed avalanche processes whereby each of them remains scale invariant. The seeming deviations from scale invariance are actually superposition effects.},

The formation of reliable Ohmic contacts that persist to cryogenic temperature is essential for the exploration of quantum transport in the diamond 2D conducting channel. Herein, the contact properties of Pd on H-terminated diamond have been fully investigated down to 4 K using transmission line method measurements. Pd is shown to form an Ohmic contact on H-terminated diamond with linear I – V characteristics and low specific contact resistance in the range of (8.4 ± 1) ×10 −4 Ω·cm 2 to (1.3 ± 0.2) ×10 −3 Ω·cm 2 for the temperature range of 300 K–4 K. This is in stark contrast to reference devices with Au/Pt/Ti contacts, which exhibit a significant temperature dependence and non-Ohmic behavior at low temperature. Using 2D thermionic emission theory, a negative Schottky barrier height (SBH), − 23 ± 1 meV, between Pd and H-terminated diamond has been determined, in comparison to a positive SBH of 42 ± 1 meV for the Au/Pt/Ti/H-terminated diamond interface. These results show that Pd serves as an excellent candidate for forming reliable Ohmic contacts on H-terminated diamond for enabling precise electrical transport measurements at cryogenic temperature.},

Considering the increasing scope and demand of varying spectral range (UV-C to NIR) photodetectors, the systematic variation of the available density of states (DOS) at a particular energy level in CuO nanostructures has been utilized to fabricate dual-band (250 nm and 900 nm), broadband (250 nm–900 nm), and UV-C (250 nm) photodetectors. The sensitivity and detectivity of the photodetector for broadband detectors were ∼10 3 and 2.24 × 10 11 Jones for the wavelengths of 900 nm and 122 and 2.74 × 10 10 Jones for 250 nm wavelength light, respectively. The UV-C detector showed a sensitivity of 1.8 and a detectivity of 4 × 10 9 Jones for 250 nm wavelength light.

Within this class of materials are ferrimagnets, whose magnetization can be reduced to zero by tuning parameters such as the chemical composition, temperature, and strain. Compared to conventional antiferromagnets, compensated ferrimagnets not only possess the aforementioned speed and density advantages but also allow the use of convenient electrical reading and writing mechanisms due to the existence of inequivalent magnetic sublattices.

The model considers both the drift of the dc-bias current to compensate for the wavelength aging of the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and the variation in the modulation index of the light field generated by the VCSEL. We investigated the dc-bias-current-dependency of the frequency drift in an atomic clock module both theoretically and experimentally, confirming that the frequency drift can change as a function of the VCSEL basic parameters. When the atomic clock module was operated over a period of five months at the dc-bias current affording a zero-crossing of the clock frequency drift, the Allan standard deviation and clock frequency drift for long-term stability were 8.0 × 10 − 12 for averaging times of 4 × 10 6 s and 2.4 × 10 − 13 /day, respectively.

Two metrics characterizing the attenuation were identified, which allow us to quantitatively evaluate the differences between the manufactured samples.

We report a 3D mm-wave cavity with a measured single-photon internal quality factor of 3 × 10 7 and mode volume of 0.14 × λ 3 at 98.2 GHz, sufficient to reach strong coupling in a Rydberg cavity quantum electrodynamics system. An in situ piezotunability of 18 MHz facilitates coupling to specific atomic transitions. Our unique, seamless, and optically accessible resonator design is enabled by the realization that intersections of 3D waveguides support tightly confined bound states below the waveguide cutoff frequency. Harnessing the features of our cavity design, we realize a hybrid mm-wave and optical cavity, designed for interconversion and entanglement of mm-wave and optical photons using Rydberg atoms.},

In the presence of a small magnetic field (25 mT), the electrical conductivity is enhanced by 16\% and, simultaneously, the Seebeck coefficient is enhanced by 23\%. The presence of CFO nanoparticles in the matrix of Bi 2 Te 3 in the nanocomposite produces an interpenetrating network of the magnetically induced orientation of the magnetic moment of CFO, which results in the substantial reduction in the interface barrier by suppressing scattering of charge carriers at the interfaces. The simultaneous enhancement in the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient in the presence of the small magnetic field resulted in an ∼52\% enhancement of figure of merit for the Bi 2 Te 3 –CFO (4 wt.\%) nanocomposite.},

  abstract     = {Numerous endeavors have been made to advance thermoelectric SnTe for potential applications. Effective strategies focus on the manipulation of transport properties, including valence band convergence, resonate state, and defect engineering. It has been demonstrated that alloying trivalent Bi or chalcogenide SnSe alone in SnTe can trigger an inherent enhancement of thermoelectric performance. However, what the critical role in the transport valence band co-doping Bi and Se in SnTe plays is still unclear. Particularly, fully evaluating the effect of band convergence on the carrier concentration-dependent weighted mobility, which dominates the electronic performance, is primary and essential for designing excellent thermoelectric materials. Here, we report that Bi doping in SnTe–SnSe alloys can derive a distinct decrease in the energy offset between the two valence bands, thus improving the density-of-state effective mass by only slightly deteriorating the mobility. The well-established theoretical model reveals that the Bi-doping-induced band convergence and the optimized carrier concentration actually enhance the weighted mobility, contributing to the improvement of electronic performance. Moreover, the Debye–Callaway model demonstrates the origin of the reduced lattice thermal conductivity. The present results confirm the potential of transport engineering in promoting thermoelectric performance.},

For the compression process, finite-rate equilibration can be achieved by increasing and then decreasing the stiffness of the potential to the final stiffness according to the shortcuts-to-isothermal (ScI) protocol. On the other hand, the realization of the ScI expansion is experimentally impossible with optical tweezers due to the requirement of a negative stiffness. Here, we propose a simple and elegant method to resolve this problem and demonstrate the ScI expansion by using the optical feedback trap capable of creating an arbitrary spatiotemporal potential even with a negative stiffness. In addition, we check the thermodynamic energetics such as work, heat, and internal energy, which indeed obey stochastic thermodynamics. Our method provides the possibility of a Brownian heat engine with maximum efficiency but non-vanishing power.},

  abstract     = {The transport of soft particles through narrow channels or pores is ubiquitous in biological systems and industrial processes. On many occasions, the particles deform and temporarily block the channel, inducing a built-up pressure. This pressure buildup often has a profound effect on the behavior of the respective system; yet, it is difficult to be characterized. In this work, we establish a quantitative correlation between the built-up pressure and the material and geometry properties through experiments and mechanics analysis. We fabricate microgels with a controlled diameter and elastic modulus by microfluidics. We then force them to individually pass through a constrictive or straight confining channel and monitor the pressure variation across the channel. To interpret the pressure measurement, we develop an analytical model based on the Neo-Hookean material law to quantify the dependence of the maximum built-up pressure on the radius ratio of the elastic sphere to the channel, the elastic modulus of the sphere, and two constant parameters in the friction constitutive law between the sphere and the channel wall. This model not only agrees very well with the experimental measurement conducted at large microgel deformation but also recovers the classical theory of contact at small deformation. Featuring a balance between accuracy and simplicity, our result could shed light on understanding various biological and engineering processes involving the passage of elastic particles through narrow channels or pores.},

These results atomistically confirm that a critical radius of nucleation exists for heterogeneous nucleation. Based on these simulations, an analytical model is developed to predict the critical width required for bubble nucleation at the nanoscale.

Although its formation occurs on a time scale of ∼100 ns, it is the plasma&#39;s decay dynamics on longer time scales that dictates the fluxes and energy distribution of the produced ions. Therefore, the plasma decay also determines the overall impact on plasma-facing EUV optical components. Enabled by electron density measurements using Microwave Cavity Resonance Spectroscopy at a much higher sensitivity, we clearly show the breakdown of the ambipolar field in an EUV photon-induced plasma below electron densities of ∼2 × 10 12 m −3 and the—until now—unidentified transition from ambipolar diffusion-driven decay into a decay regime driven by free diffusion. These results not only further improve the understanding of elementary processes in this type of plasma but also have a significant value for modeling and predicting the stability and lifetime of optical components in EUV lithography.},

In the present experimental study, the liquid films from two soap bubbles are brought together. Once the liquid layers initially separated by a gas sheet are bridged on a single spot, the rapid merging of the two liquid films proceeds. Thereby, the connecting rim is rapidly accelerated into the separating gas layer. We show that, due to the dimple formation, the velocity is not uniform and the high acceleration initially causes a Rayleigh–Taylor instability of the liquid rim. At later times, the rim heals and takes on a circular shape. However, for sufficiently high concentrations of the surfactant, the unstable rim pinches off microbubbles, resulting in a fractal dendritic structure after coalescence.},

Observations using SKPM show that the surface potential of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure remained nearly unchanged (∼1.08 eV) as the thickness of the AlGaN barrier was reduced from 18.5 to 5.5 nm and likely originated from the surface pinning effect. This led to a significant depletion of 2DEG from 9.60 × 10 12 to 1.53 × 10 12 cm −2 , as determined by Hall measurements, toward a normally OFF 2DEG channel. Based on a consistent solution of the Schrödinger–Poisson equations and analytical simulations, approximately 3.50 × 10 13 cm −2 of positive fixed charges were confirmed to be induced by a 20-nm LPCVD-SiN x passivation over the AlGaN/GaN heterostructures.

The former modifies the crucial dewetting parameters periodically, i.e., the surface curvature, while the latter provides energy for Au atoms&#39; surface diffusion. The extinction spectrum shows a prominent enhancement in local surface plasmon resonance, over 5 times in the visible region, which is due to the periodicity and high-density in NP distribution.

A means to monitor the spatial distribution of the nano-dopants is highly desirable but often possible only a posteriori and with destructive techniques. Here we present a spectroscopic characterization based on different plasmonic responses of silver nanoparticles, their agglomerates, and finally the percolated silver film. We demonstrate its usefulness for the specific case of their dispersion in layer-by-layer polymeric films but the method is extendable to any other host material transparent in the visible/near UV range. Individual silver nanoparticles display the well-known localized surface plasmon resonance around 400 nm, which is red-shifted upon inter-particle coupling. The transition regime between weakly coupled particles and fully percolated metal films is, however, much harder to evidence unambiguously. We show here how to monitor this transition using the so-called Ferrell plasmon, a plasmonic mode of the thin film in the mid-UV, and excitable only under oblique irradiation but without specific coupling precautions. We can thus follow the entire transition from isolated to coupled and finally to fully agglomerated nanoparticles by optical spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {Herein, we quantitatively investigated the mechanisms of interfacial phonon mismatch and quantum confinement underlying the phonon bottleneck effect in InN/In x Ga (1−x) N multiple quantum wells. Obvious extension of carrier thermalization with the longest relaxation time of 4.75 ns due to an enhanced phonon bottleneck effect was observed. It was found that a stronger quantum confinement could effectively reduce carrier relaxation rate via improving the elastic carrier–carrier scattering, while a larger phonon mismatch may give a higher initial carrier temperature due to the reflection of optical phonons and probably confinement of quasi-optical phonons. This study provides an essential theoretical insight into photovoltaic and other optoelectronic devices aiming to reduce the carrier relaxation rate via the phonon bottleneck effect.},

We find that minimum-energy bilayers of two compounds of this class, with stoichiometries Ni ( CO ) 4 and Pd ( CO ) 4 ⁠ , are intrinsic topological insulators although their isolated single-layer components are trivial metals. The first-principles results for the single-layer and bilayer systems are reproduced by tight-binding models.

A metallic interdigitated transducer (IDT) launches surface waves that propagate through a conventional piezoelectric GaAs substrate and couple to large-scale monolayer CVD graphene films resting on its surface. Based on the induced acousto-electric current, we characterize the frequency domains of the transducer from its first to the third harmonic. We find an oscillatory attenuation of the surface acoustic wave (SAW) velocity depending on the conductivity of the graphene layer. The acousto-electric current reveals an additional fine structure that is absent in pure magneto-transport. In addition, we find a shift between the acousto-electric longitudinal voltage and the velocity change of the SAW. We attribute this shift to the periodic strain field from the propagating SAW that slightly modifies the Dirac cone.},

  abstract     = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be used in many different applications. Field emission (FE) measurements were used together with Raman spectroscopy to show a correlation between the microstructure and field emission parameters. However, field emission characterization does not suffer from fluorescence noise present in Raman spectroscopy. In this study, Raman spectroscopy is used to characterize vertically aligned CNT forest samples based on their D/G band intensity ratio (I D /I G ), and FE properties such as the threshold electric field, enhancement coefficient, and anode to CNT tip separation (ATS) at the outset of emission have been obtained. A relationship between ATS at first emission and the enhancement factor, and, subsequently, a relationship between ATS and the I D /I G are shown. Based on the findings, it is shown that a higher enhancement factor (∼3070) results when a lower I D /I G is present (0.45), with initial emissions at larger distances (∼47 μ m). For the samples studied, the morphology of the CNT tips did not play an important role; therefore, the field enhancement factor (β) could be directly related to the carbon nanotube structural properties such as breaks in the lattice or amorphous carbon content. Thus, this work presents FE as a complementary tool to evaluate the quality of CNT samples, with the advantages of a larger probe size and an averaging over the whole nanotube length. Correspondingly, one can find the best field emitter CNT according to its I D /I G .},

The distribution of “jerks” (singularities of potential energy change) was found to follow a power law distribution below a Vogel–Fulcher temperature, mainly related to the movement of kinks in domain boundaries. We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the nucleation, scattering, and annihilation of phonons that are generated by the nucleation and propagation of such kinks. The interaction and scattering of phonons are correlated over a short time period and gradually become uncorrelated before annihilation at large temperature intervals. The movement and interaction of phonons show avalanche behavior. The probability of finding energy jerks follows a power law with exponents around 2.5–3. The distribution of waiting times between jerks also follows a power law. At temperatures above the Vogel–Fulcher temperature, scattering with thermal phonons becomes predominant and no phononic avalanches were observed.},

It is of importance to study the effect of antidots on the magnetic field of a vortex and its temperature dependence. In our experiment, single vortices pinned at artificial antidots of different sizes as well as vortex pinned by random defects are investigated by using a scanning Hall probe microscope. At a certain height above the superconductor surface, the morphology of the vortices at various temperatures has been directly imaged. We have shown that the magnetic field distribution and its temperature dependences for all pinned vortices are similar. For both types of antidots, the penetration depth, rather than the antidot size, plays a dominant role in determining their vortex size at various temperatures. Ginzburg–Landau simulations well support our experiments. The results set the stage for further theoretical analysis of the local field variations of the pinned vortices with temperature as well as for the design and fine tuning of pinned vortex lattices that can be used as magnetic templates for other systems.},

This shift is found to be very sensitive to pressure, with the SRT temperatures increasing at a rate of ≈ 17 K/GPa. To explain the experimental results, we have also performed first-principles calculations of the SRT temperatures for different applied strains, which corroborate the experimental findings. The calculations attribute the pressure dependence of the SRTs to a faster weakening of the Co contribution to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy with pressure compared to the Nd contribution.},

In this study, the magnetic moment of Fe in an Fe–Pd alloy thin film was increased through hydrogen absorption, as evidenced by the enhanced x-ray magnetic circular dichroism signal of Fe. Hydrogen absorption and desorption hysteresis loops in the magnetic coercivity H c - P H 2 diagram revealed that most hydrogen was absorbed when P H 2 was above 10 mbar and desorbed when P H 2 was approximately 10 –6 mbar. The hydrogenation effect on the magnetism of an Fe–Pd alloy film was eliminated at an annealing temperature of 360 K without considerable hydrogen desorption. The annealing-driven cyclic enhancement of H c was demonstrated because of the competition between thermal activation and H bonding. These results clearly reveal the critical temperature dependence and provide applicable knowledge of the hydrogenation effect on magnetic Pd-alloys.},

This current response time decreases from 29 fs for the thickest films to 7 fs for the thinnest films. The macroscopic response time is not strictly proportional to the conductivity. This excludes the existence of a single relaxation time universal for all conduction electrons. We must assume a distribution of microscopic momentum relaxation times. The macroscopic response time depends on the average and variation of this distribution; the observed deviation between the response time and conductivity scaling corresponds to the scaling of the variation. The variation of microscopic relaxation times depends on the film thickness because electrons with different relaxation times are affected differently by the confinement since they have different mean free paths.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic flux modulation technology aims to shift the low frequency or dc magnetic field to a higher frequency band and avoid the influence of 1/f noise in a magnetoresistance sensor. Despite decades of development, there are relatively few studies devoted to the impact of this technology on the noise characteristic of a magnetoresistance sensor. In this paper, we fabricated a tunnel magnetoresistance sensor integrated with a magnetic flux modulation structure and explored the noise characteristics under modulation. It was found that the noise at the modulation frequency will increase significantly when the external magnetic field is large, and this is caused by the ac magnetic field after modulation. The maximum value of noise at the modulation frequency is up to 12 μ V/√Hz under modulation, which is 63 times higher than that without modulation. Obviously, this result indicates that magnetic flux modulation technology may be ineffective in reducing 1/f noise. Fortunately, it was also observed that when the external magnetic field is small, the noise increase is not obvious. Based on this, we proposed a magnetic field tracking compensation method to keep the measured magnetic field constantly close to zero and prevent the deterioration of noise, no matter how the external magnetic field changes. A compensating coil was designed and manufactured to generate the compensating magnetic field. The test results show that the increase in noise under modulation can be well suppressed with magnetic field tracking compensation.},

Multiple absorption peaks that correspond to excitement states in magnetization dynamics appeared without the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) condition. The peaks were strongly influenced by a waveguide linewidth and a distance between the lines. Micromagnetics simulation reveals that each line induces a local magnetization dynamics oscillation and generates spin waves. The spin wave that propagates from one of the lines interacts with the other side of local magnetization dynamics oscillation around the other line, resulting in an amplification of the oscillation when they are in synchronization with each other. This amplification occurs at both sides of the lines by interference. Thus, the possible mechanism of the excitation in the magnetization dynamics oscillation is the synchronization of mutual magnetization dynamics oscillation via spin waves. This technique resonantly excites the local magnetization dynamics without the FMR condition, which is applicable as a highly coherent spin wave source.},

In this study, we investigated the SMF in ferrimagnetic GdFeCo alloy films using the spin-torque-induced ferromagnetic resonance method and clarified the relationship. The amplitude of the detected SMF becomes larger than that of the transition metal alloy FeCo by Gd doping and reaches the maximum near a Gd composition of the boundary between in-plane and perpendicularly magnetized films. According to the analytical calculation, the enhancement is related to the trajectory of the magnetization precession. Moreover, we find that the SMF induced by the magnetic resonance is inversely proportional to the square of the damping constant.},

The strain relaxation processes of the grown In x Ga 1− x N templates are accompanied by variations in the indium content (x) and lattice parameters ( a and c ) across the InGaN template&#39;s thickness as the residual strain is continuously decreasing. This strain and lattice parameters&#39; variation creates difficulties in applying standard x-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Reciprocal Space mapping (RSM) techniques to estimate the residual strain and the degree of the elastic strain relaxation. We used high-resolution High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to monitor the variations of the indium content, lattice parameters, and strain relaxation across the growing In x Ga 1− x N templates. We show that strain relaxation takes place by V-pit defect formation. Some of these V-pits are refilled by the GaN interlayers in the In x Ga 1− x N SB templates, while others propagate to the template surface. We present an alternative approach combining photoluminescence (PL) and EDS for estimating the degree of strain relaxation in these In x Ga 1− x N templates. The values obtained for the degree of relaxation estimated from TEM studies and PL measurements are within reasonable agreement in this study. Device quality In x Ga 1− x N templates with x ∼ 0.08, with a degree of relaxation higher than 70\%, are achieved.},

This study is based on the recently published compensated-pillar superjunction (cp-SJ) structure. A two-dimensional model for the electric field is analytically formulated using the Green&#39;s function method. Numerical calculations and TCAD simulations demonstrate that, for a given pillar depth, the p-SJ device has a lower BV than the d-SJ device with a wide pillar width. However, when the pillar width is less than 200 nm, both devices demonstrate a maximum BV that is close to the intrinsic structure. The R on , sp unified model for the cp-SJ device, taking into account the junction field-effect transistor (JFET) effect in the drift region, also demonstrates that the p-SJ device has a superior R on , sp over the d-SJ device. Considering the recently published impact ionization coefficients, the BV of the p-SJ device is analytically modeled as a function of the pillar depth. Finally, by applying the Lambert W-function, an exact closed-form relationship between R on , sp and BV is presented.},

  abstract     = {Ternary nitride compound semiconductors have attracted recent attention as electronic materials since their properties can be tuned by cation stoichiometry and ordering. A recently discovered example is MgZrN 2 , a ternary analog to the rock salt semiconductor ScN. MgZrN 2 has a larger bandgap and stronger dielectric response than the binary compound. Polycrystalline thin films of MgZrN 2 have been studied, but demonstration of high-quality growth is still required to establish its suitability for technological applications. Here, we report on epitaxial growth of MgZrN 2 thin films on (100) and (111) MgO substrates and (001) GaN templates. The MgZrN 2 composition is confirmed by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, showing no oxygen in the film except for a thin surface oxide layer. Epitaxial growth results in MgZrN 2 with x-ray diffraction rocking curves with a full-width at half-maximum in the range of 0.3–3.0°, depending on the substrate. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the MgZrN 2 film grown on a (111) MgO substrate confirms epitaxial growth and shows a sharp film/substrate interface. In-plane temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements show that the material is an n-type semiconductor with a relatively high concentration ( n 300K ≈ 10 19 –10 20 cm −3 ) of thermally activated electrons. Room-temperature transport measurements show a conductivity of 25 S cm −1 and a Seebeck coefficient of −80 μ V K −1 . Overall, these results provide an important step toward integration of rock salt MgZrN 2 with other technological nitrides for device applications.},

These measurements can be conducted using the internal resonance of higher harmonics generated with ultrasonic bulk, Rayleigh, and Lamb waves. However, these waves are spatially dispersive, making the evaluation very difficult. In this paper, we present the outcomes of an experimental study on the generation of higher harmonics with the fundamental mode of edge waves. This wave mode—an analog of the Rayleigh wave—propagates along the apex of an elastic plate, where the lateral plate surfaces naturally avoid spatial dispersion. In addition, this mode is weakly dispersive in the frequency domain enabling approximate internal resonance, which is required for the measurement of material nonlinearities. The current experimental results indicate that the second harmonic of the fundamental edge wave mode grows linearly with the propagation distance. The linear rate of accumulation of this harmonic can then be related to the nonlinear elastic properties as procured by previous theoretical studies.},

However, most of their high-pressure structures cannot be preserved at ambient conditions and little is known about how to control the properties of these materials recovered from high pressure. Here, we have manipulated the bandgap in a high-pressure-treated 2D organic-inorganic halide perovskite. We find that the bandgap of this compound can be largely altered by pressure-induced lattice disorder. Below 25 GPa, the phase transition is reversible and the thus-produced lattice distortion cannot be preserved after pressure release. In contrast, for the sample treated above 25 GPa, the structural disorder can be preserved at ambient pressure. Consequently, the bandgap of the sample can be profoundly tuned from 2.98 to 3.46 eV. These findings offer an extraordinary example for manipulating the structure and electronic properties of organic–inorganic perovskites by high pressure treatment.},

On the basis of theoretical simulations, it is demonstrated that the antinode regions of x-ray standing waves (XSWs) generated through wave guide structures allow one to measure the Fe diffused and Fe bulk parts independently, providing evidence for a diffused layer with reduced electron density and hyperfine fields. Due to possible small isolated clusters of Fe in the diffused layer, Fe moments are found with random orientations, while in Fe bulk moments, they are aligned in the film plane due to shape anisotropy.

[Proc. SPIE 4785 , 164 (2002)], they recognized that the specular scattering and the off-specular scattering could be spatially separated due to the tight neutron beam collimation in the scattering plane, a necessity for any reflectometry experiment. In this Letter, we show that it is possible to make large area measurements of periodic grating structures using SERGIS in a number of interesting scenarios. The SERGIS data can be analyzed using a dynamical theory, which makes it possible to effectively retrieve the lateral profile of a commercial periodic diffraction grating. Interestingly, this is still the case even when that grating is buried beneath a highly deuterated poly(methyl methacrylate-D8) polymer layer. We also clearly demonstrate that the maximum sensitivity to lateral structures is achieved when the specular reflection from the grating is excluded from the data analysis, demonstrating a feature of SERGIS that was proposed over two decades ago.},

The metallic surface state of stanene on Bi 2 Te 3 is characterized by an upward cone-like structure with a strong warping effect. Compared with the anisotropic Fermi surface of stanene on Bi 2 Te 3 modified by the hexagonal in-plane crystal field, the band dispersion of stanene on Sb 2 Te 3 steepens which is caused by the smaller in-plane lattice parameter, and the anisotropy of the Fermi surface evolves into quasi-isotropy. Band evolution, bandgap, and anisotropic effects of stanene are initially associated with the structural symmetry and lattice parameter, and this phenomenon can be used as a general rule extended to other similar low dimensional systems.},

  abstract     = {Endoscopic observation of biological tissues with quantitative depth perception, effective volumetric recognition of anatomical features, and efficient 3D navigation is critical for optical diagnostics and minimally invasive surgery for various target diseases. Light-field techniques have recently emerged as a promising approach to 3D photography and microscopy due to their scanning-free, highly scalable, and volumetric imaging capabilities. These advantages hold great potential for application to optical endoscopy, as the existing clinical endoscopy systems rely primarily on a 2D projection or use polarized glasses to provide visual parallax of complex 3D structures. Here, we report a light-field endoscopy prototype using a GRIN lens array (GLA). The GLA-based system maintains consistent spatial measurements with clinical endoscopic systems, a compact size in comparison with compound objective lenses, as well as the ability to maximally capture the angular information necessary for 3D imaging. We also present a computational strategy combining a wave-optics model and a hybrid point-spread function for high-resolution volumetric reconstruction. The system achieves spatial resolutions of 20–60 μ m and 100–200 μ m in the lateral and axial dimensions, respectively, across an imaging volume of ∼5 mm × 5 mm × 10 mm. We anticipate the prototype to offer a promising paradigm for glasses-free, high-resolution 3D medical endoscopy.},

However, the construction of a high quality junction between Si and small bandgap colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) remains a challenge, which limited their photodetecting performance in the short wavelength infrared region (1.4 μ m–3 μ m). Herein, a layer of solution processed ZnO nanoparticles was inserted between silicon and CQDs to passivate the surface dangling bond of silicon. This significantly reduces the carrier recombination between Si and CQDs. Meanwhile, the formation of the Si:CQD heterojunction structure enables effective carrier extraction. As a result, the photodetector shows the detecting range to the short wavelength infrared region (0.8 eV) and achieves a standard detectivity of 4.08 × 10 11 Jones at a bias of −0.25 V at room temperature.},

The geometrical parameters that characterize a grating can be optimized to achieve intense near-fields, which in turn enhance the nonlinear optical signals. For a nonlinear process that involves multiple frequencies, like four-wave mixing (FWM), the optimization of grating parameters necessary to enhance the radiation in-coupling for both frequencies is not trivial. Here, we propose, compute, and experimentally demonstrate a grating design that is resonant to two excitation frequencies and thus enhances the frequency mixing processes more efficiently. Second- and third-order nonlinear mechanisms are studied using two spatially and temporally overlapped laser pulses with different frequencies.

In this perspective, we critically examine the application of optical spectroscopy to characterize the quality of the transport layer-perovskite interface. We highlight the power of complementary studies that use both continuous wave and time-resolved photoluminescence to understand non-radiative losses and additional transient spectroscopies for characterizing the potential for loss-less carrier extraction at the solar cell interfaces.

However, most manipulation strategies involving SBS/SLS are limited to their large-area fabrication or sophisticated morphology designs, which distinctly hinders their practical uses. In this paper, we design and fabricate superhydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane narrowing dual rails (SNDRs) beneath a superhydrophilic stainless steel sheet by one-step femtosecond laser ablation. Our SNDR tracks are capable of transporting gas bubbles in various volumes from wide end to narrow end spontaneously and unidirectionally underwater, even when they are bent. The mechanical analysis for diverse geometrical dual-rail configurations in bubble transportation performance is further discussed. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the intriguing capability of lossless mixing of gas bubbles at a designed volume ratio on a multiple SNDR combination. This approach is facile and flexible, and will find broad potential applications such as intelligent bubble transport, mixing, and controllable chemical reactions in interfacial science and microfluidics.},

  abstract     = {Liquid-vapor phase-change cooling has a significant potential to facilitate the development of highly dense electronics by leveraging latent heat during the phase transition to remove heat from hotspots. A promising form of liquid–vapor phase-change cooling is coalescence-induced jumping droplet condensation, where droplet growth results in coalescence and gravity-independent jumping from the cold surface due to capillary-inertial energy conversion. Once the departed droplets reach the hotspot, heat is extracted via evaporation and through vapor return, subsequently spreading to the cold surface via condensation. Realizing the full potential of jumping droplet cooling requires a detailed understanding of the physics governing the process. Here, we examine the fundamental thermal and hydrodynamic limits of jumping droplet condensation. We demonstrate that jumping is mainly governed by the rate of droplet growth and fluid thermophysical properties. Timescale analysis demonstrates that the upper bound of water vapor jumping droplet condensation critical heat flux is ∼ 20 kW/cm 2 , significantly higher than that experimentally observed thus far due to surface structure limitations. Analysis of a wide range of available working fluids shows that liquid metals such as Li, Na, and Hg can obtain superior performance when compared to water.},

The device operation relies on controlling the waveguide&#39;s losses using a phase change material cell, which can be changed from amorphous (low-loss) to crystalline (high-loss). An extinction ratio as high as 11 dB was obtained between the amorphous (ON) and the crystalline (OFF) states of the MZI optical building block. The insertion loss of the MZI structure per cell unit length was measured to be as high as 0.87 dB/ μ m in the OFF state and as low as 0.064 dB/ μ m in the ON state for TM polarization.},

Meanwhile, the typical resistive switching characteristics and the functions of biomimetic synapses of the device were studied. The devices exhibit about +1.17/−1.62 V SET/RESET voltages, over 1.4 × 10 4 s retention, and excellent anti-fatigue properties. Simultaneously, the learning and memory functions, such as spiking-time-dependent plasticity, paired pulse facilitation, short-term plasticity, and short-term plasticity, might be simulated. The resistance switching mechanism is believed to be mainly related to the formation and destruction of oxygen vacancy filament channels by the analysis of XPS depth profiling.

Because the charge-injection barrier of ZAIS QDs without a wide-bandgap shell is relatively low, the QD-LEDs with red ZAIS QDs in combination with organic charge-transport materials induce electron injection from an organic electron-transport layer. These QD-LEDs exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 2.2\%, a turn-on voltage of 2.4 V, and red emission with chromaticity coordinates (0.66, 0.33).},

  abstract     = {We show that the charge transport properties of single crystals of rubrene can be well described without using polaron theories along the two high-mobility axes. The charge carriers can be considered as holes with coupling to the lattice but not to the degree, which requires the use of polaron theories. It is possible to use the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) in the relaxation time approximation (RTA) to evaluate mobilities due to various scattering mechanisms after introducing a transport reduction factor ( ⁠ P TRF ⁠ ). P TRF takes into account the fraction of charge carriers, which have path lengths that are larger than the lattice constant, and permits the use of the BTE in the RTA even when the magnitude of the overall mobility is lower than the value typically required for the use of the BTE. We are then able to calculate mobilities due to various scattering mechanisms. We calculate the effective electron–phonon coupling constant from the published values for various phonon modes. The values of the effective mass from calculations and measurements reported in the literature vary slightly; we assume an intermediate value for the effective mass. With no fitting parameters needed for calculating temperature-dependent mobilities for trap-free crystals, we are able to get excellent agreement with the measured values along the two high-mobility crystallographic directions. In samples, with some trapping, a small density of exponentially distributed trap states is assumed and gives a very good fit to the measured data. Our work provides strong evidence that it is not necessary to invoke polaronic effects to understand charge transport in rubrene crystals.},

Unlike the other optical phonon modes, the shear phonon mode was found to strongly couple with photoexcited carriers. Moreover, the amplitude of the shear mode surprisingly decreased with increasing excitation density, a phenomenon that can be attributed to be a consequence of the lattice temperature increasing after excitation. These results provide useful physical information on ultrafast lattice symmetry switching between the normal semimetal 1T′ and the lattice inversion symmetry breaking Type-II Weyl semimetal T d phases.},

The focus is on understanding the pressure effect on the ferroelectric properties of K 1− x Na x NbO 3 , which is critical to develop chemical doping strategies to achieve targeted performances via chemical strain engineering. Under pressure-free conditions, the K 0.5 Na 0.5 NbO 3 single crystal has a Curie temperature of around 673 K, which is the optimal operating temperature for the EC effect. We show that a hydrostatic pressure of around 7 GPa can reduce the optimal operating temperature to near room temperature, 300 K, at the expense of decreasing the EC temperature change Δ T EC from 5.4 K to 2.4 K when the applied electric field is 10 MV/m.

The shifting of V t toward higher voltage is due to the appearance of the Lorentz force and magnetoelectric effect when the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the flow of current. The resistance of the HRS and LRS increases simultaneously under the application of the magnetic field due to the induced Hall resistance effect.

Thicker samples provide a higher v modulation efficiency, and the v modulation magnitude of more than a factor of 100 times is observed in the thickest t Co of 0.98 nm. The parameter characterizing the creep motion is significantly affected by the EF, resulting in the modulation of v . Unlike the v case, the MA modulation efficiency decreases with increasing t Co . The present results are discussed based on the EF-induced change in the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (iDMI), which has been recently demonstrated in the same structure, and t Co dependence of the DW energy.

The calculated magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits strongly oscillating behavior at the electron-doping side, in strong contrast to the hole-doping side. The significant variation of the magnetic anisotropy energy vs electron doping concentration agrees well with experimental results. While the rigid-band approximation works well at the hole-doping side, electron doping induces significant changes in the electronic structure near the Fermi energy.

  abstract     = {Topological semimetals characterize a unique class of quantum materials hosting Dirac/Weyl fermions. The important features of topological fermions can be exhibited by quantum oscillations. Here, we report the magnetoresistance and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillation of longitudinal resistance in the single crystal of topological semimetal candidate Ta 3 SiTe 6 with a magnetic field up to 38 T. The periodic amplitude of the oscillations shows related information about the Fermi surface. The fast Fourier transformation spectra represent a single oscillatory frequency. The analysis of the oscillations shows the Fermi pocket with a cross sectional area of 0.13 Å −2 . Combining magneto-transport measurements and the first-principles calculation, we find that these oscillations come from the hole pocket. Hall resistivity and the SdH oscillations recommend that Ta 3 SiTe 6 is a hole dominated system.},

Here, we investigate the anomalous Hall effect in the bilayer all-vdW heterostructure of Fe 3 GeTe 2 (FGT)/WTe 2 . In such devices, the coercivity of thin-FGT flakes can be effectively modulated by the current, which is mainly attributed to the Joule heating effect generated at the interface of the FGT/WTe 2 bilayer because of the low interfacial thermal conductance. The gradient Δ H c /Δ J FGT is as large as 0.55 kOe MA −1 cm 2 at 10 K.

The “threshold current density” for expansion/contraction of 1SSF was determined by observing the 1SSF behavior, and it was converted to the “threshold excess carrier density” using the numerical calculation by device simulation. The threshold excess carrier density was almost independent of the diode structures though the threshold current densities were very different among the various diodes, which means that the 1SSF behavior does not depend on the current density but on the excess carrier density. The threshold excess carrier density at room temperature was estimated to be about 4 × 10 14 cm − 3 ⁠ , which agrees with the result calculated by a theoretical model previously proposed. In addition, the conduction type- and the doping concentration-dependences of the threshold excess carrier density were discussed.},

  abstract     = {The SnSe crystal is a promising candidate in the field of thermoelectric materials. In order to elucidate basic physics in the SnSe system, here we report the heavily hole doping SnSe single crystals by the flux method (using alkali halide as solvent). Compared to bad-metal behavior of SnSe grown by the Bridgeman method, the flux-grown SnSe crystals show the metallic conductive behavior consistent with the Landau Fermi liquid (resistivity ρ ∼ T 2 ) with temperatures ranging from 2 to 300 K. Combined angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and empirical Landau Fermi liquid theory, screening lengths λ of Coulomb electron–electron interaction U of SnSe grown by the flux method are 6.6 Å and 6.1 eV, which are much higher than those of normal metals. Remarkably, the excellent electrical conductivity (870 S/cm) of the SnSe crystal grown by the flux method at room temperature is attributed to the higher hole concentration (∼3.8 × 10 19 cm −3 ) and large mobility (152.2 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ). Meanwhile, these SnSe crystals still have large Seebeck coefficients (∼190 μ V/K). Thus, the SnSe crystals grown by the flux method have an ultrahigh power factor [∼31.5 μ W/(cm K 2 )] at room temperature, which is ten times larger than that of SnSe crystals grown by the Bridgeman method and as best as currently reported results. Our work shows a method for growing heavily hole-doped SnSe crystals, which provides a platform for understanding the electrical properties and improving its thermoelectric performance.},

The absorption spectra show a pronounced exponential Urbach tail with slope parameters of 120–150 meV in the spectral region between 4.5 and 5 eV, indicating an unusually large self-trapping energy of excitons. In addition, an absorption band related to deep defects is observed in the spectral region from 2.5 to 4.5 eV. The steepness of the Urbach tail as well as the strength of the defect-related absorption can be influenced and optimized by annealing at 900–1000 °C in an oxygen atmosphere. Similar features were also observed for bulk β-Ga 2 O 3 crystals and for homoepitaxial β-Ga 2 O 3 layers. The present results for β-Ga 2 O 3 are compared and discussed in the context of similar measurements for other wide-bandgap semiconductors of current interest in electronics and photocatalysis: GaN, ZnO, TiO 2 , and BiVO 4 .},

SBH is found to be nearly pinned between 1.2 and 1.35 eV in the HVPE grown epilayers. The position of the Fermi level pinning is closely matched with the energy level of the oxygen vacancy [V O (III)] state (E V + 3.57 eV) in the energy bandgap of β-Ga 2 O 3 , indicating that Fermi level pinning is due to oxygen vacancy type surface states on (001) oriented β-Ga 2 O 3 epitaxial layers. The Fermi level is found to be relatively unpinned on the bulk β-Ga 2 O 3 (001) substrate, suggesting the presence of lower density of oxygen vacancy states on its surface. Hence, the HVPE growth process was found to be responsible for the presence of oxygen vacancy states [V O (III)] in the epilayer. Moreover, this work highlights the role of these surface states in determining the SBH on β-Ga 2 O 3 (001) epilayers and also explains the reason behind the scattered data of SBH values reported in the literature. In addition to these results, we also showed an increment in the built-in potential and the reduction of reverse leakage current for the epilayer with lower surface state density, which gives a direct evidence of the effect of surface states on the properties of β-Ga 2 O 3 (001) Schottky barrier diodes.},

Here, we demonstrate their potential for sensitive and fast sensing of the surface temperature of a thin Au sheet, in contact with a 0.08 M equimolar ferri-/ferrocyanide solution in 26\% KOH. We obtained a sensitivity of about 10 μ K, because of the large Peltier coefficient of the electrochemical reaction at the electrode-electrolyte junction. The resolution is limited by the thermal noise of the electrochemical system and could be quantitatively explained by the thermal noise of a Randles equivalent circuit of the cell. Since no thermal contact resistances to bulky temperature sensors are involved, we achieved a response time smaller than 300 μ s, which may be potentially lowered to a few microseconds. By using the thermogalvanic cell as a sensor for electrochemical microcalorimetry, we calibrated the system, in full agreement with a simulation of its thermal behavior.},

Key to this is its remarkable similarities with quantum entanglement, with quantum-like effects observed at the classical level. Crucially, this parallelism enables the use of quantum tools to quantify the coupling between the spatial and polarization DoFs, usually implemented with polarization-dependent spatial light modulators, which requires the splitting of the vector mode into two orthogonal polarization components. Here, we put forward an alternative approach that relies on the use of Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs) for a fast, cheap, and robust measurement, while the polarization-independent nature of DMDs enables a reduction in the number of required measurements by 25\%. We tested our approach experimentally on cylindrical vector modes with arbitrary degrees of non-separability, of great relevance in a wide variety of applications. Our technique provides a reliable way to measure in real time the purity of vector modes, paving the way for a wide variety of applications where the degree of non-separability can be used as an optical sensor.},

Various factors, including the size of electrodes and wiring, non-optimal E-field shaping, and substrate capacitive coupling, are limiting the performance of GaN HEMT power switches.

Although the most typical size of a skyrmion is 10–100 nm, there has been remarkable progress in the discovery of ultra-small (&lt;3 nm) skyrmions and hedgehogs in the last few years. The dense topological spin crystals not only hold promise for technological applications but also provide a good arena to explore gigantic responses from emergent electromagnetic fields or Berry curvature. Here, we review design principles as well as electronic functions of versatile topological spin crystals, highlighting the distinct properties between skyrmion- and hedgehog-lattice states. Among them, unconventional outcomes from hedgehog-lattice states, such as their formation mechanisms and transport properties induced by the emergent magnetic monopoles, are discussed. The manipulation of such topological spin crystals, based on the strong couplings between topology and spin-charge-lattice degrees of freedom, may pave the way for electronics emerging in the near future.},

  abstract     = {Convective deposition has become one of the common techniques for obtaining a colloidal assembly with a desired number of layers/thickness. Many applications in photonics and semiconductor industries demand only a single layer of colloids placed in a reproducible manner. In the convective deposition, a deposition velocity is typically inversely correlated with a number of layers. Obtaining a uniform monolayer reproducibly thus requires maintaining precise conditions such as the pH, volume fraction, ionic strength of the suspension, temperature, and humidity. Maintaining ideal conditions is one of the limiting factors for the scale-up of convective deposition. Likewise, the surface chemistry must also be reproducible. In the following study, we have demonstrated the effect of the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant on convective deposition. We show that added SDS alters the flow patterns inside the thin film through Marangoni-driven surface stress, which then alters the time for the assembly. The added surfactant can permit more reliable conditions for monolayer coatings. This study using controlled amounts of the surfactant may give a broader understanding of variability of results found in the literature.},

In recent years, force microscopy and spectroscopy have become inevitable tools to attain the elastic modulus of cells as a whole using colloidal probes or with high lateral precision by sharp tips. However, the obtained values have to be treated with due care to avoid data misinterpretation. Here, we present a comparison of elasticity between four metastatic cancer cell lines (lung, liver, skin, and breast epithelial-type cancer cells) taken by colloidal and sharp probes using force spectroscopy on cell monolayers and stress the impact of a stiff substrate, which cells are attached to, on the measured values especially in cancerous cells, which depict abnormalities in structure and cellular components. As a result of our analysis, we suggest to solely use sharp probes for the mechanical characterization of cancer cells when the force-distance relation is fit by a conventional contact mechanics model such as the Hertz model.},

Distinct injected electrons interacting with the buffer traps lead to a significant decrease (increase) in Q g under negative (positive) substrate bias. Different levels of degradation on ΔQ gd to ΔQ gs after stress under negative and positive substrate biases indicate uneven distribution of acceptor-like traps and uniform distribution of donor-like traps in the GaN buffer level.

  abstract     = {Monolayer SnSe has been predicted to exhibit an unusual anisotropic thermal expansion—when heated, the long lattice parameter contracts, while the short one expands, resulting in a rectangular-to-square-lattice phase transformation at a critical temperature ( T c ). Here, we employ density-functional-theory calculations to demonstrate an even more notable thermal-expansion behavior of SnSe from monolayer to bulk. We find that the unusual thermal expansion persists in multilayers, while the coefficients of thermal expansion of different numbers of layers are almost identical. This behavior results from a delicate interplay between the elastic stiffness coefficient and Grüneisen parameters. Finally, we find that the Poisson&#39;s ratio of multilayer SnSe, which is positive at T = 0 K ⁠ , gets smaller with increasing temperature and even turns negative, signaling a zero Poisson&#39;s ratio at a particular temperature. Overall, the present results provide another perspective in understanding the unusual thermal properties of monochalcogenides.},

This fine-grained BT not only exhibits superior electrical properties with a dielectric permittivity of 7200, piezoelectric coefficient of 420 pC/N, and field-induced electrostrain 0.2\% at 30 kV/cm but also possesses high transmittance of 30\%–60\% over a wide range of wavelength from visible to middle infrared radiation spectrum. By a comparative study with the coarse-grained BT, the fine-grained BT is found to have a slight relaxation property due to its large volume fraction of grain boundaries. The coexistence of the fine domains in small grains and the relaxor regions of grain boundaries is responsible for the synchronous enhancement of electrical and optical properties of the fine-grained BT.},

We demonstrate the Gumbel statistics, a maximum extreme-value distribution for switching-filament conductance, as opposed to the minimum extreme-value distribution such as Weibull model. We apply a Poisson random statistical distribution for the spatial generation of percolation filaments to link the RRAM conductance measurements with device areas. As a result, we can derive two important relations: area scaling properties of percentiles and scale-factors. We show the validity of this maximum extreme-value distribution model by rigorously examining the vertical percentile-scaling characteristics of experimental data. The independently extracted shape-factor from the area-dependence of scale-factors captures the merged conductance distributions in good agreement with the experimental conductance data. It is revealed that larger variability associated with RRAM conductance measurements is directly linked to the maximum-valued statistical characteristics of this model. We also demonstrate that RRAM conductance, rather than resistance, is a fundamental statistical variable.},

An electrical noise-equivalent power of (9 ± 3) × 10 −15 W/Hz 1/2 , a responsivity of (3.4 ± 0.5) × 10 5 V/W, and a dynamic power range of 5 × 10 4 have been demonstrated for the square-law classical detection of 94 GHz radiation with the junctions at 50 K. The effect of background radiation on the V – I curves of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− x bicrystal junctions was found to have an optical noise-equivalent temperature of ≤30 mK/Hz 1/2 . The main contribution to the effect comes from the interplay between the classical and Josephson detection mechanisms.

The observed strong microwave absorption is mainly contributed by natural magnetic resonance, which is widened by local magnetic fields at dislocation stripes.

In this work, we investigate the electronic structures and magnetic properties of bilayer ScO 2 and NbN 2 by using first principles calculations. It is found that AB stacking is the most preferred stacking order of bilayer ScO 2 and NbN 2 . Furthermore, the ground state of AB-stacked bilayer ScO 2 is a semiconductor with intralayer ferromagnetic (FM) and interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) couplings, and the magnetic moments are mainly provided by the p z orbits of the O atoms. In contrast, the ground state of AB-stacked bilayer NbN 2 is a metal with intra- and inter-layer FM couplings, and the magnetic moments are mainly from the d z 2 orbits of the Nb atoms. In particular, the interlayer AFM coupling of AB-stacked bilayer ScO 2 is much larger than intralayer FM coupling due to the superposition of the spin-polarized p z orbits of the O atoms in adjacent layers. Compared to the strong interlayer AFM coupling of bilayer ScO 2 , the interlayer magnetic coupling of AB-stacked bilayer NbN 2 is negligible because the spin-polarized d z 2 orbits of the Nb atoms in adjacent layers do not overlap. Our results will benefit a deep understanding of the interlayer coupling of 2D vdW intrinsic magnets and exploring of high performance spintronic devices based on 2D vdW intrinsic magnets.},

The NSMO film grown on STO, exhibiting uniaxial like tensile strain of 1.3\% along the in-plane [100] direction, undergoes a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at ∼210 K followed by a ferromagnetic to A-type antiferromagnetic transition at ∼179 K upon cooling; meanwhile, the film grown on LSAT, exhibiting anisotropic in-plane tensile strains of 0.36\% along [100] and 0.50\% along [ 0 1 ¯ 1 ] directions, undergoes further transition to CE-type antiferromagnetic transition at ∼145 K. NSMO/LSAT with such transitions facilitates a strong MCE over a much wider temperature range from 90 to 170 K, with the magnetic entropy change comparable to the recently reported La 0.25 Ca 0.75 MnO 3 bulk.

  abstract     = {The tunnel magnetocapacitance (TMC) effect in two-dimensional single nanogranular layered Fe / MgF 2 films is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. We measured the frequency dependence of TMC ratios in a frequency range of 20 Hz–1 MHz and discovered that TMC ratios strongly depend on the frequency, reaching a peak value at a specific frequency. We observe that the largest TMC ratios occur at lower frequencies and that TMC values steadily reduce with increasing frequency. Notably, we achieved a maximum TMC ratio of 1.45\%, which is the largest low-field TMC ever reported for granular films. A combination of the Debye–Fröhlich (DF) model and the Julliere formula is used to fit the experimental data to theory, and an excellent agreement between the calculated values and the experimental data is obtained. To perfectly fit the experimental data, the conventional DF model is extended to a composite model in which three capacitors (with three different relaxation times) are introduced. Our findings will give further insights into the exact mechanism of the TMC effect in nanogranular films and will open broader opportunities for device applications, such as magnetic sensors and impedance tunable devices.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we investigated the nanoscale conduction and charge transport characteristics of epitaxial VO 2 thin films around the metal-insulator transition (MIT) using the Hall transport measurement and conduction atomic force microscopy. Unlike the conventional oxides, the VO 2 thin films show unique transport characteristics. First, the dominant carrier type shows a critical change from electron to hole during the MIT sequence (cooling sequence) or from hole to electron during the reverse MIT sequence (heating sequence). Second, the carrier density measured during the MIT sequence is higher than that measured during the reverse MIT sequence, evidenced with a clear thermal hysteresis. Third, the volume fraction (area percentage) of the nanoscale high-conduction phase also shows a thermal hysteresis, evidenced with a larger volume fraction of the high-conduction region in the MIT sequence than the reverse MIT sequence. The first-principles calculations indicate that the dominant carrier is the hole in the monoclinic phase, while it is the electron in the rutile phase, suggesting that the unique charge transport characteristics are attributed to the structural phase transition. Our work provides a deep insight into the nanoscale conduction and charge transports in VO 2 thin films.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of Ga 1 − x V x Sb compounds with various vanadium (V) contents ( x ) ranging from dilute doping to the extreme doping limit were systematically investigated by first-principles calculations. The results show that V atoms prefer to substitute for gallium (Ga) atoms, and the formation energy is lower under Sb-rich growth conditions than under Ga-rich growth conditions. Meanwhile, the Sb Ga antisite defects effectively decrease the energy barrier of the substitution process from 0.85 to 0.53 eV. The diffusion of V atoms in the GaSb lattice occurs through metastable interstitial sites with an energy barrier of 0.6 eV. At a low V concentration ( x = 0.0625), V atoms prefer a homogeneous distribution with antiferromagnetic coupling among the V atoms. However, when x increases above 0.5, the magnetic coupling among V atoms changes to ferromagnetic coupling due to the enhanced superexchange interaction between the e g and t 2 g states of neighboring V atoms. At the extreme doping limit of x = 1.00, zinc blende VSb along with its analogs VAs and VP is an intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductor that exhibits a large change in light absorption at the Curie temperature. The results indicate that Ga 1 − x V x Sb compounds provide a platform to design next-generation electronic, spintronic, and optoelectronic devices.},

The structural asymmetry in QDs results in fine structure splitting (FSS) of exciton and biexciton emission lines. Here, we propose a method to study QD symmetry by measuring the difference in two different polarized lifetimes of QD excitonic emission lines under applied stress. The method can be reasonably correlated with the direct FSS measurement. Actually, due to the limitation of the resolution of the spectrometer, the zero value of FSS is difficult to measure. Instead, the lifetime measurement is an effective method to judge the symmetry condition of single QDs.},

To date, however, the temporal resolution of this technique has been handicapped by the intrinsic limitations in the data acquisition speed and the lack of a suitable data processing method. The present study aims to fundamentally resolve this challenge by implementing a data analysis method that is based on differentiating discrete tomography reconstruction from a continuous scan reconstruction. With this methodological development, we capture and quantify the particle motion during the solidification of battery electrodes and reveal the statistics of the dynamically evolving motion in the drying process, which has been challenging to resolve. We discover that the particle motion exhibits a strong dependence on its geometric location within a drying electrode. Our results also imply that the final electrode quality can be controlled by balancing the solvent evaporation rate and the particle mobility in the region close to the drying surface.},

Owing to the dispersion strengthening effects, the nanocomposite showed a tensile strength σ b of ∼2.7 GPa, about 29\% higher than that of the single-phase oxide glass. Meanwhile, its tensile plasticity ε p was enhanced from zero to ∼2.7\%.

The changes can take the glasses to higher-energy “rejuvenated” or lower-energy “aged” states, with rejuvenation being of particular interest as it improves their mechanical properties. It has generally been assumed that the induced property changes would evolve monotonically with the extent of processing. We show that with sufficiently intense ultrasonic elastic processing, the intrinsic structural competition between damage and repair facilitated by increased atomic mobility can lead to oscillatory energy storage.

  abstract     = {We demonstrate a mechanism to transform a pool boiling system into a self-sustained flow boiling system through bubble-induced two-phase flow in a tapered microgap over the heater surface. The nucleating bubbles in the gap are squeezed and expand preferentially in the increasing taper direction. The expanding flow cross section decelerates the two-phase flow and converts the momentum loss into pressure buildup. The bubble squeezing and the pressure recovery effects overcome the frictional and acceleration pressure drops to provide a net pumping head. We hypothesize that the resulting self-sustained flow eliminates the need for an external pump and transforms a pool boiling system into a pumpless flow boiling system with significantly higher heat transfer potential. Experiments were carried out with water in 10° and 15° tapered gaps over a 10 mm square heater surface with an inlet gap height of 1.27 mm. The plain heater surface with a 15° tapered gap reached a critical heat flux of 288 W/cm 2 with a heat transfer coefficient of 119 kW/m 2 °C as compared to 127 W/cm 2 and 52.5 kW/m 2 °C with only a plain surface. High-speed imaging revealed that the bubbles nucleating at the entrance in the gap are squeezed and expand in the increasing cross section direction. A homogeneous flow model was used for pressure drop analysis in the expanding gap. The results indicate that the pressure recovery mechanism alone cannot sustain the flow and the bubble squeezing action plays a critical role in establishing the self-sustained flow.},

To demonstrate the broad tuning and high output power capability of the gain chip, an external cavity diode laser configuration based on using a ruled diffraction grating in a Littrow configuration is demonstrated. The laser shows a wide tuning range of 154 nm and a maximum average output power on the order of 10 mW at 2.63 μ m, corresponding to a peak power of 100 mW. For a more compact and robust integrated configuration, we consider an extended-cavity laser design where the feedback is provided by a silicon photonics chip acting as a reflector. In particular, the integrated tuning mechanism is based on utilizing the Vernier effect between two thermally tunable micro-ring resonators. In this case, a tuning range of around 70 nm is demonstrated in a compact architecture, with an average power of 1 mW, corresponding to a peak power of 10 mW.},

  abstract     = {Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has drawn great attention for its versatile applications in electronics and photonics, and precise estimation of its thickness is critical in many situations. We propose a rapid and broad range (10–500 nm) in situ thickness estimation method for transparent hBN and SiO 2 layers on the Si substrate using Raman peak intensity ratios at two wavenumbers and optical microscopy image analysis. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate our method for a wide range of hBN layer thicknesses, and the estimated results show excellent agreement with the measured results with a percentile estimation error of 2.5\%.},

The absorption properties of individual photodiodes were tuned via local strain engineering in nanostructured InGaN/GaN. By varying the diameters of individual nanopillars, the cutoff wavelengths of absorption were varied across the chip. The intrinsic wavelength selectivity is insensitive to the incident angle of light. The top-down fabrication process shown in this work is also compatible with scalable manufacturing. A proof-of-concept spectrometer was demonstrated based on 14 photodiodes, without any external optics or spectral filtering components, in the wavelength range of 450–590 nm. Using a non-negative least squares algorithm enhanced by orthogonal matching pursuit, the spectrum of a test light source was reconstructed.},

Silicon and germanium are compatible with standard semiconductor manufacturing and contain stable isotopes with zero nuclear spin, thereby serving as excellent hosts for spins with long quantum coherence. Here, we demonstrate quantum dot arrays in a silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS), strained silicon (Si/SiGe), and strained germanium (Ge/SiGe). We fabricate using a multi-layer technique to achieve tightly confined quantum dots and compare integration processes. While SiMOS can benefit from a larger temperature budget and Ge/SiGe can make an Ohmic contact to metals, the overlapping gate structure to define the quantum dots can be based on a nearly identical integration. We realize charge sensing in each platform, for the first time in Ge/SiGe, and demonstrate fully functional linear and two-dimensional arrays where all quantum dots can be depleted to the last charge state. In Si/SiGe, we tune a quintuple quantum dot using the N + 1 method to simultaneously reach the few electron regime for each quantum dot. We compare capacitive crosstalk and find it to be the smallest in SiMOS, relevant for the tuning of quantum dot arrays. We put these results into perspective for quantum technology and identify industrial qubits, hybrid technology, automated tuning, and two-dimensional qubit arrays as four key trajectories that, when combined, enable fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

However, most PAD setups are insufficient for clinical dermatology, given their single optical resolution (OR) or acoustic resolution (AR) mode, which results in poor spatiotemporal resolution or imaging depth for visualizing the internal texture of skin. Here, a switchable optical and acoustic resolution photoacoustic dermoscope (S-OR-ARPAD) system is developed, which provides a smooth transition from OR mode in microscopic imaging of superficial skin layers to AR mode when imaging at greater depths within intensely scattering deep skin layers. The lateral resolution can be seamlessly switched between 4.4 and 47 μ m as the maximum imaging depth is switched between 1.2 and 1.8 mm for skin imaging. Using the S-OR-ARPAD, we identified the two distinct resolution modes responsible for resolving features of different skin layers and demonstrated the fine structures with strong contrast in the stratum corneum, dermal papillae, and microvascular structures in the horizontal plexus by imaging the healthy human skin at different locations.},

The results indicate that condensation on a cooled flat surface was increased using electrowetting (EW) by accelerating the slow coalescence process where smaller droplets join to form larger droplets and leave behind a dry surface for new droplets to form. A pattern consisting of 100- μ m wide interdigitated electrodes separated by 100- μ m gaps showed the fastest growth in droplet size. The largest droplets formed with such a pattern had approximately 30 times larger volume than the largest droplets formed on the surface when electrowetting was not applied. Finer patterns exhibited a larger overall condensation rate, where the electrowetting method showed up to a 56\% increase in overall water condensation.},

By specifically adhering the targeted microbubbles to MDA-MB-231 cells, the acoustic sensitivity of cells can be improved significantly, leading to the isolation of MDA-MB-231 from MCF-7 cells with an efficiency of 91.2 ± 3.4\%. This method extends the diversity of acoustic separation and is capable of separation of particles with the same density and diameter, proving a strategy for specific cell sorting.},

The deposition of soft magnetic films with high magnetostriction is, however, more challenging on piezoelectric substrates such as quartz than on silicon. Thermally induced anisotropic expansion during the deposition process or during post-deposition magnetic field annealing leads to uniaxial stresses acting on the films, which makes the precise control of magnetic anisotropy difficult. Accordingly, this work analyzes the influence of the deposition process and heat treatment on the performance of Love wave devices. ST-cut quartz based delay line surface acoustic wave sensors with a SiO 2 guiding layer are employed, and a 200 nm layer of amorphous magnetostrictive (Fe 90 Co 10 ) 78 Si 12 B 10 is used as the sensitive element. Magneto-optical imaging is performed for magnetic domain characterization, and the sensor performance is characterized in terms of bias field dependent phase sensitivity and frequency dependent phase noise. By performing a low temperature deposition in an external magnetic field, considerable improvement in limits of detection at biomagnetic relevant frequencies down to 70 pT / Hz at 10 Hz and 25 pT / Hz at 100 Hz is achieved.},

Here, the magnetoelectric properties of nitrogen-doped monolayer MoS 2 are investigated by first-principles calculations, revealing that the N-p and S-p states are strongly hybridized with the Mo-d states, thus leading to the appearance of magnetism as verified experimentally. We demonstrate in situ doping of monolayer MoS 2 with nitrogen via a convenient chemical vapor deposition method. Incorporation of nitrogen into MoS 2 , leading to the evolution of magnetism, is evidenced by combining x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer measurements. By comparison with pristine monolayer MoS 2 , the distinct ferromagnetism behaviors of nitrogen-doped monolayer MoS 2 are observed up to room temperature, while the semiconducting nature persists. Our work introduces an efficient and feasible approach to realize magnetism in the 2D limit and explores potential applications in semiconductor spintronics.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a large amount of effort has been devoted to bringing p- and n-type two-dimensional (2D) materials in close contact to promise a p–n junction for photodetectors and photovoltaic devices. However, all solar cells based on 2D materials are single p–n junctions so far, where the open circuit voltage is usually limited by the bandgap of semiconductor materials. Here, by using a scanning-probe domain patterning method to polarize the ferroelectric film, we demonstrate a series connected MoTe 2 photovoltaic cell with an additive open circuit voltage and output electrical power. The nonvolatile MoTe 2 p–n diodes exhibit a rectification ratio of 100. As a photodetector, the device presents a responsivity of 220 mA/W and an external quantum efficiency of 41\% without any gate or bias voltages. The open circuit voltage increases linearly with the number of series connected p–n junctions and can be beyond the bandgap of the multilayer MoTe 2 .},

Antimony sulfoiodide (SbSI) is a prototypical compound that possesses both ferroelectricity and a strong visible-light-response. However, most of the SbSI films reported so far have a polycrystalline structure with a randomly oriented polarization axis. In this study, we have fabricated c -axis textured SbSI thin films through annealing of amorphous films deposited in a molecular beam epitaxy system, employing Sb 2 S 3 and SbI 3 sources. The fabricated films are highly uniform and have the polarization axis ordered vertical to the film plane. We have confirmed that the films show a strong visible-light-response and ferroelectricity in accord with bulk samples. These results will stimulate the development of photovoltaics employing narrow bandgap ferroelectric compounds.},

It is known that transition metals W and Pt possess spin Hall ratios with opposite signs, and therefore, the DL-SOT efficiencies in these multilayer structures may become zero with a certain W/Pt thickness combination. In this work, we show that indeed the zero DL-SOT efficiency can be achieved in such a structure, and the efficiency can evolve from negative (W-dominated) to positive (Pt-dominated) depending on the relative thickness of W and Pt. More importantly, we did not observe field-free switching when the W/Pt combination gives zero DL-SOT efficiency, which is in contrast to a recent report [Ma et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 , 117703 (2018)]. By further considering a simple spin diffusion model, we find that DL-SOT efficiencies ξ DL Pt = 0.12 and ξ DL W = − 0.13 for the Pt and W layer, respectively, in our multilayer system. We also show that the Pt(2)/Co(0.5)/Pt(2) symmetric structure is a robust perpendicular magnetization anisotropy multilayer that can be employed on W or other spin Hall materials to characterize their DL-SOT efficiencies.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the effect of sample size on the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in a device formed from chiral antiferromagnetic Mn 3 Sn. We also investigate its magnetic domains by employing focused ion beam lithography. Mn 3 Sn is a suitable material for studying the thermoelectric effect in the presence of antiferromagnetic domains because it exhibits a large ANE. In the Mn 3 Sn device used in this study, a Ta layer acts as a heater; the heat produced via Joule heating diffuses through a sapphire substrate into the thin flake of Mn 3 Sn. The Nernst signal exhibits a stepwise hysteresis when the sample is subjected to a temperature gradient and magnetic field at 290 K. The stepwise hysteresis depends on the sample shape and size—which affect nucleation, pinning, and depinning processes—but the temperature difference also has a significant effect on the switching process. The domain ratios calculated using the ANE results indicate that the domain size is smaller than 20 μ m 2 . This obtained domain size is in good agreement with the reported experimental values of 10–100 μ m 2 for the magneto-optical Kerr effect in bulk single-crystal Mn 3 Sn. Thus, the ANE is a powerful means of obtaining information about the magnetic domains in samples under a temperature gradient, thereby promising a reliable approach to study magnetic domains and spintronics using antiferromagnets.},

As the PMA impacts the non-linearity N of the STNO, we can, in this way, control the threshold current, the current tunability of the frequency, and, in particular, the STNO linewidth, which dramatically improves by two orders of magnitude. Our results are in good agreement with the theory for nonlinear auto-oscillators, confirm theoretical predictions of the role of the nonlinearity, and demonstrate a straightforward path toward improving the microwave properties of STNOs.},

  abstract     = {Owing to its unique nanostructure with nanosized strain domains embedded in the austenite matrix, ferromagnetic strain glass has recently been found to yield low-field large magnetostriction, providing an important principle for designing magnetostrictive materials. Considering that magnetostriction maximizes in the vicinity of the strain glass transition temperature, T g that is usually below room temperature; it has inspired the search for a feasible approach to further enhance room temperature magnetostriction from an application point of view. Here, we report that approaching the martensite crossover through applying proper stress during annealing can effectively enhance room temperature magnetostriction of a random polycrystalline Fe 67.7 Pd 32.3 strain glass alloy with T g of 133 K from 73 to 95 ppm by ∼30\%. The comparative results reveal that annealing with higher stress, e.g., 15 MPa, will deteriorate magnetostriction performance due to stress-induced martensites. Further transmission electron microscopy study reveals that enhanced magnetostriction is due to slightly enlarged strain nanodomains because the proper bias stress provides an extra driving force toward the martensite and helps to overcome the kinetic limitation, which may be a universal approach to achieve large magnetostriction in ferromagnetic strain glass.},

In order for β -Ga 2 O 3 to be used in electronic and optoelectronic devices, epitaxial growth technology of thin films should be given priority. However, challenges are associated with the trade-off growth rate with crystallization and surface roughness in conventional epitaxy. Herein, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition was used to grow the β -Ga 2 O 3 epilayer, and the growth kinetics process has been systematically investigated. A high growth rate of ∼0.58 μ m/h and a single 2 ¯ 01 plane orientation with a full width at half maximum value of 0.86° were obtained when grown on the c-plane sapphire substrate at the growth temperature of 820 °C. Then, a proposed model for the mechanism of nucleation and growth of β -Ga 2 O 3 epitaxial films is established to understand the precursor transport and gas phase reaction process. This work provides a cheap, green, and efficient epitaxial growth method, which is indispensable for device applications of β -Ga 2 O 3 .},

This paper reports a composite PCM thermal buffer consisting of a Field&#39;s metal PCM having high volumetric latent heat (315 MJ/m 3 ) embedded in a copper (Cu) matrix having high intrinsic thermal conductivity [384 W/(m·K)]. We demonstrate thermal buffer samples fabricated with Cu volume fractions from 0.05 to 0.2 and sample thicknesses ranging between 1 mm and 4 mm. Experiments coupled with finite element method simulations were used to determine the figures of merit (FOMs), cooling capacity η eff , energy density E eff , effective thermal conductivity k eff , and the buffering time constant τ . The cooling capacity was measured to be as high as η eff = 72 ± 4 kJ/(m 2 ·K 1/2 ·s 1/2 ) for the 1.45 mm thick thermal buffer sample having a Cu volume fraction of 0.13, significantly higher than theoretical values for aluminum–paraffin composites [45 kJ/(m 2 ·K 1/2 ·s 1/2 )] or pure paraffin wax [8 kJ/(m 2 ·K 1/2 ·s 1/2 )].

Our electrically detected-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy and first-principles calculations demonstrate that this center, which we name “the P bC center,” is formed at a carbon adatom on the 4H-SiC(0001) honeycomb-like structure. The P bC center (Si 3 ≡C-, where “-” represents an unpaired electron) is determined to be a just carbon version of the famous P b center (Si dangling-bond center, Si 3 ≡Si-) at Si(111)/SiO 2 interfaces because we found close similarities between their wave functions. The P bC center acts as one of the major interfacial traps in 4H-SiC(0001) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), which decreases the free-carrier density and the field-effect mobility of 4H-SiC(0001) MOSFETs. The formation of the P bC centers has the role of reducing the oxidation-induced strain, similar to the case of the formation of the P b centers.},

Temperature dependent electrical transport measurements revealed a first order metal-insulator transition with the transition temperature very similar to the undoped NdNiO 3 .

We showed that the nonreciprocal LBS could be positive or negative, which could be tuned by the arrangement of a magnetic basis in the unit cell. We verified the nonreciprocal LBS at normal incidence by experiments. Our study provides a useful way to manipulate the wave propagation and wave-matter interaction by artificial materials and leads to a breakthrough in LBS, which has promising potential in optical devices, such as transducers, switches, and unidirectional couplers.},

  abstract     = {Multiferroic BiFeO 3 (BFO) shows several phonon modes at infrared (IR) to THz energies, which are expected to carry information on any sample property coupled to crystal lattice vibrations. While macroscopic IR studies of BFO are often limited by single-crystal size, scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) allows for IR thin film spectroscopy of nanoscopic probing volumes with negligible direct substrate contribution to the optical signal. In fact, polaritons such as phonon polaritons of BFO introduce a resonant tip–sample coupling in s-SNOM, leading to both stronger signals and enhanced sensitivity to local material properties. Here, we explore the near-field response of BFO thin films at three consecutive resonances (centered around 5 THz, 13 THz, and 16 THz), by combining s-SNOM with a free-electron laser. We study the dependence of these near-field resonances on both the wavelength and tip–sample distance. Enabled by the broad spectral range of the measurement, we probe phonon modes connected to the predominant motion of either the bismuth or oxygen ions. Therefore, we propose s-SNOM at multiple near-field resonances as a versatile and very sensitive tool for the simultaneous investigation of various sample properties.},

  abstract     = {There is growing interest in microLED devices with lateral dimensions between 1 and 10 μ m. However, reductions in external quantum efficiency (EQE) due to increased nonradiative recombination at the surface become an issue at these sizes. Previous attempts to study size-dependent EQE trends have been limited to dimensions above 5 μ m, partly due to fabrication challenges. Here, we present size-dependent EQE data for InGaN microLEDs down to 1 μ m in diameter fabricated using a process that only utilizes standard semiconductor processing techniques (i.e., lithography and etching). Furthermore, differences in EQE trends for blue and green InGaN microLEDs are compared. Green wavelength devices prove to be less susceptible to reductions in efficiency with the decreasing size; consequently, green devices attain higher EQEs than blue devices below 10 μ m despite lower internal quantum efficiencies in the bulk material. This is explained by smaller surface recombination velocities with the increasing indium content due to enhanced carrier localization.},

Thus, we expect that the introduction of non-trivial symmetry-protected topological order will offer important freedom for designing high-performance heterogeneous catalysts. To uncover the contribution of the topologically non-trivial electronic structure to the heterogeneous reactions, in situ techniques are urgently needed to detect the interaction between surface states, topological electrons, and reaction intermediates.},

Here, we report on the creation of shallow (10 nm below the surface), single SiV − centers in diamond using low energy Si + ion implantation with subsequent high temperature annealing at 1500 °C. We show transition linewidths down to 99 MHz and narrow inhomogeneous distributions. Furthermore, we achieved a reduction of homogeneous linewidths by a factor of 2 after removing subsurface damage using oxygen plasma processing. These results not only give insights into the formation process of SiV − centers but also indicate a favorable processing method to fabricate shallow single quantum emitters in diamond perfectly suited for coupling to nanostructures on the diamond surface.},

  abstract     = {Power generation from linear finger-tapping-based electrostatic energy harvesting (FTEEH) devices is hindered by the slow capacitance variation under low-speed finger-tapping (FT) motion. Herein, a velocity amplification mechanism is proposed, which exploits the snap-through behavior of a dual-charged electret monostable dome structure and thus greatly enhances the power generation of FTEEH devices from slow FT motion. The kinetic energy and velocity amplification during the buckling event were effectively predicted for various specimens using the modified Föppl–von Kármán equations and Hamilton&#39;s principle. A high degree of dynamic velocity amplification was demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally and quantified with respect to the velocity gain and power gain. Specifically, the velocity of the capacitance variation of the designed FTEEH device, driven by a slow FT motion at 2.7 cm/s, was substantially increased to 18.5 cm/s, affording a high velocity gain of 6.9 and a correspondingly large power gain of 6.8. The proposed velocity-amplified nonlinear FTEEH device was compared with recently developed linear FTEEH devices that do not utilize this velocity amplification mechanism and found to yield a large pulse width of 90.0 ms (full width) and a high volumetric power density of 1015.7 μ W/cm 3 .},

By our proposed structure, the static divergence of the inverted driving beam in the deflected mode can not only be avoided but also be utilized. Numerical and experimental results show that the centrifugal softening effect can amplify the relative motion between the driving and generating beams and increase the impact force, which in turn improves the output power significantly. The maximum output power of the harvester is increased by 212.5\%, 258.7\%, and 682.8\% for the impact gaps of 1.07 mm, 1.43 mm, and 2.14 mm, respectively. Moreover, the inverted driving beam can be prevented from continuously deflecting by introducing large impact stiffness at the contact instant.},

The realizations of solar cells, which can maintain high efficiency under variable solar irradiance, are necessary for further improvement of solar energy conversion. In this work, a metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structure based photon-enhanced thermionic energy converter (PETEC) has been proposed for intrinsic adaptive full spectrum solar energy conversion. The basic idea is to form the thermionic electron with desired energy by the photon-enhanced thermal tunneling process. Investigations on its fundamental performance indicate that the MIS-PETEC can have an overall output energy improvement of at least 0.8\%, 2.5\%, and 3\% in typical sunny, rainy, and cloudy days compared to the normal PETEC. Additionally, the total output energy over a year can be improved by at least 3\%. These results offer an alternate technique for intrinsic adaptive full spectrum solar energy conversion, which is helpful for the development of next generation high performance solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Literature has shown that the bandwidth of a piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH) system can be effectively broadened by introducing nonlinear mechanical dynamics. However, when connected to a practical PEH interface circuit for ac-to-dc conversion, the bandwidth improvement will be impaired because of the electrically induced damping effect. On the other hand, there is another bandwidth broadening solution, in which the resonant frequency is tunable to some extent by carrying out the phase-variable synchronized switch (PVSS) control in practical interface circuits. This Letter reports a synergistic design by combining these two mechanisms toward a dual-effect broadband PEH solution. The theoretical model of this nonlinear and electromechanically coupled system is derived. The experimental result shows that, by introducing the PVSS control to a PEH system, which is composed of a monostable piezoelectric cantilever beam and a practical synchronized switch interface circuit, its bandwidth can be broadened by 18.7\%. This dual-effect solution incorporates two bandwidth broadening mechanisms toward practical broadband PEH systems.},

Partial coating of the sperm head with nanoparticle aggregates is achieved by electrostatic-based self-assembly. The coating enables propagation of helical traveling waves along the passive flagellum under the action of a periodic magnetic field. We compare the waveforms of active and passive flagellated motion and show noticeable asymmetry in the case of magnetically actuated cells, leading to lower linearity ( ⁠ LIN = VSL / VCL ⁠ ) of the taken pathway. The average curvature of the flagellar beat cycle is 10.4 ± 8.1 rad mm −1 ( ⁠ mean ± s . d . ⁠ ) for an active flagellum, whereas the curvature of a passive flagellum exhibits a linear increase (37.4 ± 18.1 rad mm −1 ) and decreases toward the distal end. We also show that the maximum amplitude of the bending wave occurs at the distal end of the active flagellum and at the middle of the passive flagellum.

Our results also give evidence that Cs + ions also participate in the process of ion migration except the widely considered Br − ions.

However, a precise and quantitative band theory is still lacking in this field. Although HfS 2 has good applications in many fields because of its good electrical and optical properties, its applications in RRAM have seldom been reported. In this work, the exfoliated nanosheets of HfS 2 were utilized to fabricate memory devices with a structure of Pt/Al/HfS 2 /p + -Si, which show typical bipolar resistive switching behavior with high switching voltage and a small ratio of high and low resistive states (R-ratio). According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results of energy band diagrams, instead of conductive filament formation in other resistive switching materials, the doping of sulfur vacancy (V S ) of 3.8\% is already enough to change the whole HfS 2 layer from the semiconductor to the metal. The transition is caused by the change in the V S doping concentration from low to high, which is the result of the generation and movement of V S under an electric field. The DFT also calculated that HfS 2 devices utilizing Indium Tin Oxide as the bottom electrode can show bipolar resistive switching behavior with lower switching voltage and a higher R-ratio than those utilizing p + -Si, which is confirmed by the experimental results. The DFT calculation can be utilized for both explaining the switching mechanism and designing the device structure to optimize the switching characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Host-guest structures are used in most state-of-the-art organic light-emitting devices, with the host transporting charge and confining excitons on the guest. While the host often plays a critical role in achieving high efficiency and stability, predicting and understanding these effects is a persistent design challenge which slows the discovery of new active materials. Closely related host molecules, which differ only by several functional groups, often show drastically different degradation behavior. Here, we explore this observation for the archetypical carbazole hosts 4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP) and 4,4′-bis(carbazole-9-yl)-2,2′-dimethylbiphenyl (CDBP). While devices based on these hosts show similar efficiencies, CDBP-based devices show a tenfold lower lifetime than CBP devices when paired with phosphorescent or fluorescent emitters. Using optically and electrically pumped degradation tests, mass spectrometry, compositional analysis, and low-temperature phosphorescence spectroscopy, the lifetimes of devices containing CDBP are shown to correlate with the formation of intermolecular triplet excimer states. These findings suggest that candidate host molecules should be screened for excimer formation as host excimers may aggravate device degradation and lower device stability.},

  abstract     = {Miniaturization of the tunable laser equipment is an important factor for further development in various optoelectronic technologies. To realize the compact tunable laser devices, an optical gain medium having a broadband optical gain characteristic is required. In this study, we propose a promising strategy for preparing an optical gain film that exhibits a ∼250 nm gain bandwidth in the visible wavelength region. This film consists of a polymer matrix co-doped with organic luminescent molecules that form a complex of the excited state, i.e., exciplex. The exciplex state can co-exist with the monomolecular exciton state, leading to broadband (400–650 nm) optical gain with a large Stokes shift. Optically pumped lasing action is also possible when the film is combined with an optical resonator. This strategy would be useful for developing a compact tunable laser device without active medium replacement.},

Clear polarization-electric-field ( P – E ) hysteresis loops were observed for these epitaxial films with the tetragonal/orthorhombic phase.

Transport measurements performed on samples cleaved in ultra-high vacuum show a significantly enhanced superconducting transition when compared to equivalent measurements performed in air. Deviations from the bulk resistivity appear at 21 K, well above the 10 K bulk T c of the underdoped compound. We demonstrate that the excess conductivity above the bulk T c can be controllably suppressed by application of potassium ions on the cleaved surface, indicating that the enhanced superconductivity is strongly localized to the sample surface. Additionally, we find that the effects of the potassium surface dosing are strongly influenced by the presence of residual gas absorbates on the sample surface, which may prevent effective charge transfer from the potassium atoms to the FeAs plane. This further supports the conclusion that the effects of the dosing (and enhanced superconductivity) are localized within a few layers of the surface.},

Due to this discrete character, the experimental determination of coercivity depends on the measurement protocol. Finite element modeling allows us to investigate how the pattern of reversed grains develops during sample demagnetization performed under closed-circuit conditions, provided that the basic features of the hysteresigraph are known. Numerical modeling provides a quantitative understanding of the collective effects that are very pronounced in the closed-circuit configuration and shows how they affect both the slope of the demagnetizing curve and the sample coercivity. With a grain coercive field standard deviation adjusted to 0.1 T, it is numerically found that the difference in coercivity between closed- and open-circuit configurations is 40 kA/m, in good agreement with previous experimental data.},

Furthermore, the field-free SOT-induced variations of VMS and exchange bias are also observed, which would be related to the effective built-in out-of-plane field due to unequal upward and downward interfacial spin populations. The SOT-induced switched fraction of out-of-plane interfacial spins shows a linear dependence on relative VMS, indicating that the number of uncompensated pinned spins is proportional to the switched interfacial spins.

In this study, an equiatomic intermetallic compound, MnGaGe, was investigated in epitaxially grown film samples. Perpendicularly magnetized films with an M s value of about 260 emu/cm 3 at 300 K were fabricated onto MgO (100) single crystal substrates. The maximum value of K u was 8.1 × 10 6 erg/cm 3 at room temperature. Microstructure analysis using a scanning transmission electron microscope atomically revealed the Cu 2 Sb type crystal structure in the film sample. First principles calculations were also carried out to discuss the electronic structure. Using the analysis of the projected density of states for 3d-orbitals, the hybridization of the 3d-orbitals was suggested as a possible factor for promoting magnetocrystalline anisotropy.

  abstract     = {Gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ) has attracted great attention for electronic device applications due to its ultra-wide bandgap, high breakdown electric field, and large-area affordable substrates grown from the melt. However, its thermal conductivity is significantly lower than that of other wide bandgap semiconductors such as SiC, AlN, and GaN, which will impact its ability to be used in high power density applications. Thermal management in Ga 2 O 3 electronics will be the key for device reliability, especially for high power and high frequency devices. Similar to the method of cooling GaN-based high electron mobility transistors by integrating it with high thermal conductivity diamond substrates, this work studies the possibility of heterogeneous integration of Ga 2 O 3 with diamond for the thermal management of Ga 2 O 3 devices. In this work, Ga 2 O 3 was deposited onto single crystal diamond substrates by atomic layer deposition (ALD), and the thermal properties of ALD-Ga 2 O 3 thin films and Ga 2 O 3 –diamond interfaces with different interface pretreatments were measured by Time-domain Thermoreflectance. We observed a very low thermal conductivity of these Ga 2 O 3 thin films (about 1.5 W/m K) due to the extensive phonon grain boundary scattering resulting from the nanocrystalline nature of the Ga 2 O 3 film. However, the measured thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of the Ga 2 O 3 –diamond interfaces is about ten times larger than that of the van der Waals bonded Ga 2 O 3 –diamond interfaces, which indicates the significant impact of interface bonding on TBC. Furthermore, the TBC of the Ga-rich and O-rich Ga 2 O 3 –diamond interfaces is about 20\% smaller than that of the clean interface, indicating that interface chemistry affects the interfacial thermal transport. Overall, this study shows that a high TBC can be obtained from strong interfacial bonds across Ga 2 O 3 –diamond interfaces, providing a promising route to improving the heat dissipation from Ga 2 O 3 devices with lateral architectures.},

  abstract     = {Screw dislocations are generally considered to be one of the main causes of GaN-based device leakage, but so far, nearly no reports have focused on the effects of open-core screw dislocations on device leakage currents experimentally. In this paper, we use a conductive atomic force microscope to characterize the electronic properties of threading dislocations (TDs) in the GaN layer. The full-core screw dislocations and mixed dislocations are found to provide conductive paths for device leakage currents. In terms of the contribution to device leakage currents, the edge and open-core screw dislocations have smaller effects than the full-core screw dislocations and mixed dislocations. We use isotropic linear elasticity theory and density functional theory calculations to model the core atomic structures of TDs and calculate the corresponding electronic structures. The results show that screw dislocations with full-core structures are found to introduce both deep and shallow energy states within the energy gap dispersedly, while the open-core screw dislocations and the most edge dislocations introduce only shallow energy states. The calculated electronic structures of each type of dislocation are systematically compared and correlated with experimental observations. Our findings demonstrate that full-core screw dislocations and mixed dislocations in the GaN layer have a far more detrimental impact on device leakage than edge and open-core screw dislocations.},

We attribute the first peak to the orthorhombic Imma phase (Si-XI) and the second one to the TO mode of the silicon metallic β -Sn phase (Si-II). Also, in the process of decompression, we observed a first-order-like transition from a highly coordinated metallic crystalline β -Sn phase to the normal tetrahedral LDA phase of the amorphous semiconductor. When the pressure is completely relieved, the powder regains its initial crystalline structure, which suggests that the amorphous phase has retained some structural features of the parent crystalline phase.},

A unified forward current model, namely a modified thermionic emission diffusion model, has been developed to explain the forward characteristics, especially in the regime with a large ideality factor. Three leakage current mechanisms and their applicability boundaries have been identified for various bias conditions and temperature ranges: Frenkel–Poole emission for temperatures above 110 K; variable range hopping (VRH) for 20 K–110 K, but with a reverse bias less than 20 V; high-field VRH, in a similar form of Fowler–Nordheim tunneling, for cryogenic temperatures below 110 K, and relatively large bias (&gt;25 V). Four trap levels with their energy separations from the conduction band edge of 0.100 ± 0.030 eV, 0.300 eV, 0.311 eV, and 0.362 eV have been tagged together with their capture cross sections and trap concentrations. The significantly reduced DLTS signal at 100 K suggested that traps practically became inactive at cryogenic temperatures, thus greatly suppressing the trap-assisted carrier hopping effects.},

  abstract     = {AlGaN films were grown on face-to-face annealed sputter-deposited AlN/sapphire (FFA Sp-AlN) templates via metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), and the growth behavior of the AlGaN films was investigated. The sapphire substrates with small off-cut exhibited poor surface flatness of AlGaN grown on the FFA Sp-AlN templates owing to the formation of large hillock structures. To understand the origin of these hillock structures, the crystallinity and surface morphology of conventional fully MOVPE-grown AlN/sapphire (MOVPE-AlN) templates and the FFA Sp-AlN template were comprehensively studied. The screw- and mixed-type threading dislocation density of the FFA Sp-AlN template was estimated to be approximately 1.8 × 10 6 cm −2 , which was two orders of magnitude lower than that of the MOVPE-AlN template. Consequently, the uniquely observed growth of the hillock structures in the FFA Sp-AlN templates was attributed to their low density of screw- and mixed-type threading dislocations. The large surface off-cut sapphire substrates suppressed the hillock structures on the FFA Sp-AlN templates. The improvement in surface flatness resulted in better optical properties of multiple quantum wells grown on the AlGaN layer. These results demonstrate a promising method for achieving highly efficient and cost effective AlGaN based deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the frictional properties of various polymer binders were studied using atomic force microscopy to enhance the mechanical integrity of the silicon (Si) anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The binders used include polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and polyvinylidene fluoride. The interfacial shear strength of the polymer binder was determined against Si to understand the contact shearing and sliding behaviors. The results showed that due to electrolyte immersion, the intrinsic interfacial shear strengths and pressure coefficients decreased by factors of 1.3–7.5 and 1.6–23.7, respectively. Decreases in mechanical and adhesion properties in the electrolyte may be responsible for the decrease in the frictional properties. The results also showed that topography-induced friction fluctuation became significant in the electrolyte due to an increase in the slope of the surface asperities, which is associated with polymer swelling. The Si anodes of LIBs containing polymer binders with relatively large intrinsic interfacial shear strengths and pressure coefficients in the electrolyte (PAA, PAN, PVA, and CMC) had high capacity retention. Given that a polymer binder with high interfacial shear strength helps maintain the mechanical integrity of the Si anode, PAA with high intrinsic interfacial shear strength may be preferred when the stress level is low during lithiation, while PVA with a large pressure coefficient may be advantageous when the stress level is high during lithiation. The outcome of this work suggests that the interfacial shear strength is a better polymer binder performance indicator than just considering mechanical and adhesion properties.},

STM reveals a surface terminated by As atoms, with the expected semi-metallic behavior. An unexpected zigzag step edge surface reconstruction is observed with emerging electronic states below the Fermi energy. DFT calculations indicate that the step edge reconstruction can be attributed to an As deficiency that results in changes in the density of states of the remaining As atoms at the step edge.

A test sample consisting of a series of trenches of varying depths was prepared by ion beam milling. SHeM images of shallow trenches (depth/width  1) exhibited an enhanced intensity. The scattered helium signal was modeled analytically and simulated numerically using Monte Carlo ray tracing. Both approaches gave excellent agreement with the experimental data and confirmed that the enhancement was due to localization of scattered helium atoms due to multiple scattering.

It is thus of utmost importance to demonstrate the extension of such effects for the IV–VI system in general, thereby elucidating the generality and tunability of such valleytronics. We show the highly tunable valleytronics via gradual compositional control of the tin(II) sulfo-selenide (SnS x Se 1−x ) alloy system with excellent retainment of symmetry-determined selection rules. We show the presence of both ΓY and ΓX valleys in all alloy compositions via selectivity in absorption and emission of linearly polarized light by optical reflection (R)/transmission (T) and photoluminescence measurements and tuned the bandgaps of the valleys within a range of 1.28 eV–1.05 eV and 1.48 eV–1.24 eV, respectively. This simultaneous tuning of non-degenerate valleys agrees well with theoretical calculations. We then fitted the bandgap values in compositional space, obtaining bowing parameters as a useful database. We further demonstrated the feasibility of using IV–VI valleytronics systems in general by elucidating the retainment of strong polarization degrees of as high as 91\% across all compositions. The generalization of such purely symmetry-dependent valleytronics also opens up opportunities for the discovery of more multi-functional materials.},

For comparison, the traditional QEPAS sensor in which the laser beam is perpendicular to the QTF plane (PP-QEPAS) is investigated with the same operating conditions. Theoretical calculations of strain and displacement of the QTF prong were performed to support the advantage of using the IP-QEPAS technique. By selecting water vapor as the gas target, the IP-QEPAS sensor results in a signal more than 40 times higher than that measured with the PP-QEPAS configuration, confirming the potential of this approach.},

Objects are trapped few micrometers below the tip due to the near-field acoustic levitation phenomenon. We first investigate the conditions to achieve an attractive force on the object depending on its size and the device operating frequency. Second, we use a 3D acoustic model that describes the converging forces and torque that provide the self-centering and self-orienting capabilities. Third, a more advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics model based on the Navier–Stokes equations explains the small gap between the tip and the trapped object. The contactless manipulation capabilities of the device are demonstrated by picking, transporting, and releasing a Surface Mount Device in air. The presented manipulation concept can be an interesting alternative for manipulating delicate objects such as microelectromechanical devices, silicon dies, or micro-optical devices.},

For validation, the curing process of a polymer droplet was monitored by using the proposed method, which not only revealed that the curing rate of the polymer surface is faster than that of the interior but also discovered the depth-dependent gelation process. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively reveal curing behaviors inside polymers, which opens new possibilities for better understanding curing kinetics.},

The metasurface behaves as a dynamically reconfigurable surface impedance distribution on one wall of the cavity, effectively perturbing the boundary conditions of the cavity and altering the cavity mode distribution. A microwave signal that passes through the cavity is thus modulated by the changing modal distribution. Assuming that this modulation can happen at a rate faster than the receiver temporal resolution, we show that we can recover the original signal by correlating the pre-recorded response of the modulated cavity with that collected by a slow receiver. This device may find applications in encrypting or compressing microwave signals at the hardware level.},

The applicability of acoustic resonators that not only work in this frequency range but can also be tuned is of great interest in many noise control applications such as muffler devices, noise barriers, or building isolation walls. This Letter studies the acoustic behavior of perforated panel absorbers with oblique perforations. Unlike more complex devices, the proposed absorber uses a simple concept that relies on the increase in the effective length of the panel by using perforations aligned obliquely with respect to the panel surface. In doing so, a shift of the resonance frequency toward low frequencies along with an increase in the sound absorption can be achieved provided that the geometrical characteristics of the absorber are properly chosen. A simple predictive model that relies on the fluid-equivalent theory was developed to investigate the acoustic properties of these absorbers, measurements in an impedance tube over additive manufactured samples serving to confirm the previous assertions. Preliminary results show the potential of these absorbers and encourage their further development for practical purposes.},

  abstract     = {The giant magnetostriction exhibited by pseudobinary Tb–Dy–Fe compounds has attracted considerable attention for use in magneto-mechanical actuators and sensors. However, simultaneously producing a crystallographic orientation and a morphological alignment of the (Tb,Dy)Fe 2 phase along the ⟨111⟩ direction has proven difficult and inhibits further increase in the desired property. This work demonstrates that, by coupling the directional solidification and a high magnetic field, a ⟨111⟩-orientation and -alignment were simultaneously created. In addition, the pores and the defects in the alloys were eliminated, leading to an enhancement of the magnetostrictive performance. Analyses indicate that the controlled growth of the (Tb,Dy)Fe 2 crystal was owing to the collaboration of the multiple magnetic field effects on both the liquid and the solid phases during the directional solidification. Specifically, the magnetic torque induced a rotation of the crystals aligning their easy axis of magnetization (i.e., ⟨111⟩) along the magnetic field direction. Further, the Lorentz force stabilized the directional growth of the crystals by suppressing the convection, while the magnetic force exerted a compressive stress on the paramagnetic alloy melt to remove the gases in the melt. As a result, a highly ⟨111⟩-oriented and -aligned and defect-free Tb–Dy–Fe compound was produced. This strategy may also be expanded to other alloy systems whose phases exhibit a magnetic anisotropy and thereby fabricate anisotropic functional compounds.},

Controlling the oxidation states of the three transition metals in NMC films is crucial for stable battery operation. However, in general, it is very difficult to simultaneously control the oxidation states of three elements in vacuum deposition processes. Tuning the oxygen partial pressure and temperature during deposition led to the growth of NMC thin films with ideal oxidation states (Ni 2+ , Mn 4+ , and Co 3+ ), as confirmed using bulk-sensitive x-ray excited optical luminescence. Next, using the NMC epitaxial thin films, we prepared solid-state batteries that demonstrated stable operation and very low resistance at the solid electrolyte/electrode interfaces. These results provide insight into the fabrication of multi-transition-metal electrode thin film materials, which are important for investigating the mechanisms of lithium battery operation. Furthermore, the low interface resistance indicates that Li 3 PO 4 and oxide electrode materials form very stable low-resistance interfaces.},

The microstructures, chemical composition, hydrophobic characteristics, and self-ejection phenomenon of melting slushes on grooved superhydrophobic surfaces are presented. The grooved superhydrophobic surface demonstrates that multiple self-ejections of isolated melting slush off the original locations with no ice bridges or great surface energy release. In addition, the self-ejection of multiple isolated slushes observed generates enough kinetic energy and removes the residual melting slushes in ways of sweeping off. It is also found that the irregular melting slush with a greater deformation energy and surface contact area demonstrates shorter jumping distances compared to that with a spherical shape and low surface contact area. The observed short-distance self-ejection results from the defects of micro-pores on the indentations, leading to great dissipation in vapor pressures and reduced impact from volume fluctuations. Both the volume fluctuation of slush and the evaporation of intermediate liquid generate the pressure gradient in the upward direction and contribute to the self-ejection behavior of isolated melting slush. The results demonstrate the necessity of fabricating grooved superhydrophobic surfaces without micro-pores and conceptual feasibility of employing volume fluctuation of slush for the self-ejection of isolated single melting slush in the case of slushes with no ice bridges, small surface energy, and low inner vapor pressures.},

The emergence of copper-tolerant strains of X. perforans is predicted to have a devastating impact on industrial scale productions, making it essential to advance approaches to distinguish copper-tolerant from the copper-sensitive X. perforans strains. After introducing a means to measure the bending stiffness of bacteria using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we propose a comparison of the longitudinal and transverse mechanical properties by acquiring high resolution images and force curves of the bacteria. A quantification of the longitudinal and transverse Young&#39;s modulus of bacteria reveals significant differences between copper-sensitive and copper-tolerant strains of X. perforans .

The planar junction characteristics show considerable improvement by adding the Mg pre-flow (Cp 2 Mg) before the p-GaN regrowth, which is attributed to the Mg out-diffusion beyond the regrowth interface. A record high ratio between the Mg concentration and the maximum impurity (C, Si, O) spike at the regrowth interface is demonstrated. Using the optimal regrowth conditions, the fabricated p-GaN/2DEG junction diodes show excellent rectifying behavior with an on/off ratio of over 5 × 10 7 in both large-area devices and the multi-finger devices with 1 μ m-wide finger trenches. A breakdown voltage over 100 V is demonstrated, where the peak electric field is estimated to be at least 2.5 MV/cm at the sidewall junction. These results not only suggest that p-GaN trench-filling regrowth is a viable approach for selective-area p-type doping in GaN power devices but also open a door for the development of unconventional GaN devices based on p-GaN/2DEG junctions.},

  abstract     = {This study demonstrates the origin of 0.7 conductance anomaly and non-volatile reversible control of switching in atomically controlled resistive random access memory devices. In quantum devices, 0.7 structure and zero bias anomaly (ZBA) are considered as the natural presence of spin state. Here, we show that similar behavior can be detected in an atomically thin electrically controllable break junction based on Cu/Ti/HfO 2 /TiN resistive switches in which the origin of the 0.7 structure is statistically controlled by the device design, filament geometry, and optimized electrical measurement scheme. Evidence of temperature dependent evolution of 0.7 plateau and low temperature ZBA is presented here. Lorentzians of the experimental result indicate the formation of a ZBA and non-ZBA like state at a low resistance state and a high resistance state of the resistive switches. Repeated spin-like switching is achieved by controlling the chemical composition of the filament in the sub-quantum region by the electric field driven ion redistribution process. During switching, formation of a ferromagnetic CuO atom in the break junction surrounded by Cu electron sources, i.e., nanoionics, manifests the suitable environment for spin-like behavior.},

The comb generation was observed on the first spurious mode above the fundamental mode resonance when driven a few kHz off resonance at power levels between +11 and +18 dBm. These combs exhibit the expected phase coherence between the teeth with no measurable line broadening from the nonlinear generation. Interestingly, the combs can exhibit a complex structure at particular temperatures. These changes in the comb structure over temperature are thought to be driven by the relative frequency shifts between the interacting modes. Teeth with both much larger and smaller frequency sensitivities to the drive frequency have been observed. These characteristics may be useful for enhancing the sensitivity of resonant-mode MEMS sensors or improving the phase stability of oscillators. In addition, if cryogenically cooled, these highly coherent combs may provide a component for phononic quantum processing studies.},

It is experimentally shown that the temperature dependence of dissipation demonstrates a peak near 30 K. A short illumination leads to a persistent change in the quality factor, which can be compared with the persistent photoconductivity effect. In particular, the illumination persistently suppresses the dissipation peak. This suppression shows that the nature of the peak is not related to the thermoelastic and Akhiezer damping. A hypothesis associating the peak with DX-centers or similar low-symmetry and light-sensitive centers is proposed. The observed effects should be taken into account when studying the low-temperature dissipation using optical methods.},

Low-field magnetoresistance (LFMR) in the LCMO VAN films can be effectively manipulated through varying the high magnetic field strength. The tunability of VAN on the electrical transport properties is dependent on control of the high magnetic field on the microstructures, including the geometrical arrangement, vertical interfaces, and vertical grain boundaries (GBs). An LFMR value as high as 45\% at 150 K and 1 T has been achieved in an LCMO VAN film grown at 10 T, and its LFMR values are larger than 25\% at 127–200 K and 1 T. The tunable and enhanced LFMR in the LCMO VAN films over a wide temperature range can be attributed to the increase in vertical interfaces and GB density with the increasing high magnetic field, which are highly related to the spin-polarized tunneling effect.

In this study, MoSe 2 , WS 2 , and WSe 2 are investigated to determine the existence and strength of out-of-plane electromechanical coupling in other monolayer TMD semiconductor materials. Piezoresponse force microscopy measurements show that monolayer MoS 2 , MoSe 2 , WS 2 , and WSe 2 all exhibit out-of-plane electromechanical response. The relative magnitudes of their out-of-plane electromechanical couplings are calculated and compared with one another and to predictions made from a simple model of flexoelectricity. This simple model correctly predicts the magnitude of out-of-plane electromechanical response in these materials, and the measured values provide useful guidance for both more detailed understanding of flexoelectric response in monolayer TMDs, and assessment of their consequences in devices incorporating these materials.},

Epitaxial K 0.7 Na 0.3 NbO 3 thin films of typically 30 nm in thickness are grown via pulsed laser deposition on (110)-oriented TbScO 3 . A partial plastic lattice relaxation of the epitaxial strain in these samples leads to a relaxor-type ferroelectricity of these films, which strongly affects the SAW properties. Without electronic bias, only tiny SAW signals of ∼0.2 dB can be detected at room temperature, which can be boosted up to ∼4 dB by a static voltage bias added to the high frequency driving current of the SAW transducers. Upon field cooling below the freezing temperature of polar nanoregions (PNRs), this strong SAW signal can be preserved and is even enhanced due to a release of the electronically fixed PNRs if the bias is removed. In contrast, at elevated temperatures, a reversible switching of the SAW signal is possible. The switching shows relaxation dynamics that are typical for relaxor ferroelectrics. The relaxation time τ decreases exponentially from several hours at freezing temperature to a few seconds (&lt;5 s) at room temperature.},

We used the electrical transport measurements to determine the DMI strength to be ∼0.040 pJ/m at room temperature in Pt/Tm 3 Fe 5 O 12 (TmIG) bilayers. The TmIG saturation magnetization and DMI strength exhibit different temperature dependences, which is attributed to the DMI being mainly contributed by Fe ions instead of Tm ions.

By such coexistence, we demonstrate that the in-plane magnetic anisotropy in CrSX monolayers can be manipulated by the reversible ferroelastic strain.

Our calculations exhibit that the electrons of Co-3 d play a dominant role around the Fermi energy ( E F ), while Sn-5 p and N-2 p are mainly distributed from −8 eV to −5 eV and −5 eV to 5 eV, respectively. The interactions of Sn-Co and N-Co disclose the magnetic ground state and bond nature of the compound, which should be an evidential response to the SG behavior in SnNCo 3 .},

Clockwise hysteresis at room temperature and anti-clockwise hysteresis at higher temperature (373 K for ReS 2 and 400 K for MoS 2 ⁠ ) are accompanied by step-like jumps in transfer curves for both forward and reverse voltage sweeps. Hence, a step-like conductance (STC) crossover hysteresis between the transfer curves for the two sweeps is observed at high temperature. Furthermore, memory parameters such as the RESET-to-WRITE window and READ window are defined and compared for clockwise hysteresis at low temperature and STC-type hysteresis at high temperature, showing better memory performance for ReS 2 FETs as compared to MoS 2 FETs. Smaller operating temperature and voltage along with larger READ and RESET-to-WRITE windows make ReS 2 FETs a better choice for thermally aided memory applications. Finally, temperature dependent Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements show decreasing (constant) surface potential with increasing temperature for ReS 2 ( ⁠ MoS 2 ⁠ ). This indicates less effective intrinsic trapping at high temperature in ReS 2 ⁠ , leading to earlier occurrence of STC-type hysteresis in ReS 2 FETs as compared to MoS 2 FETs with increasing temperature.},

Currently, however, the knowledge of the mid-gap defects is fragmented and the known structural and electrical characteristics of the defects cannot be unified in a single atomic model. In this work, a Ge–Ge chain defect model is built by artificial bond rearrangement in an amorphous GeTe network generated by atomic distortion, revealing a possible valence alternation mechanism in its formation. Atoms in the Ge–Ge chain are found to have a crystalline-like environment. The chain is found to have a negative-U property and to introduce mid-gap states. This model unifies the main known properties of the mid-gap defects in amorphous chalcogenide alloy-based phase change materials.},

A lowering of the 5p x/y states at the CBM by −0.4 eV and a reduction of the indirect bandgap were also observed. These orbital-dependent evolutions upon amorphization were caused by weakened interlayer couplings in the disordered quasi-2-dimensional semiconductor.

Unlike the commonly employed vapor–liquid−solid growth, where the amphoteric nature of Si dopants induces p -type conduction, we report a completely catalyst-free, selective area molecular beam epitaxial growth that establishes n -type behavior under Si doping. The vapor–solid selective area growth on prepatterned Si (111) substrates is enabled by an important in situ substrate pretreatment to create an As-terminated 1 × 1-Si(111) substrate necessary for the growth of [111]-oriented GaAs:Si NWs with a large aspect ratio and high yield. Correlated resonant Raman scattering and single-NW micro-photoluminescence ( μ PL) experiments confirm the n -type nature of the Si-doped GaAs NWs evidenced by a dominant Si Ga local vibrational Raman mode, a distinct band filling effect (up to &gt; 10 meV) along with increased PL peak broadening upon increased Si concentration. Excessive Si doping is further found to induce some auto-compensation evidenced by red-shifted PL and the appearance of minor Si As and Si Ga –Si As pair-like local vibrational Raman modes. Employing excitation power dependent μ PL, we further discern signatures in below-gap defect luminescence (∼1.3–1.45 eV) arising from structural defects and Si dopant-point defect complexes.},

The structure undergoes a buckling transformation when subjected to an external deformation while simultaneously being heated. Through computational and experimental results, we demonstrate that the deformation state change leads to programmable acoustic transparency, or opacity, for the scattering particle. Underwater propagation experiments resolved in the near field illustrate that the switchable acoustic characteristics are frozen in the structure with rapid cooling after compression, and the initial acoustic state can be automatically recovered through reheating.},

Probing the Ni -L edge of GdNiO 3 via near edge x-ray absorption fine structure indicates its distinguished intermediate acceptor energy states that are more easily occupied by the thermal excited valence band electrons. The hole-dominated transportation for GdNiO 3 was further confirmed by its increased localization length and opposite sign in magnetoresistance, which are derived from the general tendency of Re NiO 3 , owing to the larger effective mass of holes compared to electrons. The discovery of p- types in GdNiO 3 will further promote establishing Re NiO 3 -based elementary semiconductive devices in the field of correlated electronics.},

  abstract     = {In the quest to predict photoluminescent efficiency in rare-earth substituted inorganic phosphors, research has shown that materials consisting of ordered, rigid crystal structures tend to possess the highest photoluminescent quantum yields. A compound&#39;s Debye temperature (Θ D ), which can be calculated using ab initio calculations, is an ideal proxy for quantitatively comparing structural rigidity among different inorganic compounds, allowing potentially efficient phosphors to be selected from large crystal structure databases. However, the high computational cost of these calculations limits estimating Θ D for unsubstituted host crystal structures only. It is assumed that the low substitution concentration of the rare-earth luminescent center does not significantly influence a material&#39;s Debye temperature. This work evaluates the validity of this approximation by examining the effect of luminescent center substitution on a host structure&#39;s Θ D . Two well-known phosphors, (Y 1– x Ce x ) 3 Al 5 O 12 ( x = 0 − 0.05) and Ba 1-δ Eu δ MgAl 10 O 17 (δ = 0 − 0.15), were synthesized with varying rare-earth concentrations, while Θ D was computationally estimated and then determined by ultrasonic pulse-echo speed-of-sound and low-temperature heat capacity measurements. The ensuing results provide key implications for using Θ D as a proxy for structural rigidity in substituted inorganic compounds.},

Using low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we measured the Kondo resonance in a Co adatom on partially N-adsorbed Cu(001) surfaces, which consist of nanoislands of the Cu 2 N monolayer and the clean Cu(001) surface compressed by the surrounding Cu 2 N nanoislands. The observed Kondo temperature at the compressed clean surface depends on the area size of the surface, i . e . ⁠ , the strength of the local lattice strain. This behavior is attributed to the change in the distance between the Co adatom and Cu surface due to the surface lattice strain, which is supported by our density functional calculations. These results provide a way to detect the local strain on the sub-angstrom scale by using the sensitivity of quantum many-body effects.},

  abstract     = {With rapid development toward shrinking the size of traditional photonic systems such as cameras, spectrometers, displays, and illumination systems, there is an urgent need for high-performance and ultra-compact functional optical elements. Metasurfaces, consisting of an array of subwavelength nanoscatterers with spatially varying geometries, have shown remarkable performance as ultrathin multifunctional optical elements. Here, based on an all-dielectric metasurface, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a spatial domain optical depolarizer capable of efficiently depolarizing linearly polarized light in the visible spectral band from 450 nm to 670 nm, with a degree of polarization of less than 10\%. Remarkably, it is capable of depolarizing the light beam with a diameter down to several micrometers, about two orders of magnitude smaller than commercial liquid-crystal-based depolarizers. We envision the metasurface depolarizer to find its applications in the next generation ultra-compact grating spectrometers and illumination systems.},

The fundamental understanding of the structural phase transition in two-dimensional perovskites is of great importance for fully exploiting their potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Here, we report on how the external electric field affects the structural phase transition in 2D perovskite (BA) 2 PbI 4 microplates via temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy. A high-temperature phase and a low-temperature phase can coexist in a wider range of temperatures. The external electric field would enhance the phase transition to the dominant phase depending on the surrounding temperature. This field-induced phase transition might be ascribed to the release of strain in the perovskite microplate induced by the applied electric field, leading to the change in the structural phase transition temperature. Our findings are of great significance not only to the fundamental understanding of phase transition but also to the design and optimization of two-dimensional perovskite based electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques have enabled dramatic development in modern biology due to their capability to discern features smaller than the diffraction limit of light. Recently, super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF), an analytical approach that is capable of generating super-resolution images easily without the need for specialized hardware or photoswitchable fluorophores, has been presented. While SRRF has only been demonstrated on fluorescence microscopes, in principle, this method can be used to generate super-resolution images on any imaging platforms with intrinsic radial symmetric point spread functions. In this work, we show that SRRF can be utilized to enhance the resolution and quality of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. By including an image registration algorithm to correct for sample drift, the SRRF-TEM approach substantially enhances the resolution of TEM images of three different samples acquired with a commercial TEM system. We quantify the resolution improvement in SRRF-TEM and evaluate how SRRF parameters affect the resolution and quality of SRRF-TEM results.},

  abstract     = {Polymer dispersed liquid crystals (PDLCs) have been shown to be sensitive to ultrasound through the acousto-optic effect. The acousto-optic response of PDLCs was studied over a broad frequency range (0.3–10 MHz). We demonstrate that the displacements required to produce acousto-optic clearing of PDLC films can be as low as a few nanometers, which is at least 10 3 times smaller than the PDLC droplet size, is 10 5 times smaller than the PDLC layer thickness, and of the order of the molecular size of the liquid crystal constituents. This suggests that the acousto-optic effect in PDLCs is due to the microscopic effects of the LC reorientation under torques or flows rather than the LC reorientation through macroscopic droplet deformation. The displacement required for clearing is related to the frequency of operation via an exponential decay. We attribute the observed frequency response to a freezing out of the rotational motion around the short axis of the liquid crystal. The reported frequency dependence and displacements required indicate that the effects and materials described here could be used for ultrasound visualization in a non-destructive testing context.},

Utilizing machine learning for extracting underlying physical parameters increases the throughput of AFM data processing and eliminates inconsistencies intrinsic to manual image analysis, thus enabling the creation of reliable frameworks for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of experimental data. Here, we present a robust and scalable approach to the segmentation of AFM images based on flexible pre-selected classification criteria. The usage of supervised learning and feature extraction allows us to retain the consideration of specific problem-dependent features (such as types of periodical structures observed in the images and the associated numerical parameters: spacing, orientation, etc.). We highlight the applicability of this approach for the segmentation of molecular resolved AFM images based on the crystal orientation of the observed domains, automated selection of boundaries, and collection of relevant statistics. Overall, we outline a general strategy for machine learning-enabled analysis of nanoscale systems exhibiting periodic order that could be applied to any analytical imaging technique.},

Here, we measure the charge and heat transport properties of strongly crystallographically textured ZnO polycrystals at and above room temperature, up to 750 K. Our observations reveal a remarkable difference of the electrical conductivity, Hall coefficient, Seebeck coefficient, and electron mobility between the ZnO c -axis and ab -plane directions. The origin of electron transport anisotropy is discussed. We experimentally show that the lattice thermal conductivity for the c -axis direction can be at least 20\% larger than that for the ab -plane direction, and the anisotropy ratio is only weakly dependent on temperature, which qualitatively agrees well with our first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our DFT calculations also reveal that the heat transport difference between the c -axis and ab -plane directions is due to the anisotropy in phonon group velocities and Umklapp phonon scattering rates. The present work fills in the knowledge gap about ZnO. These findings can provide important implications for designing ZnO crystals to optimize the material or device performance in numerous applications where charge and/or heat transport properties are important.},

  abstract     = {Lithium lanthanum titanate (LLTO) is one of the promising solid-state Li-ion electrolytes for an all-solid-state Li-ion battery system. Although LLTO shows a significantly high Li-ion conductivity of 2.2 × 10 −3 S cm −1 in the bulk, the Li-ion conductivity at the grain boundary is largely reduced to 4.2 × 10 −5 S cm −1 , which prevents the practical application of solid-state Li-ion electrolytes. To solve this problem, the origin of such a low Li-ion conductivity at the grain boundary should be clarified. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the Li-ion conductivity and the geometric structure of the grain boundary in the (Li 0.33 La 0.56 )TiO 3 polycrystal by using electrochemical strain microscopy in atomic force microscopy combined with electron backscatter diffraction in scanning electron microscopy. The experimental data suggest that the Li-ion conductivity is significantly reduced at the random grain boundaries but not at the coincidence-site-lattice (CSL) grain boundaries. Such a small reduction of the Li-ion conductivity at the CSL grain boundaries may originate from the smaller increment of the activation energy, owing to less composition deviations and less structural distortions at the CSL grain boundaries. These results suggest that it is effective to control the geometries of the grain boundaries for further improvement of the Li-ion conductivity in LLTO.},

  abstract     = {Epithelial tumor cells may display different collective invasion behaviors, forming an unjammed flow like a fluid or a jammed deformation like a solid depending on such factors as cell–cell adhesion, cell–substrate adhesion, or the density and shapes of the cells. We investigate the relation between the collective motility and the shapes of human cancer cells under heat stress. The collective dynamics of MGC-803 cells in a confluent monolayer subjected to heat stress at 48 °C for 10 min were observed and analyzed using the long-term live imaging technique. We found that the normal cell motions slow down with increasing cell density and cell–cell adhesion, accompanied by a decrease in the average aspect ratio of the cell shapes and substrate-to-cell traction. Heat stress can speed up cellular motions while almost maintaining the same cell density and cell–cell adhesion and also increases the cell shape index and the traction force exerted by the cells on the substrate. An approximately linear relation is revealed between the collective migration velocity and the shape index of the heated cells. This work helps explain the collective motility of cancer cells and provides inspiration for regulating cell motion with factors such as temperature.},

  abstract     = {Controlled assembly of microscale objects can be achieved by exploiting interactions that dominate at that length scale. Capillary interactions are an excellent candidate for this purpose; microparticles trapped at fluid interfaces disturb the interface shape, migrate, and assemble to minimize the interfacial area. These interactions are independent of microparticle material properties and so can be used to assemble objects of arbitrary materials. By using a magnetic robot as a mobile distortion source, additional control over assembly can be achieved. For example, millimeter-scale magnetic robots that are heavy enough to distort the interface have been used to generate long range capillary attractions and collect passive particles that are hundreds of micrometers in diameter. However, for smaller robots and particles, gravity is less important, and capillary interactions rely on interface distortions from undulated contact lines. We use a magnetic microrobot to manipulate passive microparticles at the water/hexadecane interface via an interplay of hydrodynamic and capillary interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate preferred docking at corners of a square microrobot without the need for high resolution position control. We modulate the strength of docking interactions, allowing structure assembly and release. Finally, we design undulated docking stations with multiple stable sites for cargo delivery. The ability to dynamically manipulate microparticles and their structures at fluid interfaces creates new possibilities for manufacturing of complex microstructures.},

  abstract     = {This paper reports a 30 nm-thick integrated nano-electro-mechanical resonator based on atomically engineered ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide (Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 ) film. A 10 nm-thick Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 layer is atomically engineered through capping with 10 nm-thick titanium nitride (TiN) layer and rapid thermal annealing to promote the orthorhombic crystal phase with strong ferroelectric properties. The resulting metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) membrane is then patterned to create an integrated nano-electro-mechanical resonator with an overall thickness of 30 nm and a planar-to-vertical aspect ratio exceeding 10 4 :1. Benefiting from large electrostrictive effects in ferroelectric Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 , the 30 nm-thick nanomechanical resonator is excited into flexural resonance at 195 kHz with a very large vibration amplitude of ∼100 nm. The transmission response of the nano-electro-mechanical resonator is extracted, using a two-port apodization of the TiN electrodes, showing quality factors ( Q ) of 15 and 3300 at atmospheric and 10 −7 Torr ambient pressures, respectively. Finally, the structural robustness of the MFM nano-membrane is explored through the application of a ∼24 μ m deflection, using a point-force by a micro-probe, highlighting the extended elasticity despite the small thickness and ultra-high aspect ratio. The atomic-level thickness, fully integrated operation, high Q , and structural robustness of the Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 -based nano-membrane resonator promise its potential for the realization of highly integrated transducers for chip-scale classical and quantum information processing and sensing applications.},

Here, we investigate sub-cycle control over the electron dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) materials via adjusting the relative phase of two-color pulses. Electrons in 2D solids are sensitive to the exact shape of the optical field, showing properties similar to those of isolated atoms. Accompanied by spectra modulations, the resultant harmonic yields are enhanced and the cutoff energy increases to a ratio as large as 24\% when an optimized phase is applied. Different from the atomic-like HHG, however, the cutoff energy is linearly dependent on the maximum strength of the light electric field, in line with that shown in conventional bulk solids. Thus, two-dimensional materials provide a unique platform where both bulk and atomic electron dynamics can be investigated. Our work suggests a simple way to generate optimized harmonic emission with existing experimental laser technology and offers a powerful tool for analyzing attosecond quantum dynamics during laser–solid interactions.},

However, the modulation of ferroelectric polarization is recognized as a challenging issue. Here, Sr 3− x Ba x Sn 2 O 7 ceramics with a large remanent polarization with respect to other R–P HIFs (∼1.0 μ C/cm 2 ) combined with a reduced coercive field are reported. The polarization increases obviously with the increasing tolerance factor, inconsistent with the previous understanding. This is because the amplitude of tilt increases and rotation decreases, which results in the increased distortion of SnO 6 octahedra. That is, the polarization of R–P compounds should be determined by the combined effects of tilting and rotation and not be simply evaluated by the tolerance factor.},

This is consistent with the increase in the ferroelectric coercive field due to the suppression of thermally activated domain wall creep motion at cryogenic temperatures. However, the observed insensitivity of the location of the memory window with respect to temperature cannot be explained by the current understanding of the device physics of FeFETs.

With doping concentrations from 15\% to 30\%, the amplitude of the Seebeck coefficient increases from 1.90 μ V/K up to 16.3 μ V/K, which greatly enhances the thermoelectric efficiency (i.e., power factor). Measuring the magnetoresistance and magnetothermoelectric powers at different temperatures indicates that the enhancement of thermoelectric efficiency is a result of spin-dependent scattering from Co nanoparticles, which are less sensitive to the superparamagnetic transitions.

  abstract     = {We demonstrate a two-step procedure for the growth of relaxed GaP on pseudomorphic GaP/Si templates with a threading dislocation density (TDD) of 1.0–1.1 × 10 6 cm −2 . In lattice-mismatched epitaxy, suppressed dislocation nucleation and unimpeded dislocation glide during relaxation are both critical to achieve a low TDD. Our two-step growth process realizes the former by initiating growth with a thin, low growth temperature (T growth ) layer and the latter with a subsequent high-T growth layer. In optimizing the low-T growth layer thickness, we find a trade-off where too little thickness does not suppress dislocation nucleation, while too much thickness takes away the advantage of higher dislocation velocity at high-T growth . Dislocation pileups and trenches are identified as heterogeneous features with a very high local TDD that commonly arise during single-step growth of GaP on Si at high-T growth , and two-step growth virtually eliminates their formation. Overall, this work shows that after initiation at low-T growth , subsequent epitaxy can be performed at high-T growth while avoiding rampant dislocation nucleation, as well as formation of trenches and dislocation pileups.},

The surface morphology of BAlN alloys exhibits a transition stage from a completely two-dimensional to a three-dimensional granular surface with an increased trimethylaluminum/group III (TMAl/III) ratio. Only a shift in the position of the 002 plane reflection peak to higher diffraction angles in the 2 θ − ω scan along with a decrease in intensity was observed, specifying formation of layered BAlN alloys up to a TMAl/III ratio of 14. AlN phase separation was observed while increasing the TMAl/III ratio to 25, supporting SEM observations. Secondary-ion mass spectrometry measurements confirmed the presence of up to 17\% Al in layered BAlN alloy systems. A cross sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study confirmed the layered nature of single phase BAlN alloys. It also revealed the presence of wurtzite Al rich BAlN phases in a matrix of layered hexagonal B rich BAlN. Band to band transition around 5.86 eV has been observed, which shifted slightly to lower energy with increasing Al incorporation. The bowing parameter (C) in boron rich BAlN alloy systems was evaluated to be around 0.65 ± 0.05 eV. Encouraging results were obtained on boron rich BAlN alloy formation, motivating further exploration of growth conditions and study of BAlN fundamental properties for applications in deep UV optoelectronics.},

To unravel the nanocomposite structure of NDC films, both far- and near-field Raman spectroscopy were employed. Based on the comparison of visible and ultraviolet far-field Raman data, component spectra based on either nanodiamond or a-C were estimated by a peak-decomposition procedure based on band fitting. Near-field optical resolution achieved via tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy reveals sharper peaks of both the nanodiamond and the amorphous carbon than the far-field spectra. Consequently, the peak-decomposition procedure is not required, which evidently indicates the effective detection of nanodiamond grains embedded in a-C matrices and is a direct result of the high spatial resolution that limits the number of probed grains. The size of the nanocrystals could additionally be estimated from the profile and position of a diamond peak. This work demonstrates that tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy is a powerful nondestructive method for nanodiamond composite films, which allows direct access to parameters hitherto only available via average data.},

  abstract     = {Silicon quantum photonics provides a promising pathway to realize large-scale quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs) by exploiting the power of complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Toward scalable operation of such silicon-based QPICs, a straightforward approach is to integrate deterministic single-photon sources (SPSs). To this end, hybrid integration of deterministic solid-state SPSs, such as those based on InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs), is highly promising. However, the spectral and spatial randomness inherent in the QDs poses a serious challenge for scalable implementation of multiple identical SPSs on a silicon CMOS chip. To overcome this challenge, we have been investigating a hybrid integration technique called transfer printing, which is based on a pick-and-place operation and allows for the integration of the desired QD SPSs on any locations on the silicon CMOS chips at will. Nevertheless, even in this scenario, in situ fine tuning for perfect wavelength matching among the integrated QD SPSs will be required for interfering photons from dissimilar sources. Here, we demonstrate in situ wavelength tuning of QD SPSs integrated on a CMOS silicon chip. To thermally tune the emission wavelengths of the integrated QDs, we augmented the QD SPSs with optically driven heating pads. The integration of all the necessary elements was performed using transfer printing, which largely simplified the fabrication of the three-dimensional stack of micro/nanophotonic structures. We further demonstrate in situ wavelength matching between two dissimilar QD sources integrated on the same silicon chip. Our transfer-printing-based approach will open the possibility for realizing large-scale QPICs that leverage CMOS technology.},

  abstract     = {Although quantum dots (QDs) show strong photoluminescence and high photostability, they are not widely used as probes for stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy because the excitation of the doughnut-shaped STED beam always generates background noise (the so-called “halo”) that hampers superresolution microscopy. In this study, we attempted to use commercially available CdSe@ZnS QDs with green emission (QD526) as a probe in STED nanoscopy. A lateral resolution of 21.0 nm for a single QD was obtained when using a 488-nm excitation laser and a 592-nm depletion laser. The high resolution achieved was mainly attributed to the fact that no halo was generated around the STED spots. This was also confirmed through spectral analysis in that no spontaneous fluorescence was detected when the QDs were irradiated by the 592-nm laser. The results indicated that the halo could be avoided effectively in QD-assisted STED nanoscopy by tuning the wavelength of the emission peak of the QDs and the depletion laser. This study provides insights into how to easily avoid the halo in QD-assisted STED nanoscopy and how to improve the nanoscopy resolution.},

Here, we propose and analyze theoretically and numerically a waveguide system consisting of two membranes whose surface tensions are time-modulated with a phase difference between them. Strong non-reciprocity and low insertion loss can result for waves transmitted through the structure. An analytic approach is developed to calculate the harmonics generation in the system. Based on this approach, the optimal design of a two-membrane system for non-reciprocal wave behavior is then discussed. By suitably choosing the modulation parameters, the isolation factor for waves incident from opposite sides can reach as high as 19.8 dB and an insertion loss of only 2.8 dB, with an overall dimension being less than 1/3 wavelength. These theoretical results are verified by time-dependent finite element simulations. Our work provides a feasible way to design acoustic non-reciprocal devices.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) have been considered as promising electrically switchable nonvolatile data storage elements due to their fast switching speed, programmable conductance, and high dynamic range for neuromorphic applications. Meanwhile, FeFETs can be aggressively shrunk to the atomic scale for a high density device integration, ideally, without comprising the performance by introducing two-dimensional (2D) materials. So far, the demonstrated 2D material-based FeFETs mainly rely on mechanically exfoliated flakes, which are not favorable for large-scale industrial applications, and FeFETs based on organic ferroelectrics typically show a large writing voltage (e.g., &gt;±20 V), making these types of memory devices impractical to be commercially viable. Here, we demonstrate that monolayer MoS 2 grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can be used as a resistive switching channel to fabricate FeFETs, in which the MoS 2 channel is modulated by a hybrid gate stack of HfO 2 /ferroelectric HfZrO x thin films. The programming processes in the 2D MoS 2 FeFETs originate from the ferroelectric polarization switching, yielding two distinct write and erase states for data storage and cumulative channel conductance for artificial synapse applications. Our 2D FeFETs show a low-voltage-driven feature (&lt;±3 V) and gate-tunable ferroelectric hysteresis characteristics. The thin HfO 2 layer in the hybrid gate stack likely plays crucial roles in preserving the ferroelectricity of the device and lowering the threshold of switching voltages through energy redistribution. Our findings open an avenue for the use of CVD-grown layered materials as the resistive switching mediums combined with HfO 2 -based ferroelectrics for future energy-efficient “brain-on-a-chip” hardware.},

The release of lithium ions and the subsequent lithiation were driven by energetic electron beam irradiation, both of which in turn triggered the H to T′ phase transition of the object monolayer MoS 2 . The as-formed T′ phase domains showed a random nucleation behavior. Interestingly, the reverse process, i.e., T′ back to H phase transition, caused by prolonged e-beam illumination, was also captured in situ . During both phase transformation processes, i.e., H → T′ and T′ → H, we did not observe any large area T phase existing in monolayer MoS 2 .

It can be found that the frequency of the A 1 g mode increases with the decreasing temperature. When the temperature reaches 110 K, the A 1 g mode abruptly converts to a low wavenumber. This phenomenon proves the CDW formation of VSe 2 with the 5 nm thickness. It can be interpreted as arising from an enhanced electron–phonon coupling mechanism. Moreover, variable temperature-dependent Raman spectra for VSe 2 with different thicknesses showed that the phase transition temperature gradually increased with the thickness. In addition, the CDW phase transition has also been detected by the abrupt change of the resistance, and its slope is located at about 112 K.

  abstract     = {Charge density waves (CDWs) have received extensive attention due to their unique physical properties and potential applications in oscillators and memory devices. Transition metal dichalcogenides are typical prototypes for studying CDWs. 1T′-VSe 2 films grown by molecular beam epitaxy exhibited a sudden change in resistance at about 270 K, corresponding to a critical temperature of transition from the normal phase to the CDW phase. In addition, the phase transition can be modulated by voltage and the corresponding resistance states are controllable due to local Joule heating, which could be applied to the memory device. Temperature-dependent Raman characterization showed a significant change in the Raman pattern of the 1T′-VSe 2 films around 270 K, further confirming the CDW phase transition observed by electrical transport measurements. The results are important not only for understanding the microscopic physics and electrical control of CDW phases, but also probably play an important role in the future applications of these CDW materials.},

  abstract     = {Here, we demonstrate write voltage-dependent electron transport mechanisms in Pt/BaTiO 3 /Nb:SrTiO 3 ferroelectric tunnel memristors. Tunable resistances associated with a large resistance variation were observed at room temperature. It is found that the electron transport mechanism of the device depends not only on the polarity, but also on the magnitude of the write voltage. For positive write voltages, the memristor holds a low resistance state whereas for low negative write voltages, the memristor exhibits a high resistance state. However, an enhanced negative write voltage causes a transition of the transport behavior from direct tunneling into Schottky thermionic emission. The ferroelectric polarization modulation of electron accumulation or depletion at the ferroelectric/semiconductor interface and the resultant change of the interface barrier width/height under the external voltages are proposed to be responsible for the write voltage-dependent electron transport mechanisms.},

The tunnel currents of the FTJ on silicon show a large tunneling electroresistance (∼1 × 10 5\%) effect, which is explained by a numerical FTJ model incorporating pinned dipoles at the interfaces.

Atomic layer deposition is one of the preferred techniques for the fabrication of hafnium zirconium oxide thin films, with a standard choice of oxidizer being either O 3 or H 2 O. In this study, we explore various oxidizing conditions and report on the in situ treatment of hydrogen plasma after every atomic layer during the deposition of hafnium zirconium oxide to increase the virgin state polarization. Three different oxidization methods were utilized during the fabrication of the Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 films: H 2 O, O 2 plasma, and O 2 plasma followed by H 2 plasma. The 10 and 8 nm thick films oxidized with only O 2 plasma result in initially anti-ferroelectric films. Comparatively, the addition of H 2 plasma after every O 2 plasma step results in films with strong ferroelectric behavior. Peak shifting of the GIXRD pattern suggests that the sequential O 2 -H 2 plasma films tend more to the orthorhombic phase as compared to the O 2 plasma and H 2 O oxidized films.},

These feedhorn-coupled detectors are sensitive over a 40\% fractional bandwidth centered on λ = 2 mm, are dual-polarization-sensitive, and consist of lumped-element superconducting resonators fabricated from a hybrid of stoichiometric TiN and Al films together with an amorphous-Si passivation layer. When observing a 7 K, 3.8 pW thermal load and employing no signal modulation scheme, the measured noise spectrum is white down to 50 mHz and has an amplitude consistent with photon noise.

The devices, fabricated using electron-beam and laser lithography, were tested using magneto-optical Kerr microscopy and electrical transport measurements.

We confirm a clear amorphous structure and paramagnetic behavior of our a-YIG films, with semiconducting behavior resistivity that strongly decays with increasing temperature. The non-local transport measurements show a signal that is not compatible with spin transport and can be attributed to the drop of the a-YIG resistivity caused by Joule heating.

The invariance of localized states on the alloy composition creates a convenient internal reference energy with respect to which other energy states may be measured. We demonstrate a higher generality to the universality rule with the independence of deep transition states of otherwise shallow donor type defects [(+1/+3) transition for V N ] and defect complexes (C N +Si III ) in addition to the earlier predicted independent nature of mid-gap states when they are either the antibonding state between cationic impurities and host anion or acceptors at anion sites.},

Self-atom irradiation of the material, modeled using thermal spikes and stochastic-boundary conditions, results in glassy models with a significant reduction of diffusive thermal transport compared to the pristine glassy structure.

  abstract     = {Interfaces between two topological insulators are of fundamental interest in condensed matter physics. Inspired by experimental efforts, we study interfacial processes between two slabs of BiSbTeSe 2 (BSTS) via first principles calculations. Topological surface states are absent for the BSTS interface in its equilibrium separation, but our calculations show that they appear if the inter-slab distance is greater than 6 Å ⁠ . More importantly, we find that topological interface states can be preserved by inserting two or more layers of hexagonal boron nitride between the two BSTS slabs. In experiments, the electric current tunneling through the interface is insensitive to back gate voltage when the bias voltage is small. Using a first-principles based method that allows us to simulate the gate field, we show that at low bias, the extra charge induced by a gate voltage resides on the surface that is closest to the gate electrode, leaving the interface almost undoped. This provides clues to understand the origin of the observed insensitivity of transport properties to back voltage at low bias. Our study resolves a few questions raised in experiment, which does not yet offer a clear correlation between microscopic physics and transport data. We provide a road map for the design of vertical tunneling junctions involving the interface between two topological insulators.},

Every pixel of the CCD camera detects the cosine curve of the phase beating at the corresponding spatial point separately and eventually forms a wavefront distribution, whose spatial resolution is the size of the pixel. The phase singularity and the wavefront helicity of a vortex optical beam are obtained by the proposed method, and the phase jump from the simulation is reproduced by the measurement.

  abstract     = {Recent advances in silicon photonics have enabled large-scale optical phased arrays for applications such as beam steering and directional light detection. However, to date, these results have only been applied to coherent light. Many applications, including passive imaging with natural illumination, require operation using incoherent and/or broadband light. Here, we implement an optical phased array designed for these applications using a planar, fractal, path length-matching architecture known as an “H-tree.” We demonstrate electronic beamsteering and natural light imaging using this flat, broadband, photonic-integrated device.},

  abstract     = {This Letter covers the design and implementation of a generalizable system for the precise alignment of X-ray gratings. Next-generation high-energy grating-based Differential Phase Contrast (gDPC) X-ray imaging systems require precise alignment of the X-ray gratings as low as 1 mrad in rotation and 0.5 mm in translation. In this work, we designed holographic fiducial marks, consisting of four reflective Fresnel zone plates, each placed in a separate quadrant of the mark. When illuminated with a collimated laser beam, each mark creates a predefined pattern of four points, which changes quantitatively for any misalignment in each of the three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom. We fabricated the designed fiducial marks using photolithography and etching processes. The experimental system is implemented using a HeNe laser and an optical imaging system, which includes a beam expander, a plate beam splitter, and a CMOS camera, suitable for aligning practical gratings in gDPC X-ray imaging systems. Our experimental results demonstrate the rotational precision capabilities of the reported alignment system down to 0.42 mrad around the optical axis and 0.03 mrad around the axes perpendicular to the optical axis. The translational precision of 83.64 μ m along the optical axis and 1.22 μ m along the axes perpendicular to the optical axis is also demonstrated.},

Traditional acoustic holography typically relies on arrays of discrete sound emitters independently driven by sophisticated circuits to generate the required phase and amplitude profile. Recently, we witnessed growing efforts to conquer the realm of acoustic metasurfaces as a possible platform to reconstruct computer-generated holograms due to their advantages in manipulating sound waves with a well-controlled phase and/or amplitude. In this article, we review the latest efforts to explore an acoustic metasurface hologram in transmission-type and reflection-type systems, where we discuss how artificial meta-pixels appear as highly useful ingredients to tailor the flow of sound and transform a conventional incident wave into a desired arbitrary-complex wavefront in the far field. We summarize the latest advancements from their design principles to versatile functional applications, and some future research directions are also provided.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the effect of residual stress in a film on the growth behavior of a free-standing metallic micro/nanowire due to electromigration (EM) is examined. The growth of a wire is accompanied by atomic diffusion, accumulation of atoms, and release of compressive EM-induced localized hydrostatic stress due to the accumulation of atoms. Hence, the growth of the wire dominantly depends on the EM-induced localized stress caused by the accumulation of atoms. Because rigid passivation generates a strong localized stress field in the metallic interconnect, with greater accumulation of atoms, the EM-induced localized stress state for wire growth is influenced by passivation conditions, including the thickness and residual stress associated with passivation. Two samples with different passivation thicknesses, resulting in different levels of residual stress, were used to elucidate the influence of passivation conditions on the growth performance of Al microwires. The growth rate was experimentally measured. An x-ray diffraction system was used to obtain the value of residual stress in passivation, demonstrating that a higher absolute value of compressive residual stress results in a lower growth rate. In contrast, a lower absolute value increases the growth rate of the wire and can decrease the delamination risk of the topmost passivation, deposited by sputtering. Contrarily, a passivation that is too thin, resulting in a lower absolute value of compressive stress, increases the risk of passivation crack due to the accumulation of atoms by EM. A suitable passivation thickness for a desired wire growth must be determined based on this finding.},

In the ML approach (backpropagation), the wavefunction data obtained from experiments are interpreted as the attribute class (input data), while the spectrum of quantum numbers establishes the label class (output data). To evaluate this approach, we employ two exactly solvable models with the random modulated wavefunction amplitude. The random factor allows modeling the incompleteness of information about the state of quantum system. The trial wave functions are fed into the neural network, with the goal of making prediction about the spectrum of quantum numbers. We found that in such a configuration, the training process occurs with rapid convergence if the number of analyzed quantum states is not too large. The two qubit entanglement is studied as well. The accuracy of the test prediction (after training) reached 98\%. It is considered that the ML approach opens up important perspectives to plane the quantum measurements and optimal monitoring of complex quantum objects.},

We model both the optical and optoelectronic components of the TPV system and study the influence of the emitter selectivity on the optimum bandgap of the photovoltaic cell, heat sink requirements, and maximum conversion efficiency for any given emitter temperature from 1000 to 2000 K. Our calculations suggest that thermal emitters with at least 20 dB suppression of sub-bandgap emission and an emission enhancement of 100× can push the overall efficiency to 70\% of Carnot&#39;s limit. Furthermore, we show that such an extreme requirement on suppression is at the performance limits for resonant thermal emitters employing refractory plasmonic materials such as Mo, W, Ta, TiN, and carbon nanotubes.},

However, there are few reports utilizing the same oxide matrix materials with appropriate doping to simultaneously enhance the piezoelectric and triboelectric outputs. Herein, a hybrid nanogenerator (HG) consisting of a piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) and a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) was constructed using (Ba 0.838 Ca 0.162 )(Ti 0.9072 Zr 0.092 )O 3 (BCZTO)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a piezoelectric layer and Ba(Ti 0.8 Zr 0.2 )O 3 (BZTO)/PDMS as a triboelectric layer. For the PENG, how the electrical output was related to the BCZTO ratio in the BCZTO/PDMS composite films was systematically investigated. For the TENG, remarkably enhanced output performance is attributed to the ferroelectric polarization and large permittivity of the BZTO/PDMS. The Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements show that the poled BZTO/PDMS composite film with a 20 wt.\% mass ratio of BZTO has the highest surface charge potential, in line with the macroscopic electrical outputs of the TENG. Interestingly, the output performance of the PENG in the HG is significantly enhanced compared to the PENG acting alone, which is also verified by COMSOL simulation. After rectification, the HG can produce a maximum output voltage of 390 V and a current density of 47 mA/m 2 . This work not only provides a feasible solution to enhance the output performance of the HG but also offers an effective approach to develop a small, portable power source with promising application in self-powered electronics.},

  abstract     = {For the development of advanced robots, there is an increasing demand to design self-adaptive envelope graspers that can take objects of unknown shapes, sizes, and softness. Inspired by the predation strategy of sea anemones, we propose a soft actuator by filling liquid into a torus. When a pulling force is applied at the interior skin of the torus, its exterior skin will roll inward and suck the target. Similar to the predation behavior of sea anemones, the inward crimping of the skin is able to grip and hold objects with different shapes, weights, and materials. By adjusting the rolling direction and length of the torus skin, the object could be engulfed, swallowed, and released. The prototype of such a gripper is fabricated, which demonstrates the versatility of application in various environments. This work provides an alternative route for designing self-adaptive graspers.},

By using BaTiO 3 , a high-k material, as a dielectric material between the anode and semiconductor, the peak electric field at the anode edge near the cathode was significantly reduced and an average breakdown field exceeding 8 MV/cm was achieved for devices with an anode to cathode spacing of &lt;0.2 μ m. In contrast, Pt/Al 0.58 Ga 0.42 N control Schottky diodes displayed an average breakdown field of ∼4 MV/cm for devices with similar dimensions. The use of a high-k dielectric can more effectively utilize the high breakdown fields in ultra-wide bandgap materials by proper management of the electric field.

We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for isolating the electrical damping of a mechanical resonator due to Ohmic dissipation in the readout amplifier. The quality factor suppression arising from the amplifier is strongly dependent on the amplifier feedback resistance and parasitic capacitance. By studying the thermomechanical displacement noise spectrum of a doubly clamped micromechanical beam, we confirm that electrical dissipation tunes the actual, not effective, quality factor. Electrical dissipation is an important consideration in the design of sensitive capacitive displacement transducers, which are a key component in resonant sensors and oscillators.},

Numerical analysis is performed on the dispersive characteristics of the Lamb modes propagating in AlN plates, and the design parameters to enable zero group velocity ( v g ) for the S 1 mode are identified. The simulation results based on finite element analysis verify that the use of the damped edge reflectors, instead of the conventional edge reflectors, can efficiently de-couple most of the Lamb waves such as the S 0 mode by mode conversion upon edges, but not the S 1 mode characterizing zero v g .

In addition, the MgO layer formed by thermal oxidation could effectively passivate the surface traps that were caused in the previous etching procedure.

In this study, the molecular orientation in codeposited films composed of a host molecule and a disk-shaped emitter that exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence is investigated systematically. It is found that the orientation of the transition dipole moment (TDM) of the disk-shaped emitters is strongly dependent on the glass transition temperature and the polarization of the host molecules, and almost perfectly horizontal orientation of the TDM of the disk-shaped emitters can be realized. Our findings clarify the role of the host–guest dipole–dipole interaction in the molecular orientation, and it will enable the expansion of both the molecular design and the material combination rules for high-performance OLEDs.},

The high mechanical flexibility allows applying mechanical strain to reduce the bandgap by 1.5 eV. With increasing strain, the bandgap undergoes an unusual indirect-direct-indirect-direct transition. We also show that the uniaxial strain can effectively control the Si-Si dimer alignment, which is beneficial for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen octahedra tilt (OOT) transition is the most common type of distortion in inorganic ABO 3 compounds with a perovskite crystal structure. The importance of OOT transitions is underlined by accompanying changes in the B-O and A-O bonding environments, which consequently affects the electronic states and hence influences electrical, magnetic, and superconducting properties of many perovskite compounds. In recent years, controlled manipulation of the OOT order in perovskite thin film ferroelectrics has been attempted through heteroepitaxial strain engineering. The current study demonstrates an alternative approach whereby OOT ordering in a 200 nm thick polycrystalline thin film of (Na 1/2 Bi 1/2 )TiO 3 (NBT) Pb-free ferroelectric is induced by applying electric-field along the 111 octahedral tilt axis, which is furthermore enabled by a strong (111) crystallographic texture normal to the film surface. In situ x-ray diffraction reveals that electric-field-induced OOT ordering proceeds through nucleation and rapid growth of domains with ordered a − a − a − tilting, followed by an increase in the tilt angle within the ordered domains.},

  abstract     = {We investigate temperature-dependent electrical properties of Pt/Nb:SrTiO 3 Schottky junctions by measuring current–voltage and capacitance–voltage curves at various temperatures (20 K–300 K). Interestingly, the Schottky junctions have shown different temperature dependences of resistance according to the polarity of bias voltage: insulating behaviors are displayed in the positive bias branch, while metallic behaviors are observed in the negative bias branch. These behaviors can be ascribed to Schottky barrier modulation that arises from the temperature and field dependences of dielectric permittivity of SrTiO 3 . The modulation of the barrier profile determines anomalous tunneling current in the negative bias branch as a function of temperature. These comprehensive analyses could not only reveal the rich physics of the Pt/Nb:SrTiO 3 Schottky junction but also enhance our understanding for high dielectric materials.},

  abstract     = {Tailoring the magnetic anisotropy of a ferromagnet film is the critical issue to construct high-efficient magnetic memory and logic devices. In this paper, we demonstrated a controllable magnetic anisotropy of Pt/Co/HfO 2 multilayers by tuning the oxygen-dependent orbital occupancy at the Co/HfO 2 interface. Driven by the large difference in formation enthalpy between HfO 2 with CoO, an effective O 2− migration occurred at the Co/HfO 2 interface by thermal activation, which increased the electronic occupation on the Co 3 d z 2 orbit and facilitated the out-of-plane Co-O orbital hybridization. Therefore, the interfacial magnetic anisotropy energy was enhanced by two times, leading to a transition from in-plane to out-of-plane anisotropy. Conversely, the O 2− migration was suppressed when HfO 2 was replaced by ZnO with the formation enthalpy close to CoO, which makes the orbital tunability effect disappear and the magnetic anisotropy of film unchangeable. These findings are crucial for exploiting the magnetoionic control of interfacial magnetism and advancing the functionalized design of memorizers based on orbital engineering.},

The thermomagnetic curves show an unambiguous noncoincidence between zero-field-cooled and field-cooled protocols, indicating the presence of magnetically inhomogeneous phases in the film in the low temperature range. Magnetic measurements, including magnetic relaxation and magnetic memory effects, demonstrate that the exchange bias should be attributed to the exchange interaction between ferromagnetic clusters and the antiferromagnetic host in the Ni 38.8 Co 2.9 Mn 37.9 Ti 20.4 thin film at low temperature. The local Mn-Co-Mn configuration provides the ferromagnetic contribution, which is formed in the antiferromagnetic Heusler main phase due to the small amount of Co-substitution for Ni. The achievement of the large exchange bias effect in the Ni 38.8 Co 2.9 Mn 37.9 Ti 20.4 thin film is a significant addition to the existing multiple magneto-responsive effects in all-3 d -metal Ni-Mn-based Heusler systems.},

  abstract     = {A non-vanishing electric field inside a non-centrosymmetric crystal transforms into a momentum-dependent magnetic field, namely, a spin–orbit field (SOF). SOFs are of great use in spintronics because they enable spin manipulation via the electric field. At the same time, however, spintronic applications are severely limited by the SOF, as electrons traversing the SOF easily lose their spin information. Here, we propose that in-plane ferroelectricity in (001)-oriented SnTe thin films can support both electrical spin controllability and suppression of spin dephasing. The in-plane ferroelectricity produces a unidirectional out-of-plane Rashba SOF that can host a long-lived helical spin mode known as a persistent spin helix (PSH). Through direct coupling between the inversion asymmetry and the SOF, the ferroelectric switching reverses the out-of-plane Rashba SOF, giving rise to a maximally field-tunable PSH. Furthermore, the giant out-of-plane Rashba SOF seen in the SnTe thin films is linked to the nano-sized PSH, potentially reducing spintronic device sizes to the nanoscale. We combine the two ferroelectric-coupled degrees of freedom, longitudinal charge and transverse PSH, to design intersectional electro-spintronic transistors governed by non-volatile ferroelectric switching within nanoscale lateral and atomic-thick vertical dimensions.},

Here, we examine the origin of spin Hall magnetoresistance-like signals measured in a standard Hall bar geometry, which have recently been taken as evidence of current-induced switching of the antiferromagnetic order in Pt/AFI bilayers. We show that transverse voltage signals consistent with both the partial switching and toggle switching of the Néel vector in epitaxial Pt/NiO bilayers on Al 2 O 3 are also present in Pt/Al 2 O 3 in which the AFI is absent. We show that these signals have a thermal origin and arise from (i) transient changes in the current distribution due to nonuniform Joule heating and (ii) irreversible changes due to electromigration at elevated current densities, accompanied by long-term creep. These results suggest that more sophisticated techniques that directly probe the magnetic order are required to reliably exclude transport artifacts and thus infer information about the antiferromagnetic order in such systems.},

The endurance of the devices at 9 K surpassed that at 300 K by three orders of magnitude under the same write conditions, functioning for more than 10 12 cycles with 10 ns write pulses. The switching voltage at 9 K was observed to increase by 33\% to 93\%, depending on the pulse duration, compared to that at 350 K. Ferromagnetic resonance and magnetization measurements on blanket pMTJ film stacks suggest that the increased switching voltage is associated with an increase in the energy barrier of the free layer with decreasing temperature. Our work demonstrates that CoFeB/MgO-based pMTJs have great potential to enable cryogenic magnetic random access memory and that their exchange stiffness, magnetization, and effective magnetic anisotropy can be further optimized to lower operating power and improve endurance.},

The anomalous Hall conductivity as large as σ AHE = 40 Ω −1 cm −1 was observed at R.T. This value can be translated to the anomalous Hall conductivity per net magnetization M as | σ AHE / M | = 0.6 V −1 , which is much larger compared to those for general ferromagnetic materials. We also show that σ AHE depends on the crystallinity of Mn 3 Ir as well as the chemical order parameter S characterizing a content of the L1 2 phase.

The magnetization of the interfacial FM layer at the I/FM interface was found to be aligned opposite to the magnetization of the rest of the FM layer. This result indicates that the Cooper pairs tunnel across the insulator, interact with the local magnetization in the interfacial region (extending ∼30 Å) of the FM, and then modify the magnetization at the interface. This unexpected magnetic behavior cannot be explained on the basis of the existing theoretical models. However, the length scale associated here clearly suggests the long-range proximity effect as a result of tunneling of Cooper pairs. The magnetic exchange field-effect across SC/I/FM interfaces driven by tunneling may serve as the basis for application in superconducting spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {A gate voltage application in a Si-based spin metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (spin MOSFET) modulates spin accumulation voltages, where both electrical conductivity and drift velocity are modified while keeping constant electric current. An unprecedented reduction in the spin accumulation voltages in a Si spin MOSFET under negative gate voltage applications is observed in a high electric bias current regime. To support our claim, the electric bias current dependence of the spin accumulation voltage under the gate voltage applications is investigated in detail and compared with a spin drift diffusion model including the conductance mismatch effect. The drastic decrease in the mobility and spin lifetime in the Si channel is ascribable to the optical phonon emission at the high electric bias current, which consequently reduced the spin accumulation voltage.},

  abstract     = {Future spintronic devices on the nanoscale require low-dimensional materials with high spin polarization. Transition-metal trichlorides have received much attention because 2D ferromagnetism is observed in them such as the ferromagnetic semiconductor of CrI 3 monolayer and the ferromagnetic Dirac spin gapless semiconductor of VCl 3 monolayer with 100\% spin polarization. What about their spin transport properties? Here, we design the magnetic tunnel junction of VCl 3 /CoBr 3 /VCl 3 with the electrode of the spin gapless semiconductor of VCl 3 monolayer and the tunneling barrier of the nonmagnetic semiconductor of CoBr 3 monolayer and explore the spin-polarized bias-voltage-dependent tunneling current. Our first-principles calculations combined with nonequilibrium Green&#39;s function indicate that VCl 3 /CoBr 3 /VCl 3 exhibits a high tunnel magnetoresistance ratio (up to 4.5 × 10 12\%) and a perfect spin filtering effect, which make the VCl 3 monolayer useful in 2D spintronic devices. The physical origins of these versatile spin transport properties are discussed in terms of the spin gapless semiconductor property of the VCl 3 monolayer and the spin-dependent transmission spectrum.},

An improved model combining the effects from interface states and hole traps in Si 3 N 4 is proposed to extract the interface state density ( ⁠ D i t ⁠ ) accurately. Based on the model, D i t can be obtained by extrapolating the trap density to a zero-thickness dielectric.

  abstract     = {La-doped SrSnO 3 (LSSO) is known as one of the deep-ultraviolet (DUV)-transparent conducting oxides with an energy bandgap of ∼4.6 eV. Since LSSO can be grown heteroepitaxially on more wide bandgap substrates such as MgO ( E g ∼ 7.8 eV), LSSO is considered to be a good candidate for a DUV-transparent electrode. However, the electrical conductivity of LSSO films is below 1000 S cm −1 , most likely due to the low solubility of the La ion in the LSSO lattice. Here, we report that high electrically conducting (&gt;3000 S cm −1 ) LSSO thin films with an energy bandgap of ∼4.6 eV can be fabricated by pulsed laser deposition on a MgO substrate followed by a simple annealing in vacuum. From the X-ray diffraction and the scanning transmission electron microscopy analyses, we found that lateral grain growth occurred during the annealing, which improved the activation rate of the La ion, leading to a significant improvement of the carrier concentration (3.26 × 10 20 cm −3 ) and Hall mobility (55.8 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ). The present DUV-transparent oxide semiconductor would be useful as a transparent electrode for developing optoelectronic devices, which transmit and/or emit DUV-light.},

  abstract     = {The semiconductor MoS 2 has attracted much attention owing to its sizable energy bandgap, significant spin–orbit coupling, and quantum effects such as the valley Hall effect and gate-induced superconductivity. However, in electronic devices, the energy bandgap usually gives rise to the formation of Schottky barriers at the interface to the contact metal, which may render devices intended for quantum transport inapplicable at low temperature. Therefore, the fabrication of Ohmic contacts operational at low temperature is crucial. Yet, it currently remains a substantial challenge to produce low resistive contacts with a simple process. We manifest that low temperature Ohmic contacts to mono- and few-layer MoS 2 can be achieved with Tin (Sn) as the contact metal. Sn is directly evaporated onto MoS 2 ⁠ , and hence, this establishes a much easier fabrication method than tunneling barriers, for example. We provide detailed device characterization, extract Schottky barrier heights, demonstrate multiterminal measurements, and propose a possible explanation: strain induced deformation of MoS 2 imposed by Sn.},

Here, we prepared amorphous Sc 0.3 Sb 2 Te 3 nanocomposites within a minute amount of face-centered-cubic (FCC) type nanograins embedded in the amorphous matrix. Using in situ high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we found that nanograins were frustrated under high pressure and gradually dissolved into the matrix around 11.0 GPa. Beyond 11.0 GPa, the a-SST matrix transformed into a uniform high density metallic like amorphous state with a five orders of magnitude drop in electric resistivity compared to the pristine materials. When further compressed to 23.97 GPa, the high density amorphous (HDA) phase switched into a body-centered-cubic (BCC) high-pressure structure, a different phase from the ambient pressure crystalline structure. Upon decompression back to ambient pressure, a pure amorphous phase was sustained. The present study provides additional insight into the phase change mechanism of amorphous nanocomposites.},

The results shows that Poisson&#39;s ratio of the designed metamaterial can be changed from −0.45 to 0.35 with different cell parameters. Acoustic tests show that the designed metamaterial provides an ultra-wide phononic bandgap and exhibits outstanding wave attenuation properties. By applying rational tensile/compression force, the bandgap is widened/narrowed, which indicates the tunability of the bandgap through deformation. Moreover, the bandgap tuning is through all high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone due to the iso-auxeticity of the metamaterial. This study provides a possible way for controlling the bandgap with the deformable metamaterial.},

Moreover, the rate performance (100 mAh·g −1 ) of LNMO-1LZO at a high current density of 10 C was superior to those of pristine LNMO and other modified samples. The enhanced electrochemical performance was ascribed to the generation of dual-phase island-shaped LZO with an interior crystalline phase, which accelerated Li + diffusion, and an exterior amorphous shell, which enhanced interfacial compatibility and stability without influencing the intrinsic spinel structure of bulk LNMO.

By using a home-made strain apparatus, a nearly uniaxial stress is precisely applied to ZnO microwires, thus inducing an internal strain along its c -axis. Dynamic tuning of cavity polariton modes is clearly characterized by angle-resolved microphotoluminescence spectroscopy. The coupled oscillator&#39;s model with fitting parameters of strain-dependent excitons&#39; energies can well describe the modes&#39; redshift. Moreover, we show that the modes&#39; redshift can also be understood by the strain-induced refractive index increase, described by the Lorentz model, of which the underlying mechanism is also related to light-exciton strong coupling. Finally, the strain-engineered dynamic tuning of polariton lasing modes is demonstrated as well, and this actually provides convincing evidence for the polariton states surviving above the threshold. This work indicates that strain-engineered cavity polaritons would pave an alternative way for developing polariton-based integrated or flexible optoelectronic devices.},

The technique combines time-correlated single-photon counting with single-molecule localization microscopy by monitoring the emission centroid location with a 2 × 2 array of optical fibers that are coupled to four single-photon counting detectors. We applied this method to image isolated and clustered CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots (QDs). Single QDs were localized with ∼5 nm precision using 10 4 detected photons. Within clusters, emission centroids separated by ∼12 nm were resolved, and spatial mapping of both the emission intensity and lifetime provided evidence of energy transport pathways among the QDs.},

We demonstrate an x-ray plenoptic microscope that uses a concentrating microcapillary array instead of a microlens array and can simultaneously acquire from one hundred to one thousand x-ray projections of imaged volumes that are located in the focal spot region of the microcapillary array. Hence, tomographic slices at various depths near the focal plane can be reconstructed in a way similar to tomosynthesis but from a single x-ray exposure. The microscope enables the depth-resolved imaging of small subvolumes in large samples and can be used for the imaging of weakly absorbing artificial and biological objects by means of propagation phase-contrast.},

By experimentally identifying the respective contributions from the nanoparticle size, grain boundaries, dislocation density, and nanoparticle volume percentage, it suggests that a low volume percent of TiB 2 nanoparticles can reduce the electron concentration significantly to decrease the electrical conductivity of the Al-TiB 2 nanocomposites, while yielding less effect on the electron mobility. Moreover, the results show that the intrinsically enhanced electron-phonon interaction and the interfacial bound states by TiB 2 nanoparticles play a role in lowering the electron concentration. This understanding of how nanoparticles affect the electrical conductivity provides useful insights into the rational design and optimization of metal matrix nanocomposites for numerous applications.},

We find that the permutation-based Shannon entropy (PEn) and time irreversibility (PYs) detect nonlinearities in the model series differently according to the surrogate theory. Moreover, PEn and PYs, based on either the original or the equal-value permutation, give contradictory results for congestive heart failure cases and healthy young and elderly heartbeats. PEn quantifies the complexity by calculating the amount of mean information, whereas PYs measures the probabilistic differences among symmetric nonequilibrium distributions, and these yield different or even contradictory outcomes. Our findings demonstrate the statistical associations between the Shannon entropy and qTIR, contribute to more reliable elucidation of the nonlinear dynamics of heartbeats, and improve our understanding of the complexity and nonequilibrium nature of complex systems.},

This implies the time-dependent solutions of the transport equations under small perturbation of the external bias applied as a boundary condition at the electrodes. However, in the case of photosensitive devices, a small light perturbation modulates the generation rate along the absorber bulk. This work then approaches a set of analytical solutions for the signals of IS and intensity modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopies, intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), respectively, from one-sided p-n junction solar cells at the open-circuit. Subsequently, a photoimpedance signal named “light intensity modulated impedance spectroscopy” (LIMIS = IMVS/IMPS) is analytically simulated, and its difference with respect to IS suggests a correlation with the surface charge carrier recombination velocity. This is an illustrative result and the starting point for future more realistic numerical simulations.},

Compared with semirandom HZO thin-film devices, the highly oriented (−111) HZO film exhibits excellent resistive switching behavior and superior retention time of up to 10 5 s with negligible performance degradation. Besides, highly oriented (−111) HZO films show a lower threshold of switching voltage, faster response time, and multilevel storage capability.

  abstract     = {Hydrogen-terminated diamond (H-diamond) metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) were fabricated on a polycrystalline diamond substrate. The device has a gate length of 2 μ m and uses Al 2 O 3 grown by atomic layer deposition at 300 °C as a gate dielectric and passivation layer. The Al 2 O 3 /H-diamond interfacial band configuration was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and a large valence band offset (3.28 eV) that is very suitable for p-channel H-diamond FETs was observed. Meanwhile, the measured O/Al ratio hints that there are O i or V Al defects in the Al 2 O 3 dielectric, which can work as an acceptorlike transfer doping material on a H-diamond surface. The device delivers the maximum saturation drain current of over 200 mA/mm, which is the highest for 2- μ m H-diamond MOSFETs with the gate dielectric or passivation layer grown at 300 °C or higher temperature. The ultrahigh on/off ratio of 10 10 and ultralow gate leakage current of below 10 −12 A have been achieved. The high device performance is ascribed to the ultrahigh carrier density, good interface characteristics, and device processes. In addition, the transient drain current response of the device can follow the gate voltage switching on/off pulse at a frequency from 100 kHz to 1 MHz, which indicates the potential of the H-diamond FETs in power switch applications.},

  abstract     = {We studied hydrogen (H) behavior in amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) films under X-ray irradiation by evaluating the threshold voltage (V TH ) shift in a-IGZO thin film transistors (TFTs) with different H concentrations in the active layers. We fabricated three types of a-IGZO TFTs: (i) one without a buffer layer and postannealed in N 2 , (ii) one with a H-resolved buffer layer and postannealed in N 2 , and (iii) one with a H-resolved buffer layer and postannealed in a mixture of N 2 and H 2 . All three TFTs showed a negative V TH shift after 100 Gy of X-ray exposure. The degree of V TH shift correlated with an increase in conductivity, which, in turn, corresponds to the H concentration in the active layer of the as-fabricated TFTs. Based on spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis, we confirmed a large increase in the donorlike H related D1 state after X-ray irradiation in high-H concentration a-IGZO films. In addition, an increase in the number of H 2 molecules in a-IGZO films after X-ray irradiation was observed via thermal desorption spectroscopy analysis. Therefore, we conclude that the increase in conductivity and/or the resulting negative V TH shift in a-IGZO TFTs during X-ray irradiation can be attributed not only to the state transition from acceptorlike to donorlike H in the as-prepared a-IGZO but also to the incorporation of additional H radicals generated by X-ray irradiation.},

The PCMO layer on Pt had a mixed polycrystalline and amorphous structure. The cells displayed interface-type and filament-type resistive switching (RS) depending on the PCMO layer thickness. The interface-type RS was attributed to the migration of oxygen ions, which caused a redox reaction at the Ti/PCMO interface and the formation of a TiO x layer. For filament-type RS, a forming process occurred and this indicated the formation of a conductive filament in the PCMO layer. After forming, the cells showed bipolar and continuous RS similar to interface-type RS. This indicated that both the formation of a conductive filament in the PCMO layer and the redox reaction at the Ti/PCMO interface occur in the same cell. Finally, a qualitative model for the observed RS phenomenon is discussed based on conventional interface-type RS.},

At low temperatures, the device shows a single hole transistor signature with well pronounced Coulomb oscillations. The barrier strength between the Ge segment and the Al leads can be tuned as a function of the gate voltage V G . It leads to a zero conductance at V G = 0 V to a few quantum conductance at V G = –15 V. When the gate voltage increases from –5 V to –3 V, the charging energy is extracted and it varies from 0.39 meV to 2.42 meV.},

This decrease can be explained by magnetoelastic effects, as Ni NWs are subjected to stress due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the nanocomposite materials. Matching our experimental findings with previously measured thermal strains along the Ni NW axis led us to estimate the perpendicular stress. Thus, we postulate the Ni NWs as nanometric differential stress sensors.},

The dramatic magnetic properties of nanoscale BFO with diameters in the range of 50–130 nm are explored by analyzing the temperature and field dependence of magnetization, and detailed zero-field cooling and field cooling magnetization curves show that interparticle interactions play a constructive role in increasing the magnetic response. Moreover, BFO nanoparticles have two absorption regions in the range of 2–18 GHz, and the minimum reflection loss is −18 dB. The finite-size effect is discussed as the primary mechanism for enhancing the ferromagnetism and microwave absorption, and the results provide a feasible route for designing multifunctional materials.},

On one-dimensional acoustic systems, many researchers have lately paid their attention to the applications of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which can support topologically nontrivial phases. In this paper, we design a supercell composed of two identical hollow cylinders with a side split immersed in the air background. The supercell is arranged in a line to form a SSH model, which has three bandgaps including two zone-folding-induced gaps and a local resonant gap in the subwavelength region. By analyzing the eigenstates and calculating the Zak phases, we find that a topological phase transition takes place only in the zone-folding-induced gaps when we rotate the split-cylinders. Thus, a finite-size array, made of two sublattices with distinct topological properties, inevitably produces topological interface states on their interface. In addition, we demonstrate that the topological interface states can be adjusted in a wide frequency range by rotating the cylinders that control the coupling strength between two split-cylinders in one supercell. These tunable topological interface states may have potential application prospects in wave filtering, wave detecting, and so on.},

  abstract     = {In nanoscale magnetic multilayers, capping layers are often used to protect the underlying magnetic layers from oxidation. However, little research has investigated possible long-range coupling interactions between nonmagnetic transition metal (TM) capping layers and neighboring magnetic layers. In this paper, the temperature (T) dependence of the magnetic moment of different thicknesses of cobalt (Co) was studied in a tantalum (Ta)/Co/TM trilayer structure with four TM capping layers, where the TMs were Ta, Chromium (Cr), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr), respectively. It was found that the capping layer had a large effect on the phase-transition behavior and thermal stability of the Co layer. In the Ta and Cr layers, the T-dependence of Co magnetic moment showed nonmonotonic behavior, and in the Ti and Zr layers, the Co M-T curve exhibited very few effects of the capping layer. We attribute this phenomenon to the long-range coupling between the Co and TM layers. Furthermore, the coupling mechanism was linked to the indirect magnetic exchange coupling in Co/TM multilayers, similar to the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida coupling. The results of this work will support further development of the understanding of the coupling between the 3d ferromagnetic (FM) metal and nonmagnetic TM at nanoscales. Relative to potential applications, it will inspire us to rediscover the role of both the TM capping layer and buffer nonmagnetic layer in FM/TM multilayers, especially for nanoscale magnetic multilayers with spin-dependent effects, such as spin valves, spin halls, spin transfer torque, and spin–orbit coupling, which are in widespread use in the manufacture of various spintronics devices.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the magnetic field dependence of the spin excitation spectra of the chiral soliton lattice (CSL) in the helimagnet CrNb 3 S 6 ⁠ , by means of microwave resonance spectroscopy. The CSL is a prototype of a noncollinear spin system that forms periodically over a macroscopic length scale. Following the field initialization of the CSL, we found three collective resonance modes over an exceptionally wide frequency range. Upon further reducing the magnetic field toward 0 T, the spectral weight of these collective modes was disrupted by the emergence of additional resonances whose Kittel-like field dependence was linked to coexisting field polarized magnetic domains. The collective behavior at a macroscopic level was only recovered upon reaching the helical magnetic state at 0 T. The magnetic history of this noncollinear spin system can be utilized to control microwave absorption, with potential use in magnon-driven devices.},

Nonmagnetic metal layers with opposite spin Hall angles were utilized for further improvement of the efficiency. This study opens a route for an efficient type of spintronic terahertz emitter system based on the ferrimagnetic properties of rare earth-3d transition metal alloys, which allows switching the emission state from high to low power.},

However, due to the difficulty of introducing strain into 2D materials, experimental research has always been a challenge. We have fabricated MoS 2 thin films using polymer assisted deposition and have observed strain-induced ferromagnetism in buckled MoS 2 films. After buckling, the saturated magnetization (M s ) of buckled films at 300 K (0.486 emu·g −1 ) is enhanced 7.5 times compared to that of flat films (0.065 emu·g −1 ), while the linear temperature coefficient (χ T ) of buckled MoS 2 films for E 1 2g mode of Raman spectra is reduced to one third.

Smaller-size QDs show higher sensitivity in the detection of Fe 2+ , resulting in higher quenching efficiency and red shift of the fluorescence peak of QDs. Stern–Volmer plots indicate that the charge transfer model can be employed to account for the observed fluorescence quenching effect. Fe 2+ is bound to the surface of QDs by GSH and excited electrons are transferred from QDs to Fe 2+ , which facilitates a nonradiative recombination process and a decrease in the PL efficiency. In addition, the results from time resolved photoluminescence and a confocal scanning fluorescence microscope have shown that smaller-size QDs have a faster decrease in the fluorescence lifetime compared with that of larger-size QDs with Fe 2+ addition, suggesting that the fast charge transfer in smaller-size QDs should be responsible for the observed fluorescence quenching effect.

  abstract     = {Apart from being a unique material for efficient solar cells, hybrid halide perovskites possess more mysteries than ever. An anomalous bandgap behavior in CH 3 NH 3 Sn 1− x Pb x I 3 alloys has been reported recently [Hao et al. , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 136 , 8094 (2014)], in which the composition-dependent optical bandgap follows nonmonotonic and nonlinear characteristics instead of a linear trend or Vegard&#39;s law; the bandgap of the intermediate compounds was lower than that of the end members. In this article, we study composition-dependent conduction and valence band energies through scanning tunneling spectroscopy to deliberate on the role of the two bands in the bandgap bowing phenomenon and the underlying mechanism. We observe a nonlinear behavior of the two bands with respect to the alloy composition, leading to an anomalous behavior in the transport gap as well. We confirm that two competing events, namely, a spin–orbit coupling parameter appearing due to inclusion of a high- Z material and structural distortion affecting molecular orbitals responsible for the formation of the valence and the conduction bands, result in bandgap bowing in CH 3 NH 3 Sn 1− x Pb x I 3 alloys.},

The diode showed a high blocking voltage of 300 V and ultralow on-resistance of 0.18 m Ω cm 2 at a forward bias of 2.4 V. This value is almost the same as the resistance of the 4H-SiC bulk substrate, indicating that the resistance of the drift layer is almost zero and does not contribute to the observed on-resistance. As the temperature was increased, the forward I-V curve moved in parallel as the built-in bias shifted to a lower voltage due to the reduction in the barrier height of the np junction. This means that the resistance of SNPD above built-in bias is the same regardless of temperature. These results suggest that the diode is different from the conventional Schottky diodes and pn diodes. This diode has great potential for devices with both ultralow on-resistance and high blocking voltage.},

Furthermore, the STP is transferred to long-term potentiation (LTP) by increasing the pulse amplitude and number. In addition, spike-timing-dependent plasticity is demonstrated. The high density hydrogen in low temperature processed AlO x is adsorbed on InO x electrostatically or electrochemically, which plays a role in synaptic behaviors.

Copper-based metallic glasses are of particular interest due to the low cost and attractive characteristics of the base element, but the copper-based metallic glasses known to date rely on rare-earth or precious metals that have limited supplies and relatively high cost, in order to achieve good glass-forming ability. Here, we report our discovery of a series of rare-earth and precious-metal free copper-based metallic glasses formulated as Cu 46 Zr 47−x Hf x Al 7 (8 ≤ x ≤ 20, at.\%), which possess superior glass-forming ability and processability. Fully amorphous ingots with a large cross section of 15 (all x) to 28.5 mm (x = 13.5) diameter can be readily produced by a simple water quenching method. The Cu 46 Zr 33.5 Hf 13.5 Al 7 alloy, in particular, presents the highest glass-forming ability and processability of all known copper-based metallic glasses. The adjustable Hf content in the composition offers a range of physical properties (e.g., density) that can be chosen based on applications. We also discuss the physical origin of the superior glass-forming ability and processability in these copper-based metallic glasses.},

We use the exact location of these Van Hove singularities to determine the twist angle dependent interlayer hopping energy. For a twist angle of 0.6°, we found a hexagonal network of topologically protected one-dimensional channels that run along the boundaries of the AB/BA domains. The electric field in the tunnel junction is responsible for the breaking of the symmetry of the AB and BA domains and the development of the hexagonal network of topologically protected states. The latter shows that the electric field in the tunneling junction can significantly affect the topological nature of two-dimensional materials, and therefore, one should be cautious when interpreting scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments of this class of materials.},

The extreme shallowness of the 2DES, only a few nanometers below the surface, opens up unique possibilities such as tunneling spectroscopy, local electronic sensing, and in situ patterning by manipulating the surface properties. It is particularly tempting to manipulate the charge carriers with surface acoustic wave (SAW) phonons, which are confined to the surface. However, the absence of intrinsic piezoelectricity in both LAO and STO complicates the electric generation of SAWs, as well as the induction of an acoustoelectric current. Here, we present robust acoustoelectric coupling between SAWs and the LAO/STO 2DES by using electrostriction in STO, induced by a dc electric field. Electromechanical coupling to the carriers is provided by phonon-induced modulation of the 2DES potential well, leading to SAW-induced carrier transport. The ability to control charge carriers with SAWs brings the versatile LAO/STO 2DES into reach of quantum acoustics, opening possibilities to study the interplay of nanoscale mechanical waves and the rich physics exhibited by nonpiezoelectric complex oxides, including superconductivity, magnetism, and correlated insulator states.},

The base of the QTF prongs is the area maximizing the light-induced thermoelastic effect. The front surface of this area was left uncoated to allow laser transmission through the quartz, while on the back side of the QTF, a gold film was coated to back-reflect the laser beam and further enhance the light absorption inside the crystal. Acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) was chosen as the target gas to test and validate the LITES sensor. We demonstrated that the sensor response scales linearly with the laser power incident on the prong base, and the optimum signal to noise ratio was obtained at an optical power of 4 mW. A minimum detection limit of ∼325 ppb was achieved at an integration time of 1 s, corresponding to a normalized noise equivalent absorption coefficient of 9.16 × 10 −10 cm −1 W/√Hz, nearly one order of magnitude better with respect to the value obtained with a standard 32.768 kHz QTF-based LITES sensor under the same experimental conditions.},

Then, exploiting the reverse design technique, the above-mentioned operations were mapped onto the initial execution plane via Fourier transform. Based on this, 1D and 2D OS-EOVAs were generated experimentally and the existence of optical vortices was verified. Specific OS-EOVAs were designed, possessing antenna array orientation as well as radial and azimuthal orientation. Compared to existing OVAs, the OS-EOVA provides an additional modulated dimension, i.e., orientation.

  abstract     = {With significant improvements in external quantum efficiency (EQE) and stability for red, green, and blue devices over the past decade, the future of electroluminescent quantum dot light-emitting devices (QDLEDs) is bright. State-of-the-art QDLEDs have achieved &gt;30\% EQE and a &gt;2 000 000 h electroluminescence half-life for an initial luminance of 100 cd m −2 , rivaling those of organic light-emitting devices. To date, most of the improvements in QDLED performance have been primarily achieved via advancements in QD synthesis and design that aim at reducing Auger recombination and improving the balance between electron and hole concentrations in the emissive QD layer. However, recent work is starting to reveal the critical role that other device layers, as well as interlayer interfaces, play in limiting QDLED stability. Degradation within the organic hole transport layer (HTL) and near the QD/HTL interface has recently been found to lead to the formation of nonradiative recombination centers that quench excitons in the emissive QD layer and contribute to QDLED failure over time. Looking forward, minimizing degradation in the charge transport layers will likely be crucial for the realization of highly stable QDLEDs and this perspective provides potential avenues to achieve these enhancements. In particular, tailoring the QD energy levels via material selection or interfacial dipoles may reduce charge carrier accumulation in the transport layers and replacing the organic HTL with an inorganic alternative may be an effective approach to circumvent the inherent susceptibility of organic semiconductors to exciton-induced degradation.},

  abstract     = {Localized and actively controlled delivery of drugs presents an opportunity for improving bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy, and long-term treatment of injury or disease. Conductive polymer (CP) based systems present a unique opportunity for using inherent electrochemical and actuating properties to ensure that drugs are delivered or retained using charge controlled mechanisms. A number of CP formats have been explored spanning CP films, composites of CPs with polymeric carriers, and organic electronic ion pumps (OEIPs). Each of these designs can be used to deliver drugs with ionic properties that take advantage of the doping and dedoping characteristics of CPs during electrical pulsing or cycling. However, CP composites that use actuation and OEIPs are emerging technologies that can better address the need for the delivery of a wide range of drugs with varying net charge properties. These systems also allow a high drug loading profile, and with an appropriate configuration, they can use additional electrodes to drive drugs into the tissues. There are also innovative opportunities in the delivery of multiple drug types with varying charge properties that can be individually addressed. The future of CP based drug delivery systems will be strongly influenced by translational challenges including the need for regulatory approvals prior to the use of these novel material platforms in the clinic. Multidisciplinary collaboration will be critical to driving technology development and creating a new paradigm in personalized bioelectronic delivery of therapeutics.},
