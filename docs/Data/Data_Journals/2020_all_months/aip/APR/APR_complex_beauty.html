  abstract     = {The differential response of chiral molecules to incident left- and right-handed circularly polarized light is used for sensing the handedness of molecules. Currently, significant effort is directed toward enhancing weak differential signals from the molecules, with the goal of extending the capabilities of chiral spectrometers to lower molecular concentrations or small analyte volumes. Previously, optical cavities for enhancing vibrational circular dichroism have been introduced. Their enhancements are mediated by helicity-preserving cavity modes which maintain the handedness of light due to their degenerate TE and TM components. In this article, we simplify the design of the cavity and numerically compare it with the previous one using an improved model for the response of chiral molecules. We use parameters of molecular resonances to show that the cavities are capable of bringing the vibrational circular dichroism signal over the detection threshold of typical spectrometers for concentrations that are one to three orders of magnitude smaller than those needed without the cavities, for a fixed analyte volume. Frequency resolutions of current spectrometers result in enhancements of more than one order (two orders) of magnitude for the new (previous) design. With improved frequency resolution, the new design achieves enhancements of three orders of magnitude. We show that the TE/TM degeneracy in perfectly helicity-preserving modes is lifted by factors that are inherent to the cavities. More surprisingly, this degeneracy is also lifted by the molecules themselves due to their lack of electromagnetic duality symmetry, that is, due to the partial change of helicity during the light-molecule interactions.},

  abstract     = {Rivaling state-of-the-art crystalline silicon, organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have been intensely studied in recent years. Surface and interfacial engineering have been a focus for performance improvement. Even though significant progress has been made during the last decade in terms of the diversity and capability of perovskite-based devices, the structure-property relationship, particularly at the surface, which governs the real-world performance of these applications, is still unresolved. In the article, this issue was addressed by employing synchrotron-related experimental measurements, and a mechanism that correlates microstructure with surface chemistry was resolved. As a powerful and highly sensitive spectromicroscopy, soft x ray photoemission electron microscopy (X-PEEM) was used to probe the surface of perovskite films varying in post solvent annealing. Static and in situ grazing incidence hard x ray diffraction (GIXD) was used to track the grain growth dynamics during the film formation process. It was found that the nature of the surfaces was dictated by the local chemistry that varied due to mass flow during the development of the microstructure. Combining optical and electronic characterizations, it was confirmed that a more homogenous chemistry, i.e., uniform chemical components and properties, along with reduced strain and grain boundary energies, yielded more defect-tolerant films. Grain boundaries were more favorable for screening carriers than those in the control film. Our findings underscore the importance of the uniformity in the surface for developing a chemistry-structure-property relationship in perovskite materials, as well as engineering local chemistry toward high-performance and stable devices.},

  abstract     = {Sonodynamic therapy, with advantages in large tissue penetration depth and great controllability, is a promising type of non-invasive cancer treatment method. Developing sonosensitizers with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantum yield and the ability to regulate tumor microenvironment to achieve enhanced performances in sonodynamic therapy would thus be rather attractive. Herein, vanadium (V) doped TiO 2 (V-TiO 2 ) nanospindles with glutathione-depleting properties are fabricated for enhanced sonodynamic cancer therapy. Due to doping of the V element, the bandgap of V-TiO 2 nanospindles is reduced, increasing the efficiency of ultrasound-triggered ROS production compared to that of pure TiO 2 nanoparticles. More interestingly, the doping of V also makes V-TiO 2 nanospindles an effective Fenton-like agent, which can catalyze the generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (•OH) from endogenous H 2 O 2 in the tumor, thus enabling cancer-killing through chemodynamic therapy. In addition, the V doping also endows V-TiO 2 nanospindles with the function of glutathione depletion, further amplifying the oxidative stress generated by chemodynamic-sonodynamic therapy. In vitro cell experiments and in vivo animal experiments demonstrate that V-TiO 2 nanospindles can effectively kill cancer by the combined chemodynamic-sonodynamic therapy, significantly improving the tumor treatment outcomes. Importantly, V-TiO 2 with the ultrasmall spindle morphology can be quickly excreted from the body, without causing any long-term toxicity. This work illustrates that doping TiO 2 with other special elements is a meaningful strategy to fabricate nanostructures with interesting functions useful in biomedicine.},

  abstract     = {Sodium ion batteries are an emerging candidate to replace lithium ion batteries in large-scale electrical energy storage systems due to the abundance and widespread distribution of sodium. Despite the growing interest, the development of high-performance sodium cathode materials remains a challenge. In particular, polyanionic compounds are considered as a strong cathode candidate owing to their better cycling stability, a flatter voltage profile, and stronger thermal stability compared to other cathode materials. Here, we report the rational design of a biomimetic bone-inspired polyanionic Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 -reduced graphene oxide composite (BI-NVP) cathode that achieves ultrahigh rate charging and ultralong cycling life in a sodium ion battery. At a charging rate of 1 C, BI-NVP delivers 97\% of its theoretical capacity and is able to retain a voltage plateau even at the ultra-high rate of 200 C. It also shows long cycling life with capacity retention of 91\% after 10 000 cycles at 50 C. The sodium ion battery cells with a BI-NVP cathode and Na metal anode were able to deliver a maximum specific energy of 350 W h kg −1 and maximum specific power of 154 kW kg −1 . In situ and postmortem analyses of cycled BI-NVP (including by Raman and XRD spectra) HRTEM, and STEM-EELS, indicate highly reversible dilation–contraction, negligible electrode pulverization, and a stable NVP-reduced graphene oxide layer interface. The results presented here provide a rational and biomimetic material design for the electrode architecture for ultrahigh power and ultralong cyclability of the sodium ion battery full cells when paired with a sodium metal anode.},

  abstract     = {Spintronic structures are extensively investigated for their spin–orbit torque properties, required for magnetic commutation functionalities. Current progress in these materials is dependent on the interface engineering for the optimization of spin transmission. Here, we advance the analysis of ultrafast spin-charge conversion phenomena at ferromagnetic-transition metal interfaces due to their inverse spin-Hall effect properties. In particular, the intrinsic inverse spin-Hall effect of Pt-based systems and extrinsic inverse spin-Hall effect of Au:W and Au:Ta in NiFe/Au:(W, Ta) bilayers are investigated. The spin-charge conversion is probed by complementary techniques—ultrafast THz time-domain spectroscopy in the dynamic regime for THz pulse emission and ferromagnetic resonance spin-pumping measurements in the GHz regime in the steady state—to determine the role played by the material properties, resistivities, spin transmission at metallic interfaces, and spin-flip rates. These measurements show the correspondence between the THz time-domain spectroscopy and ferromagnetic spin-pumping for the different set of samples in term of the spin mixing conductance. The latter quantity is a critical parameter, determining the strength of the THz emission from spintronic interfaces. This is further supported by ab initio calculations, simulations, and analysis of the spin-diffusion and spin-relaxation of carriers within the multilayers in the time domain, permitting one to determine the main trends and the role of spin transmission at interfaces. This work illustrates that time-domain spectroscopy for spin-based THz emission is a powerful technique to probe spin-dynamics at active spintronic interfaces and to extract key material properties for spin-charge conversion.},

  abstract     = {Metasurfaces have developed rapidly in the past decade because their customizable properties are able to regulate wave-matter interaction over a subwavelength scale. Recently, the space-time modulated metasurfaces have attracted significant attention for the additional degree of freedom they offer in the manipulation of the electromagnetic waves in both space and time domains. However, the existing techniques have limited wave control capabilities, which results in just a few feasible schemes, like regulation of only one specific harmonic. Here, we propose to create independent manipulations of arbitrary dual harmonics and their wave behaviors using a space-time-coding digital metasurface. By employing different space-time-coding sequences in the reflection phase of the metasurface, independent phase-pattern configurations of two desired harmonics can be achieved simultaneously, which further leads to independent beam shaping at the two harmonic frequencies. We have developed an analytical theory to offer physical insights into the arbitrary dual-harmonic manipulations of spectra and spatial beams, which is verified by experiments with good agreements. The presented space-time-coding strategy provides a new way to design multifunctional programable systems, which will find potential applications such as cognitive radar and multi-user wireless communications.},

  abstract     = {The development of quantum electronic devices operating below a few Kelvin degrees is raising the demand for cryogenic complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor electronics (CMOS) to be used as in situ classical control/readout circuitry. Having a minimal spatial separation between quantum and classical hardware is necessary to limit the electrical wiring to room temperature and the associated heat load and parasitic capacitances. Here, we report prototypical demonstrations of hybrid circuits combining silicon quantum dot devices and a classical transimpedance amplifier, which is characterized and then used to measure the current through the quantum dots. The two devices are positioned next to each other at 4.2 K to assess the use of the cryogenic transimpedance amplifier with respect to a room-temperature transimpedance amplifier. A quantum device built on the same substrate as the transimpedance amplifier is characterized down to 10 mK. The transimpedance amplifier is based on commercial 28 nm fully depleted Silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS. It consists of a two-stage Miller-compensated operational amplifier with a 10 M Ω polysilicon feedback resistor, yielding a gain of 1.1 × 10 7 V/A. We show that the transimpedance amplifier operates at 10 mK with only 1 μ W of power consumption, low enough to prevent heating. It exhibits linear response up to ±40 nA and a measurement bandwidth of 2.6 kHz, which could be extended to about 200 kHz by design optimization. The realization of custom-made electronics in FDSOI technology for cryogenic operation at any temperature will improve measurement speed and quality inside cryostats with higher bandwidth, lower noise, and higher signal-to-noise ratio.},

Novel, efficient, and environmentally friendly refrigeration technologies based on solid-state refrigerants can offer a way out of the problems arising from climate-damaging substances used in conventional vapor-compressors. Multicaloric materials stand out because of their large temperature changes, which can be induced by the application of different external stimuli such as a magnetic, electric, or a mechanical field. Despite the high potential for applications and the interesting physics of this group of materials, few studies focus on their investigation by direct methods. In this paper, we report on the advanced characterization of all relevant physical quantities that determine the multicaloric effect of a Ni-Mn-In Heusler compound. We have used a purpose-designed calorimeter to determine the isothermal entropy and adiabatic temperature changes resulting from the combined action of magnetic field and uniaxial stress on this metamagnetic shape-memory alloy. From these results, we can conclude that the multicaloric response of this alloy by appropriate changes of uniaxial stress and magnetic field largely outperforms the caloric response of the alloy when subjected to only a single stimulus. We anticipate that our findings can be applied to other multicaloric materials, thus inspiring the development of refrigeration devices based on the multicaloric effect.},

The main challenges are centered around developing electrode architectures to produce both high energy and power. As one of the key components, conductive fillers play a vital role in battery electrodes, contributing to the electrical conductivity and shaping electrode structures, which significantly determine the rate capability. In this study, the dimensionality effect of conductive fillers on electrochemical performance is elucidated in thick electrodes for scalable energy storage. In particular, three types of conductive fillers: single-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene nanosheets, and Super P, are studied using commercial LiNi 1/3 Co 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 as the model material. The role of these conductive fillers on electrode morphology, electrical percolation, and electrochemical properties of LiNi 1/3 Co 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 electrodes is comparatively investigated. Notably, electrodes with single-walled carbon nanotubes exhibit superior rate performance owing to both high electrical conductivity and tight wrapping architecture, which was further revealed by various advanced structural and electrochemical characterization. This work demonstrates the dimensionality effect of conductive fillers on both electrochemistry and electrode architecture and highlights the advantages of 1D conductive filler in thick electrodes, which brings new insights in future high energy/power systems.},

Often, the experimental calibration of these force fields relies on the analysis of the trajectories of the Brownian particles. However, such an analysis is not always straightforward, especially if the underlying force fields are non-conservative or time-varying, driving the system out of thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we introduce a toolbox to calibrate microscopic force fields by analyzing the trajectories of a Brownian particle using machine learning, namely, recurrent neural networks. We demonstrate that this machine-learning approach outperforms standard methods when characterizing the force fields generated by harmonic potentials if the available data are limited. More importantly, it provides a tool to calibrate force fields in situations for which there are no standard methods, such as non-conservative and time-varying force fields. In order to make this method readily available for other users, we provide a Python software package named DeepCalib, which can be easily personalized and optimized for specific force fields and applications. This package is ideal to calibrate complex and non-standard force fields from short trajectories, for which advanced specific methods would need to be developed on a case-by-case basis.},

We directly and simultaneously learn phase stability and bandgap tunability from chemical composition alone to efficiently discover all superior compositions on the design Pareto front.

  abstract     = {Indium monoselenide (InSe) is an emerging two-dimensional semiconductor with superlative electrical and optical properties whose full potential for high-performance electronics and optoelectronics has been limited by the lack of reliable large-area thin-film synthesis methods. The difficulty in InSe synthesis lies in the complexity of the indium-selenium phase diagram and inadequate understanding of how this complexity is manifested in the growth of thin films. Herein, we present a systematic method for synthesizing InSe thin films by pulsed laser deposition followed by vacuum thermal annealing. The controlled phase evolution of the annealed InSe thin films is elucidated using a comprehensive set of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques. The annealing temperature is identified as the key parameter in controlling phase evolution with pure thin films of InSe developed within a window of 325 °C to 425 °C. To exert finer stoichiometric control over the as-deposited InSe thin film, a co-deposition scheme utilizing InSe and In 2 Se 3 pulsed laser deposition targets is employed to mitigate the effects of mass loss during annealing, ultimately resulting in the synthesis of centimeter-scale, thickness-tunable ε-InSe thin films with high crystallinity. The optimized InSe thin films possess a strong optoelectronic response, exhibited by phototransistors with high responsivities up to 10 3 A/W. Additionally, enhancement-mode InSe field-effect transistors are fabricated over large areas with device yields exceeding 90\% and high on/off current modulation greater than 10 4 , realizing a degree of electronic uniformity previously unattained in InSe thin-film synthesis.},

  abstract     = {For nanoparticles with sub-10 nm diameter, the electronic bandgap becomes size dependent due to quantum confinement; this, in turn, affects their electro-optical properties. Thereby, MoS 2 and WS 2 monolayers acquire luminescent capability, due to the confinement-induced indirect-to-direct bandgap transition. Rolling up of individual layers results in single wall inorganic nanotubes (SWINTs). Up to the present study, their luminescence properties were expected to be auspicious but were limited to theoretical investigations only, due to the scarcity of SWINTs and the difficulties in handling them. By optimizing the conditions in the plasma reactor, relatively high yields of WS 2 SWINTs 3–7 nm in diameter were obtained in this work, compared to previous reports. A correlative approach, transmission electron microscopy coupled with a scanning electron microscope, was adapted to overcome handling obstacles and for testing individual nanotubes by low-temperature cathodoluminescence. Clear cathodoluminescence spectra were obtained from WS 2 -SWINTs and compared with those of WS 2 multiwall nanotubes and the corresponding bulk material. Uniquely, the optical properties of INTs acquired from cathodoluminescence were governed by the opposite impact from quantum size effect and strain in the bent triple S-W-S layers. The experimental findings were confirmed by the Density Functional and Time-Dependent Density Functional theoretical modeling of monolayer and bilayer nanotubes of different chiralities and diameters. This study provides experimental evidence of the quantum confinement effect in WS 2 SWINTs akin to WS 2 monolayer. The ability to tune the electronic structure with morphology or number of layers may be exploited toward photoelectrochemical water splitting with WS 2 catalysts, devising field effect transistors, photodetectors, and so on.},

  abstract     = {3D bioprinting techniques have shown great promise in various fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Yet, creating a tissue construct that faithfully represents the tightly regulated composition, microenvironment, and function of native tissues is still challenging. Among various factors, biomechanics of bioprinting processes play fundamental roles in determining the ultimate outcome of manufactured constructs. This review provides a comprehensive and detailed overview on various biomechanical factors involved in tissue bioprinting, including those involved in pre, during, and post printing procedures. In preprinting processes, factors including viscosity, osmotic pressure, and injectability are reviewed and their influence on cell behavior during the bioink preparation is discussed, providing a basic guidance for the selection and optimization of bioinks. In during bioprinting processes, we review the key characteristics that determine the success of tissue manufacturing, including the rheological properties and surface tension of the bioink, printing flow rate control, process-induced mechanical forces, and the in situ cross-linking mechanisms. Advanced bioprinting techniques, including embedded and multi-material printing, are explored. For post printing steps, general techniques and equipment that are used for characterizing the biomechanical properties of printed tissue constructs are reviewed. Furthermore, the biomechanical interactions between printed constructs and various tissue/cell types are elaborated for both in vitro and in vivo applications. The review is concluded with an outlook regarding the significance of biomechanical processes in tissue bioprinting, presenting future directions to address some of the key challenges faced by the bioprinting community.},

  abstract     = {III-nitrides based light-emitting diodes and laser diodes (LDs) have shown great success as solid-state lighting sources, but the development of common c -plane (0001) polar GaN emitters is facing limitations due to quantum-confinement Stark effect, efficiency drop, low efficiency at green range, and peak wavelength blue-shift. Efficient semipolar or nonpolar GaN light emitting diodes and LDs have been successfully demonstrated by growing on semipolar or nonpolar free-standing GaN substrates. The small size and high cost of high crystal quality semipolar or nonpolar free-standing GaN substrates, which are sliced from hydride vapor phase epitaxy grown c -plane bulk GaN substrate, have severely limited their commercial development and application. Achieving scalable heteroepitaxial semipolar GaN materials with a very low density of basal-stacking faults (BSFs) on a foreign substrate remains very challenging. The recent breakthrough in the demonstration of continuous-wave (CW) semipolar (20 2 ¯ 1) LDs at room-temperature on semipolar GaN/sapphire template marks a milestone in exploring high crystal quality heteroepitaxial semipolar GaN materials and low-cost semipolar emitters. Here, we review the key progress through the past years about the development of heteroepitaxial semipolar GaN materials including epitaxial lateral overgrowth, orientation controlling epitaxy, BSFs burying by neighboring Ga-polar (0001) GaN with air voids, facet-engineering orientation control epitaxy, resulting in a low density or free of basal stacking faults. Furthermore, we discuss the heteroepitaxially grown pulsed semipolar (11 2 ¯ 2) blue LDs and CW semipolar (20 2 ¯ 1) LDs.},

Data in materials science are particularly heterogeneous, based on the significant range in materials classes that are explored and the variety of materials properties that are of interest. This leads to data that range many orders of magnitude, and these data may manifest as numerical text or image-based information, which requires quantitative interpretation. The ability to automatically consume and codify the scientific literature across domains—enabled by techniques adapted from the field of natural language processing—therefore has immense potential to unlock and generate the rich datasets necessary for data science and machine learning. This review focuses on the progress and practices of natural language processing and text mining of materials science literature and highlights opportunities for extracting additional information beyond text contained in figures and tables in articles. We discuss and provide examples for several reasons for the pursuit of natural language processing for materials, including data compilation, hypothesis development, and understanding the trends within and across fields. Current and emerging natural language processing methods along with their applications to materials science are detailed. We, then, discuss natural language processing and data challenges within the materials science domain where future directions may prove valuable.},

One key ingredient in the successful design of FTJs is the type and nature of the electrode used—indeed device performance strongly hinges on the ability to precisely tune and modulate the electrostatic boundary conditions. This perspective presents an overview of the experimental state of the art in electrode engineering for FTJs. We discuss related governing factors and methods for various electrode-FTJ combinations, highlighting and comparing the advantages and weaknesses for each system. Finally, we also reveal the challenges and identify the opportunities for the future development of FTJs.

  abstract     = {Current studies reveal the expectation that photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion will become the front-runner technology to stem against the extent of global warming by the middle of this century. In 2019, the passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) design has taken over the majority of global photovoltaic solar cell production. The objective of this paper is to review the fundamental physics of the underlying cell architecture, its development over the past few decades to an industry main stream product, as well as an in-depth characterization of current cells and the future potential of the device structure. The early development of PERCs was set by an intriguing series of improvements starting in 1989 and resulting in a long-standing energy conversion efficiency record of 25.0\% set up in 1999. It took a decade of intense technological development to implement this structure as an upgrade to existing production lines and another decade to increase the efficiency of industrially manufactured cells to over 22\%. Our analysis of state-of-the-art large-area screen-printed PERCs is based on the pilot-line technology in the Photovoltaic Technology Evaluation Center at the Fraunhofer ISE, which is assumed to be representative of current state-of-the art cell processing. The main recent cell efficiency improvements have been achieved thanks to fine line metallization taking advantage of the high quality emitter formation and passivation and to improvements in material quality. In order to enhance the energy yield of the PV modules, innovations in interconnection technology like multibusbar and shingling technology as well as bifaciality are supported by PERC developments. Over the years, ongoing improvements have been made in the understanding of PERCs by analytical and numerical modeling of these devices. We show a study based on 3D numerical modeling and an extrapolation of the PERC device structure and technology to achieve an efficiency of 26\%. This result surpasses earlier investigations due to the combination of technology components, as further improved front contact and emitter design as well as rear passivation and mirrors. We expect that PERCs can also play a strong role at the bottom of multijunction solar cells and will defend a strong position in global PV production beyond the end of the now starting decade.},

  abstract     = {A key material system for opto- and high-power electronics are III-nitrides. Their functionality can be expanded when bandgap engineering is extended beyond common materials such as AlN, GaN, and InN. Combining these three compounds with boron nitride and other III–V compounds (GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InP, etc.) is an intuitive method of expanding bandgap engineering in semiconductor devices. This may allow improvement of current devices for which performances are limited by the intrinsic properties of common III-nitride alloys, as well as the creation of novel devices. A comprehensive review of this activity is presented in this article, including an up-to-date compilation of material parameters for wurtzite boron nitride; its alloying with other III-nitrides, including structural and optical characterization; the band anticrossing model for III-nitrides diluted with group V atoms; their synthesis and structural and optical characterization; and examples of applications of III-nitrides containing boron and group V atoms in semiconductor devices. It is shown to be very beneficial for ultraviolet emitters to incorporate alloying of III-nitrides with BN, as these compounds have lattice constants much smaller than that of AlN, offering unique possibilities in strain engineering. It is shown that the incorporation of P, As, Sb, and Bi in GaN is low when the material is deposited at this temperature, which is optimal for the host. Lowering the growth temperature significantly enhances the incorporation of isovalent dopants, but deteriorates the optical quality of the material. The obtained changes in the electronic band structure can be beneficial in many applications, including water splitting or shifting emission toward longer wavelengths.},

As one of the new and promising candidates for both next-generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, halide perovskite semiconductors have attracted extensive research attention because of their excellent electrical and optical properties demonstrated in the linear optical regime. In the past five years, halide perovskites have become a new research frontier of nonlinear optical materials because their highly tunable chemical components and multiple structures provide a variety of outstanding nonlinear optical properties, which support a broad scope of nonlinear optical applications. In this review, we have summarized the nonlinear optical properties of halide perovskites categorized according to the second-, third-, and high-order processes. Aside from the more conventional nonlinear effects, such as sum and difference frequency generation, this review also pays attention to the lesser known but important nonlinear phenomena, such as linear and circular photogalvanic effects, the high-order shift current effect, and the multi-photon pumped photoluminescence. We have also reviewed and summarized the nonlinear applications of halide perovskites, including multi-photon pumped photoluminescence imaging, multi-photon pumped amplified spontaneous emission and lasing, sub-bandgap and self-powered photodetection, all-optical and electro-optic modulation, saturable absorption, optical limiting, and so on.

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a significant family of compounds predicted by simplistic electronic structure theory to be metals but are, in fact, insulators. This false metallic state has been traditionally attributed in the literature to reflect the absence of proper treatment of electron-electron correlation (“Mott insulators”) whereas, in fact, even mean-field like density functional theory describes the insulating phase correctly if the restrictions posed on the simplistic theory are avoided. Such unwarranted restrictions included different forms of disallowing symmetry breaking described in this article. As the science and technology of conductors have transitioned from studying simple elemental metals such as Al or Cu to compound conductors such as binary or ternary oxides and pnictides, a special class of degenerate but gapped metals has been noticed. Their presumed electronic configurations show the Fermi level inside the conduction band or valence band, yet there is an “internal band gap” between the principal band edges. The significance of this electronic configuration is that it might be unstable toward the formation of states inside the internal band gap when the formation of such states costs less energy than the energy gained by transferring carriers from the conduction band to these lower energy acceptor states, changing the original (false) metal to an insulator. The analogous process also exists for degenerate but gapped metals with the Fermi level inside the valence band, where the energy gain is defined by transfer of electrons from the donor level to the unoccupied part of the valence band. We focus here on the fact that numerous electronic structure methodologies have overlooked some physical factors that could stabilize the insulating alternative, predicting instead false metals that do not really exist (note that this is in general not a physical phase transition, but a correction of a previous error in theory that led to a false prediction of a metal). Such errors include: (i) ignoring spin symmetry breaking , such as disallowing magnetic spin ordering in CuBi 2 O 4 or disallowing the formation of polymorphous spin networks in paramagnetic LaTiO 3 and YTiO 3 ; (ii) ignoring structural symmetry breaking, e.g., not enabling energy-lowering bond disproportionation (Li-doped TiO 2 , SrBiO 3 , and rare-earth nickelates), or not exploring pseudo-Jahn–Teller-like distortions in LaMnO 3 , or disallowing spontaneous formation of ordered vacancy compounds in Ba 4 As 3 and Ag 3 Al 22 O 34 ; and (iii) ignoring spin–orbit coupling forcing false metallic states in CaIrO 3 and Sr 2 IrO 4 . The distinction between false metals vs real insulators is important because (a) predicting theoretically that a given compound is metal even though it is found to be an insulator often creates the temptation to invoke high order novel physical effects (such as correlation in d-electron Mott insulators) to explain what was in effect caused by a more mundane artifact in a lower-level mean-field band theory, (b) recent prediction of exotic physical effects such as topological semimetals were unfortunately based on the above compounds that were misconstrued by theory to be metal, but are now recognized to be stable insulators not hosting exotic effects, and (c) practical technological applications based on stable degenerate but gapped metals such as transparent conductors or electrides for catalysis must rely on the systematically correct and reliable theoretical classification of metals vs insulators.},

In particular, stretchable, skin mountable, breathable, wearable, light weight, and highly sensitive sensors are needed for detecting subtle deformation arising from human physiological signals and have potential applications in health diagnosis. In this review, we discuss flexible, noninvasive, and wearable sensors based on micro/nanofibers with unique sensing capabilities for detecting human vital signs such as body motion, temperature, heartbeat, respiration rate, and blood glucose level, which have applications in both fitness-monitoring and medical diagnosis. Here, the latest successful examples of micro/nanofiber based flexible and wearable human vital signs monitoring sensors in the form of film, mat, yarn, fabric, textiles, etc., are outlined and discussed in detail. Discussion includes the fiber fabrication technique, sensing mechanism, device structure, sensor performance, and data processing. Some of the latest fabricated self-powered devices with integrated sensing platforms are also reviewed.

  abstract     = {Understanding material responses to energy deposition from energetic charged particles is important for defect engineering, ion-beam processing, ion-beam analysis and modification, geologic aging, space exploration, and nuclear applications. As an incident ion penetrates a solid, its energy is transferred to electrons and to atomic nuclei of the solid. Much of this electronic energy deposition is subsequently transferred to the atomic structure via electron–phonon ( e – ph ) coupling, leading to local inelastic thermal spikes in which energy dissipation is influenced by the local environment. In addition, intense ionization can lead to high densities of localized electronic excitations in wide-bandgap materials and ceramics that can affect defect dynamics and atomic mobility. Specifically, energy exchange between electrons and atomic nuclei, along with localized electronic excitations, can lead to substantial competitive (ionization-induced annealing), additive (both electronic and nuclear energy depositions contributing to damage production), and synergistic (more damage than the sums of separate damage processes) effects. Although nonmonotonic effects of the e–ph coupling strength and athermal processes are demonstrated for pre-existing defects and residual damage during ion–solid interactions, there is limited understanding of when such electronic effects must be considered in atomic-scale models of damage production and evolution in a broad variety of materials. Complex ceramics and chemically disordered solid solution alloys with different constituent elements allow a systematic evaluation of defect dynamics and irradiation performance with increasing complexity. Current knowledge regarding tuning of bonding characteristics and chemical disorder to control atomic-level dynamics is reviewed. Although a lack of fundamental understanding obstructs the advancement of reliable predictions for ion beam material modification, it highlights challenges and opens research opportunities. Insights into the complex electronic and atomic correlations with extreme energy deposition will strengthen our ability to design materials and predict ion-irradiation-induced damage in a radiation environment, and they may pave the way to better control fundamental processes and design new material functionalities for advanced technologies.},

These nanosized crystals are employed successfully in a broad variety of devices including field-effect transistors, solar cells, and light emitting diodes, and their performance has increased significantly over the last 20 years. Often, such improvements have been associated with the suppression of detrimental recombination of charge carriers via trap states. Historically, traps have been attributed to dangling bonds on the surface of CQDs that needed to be passivated for proper electronic behavior. More recent understanding goes beyond such simplified views. Surfaces can be bare without necessarily evoking traps. On the other hand, imperfect separation of CQDs and their subsequent agglomeration can generate trapping sites without the need of chemical defects. Experimental and computational approaches that have led to a more accurate understanding are here discussed, and rivaling concepts and ideas are highlighted. Although the community established a much improved understanding of carrier trapping, there is still room to further the knowledge about the precise mechanisms, especially with respect to impacts from the environment. With these limitations notwithstanding, PbX CQDs exhibit large potential that we expect to be unlocked through future improvements in control of the surface chemistry and strategies of thin film assembly.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been a key point of focus for developing sustainable hydrogen economy, but it is hampered by sluggish reaction kinetics. Despite the fact that various non-noble metal-based materials as electrocatalysts toward the HER are gaining considerable attention, noble metal-based nanomaterials (NMNs) for catalyzing the HER still have advantageous features, i.e., wide pH applicability, high intrinsic activity, and good stability. Considering a high chemical similarity to HER-benchmark Pt metals, various non-Pt NMNs with high atom utilization, super efficiency, and durability for HER catalysis are engineered through various structural/electronic tailoring strategies, which has become a significant trend in this research field. Herein, a panoramic review about recent representative efforts and progress in the design of non-Pt NMNs is presented. It first introduces the HER fundamentals and then generally describes the structural and electronic characteristics of non-Pt noble metals matching the HER. Followed on, different tuning strategies for fabricating effective non-Pt NMN catalysts, including composition optimizing by constructing alloys or novel compounds, morphological tuning via decreasing the particle size or designing unique nanostructures, and hybrid engineering as well as crystalline structure/facet controlling, are systemically summarized, with a special focus on the underlying structure–activity relationship for different catalysts. The features of pH universality and bifunctionality for these non-Pt NMN catalysts are also highlighted. At the end, existing challenges and future perspectives awaiting this emerging research field are discussed.},

  abstract     = {The development of environmentally friendly, efficient, and universal access renewable energy technology is the key to achieve the goal of sustainable development. (Photo)electrochemical energy storage and conversion technology is an important part. Therefore, to realize the practical application of (photo)electrochemical energy technology, nanostructured catalytic materials need to be reasonably designed, synthesized, and modified. Ion beam technology is a powerful and versatile physical modification method. Modification of various catalytic materials from the surface to interface and thin films can be realized by controlling the species, energy, and fluence of implanted ions. Ion beam technology has its unique advantages, including its compulsivity of element doping and its high controllability, accuracy, and repeatability. It can realize arbitrary element doping and defect control of almost any material and finely control its concentration. This makes it possible for the ion beam technology to adapt to the modification requirements of catalytic materials to tailor the electronic structure, interface structure, and morphology of the materials more finely. Besides, a variety of strategies for material design can be realized using ion beams, including element doping, defect control, heterostructure construction, and micro/nanostructure formation, which may bring novel changes in catalytic materials. In this Review, we briefly introduce the principle of ion beam technology and introduce various ion beam technologies that can be applied to different catalytic material modification applications. We systematically review the research progress on the application of ion beam technology in photocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic, and electrocatalytic materials for water splitting including bandgap engineering, defect engineering, heterostructure formation through ion doping, ion irradiation, ion sputtering, and their combined effects. The applications of ion beam technology on modification of fuel oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts for fuel cells are also introduced. The advantages of ion beam technology in the modification of catalytic materials are summarized. Several promising topics are proposed to look forward to the future development of ion beam technology in the field of catalytic materials.},

Polymer fibers could be obtained from natural and synthetic polymers at a length scale from the nanometer to micrometer range. These fibers could be formed into different configurations such as single, core–sheath, hollow, blended, or composite according to human needs. Of these several conformations of fibers, core–sheath polymer fibers are an interesting class of materials, which shows superior physical, chemical, and biological properties. In core–sheath fiber structures, one of the components called a core is fully surrounded by the second component known as a sheath. In this format, different polymers can be applied as a sheath over a solid core of another polymer, thus resulting in a variety of modified properties while maintaining the major fiber property. After a brief introduction to core–sheath fibers, this review paper focuses on the development of the electrospinning process to manufacture core–sheath fibers followed by illustrating the current methodology and approaches to form them on a larger scale, suitable for industrial manufacturing and exploitation. Finally, the paper reviews the applications of the core–sheath fibers, in particular, recent studies of core–sheath polymer fibers in tissue engineering (nerve, vascular grafts, cardiomyocytes, bone, tendons, sutures, and wound healing), growth factors and other bioactive component release, and drug delivery. Therefore, core–sheath structures are a revolutionary development in the field of science and technology, becoming a backbone to many emerging technologies and novel opportunities.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen will be a crucial pillar in the clean-energy foundation, and therefore, the development of safe and cost-effective storage and transportation methods is essential to its success. One of the key challenges in the development of such storage and transportation methods is related to the interaction of hydrogen with structural materials. Despite extensive work, there are significant questions related to the hydrogen embrittlement of ferritic steels due to challenges associated with these steels, coupled with the difficulties with gauging the hydrogen content in all materials. Recent advancements in experimental tools and multi-scale modeling are starting to provide insight into the embrittlement process. This review focuses on a subset of the recent developments, with an emphasis on how new methods have improved our understanding of the structure–property–performance relationships of ferritic steels subjected to mechanical loading in a hydrogen environment. The structure of ferritic steels in the presence of hydrogen is described in terms of the sorption and dissociation processes, the diffusion through the lattice and grain boundaries, and the hydrogen–steel interactions. The properties of ferritic steels subjected to mechanical loading in hydrogen are also investigated; the effects of test conditions and hydrogen pressure on the tensile, fracture, and fatigue properties of base metal and welds are highlighted. The performance of steels in hydrogen is then explored via a comprehensive analysis of the various embrittlement mechanisms. Finally, recent insights from in situ and high-resolution experiments are presented and future studies are proposed to address challenges related to embrittlement in ferritic steels.},

Efforts have been made to improve the efficiency to save the energy, and to search for new refrigerants to take the place of the ones with high global warming potentials. The solid-state refrigeration using caloric materials are regarded as high-efficiency and environmentally friendly technologies. Among them, the elastocaloric refrigeration using shape memory alloys has been evaluated as the most promising one due to its low device cost and less of a demand for an ambient environment. General caloric materials heat up and cool down when external fields are applied and removed adiabatically (conventional caloric effect), while a few materials show opposite temperature changes (inverse caloric effect). Previously reported shape memory alloys have been found to show either a conventional or an inverse elastocaloric effect by the latent heat during uniaxial-stress-induced martensitic transformation. In this paper, we report a self-regulating functional material whose behavior exhibits an elastocaloric switching effect in Co-Cr-Al-Si Heusler-type shape memory alloys. For a fixed alloy composition, these alloys can change from conventional to inverse elastocaloric effects because of the change in ambient temperature. This unique behavior is caused by the sign reversal of latent heat from conventional to the re-entrant martensitic transformation. The realization of the elastocaloric switching effect can open new possibilities of system design for solid-state refrigeration and temperature sensors.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnetic materials are expected to trigger the revolution of spintronic applications because they are robust against the perturbation of magnetic fields, produce no stray fields, and display ultrafast dynamics. To design antiferromagnetic devices, the generation and manipulation of spin-polarized current in antiferromagnetic materials are vital. Unfortunately, it has long been believed that spin-polarized current could not be achieved in collinear antiferromagnetic materials because of the symmetry of spin sublattices. Inspired by the possibility of breaking the symmetry using a bias voltage, a special Au/NiO/Au junction is proposed and constructed along the [111] direction of NiO using the collinear NiO antiferromagnetic insulator as a prototype. It was found that the symmetry of spin sublattices was broken by an external bias, which induces a nonequivalent transport for spin-up and spin-down currents, that is, the appearance of spin-polarized current. Unexpectedly, this study found that the magnitude and sign of spin polarization could be adjusted by varying the bias. A positive spin polarization up to 80\% was obtained at ∼ 0.9 V, and the spin polarization turned negative when the bias voltage was beyond 1.6 V. The related physical mechanisms were explored and clarified by analyzing spin-resolved transmission, k ǁ -resolved density of states, and layer-resolved local density of states of Au/NiO/Au, etc. The effects of NiO layer thicknesses, different electrodes, and interfacial disorders on the spin polarization were also analyzed and found to offer promising applications. This study provides new physical insight into spin-polarized current transport in collinear antiferromagnetic materials and greatly contributes to the development of novel antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {With an ongoing trend in computing hardware toward increased heterogeneity, domain-specific coprocessors are emerging as alternatives to centralized paradigms. The tensor core unit has been shown to outperform graphic processing units by almost 3 orders of magnitude, enabled by a stronger signal and greater energy efficiency. In this context, photons bear several synergistic physical properties while phase-change materials allow for local nonvolatile mnemonic functionality in these emerging distributed non-von Neumann architectures. While several photonic neural network designs have been explored, a photonic tensor core to perform tensor operations is yet to be implemented. In this manuscript, we introduce an integrated photonics-based tensor core unit by strategically utilizing (i) photonic parallelism via wavelength division multiplexing, (ii) high 2 peta-operations-per-second throughputs enabled by tens of picosecond-short delays from optoelectronics and compact photonic integrated circuitry, and (iii) near-zero static power-consuming novel photonic multi-state memories based on phase-change materials featuring vanishing losses in the amorphous state. Combining these physical synergies of material, function, and system, we show, supported by numerical simulations, that the performance of this 4-bit photonic tensor core unit can be 1 order of magnitude higher for electrical data. The full potential of this photonic tensor processor is delivered for optical data being processed, where we find a 2–3 orders higher performance (operations per joule), as compared to an electrical tensor core unit, while featuring similar chip areas. This work shows that photonic specialized processors have the potential to augment electronic systems and may perform exceptionally well in network-edge devices in the looming 5G networks and beyond.},

  abstract     = {The cell cycle is a process and function of a cell with different phases essential for cell growth, proliferation, and replication. It depends on the structure and dynamics of the underlying DNA molecule, which underpins the genome function. A microscopic structural-level understanding of how a genome or its functional module chromosome performs the cell cycle in terms of large-scale conformational transformation between different phases, such as the interphase and the mitotic phase, is still challenging. Here, we develop a non-equilibrium, excitation-relaxation energy landscape-switching model to quantify the underlying chromosome conformational transitions through (de-)condensation for a complete microscopic understanding of the cell cycle. We show that the chromosome conformational transition mechanism from the interphase to the mitotic phase follows a two-stage scenario, in good agreement with the experiments. In contrast, the mitotic exit pathways show the existence of an over-expanded chromosome that recapitulates the chromosome in the experimentally identified intermediate state at the telophase. We find the conformational pathways are heterogeneous and irreversible as a result of the non-equilibrium dynamics of the cell cycle from both structural and kinetic perspectives. We suggest that the irreversibility is mainly due to the distinct participation of the ATP-dependent structural maintenance of chromosomal protein complexes during the cell cycle. Our findings provide crucial insights into the microscopic molecular structural and dynamical physical mechanism for the cell cycle beyond the previous more macroscopic descriptions. Our non-equilibrium landscape framework is general and applicable to study diverse non-equilibrium physical and biological processes such as active matter, differentiation/development, and cancer.},

  abstract     = {The formation of well-controlled interfaces between materials of different structure and bonding is a key requirement when developing new devices and functionalities. Of particular importance are epitaxial or low defect density interfaces between two-dimensional materials and three-dimensional semiconductors or metals, where an interfacial structure influences electrical conductivity in field effect and optoelectronic devices, charge transfer for spintronics and catalysis, and proximity-induced superconductivity. Epitaxy and hence well-defined interfacial structure has been demonstrated for several metals on van der Waals-bonded substrates. Semiconductor epitaxy on such substrates has been harder to control, for example during chemical vapor deposition of Si and Ge on graphene. Here, we demonstrate a catalytically mediated heteroepitaxy approach to achieve epitaxial growth of three-dimensional semiconductors such as Ge and Si on van der Waals-bonded materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. Epitaxy is “transferred” from the substrate to semiconductor nanocrystals via solid metal nanocrystals that readily align on the substrate and catalyze the formation of aligned nuclei of the semiconductor. In situ transmission electron microscopy allows us to elucidate the reaction pathway for this process and to show that solid metal nanocrystals can catalyze semiconductor growth at a significantly lower temperature than direct chemical vapor deposition or deposition mediated by liquid catalyst droplets. We discuss Ge and Si growth as a model system to explore the details of such hetero-interfacing and its applicability to a broader range of materials.},

  abstract     = {Artificial iconic memories, also called photomemories, are new types of nonvolatile memory that can simultaneously detect and store light information in a monolithic device. Several approaches have been proposed to construct artificial iconic memories, such as three-terminal field effect transistors, which can achieve an effective control of the gate voltage and external light terminals. The drawbacks in constructing these memories involve complicated fabrication processes, and the resulting performance of, for example, perovskite transistor-type photomemories is limited by the low carrier mobilities and poor ambient stabilities, whereas architectures based on floating gate modulations entail strict interface engineering and poor device reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel monolithic artificial iconic memory with a multilayer architecture of indium tin oxide/perovskite/gold/perovskite/silver, which combines the memory and photodetector functionalities of perovskites in an integrated device. The bottom perovskite layer plays the role of a photodetector, modulating the voltage bias on the top perovskite layer that serves as a resistive switching memory. This multilayer perovskite device can store photo-sensing data in its resistive states, with a memory retention of 5 × 10 3 s and ambient stability longer than sixty days. As a prototype demonstration, a 7 × 7 artificial iconic memory array is constructed to detect and store data on light intensity distribution, enabling a nonvolatile imaging functionality. Our work provides a new platform for designing perovskite-based architectures with simultaneous light detection and data storage capabilities.},

  abstract     = {In this review, the weightiest decadal developments of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and nanoplasmonic materials in sensing applications are discussed. Today, there are several well-established research directions where plasmonic detection is employed extensively, namely, food and water quality monitoring, viruses, pathogenic bacteria and hazardous toxin investigations for theranostic applications, and explosive substance detection for military and civil protection purposes. A combination of vibrational spectroscopy and surface nanoengineering has gained a reputation as a powerful weapon for rapid and accurate determination of submolecular quantities of nanoanalytes. Signal enhancement achieved by employing various metallic nanoparticles and nanostructures can be amplified significantly due to the electromagnetic field confinement effect. Localized surface plasmon waves, which are responsible for the phenomenon, promote light absorption at nanovolume, generating ‘hot spots’ with an incredibly intense and confined electromagnetic field close to the nanosculptured metallic surface. However, the formation of the hot spot network is heavily dependent on morphology, size, and spatial arrangement of plasmonic nanomaterials. Under optimal excitation conditions, the interaction between the optically induced electromagnetic field in the hot spot region and a probing analyte attached to the nanosculptured metallic substrate enlarges photon scattering cross section, increasing signal intensity by 10 6 –10 10 . As a result, fast single-molecule vibrational fingerprint recording is possible. This focused review collects recent state-of-the-art developments in nanoplasmonic SERS sensing, highlighting the most efficient surface morphology designs that hold the most promise for future developments.},

In a time when flexible electronics powered by an organic circuit comes close to the market, the revelation of wide-spread carrier mobility overestimation has astonished the broad scientific community, as this may contradict some of the most significant developments made to date. Since the contact resistance was pointed out as the major reason behind the issue, the research into reducing or eliminating this resistance has become more intense and justified than ever. However, there have been other revelations that suggest the benefits of contact resistance in certain structures and applications. Therefore, it seems timely to fairly judge the true meaning and consequences of the contact resistance, and to provide a comprehensive view covering both its positive and negative aspects, which constitutes the main motivation of this article. To maximize the depth of discussion, several important backgrounds for contact effects will be recapitulated before tackling selected practical problems of contact resistance, and before clarifying when it should actually be minimized and when it could otherwise serve as a useful element.},

However, the loathsomely structural changes during repeated charge/discharge processes result in the mechanical fracture problems of polymers inside batteries, which significantly reduce the cycling lifetimes. The use of intrinsic self-healing polymers as substitutes is one of the most favored strategies for reviving lithium-based batteries since self-healing polymers spontaneously eliminate the mechanical cracks or damages and result in greatly enhanced electrochemical performances.

Different types of solar cells have been developed with the employment of versatile organic, inorganic, and hybrid semiconductors as the photoactive layer among which perovskite and solar cells have evidenced enormous progress in recent years. The maximum achievable power conversion efficiencies of perovskite and organic solar cells have now surpassed 25\% and 18\%, respectively. Nevertheless, the relatively narrow light absorption region of perovskite and large open-circuit voltage loss of organic solar cells hinder their further improvements. Recently, an emerging type of photovoltaic device, an integrated perovskite/organic solar cell, by incorporating perovskites and near-infrared organic semiconductors, has obtained enhanced short-circuit current density while reserving the high open-circuit voltage of perovskite devices. Integrated perovskite/organic solar cells simplify the sophisticated fabrication processes of tandem solar cells by depositing organic semiconductors, which are dissolved in orthogonal solvents directly onto the perovskite layer, offering a novel route to utilize more photons. In this review, we start with the operational mechanism of this new type of solar cell and then introduce various devices through distinctions of the organic layer. We proceed to summarize critical factors that determine efficiency and provide perspectives on directions to optimize, including the device structure and the organic and perovskite layers.

  abstract     = {Nanophotonic devices can provide solutions to challenges in energy conversion, information technologies, chemical or biological sensing, quantum computing, and secure communications. The realization of practical optical structures and devices is a complex problem due to the multitude of constraints on their optical performance, materials, scalability, and experimental tolerances, all of which are requirements implying large optimization spaces. However, despite the complexity of the process, to date, almost all nanophotonic structures are designed either intuitively or based on a priori selected topologies, and by adjusting a limited number of parameters. These intuition-based models are limited to ad hoc needs and have narrow applicability and predictive power, with the exhaustive parameter searches often performed manually. Since the comprehensive search in hyper-dimensional design space is highly resource-heavy, multi-objective optimization has so far been almost impossible. Humans&#39; restrained capacity to think hyper-dimensionally also limits the perception of multivariate optimization models, and, therefore, advanced machinery is needed to manage the multi-domain, hyper-dimensional design parameter space. In this work, we merge the topology optimization method with deep learning algorithms, such as adversarial autoencoders, and show substantial improvement of the optimization process in terms of computational time (4900 times faster) and final devices efficiencies (∼98\%) by providing unparalleled control of the compact design space representations. By enabling efficient, global optimization searches within complex landscapes, the proposed compact hyperparametric representations could become crucial for multi-constrained problems. The proposed approach could enable a much broader scope of the optimal designs and data-driven materials synthesis that goes beyond photonic and optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {The ability to transform two-dimensional (2D) structures into three-dimensional (3D) structures leads to a variety of applications in fields such as soft electronics, soft robotics, and other biomedical-related fields. Previous reports have focused on using electrospun nanofibers due to their ability to mimic the extracellular matrix. These studies often lead to poor results due to the dense structures and small poor sizes of 2D nanofiber membranes. Using a unique method of combining innovative gas-foaming and molding technologies, we report the rapid transformation of 2D nanofiber membranes into predesigned 3D scaffolds with biomimetic and oriented porous structure. By adding a surfactant (pluronic F-127) to poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibers, the rate of expansion is dramatically enhanced due to the increase in hydrophilicity and subsequent gas bubble stability. Using this novel method together with molding, 3D objects with cylindrical, hollow cylindrical, cuboid, spherical, and irregular shapes are created. Interestingly, these 3D shapes exhibit anisotropy and consistent pore sizes throughout entire object. Through further treatment with gelatin, the scaffolds become superelastic and shape-recoverable. Additionally, gelatin-coated, cube-shaped scaffolds were further functionalized with polypyrrole coatings and exhibited dynamic electrical conductivity during cyclic compression. Cuboid-shaped scaffolds have been demonstrated to be effective for compressible hemorrhage in a porcine liver injury model. In addition, human neural progenitor cells can be uniformly distributed and differentiated into neurons throughout the cylinder-shaped nanofiber scaffolds, forming ordered 3D neural tissue constructs. Taken together, the approach presented in this study is very promising in the production of pre-molded 3D nanofiber scaffolds for many biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {Solid solution ferroelectrics are the most widely used piezoelectric material for numerous electromechanical applications, including sensors, actuators, and transducers. A milestone in ferroelectric research is the discovery of the morphotropic phase boundary that was first reported in Pb(Zr x Ti 1−x )O 3 , which has been extensively solicited to improve the performance of various solid solution ferroelectrics, including those having the highest piezoelectricity known today. However, due to the inherent correlation between phase transition and thermodynamic imbalance, the efforts of building the phase boundary encounter the challenge that high performance materials are generally accompanied by property instability. Here, we report a comprehensive study on the crystalline symmetry and polar nano-regions in relaxor-PbTiO 3 crystals by synchrotron measurements and property characterizations. In contrast to the common belief that the morphotropic phase boundary is a narrow composition region, the morphotropic phase boundary in ternary Pb(In 1/2 Nb 1/2 )O 3 -Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 -PbTiO 3 is demonstrated as an extensive region covering at least 9\% of the PbTiO 3 content. Such a diffused morphotropic phase boundary is associated with the intensive interaction of polar nano-regions, leading to high piezoelectricity (&gt;1500 pC/N) with greatly improved thermal stability, where the piezoelectric variation is ∼90\% over the temperature range of 273–373 K, which is about a factor of 3 lower compared to its binary counterpart Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 -PbTiO 3 . This work sheds light on the fundamental understanding of nanoscale inhomogeneity and macroscopic symmetry in relaxor-PbTiO 3 , and successfully interlinks the structure and properties in complex solid solutions. The existence of a diffused morphotropic phase boundary is also expected to benefit other ferroic systems beyond ferroelectrics, such as ferromagnetic and multiferroic materials.},

  abstract     = {The identification of light sources represents a task of utmost importance for the development of multiple photonic technologies. Over the last decades, the identification of light sources as diverse as sunlight, laser radiation, and molecule fluorescence has relied on the collection of photon statistics or the implementation of quantum state tomography. In general, this task requires an extensive number of measurements to unveil the characteristic statistical fluctuations and correlation properties of light, particularly in the low-photon flux regime. In this article, we exploit the self-learning features of artificial neural networks and the naive Bayes classifier to dramatically reduce the number of measurements required to discriminate thermal light from coherent light at the single-photon level. We demonstrate robust light identification with tens of measurements at mean photon numbers below one. In terms of accuracy and number of measurements, the methods described here dramatically outperform conventional schemes for characterization of light sources. Our work has important implications for multiple photonic technologies such as light detection and ranging, and microscopy.},

  abstract     = {On-chip single-photon sources with high repetition rates are a fundamental block for quantum photonics and can enable applications such as high-speed quantum communication or quantum information processing. Ideally, such single-photon sources require a large on-chip photon extraction decay rate, especially over a broad spectral range, but this goal has remained elusive so far. Current approaches implemented to enhance the spontaneous emission rate include photonic crystals, optical cavities, metallic nanowires, and metamaterials. These approaches either have a strong reliance on the frequency resonance mechanisms, which unavoidably suffer from the issue of narrow working bandwidth, or are limited by poor outcoupling efficiency. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to enhance the on-chip photon extraction decay rate of quantum emitters through the tilting of the optical axis of hyperbolic metamaterials with respect to the end-facet of nanofibers. The revealed scheme is applicable to arbitrarily orientated quantum emitters over a broad spectral range extending up to ∼80 nm for visible light. This finding relies on the emerging unique feature of hyperbolic metamaterials if their optical axis is judiciously tilted. Hence, their supported high- k (i.e., wavevector) hyperbolic eigenmodes, which are intrinsically confined inside them if their optical axis is un-tilted, can now become momentum-matched with the guided modes of nanofibers, and more importantly, they can efficiently couple into nanofibers almost without reflection.},

  abstract     = {Emerging wide bandgap semiconductor devices such as the ones built with SiC have the potential to revolutionize the power electronics industry through faster switching speeds, lower losses, and higher blocking voltages, which are superior to standard silicon-based devices. The current epitaxial technology enables more controllable and less defective large area substrate growth for the hexagonal polymorph of SiC (4H-SiC) with respect to the cubic counterpart (3C-SiC). However, the cubic polymorph exhibits superior physical properties in comparison to its hexagonal counterpart, such as a narrower bandgap (2.3 eV), possibility to be grown on a silicon substrate, a reduced density of states at the SiC/SiO 2 interface, and a higher channel mobility, characteristics that are ideal for its incorporation in metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors. The most critical issue that hinders the use of 3C-SiC for electronic devices is the high number of defects in bulk and epilayers, respectively. Their origin and evolution are not understood in the literature to date. In this manuscript, we combine ab initio calibrated Kinetic Monte Carlo calculations with transmission electron microscopy characterization to evaluate the evolution of extended defects in 3C-SiC. Our study pinpoints the atomistic mechanisms responsible for extended defect generation and evolution, and establishes that the antiphase boundary is the critical source of other extended defects such as single stacking faults with different symmetries and sequences. This paper showcases that the eventual reduction of these antiphase boundaries is particularly important to achieve good quality crystals, which can then be incorporated in electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Ocean wave energy is a promising energy source for large-scale exploitation owing to its abundant reserve and renewability. An effort is underway to develop a generator that can adapt to the ultra-low frequency of ocean wave vibration. Here, we designed a cylindrical triboelectric nanogenerator with an internal swing structure for effective water wave energy harvesting. Based on the supporting effect of the bearing component, the rotary dielectric films can be suspended over the stator electrodes, rather than coming into direct contact with them. Benefiting from the largely reduced resistance and continuous swing of an internal rotary component, the fabricated triboelectric nanogenerator can operate for about 85 s and produce over one thousand current pulses after one water wave excitation. Being agitated by a 0.033 Hz water wave (during a period of 30 s), the optimized cylindrical triboelectric nanogenerator can produce a peak power density of 231.6 mW·m −3 and an average one of 39.8 mW·m −3 . Successful demonstrations of powering portable electronic devices and iron material corrosion inhibition under such simulated excitation indicate the robust capability for ultra-low-frequency water wave energy conversion. This triboelectric nanogenerator offers a new vision for efficient ultra-low-frequency wave energy harvesting with the possibility of large-scale blue energy.},

  abstract     = {Historically, memory technologies have been evaluated based on their storage density, cost, and latencies. Beyond these metrics, the need to enable smarter and intelligent computing platforms at a low area and energy cost has brought forth interesting avenues for exploiting non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies. In this paper, we focus on non-volatile memory technologies and their applications to bio-inspired neuromorphic computing, enabling spike-based machine intelligence. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) based on discrete neuronal “action potentials” are not only bio-fidel but also an attractive candidate to achieve energy-efficiency, as compared to state-of-the-art continuous-valued neural networks. NVMs offer promise for implementing both area- and energy-efficient SNN compute fabrics at almost all levels of hierarchy including devices, circuits, architecture, and algorithms. The intrinsic device physics of NVMs can be leveraged to emulate dynamics of individual neurons and synapses. These devices can be connected in a dense crossbar-like circuit, enabling in-memory, highly parallel dot-product computations required for neural networks. Architecturally, such crossbars can be connected in a distributed manner, bringing in additional system-level parallelism, a radical departure from the conventional von-Neumann architecture. Finally, cross-layer optimization across underlying NVM based hardware and learning algorithms can be exploited for resilience in learning and mitigating hardware inaccuracies. The manuscript starts by introducing both neuromorphic computing requirements and non-volatile memory technologies. Subsequently, we not only provide a review of key works but also carefully scrutinize the challenges and opportunities with respect to various NVM technologies at different levels of abstraction from devices-to-circuit-to-architecture and co-design of hardware and algorithm.},

Ferroelectrics have been suggested to code digital information due to their intrinsic and stable binary electronic polarization. However, realization of a ferroelectric bistable rectifying diode is challenging since ferroelectricity and electrical conductivity are mutually exclusive and cannot coexist in a single compound.

  abstract     = {The efficiency of photovoltaic energy conversion is a decisive factor for low-cost electricity from renewable energies. In recent years, the efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells in mass production has increased annually by about 0.5–0.6\% abs per year. In order to maintain this development speed, new technologies must be developed and transferred to industrial production. After the transition from full area Al back surface field cells to passivated emitter and rear contact cells, passivating contacts are an important step to get as close as possible to the efficiency limit of single junction Si solar cells. The theoretical background and the two prominent technologies for passivating contacts are presented and discussed. After implementing passivating contacts, the fundamental limit of single junction Si solar cells of 29.4\% is in reach. Multi-junction solar cells are the most promising option to achieve efficiencies greater than 30\%. Tandem technologies based on crystalline silicon as bottom cells have the advantage that they are based on a mature technology established on a gigawatt scale and can partially use the existing production capacity. In addition, silicon has an ideal bandgap for the lower subcell of a tandem solar cell. The two most promising material candidates for the top cell, i.e., III/V and perovskites, will be discussed. The presented technology routes show that silicon is able to maintain its outstanding position in photovoltaics in the coming years.},

  abstract     = {The development of renewable energy conversion and storage devices, aiming at high efficiency, stable operation, environmental friendliness, and low-cost goals, provides a promising approach to resolve the global energy crisis. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have drawn enormous attention due to their unique layered structure and intriguing electrical characteristics, which brings the unprecedented board applications in the fields ranging from electronic, optical, optoelectronic, thermal, magnetic, quantum devices to energy storage and catalysis. Graphene-based 2D layered materials show promising applications in energy storage and conversion owing to their high specific surface area, which have been used for supercapacitor electrode materials based on the electrical double-layer capacitance model. However, graphene has a limited value of theoretical electrical double-layer capacitance when the whole surface area is fully utilized. Among several classes of 2D layered materials beyond graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal carbides, and nitrides may exhibit excellent electrochemical properties due to the distinctive features of these 2D materials, such as large specific surface area, good hydrophilic nature, highly exposed active edge sites, and ease of intercalation and modification. Therefore, careful design and construction of these 2D compounds make them become potential candidates used for electrochemical supercapacitors and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This review emphasizes the recent important advances of the 2D layered materials composed of transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal carbides, and nitrides for supercapacitors and electrocatalysts. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and perspectives in this energy field in terms of the classes of two-dimensional layered materials.},

  abstract     = {Brain inspired electronics with organic memristors could offer a functionally promising and cost-effective platform for flexible, wearable, and personalized computing technologies. While there are different material approaches ( viz. oxides, nitrides, 2D, organic) to realize memristors, organic materials are characteristically unique, as they could, in principle, offer spatially uniform switching, tunable molecular functionalities, and ultra-low switching energies approaching atto joules that are highly desirable but elusive with other material systems. However, despite a long-standing effort spanning almost 2 decades, the performance and mechanistic understanding in organic memristors are quite far from a translational stage and even a single suitable candidate is yet to emerge. Almost all the reported organic memristors lack reproducibility, endurance, stability, uniformity, scalability, and speed that are needed for an industrial application. In this review, we analyze the root cause of the prolonged failures of organic memory devices and discuss a new family of organic memristors, made of transition metal complexes of redox active organic ligands (RAL), that satisfy and go beyond the requirements specified in the 2015 ITRS roadmap for RRAM devices. These devices exhibit cyclability &gt; 10 12 , retention of several months, on/off ratio &gt; 10 3 , switching voltage approaching 100 mV, rise time less than 30 ns, and switching energy &lt;1 fJ, offering a quantum leap in organic memristor technology. This could give birth to a new generation of organic memristors that are industrially competitive with ample scopes for functional tunability by molecular engineering, such as variation of the metal center and ligands as well as the counterions. A combination of molecular and device engineering may enable this material system to be an ideal candidate for brain inspired electronics.},

Borrowing the concept of computational graphs, SPINS is a design framework that emphasizes flexibility and reproducible results. By factoring the inverse design process into components that can be swapped out for one another, SPINS enables inverse design practitioners to easily explore different design methodologies. Here, we present the mathematical and architectural details on how to achieve these goals, using the inverse design of a wavelength demultiplexer as a primary example. Using inverse design effectively requires understanding the “control knobs” available to the designer, and, to that end, we also discuss practical considerations and heuristics for effective use of inverse design. In particular, by running inverse design on hundreds of designs of 3D wavelength demultiplexers, this paper explores the landscape of local minima, which leads to insights on the choice of initial conditions.},

  abstract     = {The ability for electrochemical cells to self-charge for extended periods of time is desirable for energy storage applications. While self-oscillation is a phenomenon found in human-made dynamic systems and in nature, its appearance in electrochemical cells has not been reported or anticipated. Here, we chose an electrochemical cell containing two electrodes separated by a self-organizing glass electrolyte containing alkali cations. The ferroelectric character of the electrolyte, with an impressively high dielectric constant of 10 6 –10 7 , supported self-charge and self-oscillation. After fabrication, the cells were characterized to determine the electrical impedance, dielectric spectroscopy, and electrochemical discharge. The electrochemical cells also displayed negative resistance and negative capacitance. Negative capacitance is due to the formation of an inverted capacitor between the double-layer capacitor formed at the negative electrode/electrolyte interface and the dipoles of the ferroelectric-electrolyte. Negative resistance is triggered by the formation of an interface phase, which leads to a step-change of the chemical potential of the electrode. The electrochemical cell demonstrates an entanglement between negative resistance, negative capacitance, self-charge, self-cycling, and the activation energy vs thermal energy or external work. The phenomenon of self-cycling is enhanced at low temperatures where the activation energy is higher than the thermal energy. This demonstration extends the Landau-Khalatnikov model for a ferroelectric to a bistable device in which the bistability resides in an electrode. The results reported here reveal the first report of negative capacitance and negative resistance existing in the same process, which can lead to valuable advancements in energy storage devices and in low-frequency applications.},

In this context, the triboelectric nanogenerator is the cutting-edge technology that can effectively convert ambient mechanical energy into electricity through the Maxwell&#39;s displacement current. While further improvements of the energy conversion efficiency of triboelectric nanogenerators critically depend on theoretical modeling of the energy conversion process, to date only models based on single-relative-motion processes have been explored. Here, we analyze energy harvesting of triboelectric nanogenerators using a three-dimensional model in a linear-sliding mode and demonstrate a design of triboelectric nanogenerators that have a 77.5\% enhancement in the average power in comparison with previous approaches. Moreover, our model shows the existence of a DC-like bias voltage contained in the basic AC output from the energy conversion, which makes the triboelectric nanogenerators an energy source more pliable than the traditional AC power generation systems. The present work provides a framework for systematic modeling of triboelectric nanogenerators and reveals the importance of obtaining direct analytical insight in understanding the current output characteristics of the triboelectric nanogenerators. Incorporating our model analysis in future designs of triboelectric nanogenerators is beneficial for increasing the energy conversion power and may provide insights that can be used in engineering the profile of the output current of the nanogenerators.},

Here, we develop a visually aided tactile enhancement system for precise motion control by combining ultrathin, highly sensitive, crack-based strain sensors and signal acquisition circuit with real-time display equipment. By optimizing the thicknesses of the substrates and sensitive films of the strain sensors, our device has a detection limit as low as 0.01\% and an ultrahigh gauge factor of 44 013 at a strain of 0.88\%, which exceeds the performance of previous devices with crack-based strain sensors within minute strain range. The high sensitivity of the ultrathin crack-based strain sensor makes it possible for our visually aided tactile enhancement system to detect tiny deformations such as the slight brush of a feather, the fall of water droplets on fingers, and even the touch of invisible wires. Our study demonstrates promising applications of integrated visually aided tactile enhancement systems in human-machine interactions and artificial intelligence.},

This approach overcomes the conventional limit of semiconducting C 4 F in the single-sided fluorination of supported graphene and achieves insulating C 2 F. Moreover, applying this technique on bilayer graphene demonstrates for the first time a new type of rectangular moiré pattern arising from the generated C 2 F boat/graphene superlattice. This novel technique constitutes a new approach to fabricating graphene-based flexible and transparent electronic nanodevices with the C x F channels utilized as semiconducting or insulating counterparts, and also opens a route toward the tailoring and engineering of electronic properties of such materials in addition to the dominating triangular moiré patterns from a graphene/hBN system.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectric materials exhibit the largest dielectric permittivities and piezoelectric responses in nature, making them invaluable in applications from supercapacitors or sensors to actuators or electromechanical transducers. The origin of this behavior is their proximity to phase transitions. However, the largest possible responses are most often not utilized due to the impracticality of using temperature as a control parameter and to operate at phase transitions. This has motivated the design of solid solutions with morphotropic phase boundaries between different polar phases that are tuned by composition and that are weakly dependent on temperature. Thus far, the best piezoelectrics have been achieved in materials with intermediate (bridging or adaptive) phases. But so far, complex chemistry or an intricate microstructure has been required to achieve temperature-independent phase-transition boundaries. Here, we report such a temperature-independent bridging state in thin films of chemically simple BaTiO 3 . A coexistence among tetragonal, orthorhombic, and their bridging low-symmetry phases are shown to induce continuous vertical polarization rotation, which recreates a smear in-transition state and leads to a giant temperature-independent dielectric response. The current material contains a ferroelectric state that is distinct from those at morphotropic phase boundaries and cannot be considered as ferroelectric crystals. We believe that other materials can be engineered in a similar way to contain a ferroelectric state with gradual change of structure, forming a class of transitional ferroelectrics. Similar mechanisms could be utilized in other materials to design low-power ferroelectrics, piezoelectrics, dielectrics, or shape-memory alloys, as well as efficient electro- and magnetocalorics.},

  abstract     = {The ability to tune magnetic orders, such as magnetic anisotropy and topological spin texture, is desired to achieve high-performance spintronic devices. A recent strategy has been to employ interfacial engineering techniques, such as the introduction of spin-correlated interfacial coupling, to tailor magnetic orders and achieve novel magnetic properties. We chose a unique polar–nonpolar LaMnO 3 /SrIrO 3 superlattice because Mn (3d)/Ir (5d) oxides exhibit rich magnetic behaviors and strong spin–orbit coupling through the entanglement of their 3 d and 5 d electrons. Through magnetization and magnetotransport measurements, we found that the magnetic order is interface-dominated as the superlattice period is decreased. We were able to then effectively modify the magnetization, tilt of the ferromagnetic easy axis, and symmetry transition of the anisotropic magnetoresistance of the LaMnO 3 /SrIrO 3 superlattice by introducing additional Mn (3 d ) and Ir (5 d ) interfaces. Further investigations using in-depth first-principles calculations and numerical simulations revealed that these magnetic behaviors could be understood by the 3 d /5 d electron correlation and Rashba spin–orbit coupling. The results reported here demonstrate a new route to synchronously engineer magnetic properties through the atomic stacking of different electrons, which would contribute to future applications in high-capacity storage devices and advanced computing.},

  abstract     = {Nanomedicine aims to increase the effectiveness of therapeutic and diagnostic agents by exploiting unique properties that arise when operating at the nanoscale. Despite the recent growth of the field, nanomedicine has only managed modest improvements over conventional molecular drugs and imaging probes. To increase the efficacy of nanomedicine requires understanding fundamental processes that govern the ability of nanoparticles to locate and remain at diseased sites within the body. These processes include a nanoparticle&#39;s interactions with cells and proteins, margination in blood vessels, permeation into diseased tissues, and diffusive ability to reach all diseased cells within the tissue. Each of these processes is governed by phenomena commonly studied within fields of the physical sciences. By employing knowledge of colloidal interactions, fluid dynamics, kinetics, statistical mechanics, and thermodynamics, researchers can rationally design nanoparticles to overcome previous limitations of nanomedicine. This review will highlight recent and exemplary studies that present valuable insights into the physical phenomena of nanomedicine and present improved next-generation nanoparticle designs by applying these insights.},

They are garnering significant attention due to several unique characteristics that distinguish them from both higher temperature oxygen ion conducting oxides and lower temperature proton-conducting polymers. By enabling proton-mediated electrochemistry under both dry and wet environments at moderate temperatures, protonic ceramics provide unique opportunities to enhance or synergize a diverse range of complementary electrochemical and thermochemical processes. Because of this potential, significant efforts have been devoted to advancing numerous energy-related applications using these materials. This review aims to comprehensively summarize these applications and analyze the most up-to-date and future developments of proton-conducting oxides. We aim to bring together this diverse subject matter by integrating the fundamentals of proton-conducting oxides with application-oriented insights. We begin with a historical roadmap, followed by a basic overview of the materials, theories and fundamentals, and fabrication and processing technologies underlying the field. The central section of our review summarizes major applications and developments of proton-conducting ceramics, ranging from maturing applications approaching commercialization to embryonic technologies just now emerging from the lab. These include protonic ceramic fuel cells, protonic ceramic electrolysis cells, reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells, protonic ceramic membrane reactors, and protonic ceramic electrochemical reactors. For each application, we analyze both the prospects and challenges and offer recommendations for future research directions so that tomorrow&#39;s researchers can continue to advance the development and commercialization of these fascinating materials.},

In the past few decades, neuromorphic computing has drawn extensive attention due to its promising capability in processing massive data with extremely low power consumption. Here, we offer a comprehensive review on emerging artificial neuromorphic devices and their applications. In light of the inner physical processes, we classify the devices into nine major categories and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. We will show that anion/cation migration-based memristive devices, phase change, and spintronic synapses have been quite mature and possess excellent stability as a memory device, yet they still suffer from challenges in weight updating linearity and symmetry. Meanwhile, the recently developed electrolyte-gated synaptic transistors have demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency, linearity, and symmetry, but their stability and scalability still need to be optimized. Other emerging synaptic structures, such as ferroelectric, metal–insulator transition based, photonic, and purely electronic devices also have limitations in some aspects, therefore leading to the need for further developing high-performance synaptic devices. Additional efforts are also demanded to enhance the functionality of artificial neurons while maintaining a relatively low cost in area and power, and it will be of significance to explore the intrinsic neuronal stochasticity in computing and optimize their driving capability, etc. Finally, by looking into the correlations between the operation mechanisms, material systems, device structures, and performance, we provide clues to future material selections, device designs, and integrations for artificial synapses and neurons.},

The name “Janus” originates from the ancient Roman god which has two faces, one looking to the future while the other facing the past. Janus has been used to describe special types of materials which have two faces at the nanoscale. This unique atomic arrangement has been shown to present rather exotic properties with applications in biology, chemistry, energy conversion, and quantum sciences. This review article aims to offer a comprehensive review of the emergent quantum properties of Janus materials. The review starts by introducing 0D Janus nanoparticles and 1D Janus nanotubes, and highlights their difference from classical ones. The design principles, synthesis, and the properties of graphene-based and chalcogenide-based Janus layers are then discussed. A particular emphasis is given to colossal built-in potential in 2D Janus layers and resulting quantum phenomena such as Rashba splitting, skyrmionics, excitonics, and 2D magnetic ordering. More recent theoretical predictions are discussed in 2D Janus superlattices when Janus layers are stacked onto each other. Finally, we discuss the tunable quantum properties and newly predicted 2D Janus layers waiting to be experimentally realized. The review serves as a complete summary of the 2D Janus library and predicted quantum properties in 2D Janus layers and their superlattices.},

  abstract     = {The elementary basis of intelligence in organisms with a central nervous system includes neurons and synapses and their complex interconnections forming neural circuits. In non-neural organisms such as slime mold with gel-like media, viscosity modulation enables adaptation to changing environments. At a larger scale, collective intelligence emerges via social interactions and feedback in animal colonies. Learning and memory are therefore multi-scale features that evolve as a result of constant interactions with the environment. There is growing interest in emulating such features of intelligence in computing machines and autonomous systems. Materials that can respond to their environment in a manner similar to organisms (referred to as “organismic materials”) therefore may be of interest as hardware components in artificial intelligence machines. In this brief review, we present a class of semiconductors called correlated oxides as candidates for learning machines. The term “correlated” refers to the fact that electrons in such lattices strongly interact and the ground state is not what is predicted by classical band theory. Such materials can undergo insulator–metal transitions at near ambient conditions under external stimuli such as thermal or electrical fields, strain, and chemical doping. Depending on the mechanism driving the transition, intermediate states can be metastable with different volatilities, and the time scales of phase change can be controlled over many orders of magnitude. The change in electronic properties can be sharp or gradual, leading to digital or analog behavior. These properties enable the realization of artificial neurons and synapses and emulate the associative and non-associative learning characteristics found in various organisms. We examine microscopic properties concerning electronic and structural transitions leading to collective behavior and theoretical treatments of the ground state and dynamical response, showcasing VO 2 as a model system. Next, we briefly review algorithms designed from the plasticity demonstrated by phase changing systems. We conclude the brief review with suggestions for future research toward realizing non-von Neumann machines.},

In this review, the most recent developments in EGT-based electronics are introduced with their synaptic behaviors and detailed mechanisms, including short-/long-term plasticity, global regulation phenomena, lateral coupling between device terminals, and spatiotemporal correlated functions. Analog memory phenomena allow for the implementation of perceptron-based ANNs. Due to their mixed-conductivity phenomena, neuromorphic circuits based on EGTs allow for facile interfacing with biological environments. We also discuss the future challenges in implementing low power, high speed, and reliable neuromorphic computing for large-scale ANNs with these neuromorphic devices.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials have brought fresh prospects for spintronics, as evidenced by the rapid scientific progress made in this frontier over the past decade. In particular, for charge perpendicular to plane vertical magnetic tunnel junctions, the 2D crystals present exclusive features such as atomic-level thickness control, near-perfect crystallography without dangling bonds, and novel electronic structure-guided interfaces with tunable hybridization and proximity effects, which lead to an entirely new group of spinterfaces. Such crystals also present new ways of integration of atomically thin barriers in magnetic tunnel junctions and an unprecedented means for developing composite barriers with atomic precision. All these new aspects have sparked interest for theoretical and experimental efforts, revealing intriguing spin-dependent transport and spin inversion effects. Here, we discuss some of the distinctive effects observed in ferromagnetic junctions with prominent 2D crystals such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides and how spinterface phenomena at such junctions affect the observed magnetoresistance in devices. Finally, we discuss how the recently emerged 2D ferromagnets bring upon an entirely novel category of van der Waals interfaces for efficient spin transmission and dynamic control through exotic heterostructures.},

The idea is not new, but is currently the subject to intense research as part of the quest for “beyond Moore” electronic devices. To a large extent, these efforts are motivated by biological observations: neural systems and mammalian brains, which seem to operate on oscillatory signals. In this paper, we give a survey of oscillator-based computing, with the goal of understanding its promise and limitation for next-generation computing. Our focus will be on the physics of (mostly nanoscale) oscillatory systems and on their characteristics that may enable effective computing.},

  abstract     = {As artificial intelligence calls for novel energy-efficient hardware, neuromorphic computing systems based on analog resistive switching memory (RSM) devices have drawn great attention recently. Different from the well-studied binary RSMs, the analog RSMs are featured by a continuous and controllable conductance-tuning ability and thus are capable of combining analog computing and data storage at the device level. Although significant research achievements on analog RSMs have been accomplished, there have been few works demonstrating large-scale neuromorphic systems. A major bottleneck lies in the reliability issues of the analog RSM, such as endurance and retention degradation and read/write noises and disturbances. Owing to the complexity of resistive switching mechanisms, studies on the origins of reliability degradation and the corresponding optimization methodology face many challenges. In this article, aiming on the high-performance neuromorphic computing applications, we provide a comprehensive review on the status of reliability studies of analog RSMs, the reliability requirements, and evaluation criteria and outlook for future reliability research directions in this field.},
