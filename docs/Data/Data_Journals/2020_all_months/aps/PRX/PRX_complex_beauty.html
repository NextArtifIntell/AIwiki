  abstract     = {We present experimental results of vacuum laser acceleration (VLA) of electrons using radially polarized laser pulses interacting with a plasma mirror. Tightly focused, radially polarized laser pulses have been proposed for electron acceleration because of their strong longitudinal electric field, making them ideal for VLA. However, experimental results have been limited until now because injecting electrons into the laser field has remained a considerable challenge. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that using a plasma mirror as an injector solves this problem and permits us to inject electrons at the ideal phase of the laser, resulting in the acceleration of electrons along the laser propagation direction while reducing the electron beam divergence compared to the linear polarization case. We obtain electron bunches with few-MeV energies and a 200-pC charge, thus demonstrating, for the first time, electron acceleration to relativistic energies using a radially polarized laser. High-harmonic generation from the plasma surface is also measured, and it provides additional insight into the injection of electrons into the laser field upon its reflection on the plasma mirror. Detailed comparisons between experimental results and full 3D simulations unravel the complex physics of electron injection and acceleration in this new regime: We find that electrons are injected into the radially polarized pulse in the form of two spatially separated bunches emitted from the p-polarized regions of the focus. Finally, we leverage on the insight brought by this study to propose and validate a more optimal experimental configuration that can lead to extremely peaked electron angular distributions and higher energy beams.

  abstract     = {The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in a magnetic topological insulator (TI) represents a new state of matter originating from the interplay between topology and magnetism. The defining characteristics of the QAH ground state are the quantized Hall resistivity ( ρ yx ) and vanishing longitudinal resistivity ( ρ xx ) in the absence of an external magnetic field. A fundamental question concerning the QAH effect is whether it is merely a zero-magnetic-field quantum Hall (QH) effect or if it can host unique quantum phases and phase transitions that are unavailable elsewhere. The most dramatic departure of the QAH systems from other QH systems lies in the magnetic disorders that induce spatially random magnetization. Because disorder and magnetism play pivotal roles in the phase diagram of two-dimensional electron systems, the high degree of magnetic disorders in QAH systems may create novel phases and quantum critical phenomena. In this work, we perform systematic transport studies of a series of magnetic TIs with varied strength of magnetic disorders. We find that the ground state can be categorized into two distinct classes: the QAH phase and the anomalous Hall (AH) insulator phase, as the zero-magnetic-field counterparts of the QH liquid and Hall insulator phases in the QH systems. In the low-disorder limit of the QAH phase, we observe a universal quantized longitudinal resistance ρ xx = h / e 2 at the coercive field. In the AH insulator regime, we find that a magnetic field can drive it to the QAH phase through a quantum critical point with scaling behaviors that are distinct from those in the QH phase transition. We propose that the transmission between chiral edge states at domain boundaries, tunable by magnetic disorder and magnetic fields, is the key for determining the QAH ground state.},

In all cases, the magnetoresistance is H linear at high fields. We demonstrate that the data can be explained by an orbital model in the presence of strongly anisotropic quasiparticle spectra and scattering time due to antiferromagnetism. In optimally doped samples, the magnetoresistance is controlled by the properties of small regions of the Fermi surface called “hot spots,” where antiferromagnetic excitations induce a large quasiparticle scattering rate. The anisotropic scattering rate results in hyperbolic H / T magnetoresistance scaling, which competes with the more conventional Kohler scaling. We argue that these results constitute a coherent picture of magnetotransport in BaFe 2 ( As 1 − x P x ) 2 , which links the origin of H -linear resistivity to antiferromagnetic hot spots. Implications for the T -linear resistivity at zero field are discussed.},

To achieve this 2-orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous studies, we implement a number of innovations into our β -detected nuclear magnetic resonance ( β -NMR) setup at ISOLDE at CERN. Using liquid samples as hosts, we obtain narrow, subkilohertz-linewidth, resonances, while a simultaneous in situ H 1 NMR measurement allows us to calibrate and stabilize the magnetic field to ppm precision, thus eliminating the need for additional β -NMR reference measurements. Furthermore, we use ab initio calculations of NMR shielding constants to improve the accuracy of the reference magnetic moment, thus removing a large systematic error. We demonstrate the potential of this combined approach with the 1.1 s half-life radioactive nucleus Na 26 , which is relevant for biochemical studies. Our technique can be readily extended to other isotopic chains, providing accurate magnetic moments for many short-lived nuclei. Furthermore, we discuss how our approach can open the path toward a wide range of applications of the ultrasensitive β -NMR in physics, chemistry, and biology.},

  abstract     = {We present a theoretical study of the temporal and spatial coherence properties of a topological laser device built by including saturable gain on the edge sites of a Harper-Hofstadter lattice for photons. For small enough lattices, the Bogoliubov analysis applies, and the coherence time is almost determined by the total number of photons in the device in agreement with the standard Schawlow-Townes phase diffusion. In larger lattices, looking at the lasing edge mode in the comoving frame of its chiral motion, the spatiotemporal correlations of long-wavelength fluctuations display a Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling. Still, at very long times, when the finite size of the device starts to matter, the functional form of the temporal decay of coherence changes from the KPZ stretched exponential to a Schawlow-Townes-like exponential, while the nonlinear dynamics of KPZ fluctuations remains visible as a broadened linewidth as compared to the Bogoliubov-Schawlow-Townes prediction. While we establish the above behaviors also for nontopological 1D laser arrays, the crucial role of topology in protecting the coherence from static disorder is finally highlighted: Our numerical calculations suggest the dramatically reinforced coherence properties of topological lasers compared to corresponding nontopological devices. These results open exciting possibilities for both fundamental studies of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and concrete applications to laser devices.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the thermal-transport properties of the kagome antiferromagnet Cd-kapellasite (Cd-K). We find that a field-suppression effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity κ x x sets in below approximately 25 K. This field-suppression effect at 15 T becomes as large as 80\% at low temperatures, suggesting a large spin contribution κ x x sp in κ x x . We also find clear thermal Hall signals in the spin liquid phase in all Cd-K samples. The magnitude of the thermal Hall conductivity κ x y shows a significant dependence on the sample’s scattering time, as seen in the rise of the peak κ x y value in almost linear fashion with the magnitude of κ x x . On the other hand, the temperature dependence of κ x y is similar in all Cd-K samples; κ x y shows a peak at almost the same temperature of the peak of the phonon thermal conductivity κ x x ph which is estimated by κ x x at 15 T. These results indicate the presence of a dominant phonon thermal Hall κ x y ph at 15 T. In addition to κ x y ph , we find that the field dependence of κ x y at low fields turns out to be nonlinear at low temperatures, concomitantly with the appearance of the field suppression of κ x x , indicating the presence of a spin thermal Hall κ x y sp at low fields. Remarkably, by assembling the κ x x dependence of κ x y sp data of other kagome antiferromagnets, we find that, whereas κ x y sp stays a constant in the low- κ x x region, κ x y sp starts to increase as κ x x does in the high- κ x x region. This κ x x dependence of κ x y sp indicates the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms in the spin thermal Hall effect in kagome antiferromagnets. Furthermore, both κ x y ph and κ x y sp disappear in the antiferromagnetic ordered phase at low fields, showing that phonons alone do not exhibit the thermal Hall effect. A high field above approximately 7 T induces κ x y ph , concomitantly with a field-induced increase of κ x x and the specific heat, suggesting a coupling of the phonons to the field-induced spin excitations as the origin of κ x y ph .},

For suitable values of the atom-impurity interaction strength, each impurity can capture one or more quasihole excitations of the FQH liquid, forming a bound molecular state with novel physical properties. An effective Hamiltonian for such anyonic molecules is derived within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which provides renormalized values for their effective mass, charge, and statistics by combining the finite mass of the impurity with the fractional charge and statistics of the quasiholes. The renormalized mass and charge of a single molecule can be extracted from the cyclotron orbit that it describes as a free particle in a magnetic field. The anyonic statistics introduces a statistical phase between the direct and exchange scattering channels of a pair of indistinguishable colliding molecules and can be measured from the angular position of the interference fringes in the differential scattering cross section. Implementations of such schemes beyond cold atomic gases are highlighted—in particular, in photonic systems.},

In contrast to previous studies, our model hosts an electronlike, gauge-neutral fermion excitation providing access to Fermi-liquid phases. One of the phases of the model is a previously studied orthogonal semimetal, which has Z 2 topological order and Luttinger-volume-violating Fermi points with gapless orthogonal fermion excitations. We elucidate the global phase diagram of the model: Along with a conventional Fermi-liquid phase with a large Luttinger-volume Fermi surface, we also find a “deconfined” Fermi liquid in which the large Fermi surface coexists with fractionalized excitations.

  abstract     = {On 31 December, 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that causes the COVID-19 disease, was first reported in Hubei, mainland China. This epidemics’ health threat is probably one of the biggest challenges faced by our interconnected modern societies. According to the epidemiological reports, the large basic reproduction number R 0 ∼ 3.0 , together with a huge fraction of asymptomatic infections, paved the way for a major crisis of the national health capacity systems. Here, we develop an age-stratified mobility-based metapopulation model that encapsulates the main particularities of the spreading of COVID-19 regarding (i) its transmission among individuals, (ii) the specificities of certain demographic groups with respect to the impact of COVID-19, and (iii) the human mobility patterns inside and among regions. The full dynamics of the epidemic is formalized in terms of a microscopic Markov chain approach that incorporates the former elements and the possibility of implementing containment measures based on social distancing and confinement. With this model, we study the evolution of the effective reproduction number R ( t ) , the key epidemiological parameter to track the evolution of the transmissibility and the effects of containment measures, as it quantifies the number of secondary infections generated by an infected individual. The suppression of the epidemic is directly related to this value and is attained when R &lt; 1 . We find an analytical expression connecting R with nonpharmacological interventions, and its phase diagram is presented. We apply this model at the municipality level in Spain, successfully forecasting the observed incidence and the number of fatalities in the country at each of its regions. The expression for R should assist policymakers to evaluate the epidemics’ response to actions, such as enforcing or relaxing confinement and social distancing.},

  abstract     = {Blurring the boundary between bosons and fermions lies at the heart of a wide range of intriguing quantum phenomena in multiple disciplines, ranging from condensed matter physics and atomic, molecular, and optical physics to high-energy physics. One such example is a multicomponent Fermi gas with SU ( N ) symmetry that is expected to behave like spinless bosons in the large- N limit, where the large number of internal states weakens constraints from the Pauli exclusion principle. However, bosonization in SU ( N ) fermions has never been established in high dimensions where exact solutions are absent. Here, we report direct evidence for bosonization in a SU ( N ) fermionic ytterbium gas with tunable N in three dimensions (3D). We measure contacts, the central quantity controlling dilute quantum gases, from the momentum distribution and find that the contact per spin approaches a constant with a 1 / N scaling in the low-fugacity regime consistent with our theoretical prediction. This scaling signifies the vanishing role of the fermionic statistics in thermodynamics and allows us to verify bosonization through measuring a single physical quantity. Our work delivers a highly controllable quantum simulator to exchange the bosonic and fermionic statistics through tuning the internal degrees of freedom in any generic dimensions. It also suggests a new route toward exploring multicomponent quantum systems and their underlying symmetries with contacts.},

It allows specific information to be extracted while still preserving fragile quantum observables of the system. Here we apply cavity-based QND measurement to an optical lattice clock—a type of atomic clock with unrivaled frequency precision—preserving the quantum coherence of the atoms after readout with 80\% fidelity. We apply this technique to stabilize the phase of an ultrastable laser to a coherent atomic state via a series of repeated QND measurements. We exploit the improved phase coherence of the ultrastable laser to interrogate a separate optical lattice clock, using a Ramsey spectroscopy time extended from 300 ms to 2 s. With this technique we maintain 95\% contrast and observe a sevenfold increase in the clock’s Q factor to 1.7 × 10 15 .},

  abstract     = {Resonant transverse driving of a two-level system as viewed in the rotating frame couples two degenerate states at the Rabi frequency, an equivalence that emerges in quantum mechanics. While successful at controlling natural and artificial quantum systems, certain limitations may arise (e.g., the achievable gate speed) due to nonidealities like the counterrotating term. We introduce a superconducting composite qubit (CQB), formed from two capacitively coupled transmon qubits, which features a small avoided crossing—smaller than the environmental temperature—between two energy levels. We control this low-frequency CQB using solely baseband pulses, nonadiabatic transitions, and coherent Landau-Zener interference to achieve fast, high-fidelity, single-qubit operations with Clifford fidelities exceeding 99.7\%. We also perform coupled qubit operations between two low-frequency CQBs. This work demonstrates that universal nonadiabatic control of low-frequency qubits is feasible using solely baseband pulses.},

  abstract     = {The partition of irreversible heating between ions and electrons in compressively driven (but subsonic) collisionless turbulence is investigated by means of nonlinear hybrid gyrokinetic simulations. We derive a prescription for the ion-to-electron heating ratio Q i / Q e as a function of the compressive-to-Alfvénic driving power ratio P compr / P AW , of the ratio of ion thermal pressure to magnetic pressure β i , and of the ratio of ion-to-electron background temperatures T i / T e . It is shown that Q i / Q e is an increasing function of P compr / P AW . When the compressive driving is sufficiently large, Q i / Q e approaches ≃ P compr / P AW . This indicates that, in turbulence with large compressive fluctuations, the partition of heating is decided at the injection scales, rather than at kinetic scales. Analysis of phase-space spectra shows that the energy transfer from inertial-range compressive fluctuations to sub-Larmor-scale kinetic Alfvén waves is absent for both low and high β i , meaning that the compressive driving is directly connected to the ion-entropy fluctuations, which are converted into ion thermal energy. This result suggests that preferential electron heating is a very special case requiring low β i and no, or weak, compressive driving. Our heating prescription has wide-ranging applications, including to the solar wind and to hot accretion disks such as M87 and Sgr A*.},

  abstract     = {More than a century after the inception of quantum theory, the question of which traits and phenomena are fundamentally quantum remains under debate. Here, we give an answer to this question for temporal processes that are probed sequentially by means of projective measurements of the same observable. Defining classical processes as those that can, in principle, be simulated by means of classical resources only, we fully characterize the set of such processes. Based on this characterization, we show that for non-Markovian processes (i.e., processes with memory), the absence of coherence does not guarantee the classicality of observed phenomena; furthermore, we derive an experimentally and computationally accessible measure for nonclassicality in the presence of memory. We then provide a direct connection between classicality and the vanishing of quantum discord between the evolving system and its environment. Finally, we demonstrate that—in contrast to the memoryless setting—in the non-Markovian case, there exist processes that are genuinely quantum; i.e., they display nonclassical statistics independent of the measurement scheme that is employed to probe them.},

While it is generally agreed that the low-energy properties of cuprates can, to a large extent, be captured by a single-band model, there has been a controversy in the recent literature about the importance of a multiband description of the nickelates. Here, we use a multisite extension of the recently developed G W + EDMFT method, which is free of adjustable parameters, to self-consistently compute the interaction parameters and electronic structure of hole-doped NdNiO 2 .

State-of-the-art fabricated microcavities are found to be within one order of magnitude of this bound. By measuring the first thermodynamically limited frequency noise spectra of wavelength-scale high- Q / V silicon photonic crystal cavities, we confirm the assumptions of our theory, demonstrate a broadband sub- μ K / Hz temperature sensitivity, and unveil a new technique for discerning subwavelength changes in microcavity mode volumes. To illustrate the immediate implications of these results, we show that thermorefractive noise limits the optimal performance of recently proposed room-temperature, all-optical qubits using cavity-enhanced bulk material nonlinearities. Looking forward, we propose and analyze coherent thermo-optic noise cancellation as one potential avenue toward violating these bounds, thereby enabling continued development in quantum optical measurement, precision sensing, and low-noise integrated photonics.},

  abstract     = {Elastomers are highly valued soft materials finding many applications in the engineering and biomedical fields for their ability to stretch reversibly to large deformations. Yet their maximum extensibility is limited by the occurrence of fracture, which is currently still poorly understood. Because of a lack of experimental evidence, current physical models of elastomer fracture describe the rate and temperature dependence of the fracture energy as being solely due to viscoelastic friction, with chemical bond scission at the crack tip assumed to remain constant. Here, by coupling new fluorogenic mechanochemistry with quantitative confocal microscopy mapping, we are able to quantitatively detect, with high spatial resolution and sensitivity, the scission of covalent bonds as ordinary elastomers fracture at different strain rates and temperatures. Our measurements reveal that, in simple networks, bond scission, far from being restricted to a constant level near the crack plane, can both be delocalized over up to hundreds of micrometers and increase by a factor of 100, depending on the temperature and stretch rate. These observations, permitted by the high fluorescence and stability of the mechanophore, point to an intricate coupling between strain-rate-dependent viscous dissipation and strain-dependent irreversible network scission. These findings paint an entirely novel picture of fracture in soft materials, where energy dissipated by covalent bond scission accounts for a much larger fraction of the total fracture energy than previously believed. Our results pioneer the sensitive, quantitative, and spatially resolved detection of bond scission to assess material damage in a variety of soft materials and their applications.},

The types of data where these networks are most successful, such as images or sequences of speech, are characterized by intricate correlations. Yet, most theoretical work on neural networks does not explicitly model training data or assumes that elements of each data sample are drawn independently from some factorized probability distribution. These approaches are, thus, by construction blind to the correlation structure of real-world datasets and their impact on learning in neural networks. Here, we introduce a generative model for structured datasets that we call the hidden manifold model . The idea is to construct high-dimensional inputs that lie on a lower-dimensional manifold, with labels that depend only on their position within this manifold, akin to a single-layer decoder or generator in a generative adversarial network. We demonstrate that learning of the hidden manifold model is amenable to an analytical treatment by proving a “Gaussian equivalence property” (GEP), and we use the GEP to show how the dynamics of two-layer neural networks trained using one-pass stochastic gradient descent is captured by a set of integro-differential equations that track the performance of the network at all times. This approach permits us to analyze in detail how a neural network learns functions of increasing complexity during training, how its performance depends on its size, and how it is impacted by parameters such as the learning rate or the dimension of the hidden manifold.},

We introduce an agent-based model that integrates these dynamics and illustrates how their combination can lead to the formation of echo chambers. We find that the range of political viewpoints that individuals are willing to consider is a key determinant in the formation of polarized networks and the emergence of echo chambers and show that aggressive political campaigns can have counterproductive outcomes by radicalizing supporters and alienating moderates. Our model results demonstrate how certain elements of public discourse and political polarization can be understood as the result of an interactive process of shifting individual opinions, evolving social networks, and political campaigns.

  abstract     = {We study the low-frequency properties of the bulk photovoltaic effect in topological semimetals. The bulk photovoltaic effect is a nonlinear optical effect that generates dc photocurrents under uniform irradiation, which is allowed by noncentrosymmetry. It is a promising mechanism for a terahertz photodetection based on topological semimetals. Here, we systematically investigate the low-frequency behavior of the second-order optical conductivity in point-node semimetals. Through symmetry and power-counting analysis, we show that Dirac and Weyl points with tilted cones show the leading low-frequency divergence. In particular, we find new divergent behaviors of the conductivity of Dirac and Weyl points under circularly polarized light, where the conductivity scales as ω − 2 and ω − 1 near the gap-closing point in two and three dimensions, respectively. We provide a further perspective on the low-frequency bulk photovoltaic effect by revealing the complete quantum geometric meaning of the second-order optical conductivity tensor. The bulk photovoltaic effect has two origins, which are the transition of electron position and the transition of electron velocity during the optical excitation, and the resulting photocurrents are, respectively, called the shift current and the injection current. Based on an analysis of two-band models, we show that the injection current is controlled by the quantum metric and Berry curvature, whereas the shift current is governed by the Christoffel symbols near the gap-closing points in semimetals. Finally, for further demonstrations of our theory beyond simple two-band models, we perform first-principles calculations on the shift and injection photocurrent conductivities as well as geometric quantities of antiferromagnetic MnGeO 3 and ferromagnetic PrGeAl, respectively, as representatives of real magnetic Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Our calculations reveal gigantic peaks in many nonvanishing elements of photoconductivity tensors below a photon energy of about 0.2 eV in both MnGeO 3 and PrGeAl. In particular, we show the ω − 1 enhancement of the shift conductivity tensors due to the divergent behavior of the geometric quantities near the Dirac and Weyl points as well as slightly gapped topological nodes. Moreover, the low-frequency bulk photovoltaic effect is tunable by carrier doping and magnetization orientation rotation. Our work brings new insights into the structure of nonlinear optical responses as well as the design of semimetal-based terahertz photodetectors.},

  abstract     = {We present an unconstrained tree-tensor-network approach to the study of lattice gauge theories in two spatial dimensions, showing how to perform numerical simulations of theories in the presence of fermionic matter and four-body magnetic terms, at zero and finite density, with periodic and open boundary conditions. We exploit the quantum-link representation of the gauge fields and demonstrate that a fermionic rishon representation of the quantum links allows us to efficiently handle the fermionic matter while finite densities are naturally enclosed in the tensor network description. We explicitly perform calculations for quantum electrodynamics in the spin-one quantum-link representation on lattice sizes of up to 16 × 16 sites, detecting and characterizing different quantum regimes. In particular, at finite density, we detect signatures of a phase separation as a function of the bare mass values at different filling densities. The presented approach can be extended straightforwardly to three spatial dimensions.},

The effect is illustrated for atomically thin semiconductors, where the reflected light reveals these interactions in a unique way. The occurring nonlinear coherent oscillations are counteracted by incoherent excitation-induced dephasing, a phenomenon which originates from a new type of quantum interference between excitons and the two-exciton scattering continuum. To improve the experimental accessibility, we discuss different methods to control the oscillation modulation depth by modifying the mutual interplay of the exciton-biexciton superposition and excitation-induced dephasing. We find that the coherent optical response can be manipulated by the polarization degree of the exciting light field, the laser detuning, external magnetic fields, and quantum coherent feedback. The extraordinary temporal behavior and its control distinguishes the nonlinear coherent oscillations from atomic Rabi oscillations and enables their engineering based on our proposed control schemes.},

  abstract     = {An ultimate goal of quantum computing is to perform calculations beyond the reach of any classical computer. It is therefore imperative that useful quantum computers be very difficult to simulate classically, otherwise classical computers could be used for the applications envisioned for the quantum ones. Perfect quantum computers are unarguably exponentially difficult to simulate: the classical resources required grow exponentially with the number of qubits N or the depth D of the circuit. This difficulty has triggered recent experiments on deep, random circuits that aim to demonstrate that quantum devices may already perform tasks beyond the reach of classical computing. These real quantum computing devices, however, suffer from many sources of decoherence and imprecision which limit the degree of entanglement that can actually be reached to a fraction of its theoretical maximum. They are characterized by an exponentially decaying fidelity F ∼ ( 1 − ε ) N D with an error rate ε per operation as small as ≈ 1\% for current devices with several dozen qubits or even smaller for smaller devices. In this work, we provide new insight on the computing capabilities of real quantum computers by demonstrating that they can be simulated at a tiny fraction of the cost that would be needed for a perfect quantum computer. Our algorithms compress the representations of quantum wave functions using matrix product states, which are able to capture states with low to moderate entanglement very accurately. This compression introduces a finite error rate ε so that the algorithms closely mimic the behavior of real quantum computing devices. The computing time of our algorithm increases only linearly with N and D in sharp contrast with exact simulation algorithms. We illustrate our algorithms with simulations of random circuits for qubits connected in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. We find that ε can be decreased at a polynomial cost in computing power down to a minimum error ε ∞ . Getting below ε ∞ requires computing resources that increase exponentially with ε ∞ / ε . For a two-dimensional array of N = 54 qubits and a circuit with control- Z gates, error rates better than state-of-the-art devices can be obtained on a laptop in a few hours. For more complex gates such as a swap gate followed by a controlled rotation, the error rate increases by a factor 3 for similar computing time. Our results suggest that, despite the high fidelity reached by quantum devices, only a tiny fraction ( ∼ 10 − 8 ) of the system Hilbert space is actually being exploited.},

Large reservoirs are very hard to obtain in conventional computers, as both the computation complexity and memory usage grow quadratically. We propose an optical scheme performing reservoir computing over very large networks potentially being able to host several millions of fully connected photonic nodes thanks to its intrinsic properties of parallelism and scalability. Our experimental studies confirm that, in contrast to conventional computers, the computation time of our optical scheme is only linearly dependent on the number of photonic nodes of the network, which is due to electronic overheads, while the optical part of computation remains fully parallel and independent of the reservoir size. To demonstrate the scalability of our optical scheme, we perform for the first time predictions on large spatiotemporal chaotic datasets obtained from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation using optical reservoirs with up to 50 000 optical nodes. Our results are extremely challenging for conventional von Neumann machines, and they significantly advance the state of the art of unconventional reservoir computing approaches, in general.},

  abstract     = {Experimental studies of protein-pattern formation have stimulated new interest in the dynamics of reaction-diffusion systems. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the dynamics of such highly nonlinear, spatially extended systems is still missing. Here, we show how a description in phase space, which has proven invaluable in shaping our intuition about the dynamics of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, can be generalized to mass-conserving reaction-diffusion (MCRD) systems. We present a comprehensive analysis of two-component MCRD systems, which serve as paradigmatic minimal systems that encapsulate the core principles and concepts of the local equilibria theory introduced in the paper. The key insight underlying this theory is that shifting local (reactive) equilibria—controlled by the local total density—give rise to concentration gradients that drive diffusive redistribution of total density. We show how this dynamic interplay can be embedded in the phase plane of the reaction kinetics in terms of simple geometric objects: the reactive nullcline (line of reactive equilibria) and the diffusive flux-balance subspace. On this phase-space level, physical insight can be gained from geometric criteria and graphical constructions. The effects of nonlinearities on the global dynamics are simply encoded in the curved shape of the reactive nullcline. In particular, we show that the pattern-forming “Turing instability” in MCRD systems is a mass-redistribution instability and that the features and bifurcations of patterns can be characterized based on regional dispersion relations, associated to distinct spatial regions (plateaus and interfaces) of the patterns. In an extensive outlook section, we detail concrete approaches to generalize local equilibria theory in several directions, including systems with more than two components, weakly broken mass conservation, and active matter systems.},

In this analysis, the convex structure and extremal points of the set of quantum channels symmetric under the action of a Lie group G becomes essential. It allows us to derive bounds on the deviation from conservation laws under any symmetric quantum channel in terms of the deviation from closed dynamics as measured by the unitarity of the channel E . In particular, we investigate in detail the U(1) and SU(2) symmetries related to energy and angular momentum conservation laws. In the latter case, we provide fundamental limits on how much a spin- j A system can be used to polarize a larger spin- j B system, and on how much one can invert spin polarization using a rotationally symmetric operation. Finally, we also establish novel links between unitarity, complementary channels, and purity that are of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {The sampling problem lies at the heart of atomistic simulations and over the years many different enhanced sampling methods have been suggested toward its solution. These methods are often grouped into two broad families. On the one hand, are methods such as umbrella sampling and metadynamics that build a bias potential based on few order parameters or collective variables. On the other hand, are tempering methods such as replica exchange that combine different thermodynamic ensembles in one single expanded ensemble. We instead adopt a unifying perspective, focusing on the target probability distribution sampled by the different methods. This allows us to introduce a new class of collective-variables-based bias potentials that can be used to sample any of the expanded ensembles normally sampled via replica exchange. We also provide a practical implementation by properly adapting the iterative scheme of the recently developed on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling method [M. Invernizzi and M. Parrinello, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 2731 (2020) ], which was originally introduced for metadynamicslike sampling. The resulting method is very general and can be used to achieve different types of enhanced sampling. It is also reliable and simple to use, since it presents only few and robust external parameters and has a straightforward reweighting scheme. Furthermore, it can be used with any number of parallel replicas. We show the versatility of our approach with applications to multicanonical and multithermal-multibaric simulations, thermodynamic integration, umbrella sampling, and combinations thereof.},

We use a non-Markovian age-of-infection model that is capable of handling long and variable time delays without changing its model topology. Bayesian estimation of model parameters is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. This framework allows us to treat all available input information, including both the previously published parameters of the epidemic and available local data, in a uniform manner. To accurately model deaths as well as demand on the healthcare system, we calibrate our predictions to total and in-hospital deaths as well as hospital and ICU bed occupancy by COVID-19 patients. We apply this model not only to the state as a whole but also its subregions in order to account for the wide disparities in population size and density. Without prior information on nonpharmaceutical interventions, the model independently reproduces a mitigation trend closely matching mobility data reported by Google and Unacast. Forward predictions of the model provide robust estimates of the peak position and severity and also enable forecasting the regional-dependent results of releasing stay-at-home orders. The resulting highly constrained narrative of the epidemic is able to provide estimates of its unseen progression and inform scenarios for sustainable monitoring and control of the epidemic.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion-limited association reactions are ubiquitous in nature. They are particularly important for biological reactions, where the reaction rates are often determined by the diffusive transport of the molecules on two-dimensional surfaces, such as the cell membrane. The peculiarities of diffusion on two-dimensional surfaces may lead to nontrivial reaction kinetics, such as a concentration-dependent rate of association between two molecules. However, traditionally, the kinetics of biomolecular association reactions has been modeled using the law of mass action, which assumes that the rate of reaction is a concentration-independent constant. In this paper, using multiscale molecular simulation, we investigate the concentration dependence of diffusion-limited association reactions on 2D surfaces. In particular, we quantify the influence of short-ranged pair interactions on the concentration dependence of the reaction rates and codify it in an empirical law. Using this law in a chemical kinetic model, we find that the steady-state behaviors of simple chemical systems are drastically modified by the presence of concentration-dependent rates. In particular, we find that it leads to suppression of intrinsic noise in dimerization reaction and destabilizes robust oscillation in Lotka-Volterra predator-prey systems. In fact, we see a transition from robust to fine-tuned behavior in the steady-state oscillations. In addition, we show that concentration-dependent reaction rates arise naturally in stochastic predator-prey systems due to intrinsic noise. We comment on the consequences of these results and discuss their implications in the modeling of complex chemical and biological systems. In particular, we comment on the range of validity of the law of mass action, which is a staple in all theoretical modeling of these systems.},

If these charges are additive and independent of atomic positions, they provide a rigorous definition of atomic oxidation states and atoms can be identified as integer-charge carriers in ionic conductors. Whenever these conditions are met, charge transport is necessarily convective; i.e., it cannot occur without substantial ionic flow, a transport regime that we dub trivial . We show that the topological requirements that allow these conditions to be broken are the same that would determine a Thouless’ pump mechanism if the system were subject to a suitably defined time-periodic Hamiltonian. The occurrence of these requirements determines a nontrivial transport regime whereby charge can flow without any ionic convection, even in electronic insulators. These results are first demonstrated with a couple of simple molecular models that display a quantum-pump mechanism upon introduction of a fictitious time dependence of the atomic positions along a closed loop in configuration space. We finally examine the impact of our findings on the transport properties of nonstoichiometric alkali-halide melts, where the same topological conditions that would induce a quantum-pump mechanism along certain closed loops in configuration space also determine a nontrivial transport regime such that most of the total charge current results to be uncorrelated from the ionic ones.},

Given the large overhead associated with encoded circuits, it is paramount to reduce their size in terms of computation time and qubit number through circuit compression. While these optimizations have typically been performed in the language of three-dimensional diagrams, such a representation does not allow an efficient, general, and scalable approach to reduction or verification. We propose the use of the ZX-calculus as an intermediate language for braided circuit compression, demonstrating advantage by comparing results using this approach with those previously obtained for the compression of | A ⟩ and | Y ⟩ state distillation circuits. We then provide a benchmark of our method against a small set of Clifford + T circuits, yielding compression percentages of ∼ 77\% .

  abstract     = {Thermal transport phenomena are ubiquitous and play a critical role in the performance of various microelectronic and energy-conversion devices. Binary rocksalt and zinc blende compounds, despite their rather simple crystal structures, exhibit an extraordinary range of lattice thermal conductivity ( κ L ) spanning over 3 orders of magnitude. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying heat transfer mechanism through the development of microscopic theories is therefore of fundamental importance, yet it remains elusive because of the challenges arising from explicitly treating higher-order anharmonicity. Recent theoretical and experimental advances have revealed the essential role of quartic anharmonicity in suppressing heat transfer in zinc blende boron arsenide (BAs) with ultrahigh κ L . However, critical questions concerning the general effects of higher-order anharmonicity in the broad classes and chemistries of binary solids are still unanswered. Using our recently developed high-throughput phonon framework based on first-principles density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of 37 binary compounds with rocksalt and zinc blende structures at room temperature, with a particular focus on unraveling the impacts of quartic anharmonicity on κ L . Our advanced theoretical model for computing κ L embraces current state-of-the-art methods, featuring a complete treatment of quartic anharmonicity for both phonon frequencies and lifetimes at finite temperatures, as well as contributions from off-diagonal terms in the heat-flux operator. We find the impacts of quartic anharmonicity on κ L to be strikingly different in rocksalt and zinc blende compounds, owing to the countervailing effects on finite-temperature-induced shifts in phonon frequencies and scattering rates. By correlating κ L with the phonon scattering phase space, we outline a qualitative but efficient route to assess the importance of four-phonon scattering from harmonic phonon calculations. Among notable examples, in zinc blende HgTe, we identify an unprecedented sixfold reduction in κ L due to four-phonon scattering, which dominates over the three-phonon scattering in the acoustic region at room temperature. We also demonstrate a possible breakdown of the phonon gas model in rocksalt AgCl, wherein the phonon states are significantly broadened due to strong intrinsic anharmonicity, inducing off-diagonal contributions to κ L comparable to the diagonal ones. The deep physical insights gained in this work can be used to guide the rational design of thermal management materials.},

  abstract     = {The general theory of dark solitons relies on repulsive interactions and, therefore, predicts the impossibility to form dark-soliton bound states. One important exception to this prediction is the observation of bound solitons in nonlocal nonlinear media. Here, we report that exciton-polariton superfluids can also sustain dark-soliton molecules, although the interactions are fully local. With a novel all-optical technique, we create two dark solitons that bind together to form an unconventional dark-soliton molecule. We demonstrate that the stability of this structure and the separation distance between two dark solitons is tightly connected to the driven-dissipative nature of the polariton fluid.},

  abstract     = {The light-matter interaction can be utilized to qualitatively alter physical properties of materials. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have explored this possibility of controlling matter by light based on driving many-body systems via strong classical electromagnetic radiation, leading to a time-dependent Hamiltonian for electronic or lattice degrees of freedom. To avoid inevitable heating, pump-probe setups with ultrashort laser pulses have so far been used to study transient light-induced modifications in materials. Here, we pursue yet another direction of controlling quantum matter by modifying quantum fluctuations of its electromagnetic environment. In contrast to earlier proposals on light-enhanced electron-electron interactions, we consider a dipolar quantum many-body system embedded in a cavity composed of metal mirrors and formulate a theoretical framework to manipulate its equilibrium properties on the basis of quantum light-matter interaction. We analyze hybridization of different types of the fundamental excitations, including dipolar phonons, cavity photons, and plasmons in metal mirrors, arising from the cavity confinement in the regime of strong light-matter interaction. This hybridization qualitatively alters the nature of the collective excitations and can be used to selectively control energy-level structures in a wide range of platforms. Most notably, in quantum paraelectrics, we show that the cavity-induced softening of infrared optical phonons enhances the ferroelectric phase in comparison with the bulk materials. Our findings suggest an intriguing possibility of inducing a superradiant-type transition via the light-matter coupling without external pumping. We also discuss possible applications of the cavity-induced modifications in collective excitations to molecular materials and excitonic devices.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel, nonparametric form for compactly representing entangled many-body quantum states, which we call a “Gaussian process state.” In contrast to other approaches, we define this state explicitly in terms of a configurational data set, with the probability amplitudes statistically inferred from this data according to Bayesian statistics. In this way, the nonlocal physical correlated features of the state can be analytically resummed, allowing for exponential complexity to underpin the ansatz, but efficiently represented in a small data set. The state is found to be highly compact, systematically improvable, and efficient to sample, representing a large number of known variational states within its span. It is also proven to be a “universal approximator” for quantum states, able to capture any entangled many-body state with increasing data-set size. We develop two numerical approaches which can learn this form directly—a fragmentation approach and direct variational optimization—and apply these schemes to the fermionic Hubbard model. We find competitive or superior descriptions of correlated quantum problems compared to existing state-of-the-art variational ansatzes, as well as other numerical methods.},

Albeit the required efficient light-matter coupling can be achieved via the integration into nanoscale resonators, in this approach the proximity of interfaces is detrimental to the coherence of even the least-sensitive emitters. Here, we establish an alternative: By integrating a 19 μ m thin crystal into a cryogenic Fabry-Perot resonator with a quality factor of 9 × 10 6 , we achieve a two-level Purcell factor of 530(50). In our specific system, erbium-doped yttrium orthosilicate, this leads to a 59(6)-fold enhancement of the emission rate with an out-coupling efficiency of 46(8)\%. At the same time, we demonstrate that the emitter properties are not degraded in our approach. We thus observe ensemble-averaged optical coherence up to 0.54(1) ms, which exceeds the 0.19(2) ms lifetime of dopants at the cavity field maximum. While our approach is also applicable to other solid-state quantum emitters, such as color centers in diamond, our system emits at the minimal-loss wavelength of optical fibers and thus enables coherent and efficient nodes for long-distance quantum networks.},

This exact dynamics is in the form of a Lindblad-like equation even in the presence of initial system-environment correlations. For explicit calculations, we also develop a weak-correlation expansion that allows us to introduce systematic perturbative approximations. This expansion provides approximate master equations that can feature advantages over existing weak-coupling techniques. As a special case, we derive a Markovian master equation, which is different from existing approaches. We compare our equations with corresponding standard weak-coupling equations using two examples, for which our correlation-picture formalism is more accurate, or at least as accurate as the weak-coupling equations.},

We benchmark against the exact diagonalization (ED) for the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models of 16-site lattices, which proves high accuracy of the method. The application of the method to a larger-sized Hubbard model on the square lattice correctly reproduces the Mott insulating behavior at half-filling and gap structures of the d -wave superconducting state of the hole-doped Hubbard model in the ground state optimized by enforcing the charge uniformity, evidencing a wide applicability to strongly correlated electron systems. From the obtained d -wave superconducting gap of the charge-uniform state, we find that the gap amplitude at the antinodal point is several times larger than the experimental value when we employ a realistic parameter as a model of the cuprate superconductors. The effective attractive interaction of carriers in the d -wave superconducting state inferred for an optimized state of the Hubbard model is as large as the order of the nearest-neighbor transfer, which is far beyond the former expectation in the cuprates. We discuss the nature of the superconducting state of the Hubbard model in terms of the overestimate of the gap and the attractive interaction in comparison to the cuprates.},

Cells can accumulate and transport these ligands, which results in an emergent organization of the ligands’ spatial distribution. To study this organization, we make use of a simplified experimental setup, in which single mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can interact with immobilized ligands. We introduce a two-species age-dependent correlation function that allows the description and quantification of the spatiotemporal dynamics of single cell-ligand interactions. Through the analysis of mESC data and numerical simulations, we show that cells act as effective force-field generators, perturbing and organizing their environment. This organization, captured in the form of an aging effective potential, is an emergent property of the population of single cells interacting with randomly distributed localized ligands.},

  abstract     = {When the ground state of a localized ion is a non-Kramers doublet, such localized ions may carry multipolar moments. For example, Pr 3 + ions in a cubic environment would possess quadrupolar and octupolar, but no magnetic dipole, moments. When such multipolar moments are placed in a metallic host, unusual interactions between these local moments and conduction electrons arise, in contrast to the familiar magnetic dipole interactions in the classic Kondo problem. In this work, we consider the interaction between a single quadrupolar-octupolar local moment and conduction electrons with p -orbital symmetry as a concrete model for the multipolar Kondo problem. We show that this model can be written most naturally in the spin-orbital entangled basis of conduction electrons. Using this basis, the perturbative renormalization-group (RG) fixed points are readily identified. There are two kinds of fixed points, one for the two-channel Kondo and the other for a novel fixed point. We investigate the nature of the novel fixed point nonperturbatively using non-Abelian bosonization, current algebra, and conformal field theory approaches. It is shown that the novel fixed point leads to a, previously unidentified, non-Fermi liquid state with entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom, which shows resistivity ρ ∼ T Δ and diverging specific heat coefficient C / T ∼ T − 1 + 2 Δ , with Δ = 1 / 5 . Our results open up the possibility of myriads of non-Fermi liquid states, depending on the choices of multipolar moments and conduction electron orbitals, which would be relevant for many rare-earth metallic systems.},

  abstract     = {Continuously monitoring the environment of a quantum many-body system reduces the entropy of (purifies) the reduced density matrix of the system, conditional on the outcomes of the measurements. We show that, for mixed initial states, a balanced competition between measurements and entangling interactions within the system can result in a dynamical purification phase transition between (i) a phase that locally purifies at a constant system-size-independent rate and (ii) a “mixed” phase where the purification time diverges exponentially in the system size. The residual entropy density in the mixed phase implies the existence of a quantum error-protected subspace, where quantum information is reliably encoded against the future nonunitary evolution of the system. We show that these codes are of potential relevance to fault-tolerant quantum computation as they are often highly degenerate and satisfy optimal trade-offs between encoded information densities and error thresholds. In spatially local models in 1 + 1 dimensions, this phase transition for mixed initial states occurs concurrently with a recently identified class of entanglement phase transitions for pure initial states. The purification transition studied here also generalizes to systems with long-range interactions, where conventional notions of entanglement transitions have to be reformulated. We numerically explore this transition for monitored random quantum circuits in 1 + 1 dimensions and all-to-all models. Unlike in pure initial states, the mutual information of an initially completely mixed state in 1 + 1 dimensions grows sublinearly in time due to the formation of the error-protected subspace. Purification dynamics is likely a more robust probe of the transition in experiments, where imperfections generically reduce entanglement and drive the system towards mixed states. We describe the motivations for studying this novel class of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics in the context of advanced quantum computing platforms and fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the behavior of an impurity strongly interacting with a Fermi sea is a long-standing challenge in many-body physics. When the interactions are short ranged, two vastly different ground states exist: a polaron quasiparticle and a molecule dressed by the majority atoms. In the single-impurity limit, it is predicted that at a critical interaction strength, a first-order transition occurs between these two states. Experiments, however, are always conducted in the finite temperature and impurity density regime. The fate of the polaron-to-molecule transition under these conditions, where the statistics of quantum impurities and thermal effects become relevant, is still unknown. Here, we address this question experimentally and theoretically. Our experiments are performed with a spin-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gas with tunable interactions. Utilizing a novel Raman spectroscopy combined with a high-sensitivity fluorescence detection technique, we isolate the quasiparticle contribution and extract the polaron energy, spectral weight, and the contact parameter. As the interaction strength is increased, we observe a continuous variation of all observables, in particular a smooth reduction of the quasiparticle weight as it goes to zero beyond the transition point. Our observation is in good agreement with a theoretical model where polaron and molecule quasiparticle states are thermally occupied according to their quantum statistics. At the experimental conditions, polaron states are hence populated even at interactions where the molecule is the ground state and vice versa. The emerging physical picture is thus that of a smooth transition between polarons and molecules and a coexistence of both in the region around the expected transition. Our findings establish Raman spectroscopy as a powerful experimental tool for probing the physics of mobile quantum impurities and shed new light on the competition between emerging fermionic and bosonic quasiparticles in non-Fermi-liquid phases.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error correction and symmetry arise in many areas of physics, including many-body systems, metrology in the presence of noise, fault-tolerant computation, and holographic quantum gravity. Here, we study the compatibility of these two important principles. If a logical quantum system is encoded into n physical subsystems, we say that the code is covariant with respect to a symmetry group G if a G transformation on the logical system can be realized by performing transformations on the individual subsystems. For a G -covariant code with G a continuous group, we derive a lower bound on the error-correction infidelity following erasure of a subsystem. This bound approaches zero when the number of subsystems n or the dimension d of each subsystem is large. We exhibit codes achieving approximately the same scaling of infidelity with n or d as the lower bound. Leveraging tools from representation theory, we prove an approximate version of the Eastin-Knill theorem for quantum computation: If a code admits a universal set of transversal gates and corrects erasure with fixed accuracy, then, for each logical qubit, we need a number of physical qubits per subsystem that is inversely proportional to the error parameter. We construct codes covariant with respect to the full logical unitary group, achieving good accuracy for large d (using random codes) or n (using codes based on W states). We systematically construct codes covariant with respect to general groups, obtaining natural generalizations of qubit codes to, for instance, oscillators and rotors. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, our approach provides insight into how time evolution in the bulk corresponds to time evolution on the boundary without violating the Eastin-Knill theorem, and our five-rotor code can be stacked to form a covariant holographic code.},

Standard measures of chaos in quantum many-body systems are level statistics and the spectral form factor. In this work, we show that the norm of the adiabatic gauge potential, the generator of adiabatic deformations between eigenstates, serves as a much more sensitive measure of quantum chaos. We are able to detect transitions from integrable to chaotic behavior at perturbation strengths orders of magnitude smaller than those required for standard measures. Using this alternative probe in two generic classes of spin chains, we show that the chaotic threshold decreases exponentially with system size and that one can immediately detect integrability-breaking (chaotic) perturbations by analyzing infinitesimal perturbations even at the integrable point. In some cases, small integrability breaking is shown to lead to anomalously slow relaxation of the system, exponentially long in system size.},

  abstract     = {An array of spheres descending slowly through a viscous fluid always clumps [J. M. Crowley, J. Fluid Mech. 45 , 151 (1971) ]. We show that anisotropic particle shape qualitatively transforms this iconic instability of collective sedimentation. In experiment and theory on disks, aligned facing their neighbors in a horizontal one-dimensional lattice and settling at Reynolds number ∼ 10 − 4 in a quasi-two-dimensional slab geometry, we find that for large enough lattice spacing the coupling of disk orientation and translation rescues the array from the clumping instability. Despite the absence of inertia, the resulting dynamics displays the wavelike excitations of a mass-and-spring array, with a conserved “momentum” in the form of the collective tilt of the disks and an effective spring stiffness emerging from the viscous hydrodynamic interaction. However, the non-normal character of the dynamical matrix leads to algebraic growth of perturbations even in the linearly stable regime. Stability analysis demarcates a phase boundary in the plane of wave number and lattice spacing, separating the regimes of algebraically growing waves and clumping, in quantitative agreement with our experiments. Through the use of particle shape to suppress a classic sedimentation instability, our work uncovers an unexpected conservation law and hidden Hamiltonian dynamics which in turn open a window to the physics of transient growth of linearly stable modes.},

  abstract     = {Laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) and its particle-driven counterpart, particle or plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA), are commonly treated as separate, though related, branches of high-gradient plasma-based acceleration. However, novel proposed schemes are increasingly residing at the interface of both concepts where the understanding of their interplay becomes crucial. Here, we present a comprehensive study of this regime, which we may term laser-plasma wakefields. Using datasets of hundreds of shots, we demonstrate the influence of beam loading on the spectral shape of electron bunches. Similar results are obtained using both 100-TW-class and few-cycle lasers, highlighting the scale invariance of the involved physical processes. Furthermore, we probe the interplay of dual electron bunches in the same or in two subsequent plasma periods under the influence of beam loading. We show that, with decreasing laser intensity, beam loading transitions to a beam-dominated regime, where the first bunch acts as the main driver of the wakefield. This transition is evidenced experimentally by a varying acceleration of a low-energy witness beam with respect to the charge of a high-energy drive beam in a spatially separate gas target. Our results also present an important step in the development of LWFA using controlled injection in a shock front. The electron beams in this study reach record performance in terms of laser-to-beam energy transfer efficiency (up to 10\%), spectral charge density (regularly exceeding 10 pC MeV − 1 ), and angular charge density (beyond 300 pC μ sr − 1 at 220 MeV). We provide an experimental scaling for the accelerated charge per terawatt (TW) of laser power, which approaches 2 nC at 300 TW. With the expanding availability of petawatt-class (PW) lasers, these beam parameters will become widely accessible. Thus, the physics of laser-plasma wakefields is expected to become increasingly relevant, as it provides new paths toward low-emittance beam generation for future plasma-based colliders or light sources.

Previously, a topological superconductor has been predominantly conceived to result from a topologically nontrivial band subject to an intrinsic or external superconducting proximity effect. Here, we propose a new class of topological superconductors that are uniquely induced by unconventional pairing. They exhibit a boundary-obstructed higher-order topological character and, depending on their dimensionality, feature unprecedently robust Majorana bound states or hinge modes protected by chiral symmetry. We predict the 112 family of iron pnictides, such as Ca 1 − x La x FeAs 2 , to be highly suited material candidates for our proposal, which can be tested by edge spectroscopy. Because of the boundary obstruction, the topologically nontrivial feature of the 112 pnictides does not reveal itself for a bulk-only torus band analysis without boundaries, and as such, it had evaded previous investigations. Our proposal not only opens a new arena for highly stable Majorana modes in high-temperature superconductors but also provides the smoking gun for extended s -wave order in the iron pnictides.},

  abstract     = {Pumping graphene with circularly polarized light is the archetype of light-tailoring topological bands. Realizing the induced Floquet-Chern-insulator state and demonstrating clear experimental evidence for its topological nature has been a challenge, and it has become clear that scattering effects play a crucial role. We tackle this gap between theory and experiment by employing microscopic quantum kinetic calculations including realistic electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering. Our theory provides a direct link to the build up of the Floquet-Chern-insulator state in light-driven graphene and its detection in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This approach allows us to study the robustness of the Floquet features against dephasing and thermalization effects. We also discuss the ultrafast Hall response in the laser-heated state. Furthermore, the induced pseudospin texture and the associated Berry curvature give rise to momentum-dependent orbital magnetization, which is reflected in circular dichroism in ARPES (CD-ARPES). Combining our nonequilibrium calculations with an accurate one-step theory of photoemission allows us to establish a direct link between the build up of the topological state and the dichroic pump-probe photoemission signal. The characteristic features in CD-ARPES are shown to be stable against heating and dephasing effects. Thus, tracing circular dichroism in time-resolved photoemission provides new insights into transient topological properties.},

Because of their exchange symmetry, identical particles can appear to be entangled—another uniquely quantum phenomenon with far-reaching practical implications. However, a long-standing debate has questioned whether identical particle entanglement is physical or merely a mathematical artifact. In this work, we provide such particle entanglement with a consistent theoretical description as a quantum resource in processes frequently encountered in optical and cold atomic systems. This leads to a plethora of applications of immediate practical impact. On the one hand, we show that the metrological advantage for estimating phase shifts in systems of identical bosons amounts to a measure of their particle entanglement, with a clear-cut operational meaning. On the other hand, we demonstrate in general terms that particle entanglement is the property resulting in directly usable mode entanglement when distributed to separated parties, with particle conservation laws in play. Application of our tools to an experimental implementation with Bose-Einstein condensates leads to the first quantitative estimation of identical particle entanglement. Further connections are revealed between particle entanglement and other resources such as optical nonclassicality and quantum coherence. Overall, this work marks a resolutive step in the ongoing debate by delivering a unifying conceptual and practical understanding of entanglement between identical particles.},

  abstract     = {Isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs) produced through laser-driven high-harmonic generation (HHG) hold promise for unprecedented insight into physical, chemical, and biological processes via attosecond x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy with tabletop sources. Efficient scaling of HHG towards x-ray energies, however, has been hampered by ionization-induced plasma generation impeding the coherent buildup of high-harmonic radiation. Recently, it has been shown that these limitations can be overcome in the so-called “overdriven regime” where ionization loss and plasma dispersion strongly modify the driving laser pulse over small distances, albeit without demonstrating IAPs. Here, we report on experiments contrasting the generation of IAPs at 80 eV in argon with neon via attosecond streaking measurements. Comparing our experimental results to numerical simulations, we conclude that IAPs in argon are generated in the overdriven regime. We introduce a simple expression that fully describes the HHG dipole phase-mismatch contribution, specifically the effect of the blueshift of the driving laser. Furthermore, we present a method to numerically calculate the transient HHG phase mismatch, which allows us to demonstrate the accuracy of the introduced phase-mismatch expression. Finally, we perform simulations for different gases and wavelengths and show that including the full HHG dipole phase-mismatch contribution is important for understanding HHG with long-wavelength, few-cycle laser pulses in high-pressure gas targets, which are currently being employed for scaling isolated attosecond pulse generation beyond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) towards soft-x-ray photon energies.},

  abstract     = {Spins in gate-defined silicon quantum dots are promising candidates for implementing large-scale quantum computing. To read the spin state of these qubits, the mechanism that has provided the highest fidelity is spin-to-charge conversion via singlet-triplet spin blockade, which can be detected in situ using gate-based dispersive sensing. In systems with a complex energy spectrum, like silicon quantum dots, accurately identifying when singlet-triplet blockade occurs is hence of major importance for scalable qubit readout. In this work, we present a description of spin-blockade physics in a tunnel-coupled silicon double quantum dot defined in the corners of a split-gate transistor. Using gate-based magnetospectroscopy, we report successive steps of spin blockade and spin-blockade lifting involving spin states with total spin angular momentum up to S = 3 . More particularly, we report the formation of a hybridized spin-quintet state and show triplet-quintet and quintet-septet spin blockade, enabling studies of the quintet relaxation dynamics from which we find T 1 ∼ 4 μ s . Finally, we develop a quantum capacitance model that can be applied generally to reconstruct the energy spectrum of a double quantum dot, including the spin-dependent tunnel couplings and the energy splitting between different spin manifolds. Our results allow for the possibility of using Si complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dots as a tunable platform for studying high-spin systems.},

In this work, we propose a continuum model of pattern formation due to nonreciprocal interaction between multiple species of scalar active matter. The classical Cahn-Hilliard model is minimally modified by supplementing the equilibrium Ginzburg-Landau dynamics with particle-number-conserving currents, which cannot be derived from a free energy, reflecting the microscopic departure from action-reaction symmetry. The strength of the asymmetry in the interaction determines whether the steady state exhibits a macroscopic phase separation or a traveling density wave displaying global polar order. The latter structure, which is equivalent to an active self-propelled smectic phase, coarsens via annihilation of defects, whereas the former structure undergoes Ostwald ripening. The emergence of traveling density waves, which is a clear signature of broken time-reversal symmetry in this active system, is a generic feature of any multicomponent mixture with microscopic nonreciprocal interactions.},

The key player here is the FeSe layer, which exhibits the highest superconducting transition temperature in the form of monolayer thin film. Recently, a new FeSe based compound, CsFe 4 − x Se 4 , with the space group of B m m m was found. Interestingly, the system shows a strong insulatorlike behavior, although it shares the same FeSe planes as other relatives. Density functional theory calculations indicate that it should be a metal, in sharp contrast with the experimental observations. Here, we report the emergence of unconventional superconductivity by applying pressure to suppress this insulatorlike behavior. At ambient pressure, the insulatorlike behavior cannot be modeled as a band insulator, but it can be described by the variable-range-hopping model for correlated systems. Furthermore, the specific heat down to 400 mK has been measured, and a significant residual coefficient γ 0 = C / T | T → 0 is observed, which contrasts the insulatorlike state and suggests some quantum freedom of spin dynamics. By applying pressure, the insulatorlike behavior is gradually suppressed, and the system becomes a metal; finally, superconductivity is achieved at about 5.1 K. The superconducting transition strongly depends on magnetic field and applied current, indicating a fragile superfluid density. Our results suggest that the superconductivity is established by diluted Cooper pairs on top of a strong correlation background in CsFe 4 − x Se 4 .},

  abstract     = {Topologically ordered phases of matter, although stable against local perturbations, are usually restricted to relatively small regions in phase diagrams. Thus, their preparation requires a precise fine-tunning of the system’s parameters, a very challenging task in most experimental setups. In this work, we investigate a model of spinless fermions interacting with dynamical Z 2 gauge fields on a cross-linked ladder and show evidence of topological order throughout the full parameter space. In particular, we show how a magnetic flux is spontaneously generated through the ladder due to an Aharonov-Bohm instability, giving rise to topological order even in the absence of a plaquette term. Moreover, the latter coexists here with a symmetry-protected topological phase in the matter sector, which displays fractionalized gauge-matter edge states and intertwines with it by a flux-threading phenomenon. Finally, we unveil the robustness of these features through a gauge frustration mechanism, akin to geometric frustration in spin liquids, allowing topological order to survive to arbitrarily large quantum fluctuations. In particular, we show how, at finite chemical potential, topological solitons are created in the gauge field configuration, which bound to fermions and form Z 2 deconfined quasiparticles. The simplicity of the model makes it an ideal candidate for 2D gauge theory phenomena, as well as exotic topological effects, to be investigated using cold-atom quantum simulators.},

  abstract     = {Covariance mapping [L. J. Frasinski, K. Codling, and P. A. Hatherly, Science 246 , 1029 (1989) ] is a well-established technique used for the study of mechanisms of laser-induced molecular ionization and decomposition. It measures statistical correlations between fluctuating signals of pairs of detected species (ions, fragments, electrons). A positive correlation identifies pairs of products originating from the same dissociation or ionization event. A major challenge for covariance-mapping spectroscopy is accessing decompositions of large polyatomic molecules, where true physical correlations are overwhelmed by spurious signals of no physical significance induced by fluctuations in experimental parameters. As a result, successful applications of covariance mapping have so far been restricted to low-mass systems, e.g., organic molecules of around 50 daltons (Da). Partial-covariance mapping was suggested to tackle the problem of spurious correlations by taking into account the independently measured fluctuations in the experimental conditions. However, its potential has never been realized for the decomposition of large molecules, because in these complex situations, determining and continuously monitoring multiple experimental parameters affecting all the measured signals simultaneously becomes unfeasible. We introduce, through deriving theoretically and confirming experimentally, a conceptually new type of partial-covariance mapping—self-correcting partial-covariance spectroscopy—based on a parameter extracted from the measured spectrum itself. We use the readily available total ion count as the self-correcting partial-covariance parameter, thus eliminating the challenge of determining experimental parameter fluctuations in covariance measurements of large complex systems. The introduced self-correcting partial covariance enables us to successfully resolve correlations of molecules as large as 10 3 – 10 4 Da , 2 orders of magnitude above the state of the art. This opens new opportunities for mechanistic studies of large molecule decompositions through revealing their fragment-fragment correlations. Moreover, we demonstrate that self-correcting partial covariance is applicable to solving the inverse problem: reconstruction of a molecular structure from its fragment spectrum, within two-dimensional partial-covariance mass spectrometry.},

Motivated by this recent discovery, we use density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to quantitatively address the superconducting properties of bulk and monolayer NbSe 2 . We demonstrate that NbSe 2 is close to a ferromagnetic instability, and analyze our results in the context of experimental measurements of the spin susceptibility in NbSe 2 . We show how this magnetic instability, which is pronounced in a single monolayer, can enable sizable singlet-triplet mixing of the superconducting order parameter, contrary to contemporary considerations of the pairing symmetry in monolayer NbSe 2 , and discuss approaches as to how this degree of mixing can be addressed quantitatively within our DFT framework. Our calculations also enable a quantitative description of the large anisotropy of the superconducting critical field, using DFT calculations of monolayer NbSe 2 in the normal state.},

We investigate the correlated electronic structure of NdNiO 2 at lower temperatures and show that first-principles many-body theory may account for Kondo(-lattice) features. Yet, those features are not only based on localized Ni − d x 2 − y 2 and a Nd-dominated self-doping band, but they heavily build on the participation of Ni − d z 2 in a Hund-assisted manner. In a tailored three-orbital study, the half-filled regime of the former in-plane Ni orbital remains surprisingly robust even for substantial hole doping δ . Reconstructions of the interacting Fermi surface designate the superconducting region within the experimental phase diagram. Furthermore, they provide clues to recent Hall measurements, as well as to the astounding weakly insulating behavior at larger experimental δ . Finally, a strong asymmetry between electron and hole doping, with a revival of Ni single-orbital features in the former case, is predicted. Unlike cuprates, superconductivity in Nd 1 − x Sr x NiO 2 is of distinct multiorbital kind, building up on nearly localized Ni − d x 2 − y 2 and itinerant Ni − d z 2 .},

This effect is observed in different ferroelectric materials ( LiNbO 3 , BaTiO 3 , and PbTiO 3 ) and with different morphologies (from single crystals to thin films), suggesting that the effect is universal. We propose a theoretical framework that explains the domain wall softening and justifies that the effect should be common to all ferroelectrics. The lesson is, therefore, that domain walls are not only functionally different from the domains they separate, but also mechanically distinct.},

  abstract     = {Quantum mechanically, photoionization can be fully described by the complex photoionization amplitudes that describe the transition between the ground state and the continuum state. Knowledge of the value of the phase of these amplitudes has been a central interest in photoionization studies and newly developing attosecond science, since the phase can reveal important information about phenomena such as electron correlation. We present a new attosecond-precision interferometric method of angle-resolved measurement for the phase of the photoionization amplitudes, using two phase-locked extreme ultraviolet pulses of frequency ω and 2 ω , from a free-electron laser. Phase differences Δ η ˜ between one- and two-photon ionization channels, averaged over multiple wave packets, are extracted for neon 2 p electrons as a function of the emission angle at photoelectron energies 7.9, 10.2, and 16.6 eV. Δ η ˜ is nearly constant for emission parallel to the electric vector but increases at 10.2 eV for emission perpendicular to the electric vector. We model our observations with both perturbation and ab initio theory and find excellent agreement. In the existing method for attosecond measurement, reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions (RABBITT), a phase difference between two-photon pathways involving absorption and emission of an infrared photon is extracted. Our method can be used for extraction of a phase difference between single-photon and two-photon pathways and provides a new tool for attosecond science, which is complementary to RABBITT.},

  abstract     = {A promising route to realize entangled magnetic states combines geometrical frustration with quantum-tunneling effects. Spin-ice materials are canonical examples of frustration, and Ising spins in a transverse magnetic field are the simplest many-body model of quantum tunneling. Here, we show that the tripod-kagome lattice material Ho 3 Mg 2 Sb 3 O 14 unites an icelike magnetic degeneracy with quantum-tunneling terms generated by an intrinsic splitting of the Ho 3 + ground-state doublet, which is further coupled to a nuclear spin bath. Using neutron scattering and thermodynamic experiments, we observe a symmetry-breaking transition at T * ≈ 0.32 K to a remarkable state with three peculiarities: a concurrent recovery of magnetic entropy associated with the strongly coupled electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom; a fragmentation of the spin into periodic and icelike components; and persistent inelastic magnetic excitations down to T ≈ 0.12 K . These observations deviate from expectations of classical spin fragmentation on a kagome lattice, but can be understood within a model of dipolar kagome ice under a homogeneous transverse magnetic field, which we survey with exact diagonalization on small clusters and mean-field calculations. In Ho 3 Mg 2 Sb 3 O 14 , hyperfine interactions dramatically alter the single-ion and collective properties, and suppress possible quantum correlations, rendering the fragmentation with predominantly single-ion quantum fluctuations. Our results highlight the crucial role played by hyperfine interactions in frustrated quantum magnets and motivate further investigations of the role of quantum fluctuations on partially ordered magnetic states.},

Numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo methods are utilized to compute the nuclear weak response functions, by fully retaining many-body correlations in the initial and final states and interference effects between one- and two-body current contributions. We employ a nucleon axial form factor of the dipole form with Λ A = 1.0 or 1.15 GeV, the latter more in line with a very recent lattice QCD determination.

  abstract     = {The mechanical and chemical properties of soft solids are crucial to many applications in biology and surface science. Recent studies use wetting by liquid drops to probe the surface mechanics of reticulated polymer networks, leading to controversial interpretations. This controversy relates to the long-standing paradox of Young’s law for the liquid contact angle, which invokes only a horizontal force balance. Recent work shows that, for very soft materials, the solid’s surface tension plays a key role for the vertical force balance, involving a singular ridgelike deformation exactly at the point where the droplet pulls on the network. A hotly debated question is whether unexpected measurements on this singular deformation can be attributed to nonlinear bulk elasticity or whether these provide evidence for an intricate surface elasticity, known as the Shuttleworth effect. Here, we theoretically reveal the nature of the elastocapillary singularity on a hyperelastic substrate with various constitutive relations for the interfacial energy. First, we finely resolve the vicinity of the singularity using goal-adaptive finite-element simulations. This simulation confirms that bulk elasticity cannot affect the force balance at the contact line. Subsequently, we derive exact solutions of nonlinear elasticity that describe the singularity analytically. These solutions are in perfect agreement with numerics and show that both the angles and stretch at the contact line, as previously measured experimentally, consistently point to a strong Shuttleworth effect. Finally, using Noether’s theorem, we reveal the quantitative link between Young’s law, hysteresis, and the nature of the elastocapillary singularity. Our contribution closes the issue of the missing normal force at the contact line and opens up the development of modern techniques in polymer surface science.},

  abstract     = {In certain analytically tractable quantum chaotic systems, the calculation of out-of-time-order correlation functions, entanglement entropies after a quench, and other related dynamical observables reduces to an effective theory of an “entanglement membrane” in spacetime. These tractable systems involve an average over random local unitaries defining the dynamical evolution. We show here how to make sense of this membrane in more realistic models, which do not involve an average over random unitaries. Our approach relies on introducing effective pairing degrees of freedom in spacetime, describing a pairing of forward and backward Feynman trajectories, inspired by the structure emerging in random unitary circuits. This viewpoint provides a framework for applying ideas of coarse graining to dynamical quantities in chaotic systems. We apply the approach to some translationally invariant Floquet spin chains studied in the literature. We show that a consistent line tension may be defined for the entanglement membrane and that there are qualitative differences in this tension between generic models and “dual-unitary” circuits. These results allow scaling pictures for out-of-time-order correlators and for entanglement to be taken over from random circuits to nonrandom Floquet models. We also provide an efficient numerical algorithm for determining the entanglement line tension in 1 + 1 D .},

We perform measurements of the displacement of the microresonator, one in reflection of the cavity and one in transmission of the cavity. We show that measuring the amplitude quadrature of the light transmitted by the optomechanical cavity allows us to cancel the backaction noise between 2 and 50 kHz as a consequence of the strong optical spring present in the detuned cavity. This cancellation yields a more sensitive measurement of the microresonator’s position with a 2 dB increase in sensitivity. To confirm that the backaction is eliminated, we measure the noise in the transmission signal as a function of circulating power and use a correlation technique between two photodetectors to remove shot noise. Remaining backaction noise would be observable as a power-dependent noise floor, which is not observed. Eliminating the effects of backaction in this frequency regime is an important demonstration of a technique that could be used to mitigate the effects of backaction in interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as Advanced LIGO, VIRGO, and KAGRA.},

  abstract     = {Many applications of quantum simulation require one to prepare and then characterize quantum states by efficiently estimating k -body reduced density matrices ( k -RDMs), from which observables of interest may be obtained. For instance, the fermionic 2-RDM contains the energy, charge density, and energy gradients of an electronic system, while the qubit 2-RDM contains the spatial correlation functions of magnetic systems. Naive estimation of such RDMs requires repeated state preparations for each matrix element, which makes for prohibitively large computation times. However, commuting matrix elements may be measured simultaneously, allowing for a significant cost reduction. In this work, we design schemes for such a parallelization with near-optimal complexity in the system size N . We first describe a scheme to sample all elements of a qubit k -RDM using only O ( 3 k log k − 1 N ) unique measurement circuits, an exponential improvement over prior art. We then describe a scheme for sampling all elements of the fermionic 2-RDM using only O ( N 2 ) unique measurement circuits, each of which requires only a local O ( N ) -depth measurement circuit. We prove a lower bound of Ω ( ε − 2 N k ) on the number of state preparations, Clifford circuits, and measurement in the computational basis required to estimate all elements of a fermionic k -RDM, making our scheme for sampling the fermionic 2-RDM asymptotically optimal. We finally construct circuits to sample the expectation value of a linear combination of ω anticommuting two-body fermionic operators with only O ( ω ) gates on a linear array. These circuits allows for sampling any linear combination of fermionic 2-RDM elements in O ( N 4 / ω ) time, with a significantly lower measurement circuit complexity than prior art. Our results improve the viability of near-term quantum simulation of molecules and strongly correlated material systems.},

We show an implementation of this method for a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate spontaneous parametric down-conversion source generating up to 60 photon pairs per pulse, and we demonstrate excellent agreement between our experiments and our theory. This work enables the complete and accurate experimental characterization of high-gain effects in parametric down-conversion, including self- and cross-phase modulation. Moreover, our theory allows the exploration of designs with the goal of improving the specifications of twin-beam sources for application in quantum information, computation, sampling, and metrology.},

  abstract     = {An ever-increasing number of strong-field applications, such as ultrafast coherent control over matter and light, require driver light pulses that are both high power and spectrally tunable. The realization of such a source in the terahertz (THz) band has long been a formidable challenge. Here, we demonstrate, via experiment and theory, efficient production of terawatt (TW)-level THz pulses from high-intensity picosecond laser irradiation on a metal foil. It is shown that the THz spectrum can be manipulated effectively by tuning the laser pulse duration or target size. A general analytical framework for THz generation is developed, involving both the high-current electron emission and a time-varying electron sheath at the target rear, and the spectral tunability is found to stem from the change of the dominant THz generation mechanism. In addition to being an ultrabright source (brightness temperature of about 10 21 K ) for extreme THz science, the THz radiation presented here also enables a unique in situ laser-plasma diagnostic. Employing the THz radiation to quantify the escaping electrons and the transient sheath shows good agreement with experimental measurements.},

However, a strictly 1D system is unstable against perturbations, whose effect on CDW order requires clarification ideally with altered coupling to surroundings. Here, we fabricate such a system with nanowires of Mo 6 Se 6 bundles, which are either attached to edges of monolayer MoSe 2 or isolated freely, by postannealing the preformed MoSe 2 . Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we visualize charge modulations and CDW gaps with prominent coherent peaks in the edge-attached nanowires. Astonishingly, the CDW order becomes suppressed in the isolated nanowires, showing CDW correlation gaps without coherent peaks. The contrasting behavior, as revealed with theoretical modeling, is interpreted as the effect of phason polarons on the 1D CDW state. Our work elucidates a possibly unprecedented many-body effect that may be generic to strictly 1D system but undermined in a quasi-1D system.},

Optical and spin coherence lifetimes, which determine quantum operation fidelity and storage time, are often limited by spin-spin interactions, which can be decreased by polarizing spins. Spin polarization can be achieved using optical pumping, large magnetic fields, or mK-range temperatures. Here, we show that optical pumping of a small fraction of ions with a fixed-frequency laser, coupled with spin-spin interactions and spin diffusion, leads to substantial spin polarization in a paramagnetic rare-earth doped crystal, Yb 171 3 + ∶ Y 2 SiO 5 . Indeed, more than 90\% spin polarization has been achieved at 2 K and zero magnetic field. Using this spin polarization mechanism, we further demonstrate an increase in optical coherence lifetime from 0.3 ms to 0.8 ms, due to a strong decrease in spin-spin interactions. This effect opens the way to new schemes for obtaining long optical and spin coherence lifetimes in various solid-state systems such as ensembles of rare-earth ions or color centers in diamond, which are of interest for a broad range of quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Active matter exhibits various forms of nonequilibrium states in the absence of external forcing, including macroscopic steady-state currents. Such states are often too complex to be modeled from first principles, and our understanding of their physics relies heavily on minimal models. These are mostly studied in the case of “dry” active matter, where particle dynamics are dominated by friction with their surroundings. Significantly less is known about systems with long-range hydrodynamic interactions that belong to “wet” active matter. Dilute suspensions of motile bacteria, modeled as self-propelled dipolar particles interacting solely through long-ranged hydrodynamic fields, are arguably the most studied example from this class of active systems. Their phenomenology is well established: At a sufficiently high density of bacteria, there appear large-scale vortices and jets comprising many individual organisms, forming a chaotic state commonly known as bacterial turbulence . As revealed by computer simulations, below the onset of collective motion, the suspension exhibits very strong correlations between individual microswimmers stemming from the long-ranged nature of dipolar fields. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenology is captured by the minimal model of microswimmers. We develop a kinetic theory that goes beyond the commonly used mean-field assumption and explicitly takes into account such correlations. Notably, these can be computed exactly within our theory. We calculate the fluid velocity variance, spatial and temporal correlation functions, the fluid velocity spectrum, and the enhanced diffusivity of tracer particles. We find that correlations are suppressed by particle self-propulsion, although the mean-field behavior is not restored even in the limit of very fast swimming. Our theory is not perturbative and is valid for any value of the microswimmer density below the onset of collective motion. This work constitutes a significant methodological advance and allows us to make qualitative and quantitative predictions that can be directly compared to experiments and computer simulations of microswimmer suspensions.},

Here, we report a combined application of cutting-edge computational methods to determine the properties of the hydrogen chain in its quantum-mechanical ground state. Varying the separation between the nuclei leads to a rich phase diagram, including a Mott phase with quasi-long-range antiferromagnetic order, electron density dimerization with power-law correlations, an insulator-to-metal transition, and an intricate set of intertwined magnetic orders.},

One promising approach is frequency upconversion into the visible (VIS) or near-infrared (NIR) domain, where single-photon detectors are readily available. Here, we propose a nanoscale solution based on a molecular optomechanical platform to up-convert photons from the far- and mid-infrared (covering part of the terahertz gap) into the VIS-NIR domain. We perform a detailed analysis of its outgoing noise spectral density and conversion efficiency with a full quantum model. Our platform consists in doubly resonant nanoantennas focusing both the incoming long-wavelength radiation and the short-wavelength pump laser field into the same active region. There, infrared active vibrational modes are resonantly excited and couple through their Raman polarizability to the pump field. This optomechanical interaction is enhanced by the antenna and leads to the coherent transfer of the incoming low-frequency signal onto the anti-Stokes sideband of the pump laser. Our calculations demonstrate that our scheme is realizable with current technology and that optimized platforms can reach single-photon sensitivity in a spectral region where this capability remains unavailable to date.},

  abstract     = {Experimental data are often affected by uncontrolled variables that make analysis and interpretation difficult. For spatiotemporal systems, this problem is further exacerbated by their intricate dynamics. Modern machine learning methods are particularly well suited for analyzing and modeling complex datasets, but to be effective in science, the result needs to be interpretable. We demonstrate an unsupervised learning technique for extracting interpretable physical parameters from noisy spatiotemporal data and for building a transferable model of the system. In particular, we implement a physics-informed architecture based on variational autoencoders that is designed for analyzing systems governed by partial differential equations. The architecture is trained end to end and extracts latent parameters that parametrize the dynamics of a learned predictive model for the system. To test our method, we train our model on simulated data from a variety of partial differential equations with varying dynamical parameters that act as uncontrolled variables. Numerical experiments show that our method can accurately identify relevant parameters and extract them from raw and even noisy spatiotemporal data (tested with roughly 10\% added noise). These extracted parameters correlate well (linearly with R 2 &gt; 0.95 ) with the ground truth physical parameters used to generate the datasets. We then apply this method to nonlinear fiber propagation data, generated by an ab initio simulation, to demonstrate its capabilities on a more realistic dataset. Our method for discovering interpretable latent parameters in spatiotemporal systems will allow us to better analyze and understand real-world phenomena and datasets, which often have unknown and uncontrolled variables that alter the system dynamics and cause varying behaviors that are difficult to disentangle.},

Our construction is based on the concept of an equivalence class of finite-depth fermionic symmetric local unitary transformations and decorating symmetry domain wall picture, subjected to certain obstructions. We also discuss the systematical construction and classification of boundary anomalous SPT states which leads to a trivialization of the corresponding bulk FSPT states. Thus, we conjecture that the obstruction-free and trivialization-free constructions naturally lead to a classification of FSPT phases. Each fixed-point wave function admits an exactly solvable commuting-projector Hamiltonian. We believe that our classification scheme can be generalized to point and space group symmetry as well as continuum Lie group symmetry.},

Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy on individual rare-earth atoms adsorbed on metal-supported graphene reveals an element-dependent excitation, with energy between 30 and 170 meV, linearly increasing with the spin angular momentum of the 4 f shell. This observation is possible owing to the strong spin polarization of the outer shells, characteristic of rare-earth adatoms on graphene. This polarization gives rise to a giant magnetoresistance of up to 75\% observed for Dy on graphene / Ir ( 111 ) single-atom magnets. Density functional theory calculations of the 6 s 5 d shell spin polarizations and of their intra-atomic exchange constants with the 4 f shell yield exchange energies in agreement with the experimental values. These results prove that the description of the spin dynamics in RE considering only the 4 f − 5 d interaction is oversimplified. A more realistic treatment requires us to consider a multishell intra-atomic exchange in which both 6 s and 5 d shells are taken into account, with the 4 f − 6 s contribution possibly prevailing over the 4 f − 5 d one. Our findings are important for the general understanding of magnetism in rare earths, whether they are in bulk compounds or as surface adsorbed atoms and clusters. The results presented here also push for a revision of the description of the spin dynamics in rare-earth-based systems.},

Corrections to Eliashberg theory break these power laws but only at very small frequencies. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations have shown that, already at much larger frequencies, there are strong systematic deviations from these predictions, casting doubt on the validity of the theoretical analysis. We extend Eliashberg theory to finite T and argue that in the T range accessible in the QMC simulations above the superconducting transition, the scaling forms for both fermionic and bosonic self-energies are quite different from those at T = 0 . We compare finite T results with QMC data and find good agreement for both systems. We argue that this agreement resolves the key apparent contradiction between the theory and the QMC simulations.},

These codes, which protect against both drift in the body’s orientation and small changes in its angular momentum, may be well suited for robust storage and coherent processing of quantum information using rotational states of a polyatomic molecule. Extensions of such codes to rigid bodies with a symmetry axis are compatible with rotational states of diatomic molecules as well as nuclear states of molecules and atoms. We also describe codes associated with general non-Abelian groups and develop orthogonality relations for coset spaces, laying the groundwork for quantum information processing with exotic configuration spaces.},

  abstract     = {Degeneracies play a crucial rule in precise scientific measurements as well as in sensing applications. Spherical resonators have a high degree of degeneracy thanks to their highest symmetry; yet, fabricating perfect spheres is challenging because even a stem to hold the sphere breaks the symmetry. Here we fabricate a levitating spherical resonator that is evanescently coupled to a standard optical fiber. We characterize the resonators to exhibit an optical quality factor exceeding a billion, 10 μ m radius, and sphericity to within less than 1 Å. Using our high quality and sphericity, we experimentally lift degeneracies of orders higher than 200, which we resolve with optical finesse exceeding 10 000 000. We then present our experimentally measured degenerate modes as well as their density of states next to our corresponding theoretical calculation. Our contactless photonic resonator is compatible with standard telecom fiber technology, exhibits the highest resonance enhancement as defined by (quality factor)/(mode volume), and the modes populating our cavity show the highest order of degeneracy reported in any system ever studied. This is in comparison with other settings that typically utilize the lowest-order twofold degeneracy.},

In this technique, the attosecond structure of an extreme-ultraviolet pulse is retrieved from the wave function of the electron wave packet released during photoionization. Here, we show that this electron wave packet should rather be described using the density matrix formalism, thus allowing one to account for all processes that can affect its coherence, from the attosecond pulse generation to the photoemission and the measurement processes. Using this approach, we reconstruct experimentally a partially coherent electron wave packet with a purity of 0.11 (1 for full coherence). Comparison with theoretical models then allows us to identify the origins of this decoherence and to overcome several limitations such as beam-line instabilities or spectrometer resolution. Furthermore, we show numerically how this method gives access to the coherence and eigencomponents of complex photoelectron wave packets. It thus goes beyond the current measurement of photoionization time delays and provides a general framework for the analysis and understanding of complex photoemission processes.},

In this paper, we reexamine the case of the light-induced insulator-metal phase transition in the prototypical, strongly correlated material VO 2 , for which a nonthermal Mott-Hubbard transition has been claimed. Here, we show that heat, even on the ultrafast timescale, plays a key role in the phase transition. When heating is properly accounted for, we find a single phase-transition threshold corresponding to the thermodynamic structural insulator-metal phase transition, and we find no evidence of a hidden transient Mott-Hubbard nonthermal phase.

The properties of the composite depend on both the Rydberg excitation, which provides the gross energetic and spatial scales, and the distribution of ground state atoms within the volume of the Rydberg wave function, which sculpt the electronic states. The latter range from the “trilobites,” for small numbers of scatterers, to delocalized and chaotic eigenstates, for disordered scatterer arrays, culminating in the dense scatterer limit in symmetry-dominated wave functions which promise good control in future experiments. We discuss one-, two-, and three-dimensional arrangements of scatterers using different theoretical methods, enabling us to obtain scaling behavior for the regular spectrum and measures of chaos and delocalization in the disordered regime. We also show that analogous quantum dot composites can elucidate in particular the dense scatterer limit. Thus, we obtain a systematic description of the composite states. The two-dimensional monolayer composite possesses the richest spectrum with an intricate band structure in the limit of homogeneous scatterers, experimentally accessible with pancake-shaped condensates.},

  abstract     = {The spherical p -spin model is a fundamental model in statistical mechanics of a disordered system with a random first-order transition. The dynamics of this model is interesting both for the physics of glasses and for its implications on hard optimization problems. Here, we revisit the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the spherical mixed p -spin model, which differs from the pure p -spin model by the fact that the Hamiltonian is not a homogeneous function of its variables. We consider quenches (gradient descent dynamics) starting from initial conditions thermalized in the high-temperature ergodic phase. Unexpectedly, we find that, differently from the pure p -spin case, the asymptotic states of the dynamics keep memory of the initial condition. The final energy is a decreasing function of the initial temperature, and the system remains correlated with the initial state. This dependence disproves the idea of a unique “threshold” energy level attracting dynamics starting from high-temperature initial conditions. Thermalization, which could be achieved, e.g., by an algorithm like simulated annealing, provides an advantage in gradient descent dynamics and, last but not least, brings mean-field models closer to real glass phenomenology, where such a dependence is observed in numerical simulations. We investigate the nature of the asymptotic dynamics, finding an aging state that relaxes towards deep, marginally stable minima. However, careful analysis rules out simple generalizations of the aging solution of the pure model. We compute the constrained complexity with the aim of connecting the asymptotic solution to the energy landscape.},

Here, we study the learning of multiple stable states in sequence by an elastic material that undergoes plastic changes as it is held in different configurations. We show that an elastic network with linear or nearly linear springs cannot learn continually without overwriting earlier states for a broad class of plasticity rules. On the other hand, networks of sufficiently nonlinear springs can learn continually, without erasing older states, using even simple plasticity rules. We trace this ability to cusped energy contours caused by strong nonlinearities and thus show that elastic nonlinearities play the role of Bayesian priors used in sparse statistical regression. Our model shows how specific material properties allow continual learning of new functions through deployment of the material itself.},

Here we explore how one- and two-dimensional topological solitons formed by spatially localized continuous orientational patterns of optical axis in uniaxial birefringent media interact with light. These solitons, in the forms of one-dimensional twist walls and two-dimensional skyrmions, are controllably generated in thin films of cholesteric liquid crystals to introduce spatially localized patterns of effective refractive index. Laser light interacts with these solitons as quasiparticles or extended interfaces of different effective refractive indices seen by ordinary and extraordinary waves propagating within the liquid-crystal medium. Despite our system’s complex nature, our findings can be paralleled with the familiar phenomena of total reflection and refraction at interfaces of optically distinct media, albeit these behaviors arise in a medium with homogeneous density and chemical composition but with spatial variations of molecular and optical-axis orientations. By exploiting the facile response of liquid crystals to external stimuli, we show that the twist walls and skyrmions can be used to steer laser beams and to act as lenses and other optical elements, which can be reconfigured by low-voltage fields and other means. Analytical and numerical modeling, with the latter based on free-energy-minimizing configurations of the topological solitons, closely reproduce our experimental findings. The fundamental insights provided by this work potentially can be extended also to three-dimensional solitons, such as Hopfions, and may lead to technological applications of optical-axis topological solitons in telecommunications, nanophotonics, electro-optics, and so on.},

In particular, we investigate codes given by 2D symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases that appear naturally on the boundary of 3D symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. We find that while conventional on-site symmetries are not sufficient to allow for self-correction in commuting Hamiltonian models of this form, a generalized type of symmetry known as a 1-form symmetry is enough to guarantee self-correction. We illustrate this fact with the 3D “cluster-state” model from the theory of quantum computing. This model is a self-correcting memory, where information is encoded in a 2D SET-ordered phase on the boundary that is protected by the thermally stable SPT ordering of the bulk. We also investigate the gauge color code in this context. Finally, noting that a 1-form symmetry is a very strong constraint, we argue that topologically ordered systems can possess emergent 1-form symmetries, i.e., models where the symmetry appears naturally, without needing to be enforced externally.},

The method uses mesoscopic reservoirs, continuously damped toward thermal equilibrium, in order to represent continuum baths and a novel tensor-network algorithm to simulate the steady-state thermodynamics. Using the example of a quantum-dot heat engine, we demonstrate that our technique replicates the well-known Landauer-Büttiker theory for efficiency and power. We then go beyond the quadratic limit to demonstrate the capability of our method by simulating a three-site machine with nonquadratic interactions. Remarkably, we find that such interactions lead to power enhancement, without being detrimental to the efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of our method to tackle complex many-body systems by extracting the superdiffusive exponent for high-temperature transport in the isotropic Heisenberg model. Finally, we discuss transport in the gapless phase of the anisotropic Heisenberg model at a finite temperature and its connection to charge conjugation parity, going beyond the predictions of single-site boundary driving configurations.},

  abstract     = {The spectral gap problem—determining whether the energy spectrum of a system has an energy gap above ground state, or if there is a continuous range of low-energy excitations—pervades quantum many-body physics. Recently, this important problem was shown to be undecidable for quantum-spin systems in two (or more) spatial dimensions: There exists no algorithm that determines in general whether a system is gapped or gapless, a result which has many unexpected consequences for the physics of such systems. However, there are many indications that one-dimensional spin systems are simpler than their higher-dimensional counterparts: For example, they cannot have thermal phase transitions or topological order, and there exist highly effective numerical algorithms such as the density matrix renormalization group—and even provably polynomial-time ones—for gapped 1D systems, exploiting the fact that such systems obey an entropy area law. Furthermore, the spectral gap undecidability construction crucially relied on aperiodic tilings, which are not possible in 1D. So does the spectral gap problem become decidable in 1D? In this paper, we prove this is not the case by constructing a family of 1D spin chains with translationally invariant nearest-neighbor interactions for which no algorithm can determine the presence of a spectral gap. This not only proves that the spectral gap of 1D systems is just as intractable as in higher dimensions, but it also predicts the existence of qualitatively new types of complex physics in 1D spin chains. In particular, it implies there are 1D systems with a constant spectral gap and nondegenerate classical ground state for all systems sizes up to an uncomputably large size, whereupon they switch to a gapless behavior with dense spectrum.},

  abstract     = {We report on the observation of magnetic Feshbach resonances in a Fermi-Fermi mixture of ultracold atoms with extreme mass imbalance and on their unique p -wave dominated three-body recombination processes. Our system consists of open-shell alkali-metal Li 6 and closed-shell Yb 173 atoms, both spin polarized and held at various temperatures between 1 and 20 μ K . We confirm that Feshbach resonances in this system are solely the result of a weak separation-dependent hyperfine coupling between the electronic spin of Li 6 and the nuclear spin of Yb 173 . Our analysis also shows that three-body recombination rates are controlled by the identical fermion nature of the mixture, even in the presence of s -wave collisions between the two species and with recombination rate coefficients outside the Wigner threshold regime at our lowest temperature. Specifically, a comparison of experimental and theoretical line shapes of the recombination process indicates that the characteristic asymmetric line shape as a function of applied magnetic field and a maximum recombination rate coefficient that is independent of temperature can only be explained by triatomic collisions with nonzero, p -wave total orbital angular momentum. The resonances can be used to form ultracold doublet ground-state molecules and to simulate quantum superfluidity in mass-imbalanced mixtures.},

  abstract     = {We study the energy and entanglement dynamics of ( 1 + 1 ) D conformal field theories (CFTs) under a Floquet drive with the sine-square deformed (SSD) Hamiltonian. Previous work has shown that this model supports both a nonheating and a heating phase. Here, we analytically establish several robust and “superuniversal” features of the heating phase which rely on conformal invariance but not on the details of the CFT involved. First, we show the energy density is concentrated in two peaks in real space, a chiral and an antichiral peak, which leads to an exponential growth in the total energy. The peak locations are set by fixed points of the Möbius transformation. Second, all of the quantum entanglement is shared between these two peaks. In each driving period, a number of Bell pairs are generated, with one member pumped to the chiral peak and the other member pumped to the antichiral peak. These Bell pairs are localized, accumulate at these two peaks, and can serve as a source of quantum entanglement. Third, in both the heating and nonheating phases, we find that the total energy is related to the half system entanglement entropy by a simple relation E ( t ) ∝ c exp [ ( 6 / c ) S ( t ) ] with c being the central charge. In addition, we show that the nonheating phase, in which the energy and entanglement oscillate in time, is unstable to small fluctuations of the driving frequency in contrast to the heating phase. Finally, we point out an analogy to the periodically driven harmonic oscillator which allows us to understand global features of the phases and introduce a quasiparticle picture to explain the spatial structure, which can be generalized to setups beyond the SSD construction.},

Nowadays, the metasurface allows one to build on-chip devices that efficiently manipulate the polarization states. However, it remains challenging to generate different types of polarization states simultaneously, which is required to encode information for quantum computing and quantum cryptography applications. By introducing geometrical-scaling-induced (GSI) phase modulations, we demonstrate that an assembly of circularly polarized ( C P ) and linearly polarized (LP) states can be simultaneously generated by a single metasurface made of L -shaped resonators with different geometrical features. Upon illumination, each resonator diffracts the C P state with a certain GSI phase. The interaction of these diffractions leads to the desired output beams, where the polarization state and the propagation direction can be accurately tuned by selecting the geometrical shape, size, and spatial sequence of each resonator in the unit cell. As an example of potential applications, we show that an image can be encoded with different polarization profiles at different diffraction orders and decoded with a polarization analyzer. This approach resolves a challenging problem in integrated optics and is inspiring for on-chip quantum information processing.},

  abstract     = {In magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), electron-electron interactions play a central role, resulting in correlated insulating states at certain integer fillings. Identifying the nature of these insulators is a central question, and it is potentially linked to the relatively high-temperature superconductivity observed in the same devices. Here, we address this question using a combination of analytical strong-coupling arguments and a comprehensive Hartree-Fock numerical calculation, which includes the effect of remote bands. The ground state we obtain at charge neutrality is an unusual ordered state, which we call the Kramers intervalley-coherent (K-IVC) insulator. In its simplest form, the K-IVC order exhibits a pattern of alternating circulating currents that triples the graphene unit cell, leading to an “orbital magnetization density wave.” Although translation and time-reversal symmetry are broken, a combined “Kramers” time-reversal symmetry is preserved. Our analytic arguments are built on first identifying an approximate U ( 4 ) × U ( 4 ) symmetry, resulting from the remarkable properties of the TBG band structure, which helps select a low-energy manifold of states that are further split to favor the K-IVC state. This low-energy manifold is also found in the Hartree-Fock numerical calculation. We show that symmetry-lowering perturbations can stabilize other insulators and the semimetallic state, and we discuss the ground state at half-filling and give a comparison with experiments.},

Determination of its intrinsic electronic structure is crucial to understanding its physical properties and superconductivity mechanism. Both theoretical and experimental studies so far have provided a picture that FeSe consists of one holelike Fermi surface around the Brillouin zone center in its nematic state. Here we report direct observation of two holelike Fermi surface sheets around the Brillouin zone center, and the splitting of the associated bands, in the nematic state of FeSe by taking high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements. These results indicate that, in addition to nematic order and spin-orbit coupling, there is an additional order in FeSe that breaks either inversion or time-reversal symmetries. The new Fermi surface topology asks for reexamination of the existing theoretical and experimental understanding of FeSe and stimulates further efforts to identify the origin of the hidden order in its nematic state.},

Because of its large critical current density compared to typical Josephson junctions, its resilience to external magnetic fields, and its low dissipation, grAl may also provide a robust source of nonlinearity for strongly driven quantum circuits, topological superconductivity, and hybrid systems. Having said that, can the grAl nonlinearity be sufficient to build a qubit? Here we show that a small grAl volume ( 10 × 200 × 500 nm 3 ) shunted by a thin film aluminum capacitor results in a microwave oscillator with anharmonicity α two orders of magnitude larger than its spectral linewidth Γ 01 , effectively forming a transmon qubit. With increasing drive power, we observe several multiphoton transitions starting from the ground state, from which we extract α = 2 π × 4.48 MHz . Resonance fluorescence measurements of the | 0 ⟩ → | 1 ⟩ transition yield an intrinsic qubit linewidth γ = 2 π × 10 kHz , corresponding to a lifetime of 16 μ s , as confirmed by pulsed time-domain measurements. This linewidth remains below 2 π × 150 kHz for in-plane magnetic fields up to ∼ 70 mT .},

The outgoing SPDC beams are recorded on two separate detector arrays operating in the photon-counting regime. The properties of HOM interference are investigated both in the time and space domains. We show that the two-photon interference exhibits temporal and two-dimensional spatial HOM dips with visibilities of 60\% and widths in good agreement with the spatiotemporal coherence properties of the biphoton state. Moreover, we demonstrate that maxima of momentum spatial coincidences are evidenced within each image, in correspondence with these dips.},

The photonic chip transmitters integrate the necessary encoding components for a standard QKD source. We implement random modulations of polarization states and decoy intensities, and demonstrate a finite-key secret rate of 31 bit / s over 36-dB channel loss (or 180-km standard fiber). This key rate is higher than state-of-the-art MDI QKD experiments.

  abstract     = {Seeing and recognizing an object whose size is much smaller than the illumination wavelength is a challenging task for an observer placed in the far field, due to the diffraction limit. Recent advances in near- and far-field microscopy have offered several ways to overcome this limitation; however, they often use invasive markers and require intricate equipment with complicated image postprocessing. On the other hand, a simple marker-free solution for high-resolution imaging may be found by exploiting resonant metamaterial lenses that can convert the subwavelength image information contained in the near field of the object to propagating field components that can reach the far field. Unfortunately, resonant metalenses are inevitably sensitive to absorption losses, which has so far largely hindered their practical applications. Here, we solve this vexing problem and show that this limitation can be turned into an advantage when metalenses are combined with deep learning techniques. We demonstrate that combining deep learning with lossy metalenses allows recognizing and imaging largely subwavelength features directly from the far field. Our acoustic learning experiment shows that, despite being 30 times smaller than the wavelength of sound, the fine details of images can be successfully reconstructed and recognized in the far field, which is crucially favored by the presence of absorption. We envision applications in acoustic image analysis, feature detection, object classification, or as a novel noninvasive acoustic sensing tool in biomedical applications.},

Notably, the large optical gap achieved by photoexcitation is not observed in the equilibrium superconductor, pointing to a light-induced state that is different from that obtained by cooling.

This approach involves placing arrays of microstructured electrodes defining static electric quadrupole sites in a magnetic field, with single ions trapped at each site and coupled to neighbors via the Coulomb interaction. We solve for the normal modes of ion motion in such arrays and derive a generalized multi-ion invariance theorem for stable motion even in the presence of trap imperfections. We use these techniques to investigate the feasibility of quantum simulation and quantum computation in fixed ion lattices. In homogeneous arrays, we show that sufficiently dense arrays are achievable, with axial, magnetron, and cyclotron motions exhibiting interion dipolar coupling with rates significantly higher than expected decoherence. With the addition of laser fields, these can realize tunable-range interacting spin Hamiltonians. We also show how local control of potentials allows isolation of small numbers of ions in a fixed array and can be used to implement high-fidelity gates. The use of static trapping fields means that our approach is not limited by power requirements as the system size increases, removing a major challenge for scaling which is present in standard radio-frequency traps. Thus, the architecture and methods provided here appear to open a path for trapped-ion quantum computing to reach fault-tolerant scale devices.},

In this respect, such models more closely resemble spin glasses. We demonstrate this by two means: first, a general theorem proving that the annealed free energy is divergent at low temperature in any model with a tensor product Hilbert space, and second, a replica treatment of two prominent examples which exhibit phase transitions from an “annealed” phase to a “nonannealed” phase as a function of the temperature. We further show that this effect appears only at O ( N ) th order in a 1 / N expansion, even though lower-order terms misleadingly seem to converge. Our results prove that the nonbosonic nature of the particles in the SYK model is an essential ingredient for its physics, highlight connections between local models and spin glasses, and raise important questions as to the role of fermions and/or glassiness in holography.},

We present a study of electric resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, and inelastic neutron scattering extended to very high temperatures, which deepens the puzzle. Metallic resistivity persists up to 900 K and is accompanied by a large Seebeck coefficient whose magnitude (as well as its temperature and doping dependence) indicates that carriers are becoming heavier with rising temperature. Combining this with neutron scattering data, we find that between 500 and 900 K the Bohr radius and the electron wavelength become comparable to each other and twice the lattice parameter. According to our results, between 100 and 500 K, metallicity is partially driven by temperature-induced amplification of the carrier mass. We contrast this mass amplification of nondegenerate electrons with the better-known case of heavy degenerate electrons. Above 500 K, the mean-free path continues to shrink with warming in spite of becoming shorter than both the interatomic distance and the thermal wavelength of the electrons. The latter saturates to twice the lattice parameter. Available theories of polaronic quasiparticles do not provide satisfactory explanation for our observations.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the collective dynamics of nonlinearly interacting modes in multimode photonic settings. To this end, we have established a connection with the theory of spin networks. The emerging “photonic spins” are complex, soft (their size is not fixed), and their dynamics has two constants of motion. Our analysis sheds light on the nature of the thermal equilibrium states and reveals the existence of optical phase transitions which resemble a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic and to a spin-glass phase transition occurring in spin networks. We show that, for fixed optical power, these transitions are driven by the type of the network connectivity, its coordination number, and the total energy of the optical signal. In strictly one-dimensional photonic networks we establish a universal one-parameter scaling that dictates the crossover from a (quasi)ferromagnetic phase to a paramagnetic phase.},

  abstract     = {In the study of quantum limits to parameter estimation, the high dimensionality of the density operator and that of the unknown parameters have long been two of the most difficult challenges. Here, we propose a theory of quantum semiparametric estimation that can circumvent both challenges and produce simple analytic bounds for a class of problems in which the dimensions are arbitrarily high, few prior assumptions about the density operator are made, but only a finite number of the unknown parameters are of interest. We also relate our bounds to Holevo’s version of the quantum Cramér-Rao bound, so that they can inherit the asymptotic attainability of the latter in many cases of interest. The theory is especially relevant to the estimation of a parameter that can be expressed as a function of the density operator, such as the expectation value of an observable, the fidelity to a pure state, the purity, or the von Neumann entropy. Potential applications include quantum state characterization for many-body systems, optical imaging, and interferometry, where full tomography of the quantum state is often infeasible and only a few select properties of the system are of interest.},

We calculate vibrational branching ratios for a diverse set of asymmetric top molecules and find that many species within a broad class of molecules can be effectively cooled with a manageable number of lasers. We also describe methods to achieve rotationally closed optical cycles in ATMs. Despite significant structural complexity, laser cooling can be made effective by using extensions of the current techniques for linear molecules.

  abstract     = {We study properties of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) eigenmodes by decomposing the data of MHD simulations into linear MHD modes—namely, the Alfvén, slow magnetosonic, and fast magnetosonic modes. We drive turbulence with a mixture of solenoidal and compressive driving while varying the Alfvén Mach number ( M A ), plasma β , and the sonic Mach number from subsonic to transsonic. We find that the proportion of fast and slow modes in the mode mixture increases with increasing compressive forcing. This proportion of the magnetosonic modes can also become the dominant fraction in the mode mixture. The anisotropy of the modes is analyzed by means of their structure functions. The Alfvén-mode anisotropy is consistent with the Goldreich-Sridhar theory. We find a transition from weak to strong Alfvénic turbulence as we go from low to high M A . The slow-mode properties are similar to the Alfvén mode. On the other hand, the isotropic nature of fast modes is verified in the cases where the fast mode is a significant fraction of the mode mixture. The fast-mode behavior does not show any transition in going from low to high M A . We find indications that there is some interaction between the different modes, and the properties of the dominant mode can affect the properties of the weaker modes. This work identifies the conditions under which magnetosonic modes can be a major fraction of turbulent astrophysical plasmas, including the regime of weak turbulence. Important astrophysical implications for cosmic-ray transport and magnetic reconnection are discussed.},

Here, by substituting Pt for a perpendicularly magnetized Pt / Co / Pt spin sink, we are able to demonstrate the role of SOC and show that pure spin supercurrent pumping efficiency across Nb is tunable by controlling the magnetization direction of Co. By inserting a Cu spacer with weak SOC between Nb and Pt / ( Co / Pt ) spin sink, we also prove that Rashba-type SOC is key for forming and transmitting pure spin supercurrents across Nb. Finally, by engineering these properties within a single multilayer structure, we demonstrate a prototype superconductor spin-wave device in which lateral spin-wave propagation is gateable via the opening or closing of a vertical pure spin supercurrent channel in Nb.},

  abstract     = {The performance characteristics of magnetic nanoparticles toward application, e.g., in medicine and imaging or as sensors, are directly determined by their magnetization relaxation and total magnetic moment. In the commonly assumed picture, nanoparticles have a constant overall magnetic moment originating from the magnetization of the single-domain particle core surrounded by a surface region hosting spin disorder. In contrast, this work demonstrates the significant increase of the magnetic moment of ferrite nanoparticles with an applied magnetic field. At low magnetic field, the homogeneously magnetized particle core initially coincides in size with the structurally coherent grain of 12.8(2) nm diameter, indicating a strong coupling between magnetic and structural disorder. Applied magnetic fields gradually polarize the uncorrelated, disordered surface spins, resulting in a magnetic volume more than 20\% larger than the structurally coherent core. The intraparticle magnetic disorder energy increases sharply toward the defect-rich surface as established by the field dependence of the magnetization distribution. In consequence, these findings illustrate how the nanoparticle magnetization overcomes structural surface disorder. This new concept of intraparticle magnetization is deployable to other magnetic nanoparticle systems, where the in-depth knowledge of spin disorder and associated magnetic anisotropies are decisive for a rational nanomaterials design.},

Limited experimental access to the configurational degrees of freedom results in data that appear to be generated by a non-Markovian process. This limitation poses a challenge in the quantitative reconstruction of the model from experimental data, even in the simple case of equilibrium Langevin dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. We develop a novel Bayesian inference approach to learn the parameters of such stochastic effective models from discrete finite-length trajectories. We first discuss the failure of naive inference approaches based on the estimation of derivatives through finite differences, regardless of the time resolution and the length of the sampled trajectories. We then derive, adopting higher-order discretization schemes, maximum-likelihood estimators for the model parameters that provide excellent results even with moderately long trajectories. We apply our method to second-order models of collective motion and show that our results also hold in the presence of interactions.},

The nature of such correlations has been a central question ever since the discovery of cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Despite unprecedented effort and tremendous progress in understanding the properties of this fundamental model, a definitive answer to whether the ground state is superconducting in the parameter regime most relevant to cuprates has proved exceedingly difficult to establish. In this work, we employ two complementary, state-of-the-art, many-body computational methods—constrained-path (CP) auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods—deploying the most recent algorithmic advances in each. Systematic and detailed comparisons between the two methods are performed. The DMRG is extremely reliable on small width cylinders, where we use it to validate the AFQMC. The AFQMC is then used to study wide systems as well as fully periodic systems, to establish that we have reached the thermodynamic limit. The ground state is found to be nonsuperconducting in the moderate to strong coupling regime in the vicinity of optimal hole doping.},

Considering heat engines based on such speed-ups, we show that the corresponding efficiency at maximum power interpolates between the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency for α = 0 and the Carnot efficiency for α → ∞ . Analogous enhancements are obtained for the coefficient of performance of refrigerators. We confirm our analytical results with two numerical examples where α = 1 / 2 , namely the time-dependent Caldeira-Leggett and resonant-level models, with strong system-environment correlations taken fully into account.

However, the surface-bulk correspondence of the Mn-Bi-Te family, composed by the superlatticelike MnBi 2 Te 4 / ( Bi 2 Te 3 ) n ( n = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 … ) layered structure, remains intriguing but elusive. Here, by using scanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techniques, we unambiguously assign the two distinct surface states of MnBi 4 Te 7 ( n = 1 ) to the quintuple-layer (QL) Bi 2 Te 3 termination and the septuple-layer (SL) MnBi 2 Te 4 termination, respectively. A comparison of the experimental observations with theoretical calculations reveals diverging topological behaviors, especially the hybridization effect between the QL and SL, on the two terminations. We identify a gap on the QL termination, originating from the hybridization between the topological surface states of the QL and the bands of the SL beneath, and a gapless Dirac-cone band structure on the SL termination with time-reversal symmetry. The quasiparticle interference patterns further confirm the topological nature of the surface states for both terminations, continuing far above the Fermi energy. The QL termination carries a spin-helical Dirac state with hexagonal warping, while at the SL termination, a strongly canted helical state from the surface lies between a pair of Rashba-like splitting bands from its neighboring layer. Our work elucidates an unprecedented hybridization effect between the building blocks of the topological surface states and also reveals the termination-dependent time-reversal symmetry breaking in a magnetic topological insulator.},

  abstract     = {Soft colloids are increasingly used as model systems to address fundamental issues such as crystallization and the glass and jamming transitions. Among the available classes of soft colloids, microgels are emerging as the gold standard. Since their great internal complexity makes their theoretical characterization very hard, microgels are commonly modeled, at least in the small-deformation regime, within the simple framework of linear elasticity theory. Here we show that there exist conditions where its range of validity can be greatly extended, providing strong numerical evidence that microgels adsorbed at an interface follow the two-dimensional Hertzian theory, and hence behave like 2D elastic particles, up to very large deformations, in stark contrast to what found in bulk conditions. We are also able to estimate Young’s modulus of the individual particles and, by comparing it with its counterpart in bulk conditions, we demonstrate a significant stiffening of the polymer network at the interface. Finally, by analyzing dynamical properties, we predict multiple reentrant phenomena: By a continuous increase of particle density, microgels first arrest and then refluidify due to the high penetrability of their extended coronas. We observe this anomalous behavior in a range of experimentally accessible conditions for small and loosely cross-linked microgels. The present work thus establishes microgels at interfaces as a new model system for fundamental investigations, paving the way for the experimental synthesis and research on unique high-density liquidlike states. In addition, these results can guide the development of novel assembly and patterning strategies on surfaces and the design of novel materials with desired interfacial behavior.},

  abstract     = {We theoretically study the few- and many-body dynamics of photons in chiral waveguides. In particular, we examine pulse propagation through an ensemble of N two-level systems chirally coupled to a waveguide. We show that the system supports correlated multiphoton bound states, which have a well-defined photon number n and propagate through the system with a group delay scaling as 1 / n 2 . This has the interesting consequence that, during propagation, an incident coherent-state pulse breaks up into different bound-state components that can become spatially separated at the output in a sufficiently long system. For sufficiently many photons and sufficiently short systems, we show that linear combinations of n -body bound states recover the well-known phenomenon of mean-field solitons in self-induced transparency. Our work thus covers the entire spectrum from few-photon quantum propagation, to genuine quantum many-body (atom and photon) phenomena, and ultimately the quantum-to-classical transition. Finally, we demonstrate that the bound states can undergo elastic scattering with additional photons. Together, our results demonstrate that photon bound states are truly distinct physical objects emerging from the most elementary light-matter interaction between photons and two-level emitters. Our work opens the door to studying quantum many-body physics and soliton physics with photons in chiral waveguide QED.},

Outside the light cone, the amount of information rapidly decays with distance. When systems have long-range interactions, it is highly nontrivial whether such a linear light cone exists. Herein, we consider generic long-range interacting systems with decaying interactions, such as R − α with distance R . We prove the existence of the linear light cone for α &gt; 2 D + 1 ( D , the spatial dimension), where we obtain the Lieb-Robinson bound as ∥ [ O i ( t ) , O j ] ∥ ≲ t 2 D + 1 ( R − v ¯ t ) − α with v ¯ = O ( 1 ) for two arbitrary operators O i and O j separated by a distance R . Moreover, we provide an explicit quantum-state transfer protocol that achieves the above bound up to a constant coefficient and violates the linear light cone for α 2 D + 1 , our result characterizes the best general constraints on the information spreading.},

  abstract     = {In quantum many-body systems with local interactions, quantum information and entanglement cannot spread outside of a linear light cone , which expands at an emergent velocity analogous to the speed of light. Local operations at sufficiently separated spacetime points approximately commute—given a many-body state | ψ ⟩ , O x ( t ) O y | ψ ⟩ ≈ O y O x ( t ) | ψ ⟩ with arbitrarily small errors—so long as | x − y | ≳ v t , where v is finite. Yet, most nonrelativistic physical systems realized in nature have long-range interactions: Two degrees of freedom separated by a distance r interact with potential energy V ( r ) ∝ 1 / r α . In systems with long-range interactions, we rigorously establish a hierarchy of linear light cones : At the same α , some quantum information processing tasks are constrained by a linear light cone, while others are not. In one spatial dimension, this linear light cone exists for every many-body state | ψ ⟩ when α &gt; 3 (Lieb-Robinson light cone); for a typical state | ψ ⟩ chosen uniformly at random from the Hilbert space when α &gt; 5 2 (Frobenius light cone); and for every state of a noninteracting system when α &gt; 2 (free light cone). These bounds apply to time-dependent systems and are optimal up to subalgebraic improvements. Our theorems regarding the Lieb-Robinson and free light cones—and their tightness—also generalize to arbitrary dimensions. We discuss the implications of our bounds on the growth of connected correlators and of topological order, the clustering of correlations in gapped systems, and the digital simulation of systems with long-range interactions. In addition, we show that universal quantum state transfer, as well as many-body quantum chaos, is bounded by the Frobenius light cone and, therefore, is poorly constrained by all Lieb-Robinson bounds.},

Furthermore, we apply the anomaly-based formulation to the constraints on a half-filled spinless fermion on a square lattice with π flux, utilizing a time-reversal, magnetic translations and an on-site internal U ( N ) symmetries. This demonstrates the role of the time-reversal anomaly on the ingappabilities of a lattice model. Moreover, by our new boundary condition, we show that the many-body Chern number of this lattice model is nonvanishing as N mod 2 N in the presence of U ( N ) and magnetic translations.

In this work, we describe a novel mechanism for realizing electron optics in two dimensions. By studying a two-dimensional Fabry-Perot interferometer based on a resonant cavity formed in an InAs/GaSb double quantum well using p − n junctions, we establish that electron-hole hybridization in band-inverted systems can facilitate coherent interference.

Although so far unrealized, extended Heisenberg spin chains can enable long-distance quantum information transfer and the generation of nonequilibrium quantum states. In this work, we implement simultaneous, coherent exchange coupling between all nearest-neighbor pairs of spins in a quadruple quantum dot. The main challenge in implementing simultaneous exchange couplings is the nonlinear and nonlocal dependence of the exchange couplings on gate voltages. Through a combination of electrostatic simulation and theoretical modeling, we show that this challenge arises primarily due to lateral shifts of the quantum dots during gate pulses. Building on this insight, we develop two models that can be used to predict the confinement gate voltages for a desired set of exchange couplings. Although the model parameters depend on the number of exchange couplings desired (suggesting that effects in addition to lateral wave-function shifts are important), the models are sufficient to enable simultaneous and independent control of all three exchange couplings in a quadruple quantum dot. We demonstrate two-, three-, and four-spin exchange oscillations, and our data agree with simulations.},

The proper description of the heat dissipated in each resistor requires care within the white-noise idealization as it depends on the network topology. Our theory provides the basis to design circuits-based thermal machines, as we illustrate by designing a refrigerator using a simple driven circuit. We also derive exact results for the low-temperature regime in which the quantum nature of the electrical noise must be taken into account. We do so using a semiclassical approach, which can be shown to coincide with a fully quantum treatment of linear circuits for which canonical quantization is possible. We use this approach to generalize the Landauer-Büttiker formula for energy currents to arbitrary time-dependent driving protocols.},

Our results are, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental observation of energy transfer from dc current to plasmons leading to THz amplification. Additionally, we present a simple model offering a phenomenological description of the observed THz amplification. This model shows that in the presence of a dc current the radiation-induced correction to dissipation is sensitive to the phase shift between oscillations of carrier density and drift velocity. And, with an increasing current, the dissipation becomes negative, leading to amplification. The experimental results of this work, as all obtained at room-temperature, pave the way toward the new 2D plasmon-based, voltage-tunable THz radiation amplifiers.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel one-way quantum repeater architecture based on photonic tree-cluster states. Encoding a qubit in a photonic tree cluster protects the information from transmission loss and enables long-range quantum communication through a chain of repeater stations. As opposed to conventional approaches that are limited by the two-way communication time, the overall transmission rate of the current quantum repeater protocol is determined by the local processing time enabling very high communication rates. We further show that such a repeater can be constructed with as little as two stationary qubits and one quantum emitter per repeater station, which significantly increases the experimental feasibility. We discuss potential implementations with diamond defect centers and semiconductor quantum dots efficiently coupled to photonic nanostructures and outline how such systems may be integrated into repeater stations.},

  abstract     = {High-spin states play a key role in chemical reactions found in nature. In artificial molecular systems, singlet fission produces a correlated triplet-pair state, a spin-bearing excited state that can be harnessed for more efficient solar-energy conversion and photocatalysis. In particular, triplet-pair states with overall quintet character (total spin S = 2 ) have been discovered, but many of the fundamental properties of these biexciton states remain unexplored. The net spin of these pair states makes spin-sensitive probes attractive for their characterization. Combined with their surprisingly long spin coherence (of order microseconds), this opens up techniques relying on coherent spin control. Here we apply coherent manipulation of triplet-pair states to (i) isolate their spectral signatures from coexisting free triplets and (ii) selectively couple quintet and triplet states to specific nuclear spins. Using this approach, we separate quintet and triplet transitions and extract the relaxation dynamics and hyperfine couplings of the fission-borne spin states. Our results highlight the distinct properties of correlated and free triplet excitons and demonstrate optically induced nuclear spin polarization by singlet fission.},

  abstract     = {Multilayer networks preserve full information about the different interactions among the constituents of a complex system, and have recently proven quite useful in modeling transportation networks, social circles, and the human brain. A fundamental and still open problem is to assess if and when the multilayer representation of a system provides a qualitatively better model than the classical single-layer aggregated network. Here we tackle this problem from an algorithmic information theory perspective. We propose an intuitive way to encode a multilayer network into a bit string, and we define the complexity of a multilayer network as the ratio of the Kolmogorov complexity of the bit strings associated to the multilayer and to the corresponding aggregated graph. We find that there exists a maximum amount of additional information that a multilayer model can encode with respect to the equivalent single-layer graph. We show how our complexity measure can be used to obtain low-dimensional representations of multidimensional systems, to cluster multilayer networks into a small set of meaningful superfamilies, and to detect tipping points in the evolution of different time-varying multilayer graphs. Interestingly, the low-dimensional multiplex networks obtained with the proposed method also retain most of the dynamical properties of the original systems, as demonstrated for instance by the preservation of the epidemic threshold in the multiplex susceptible-infected-susceptible model. These results suggest that information-theoretic approaches can be effectively employed for a more systematic analysis of static and time-varying multidimensional complex systems.},

  abstract     = {The interaction-energy landscapes (ELs) and magnetization dynamics of two-dimensional ensembles of dipole-coupled magnetic nanoparticles are theoretically investigated. Extended nanostructures are modeled by considering nonoverlapping nanoparticles (NPs) in a square unit cell with periodic boundary conditions. The local minima and connecting transition states of the EL are determined systematically for representative NP arrangements having different degrees of disorder. The topology of the ergodic networks of stationary points is analyzed from both local and energy perspectives by using kinetic networks and disconnectivity graphs. We show that increasing the degree of disorder not only increases, most significantly, the number of local minima and transition states but also changes the shape of the EL in a very profound way. While slightly disordered ensembles correspond to good structure seekers, which are funneled towards the global minima, strongly disordered systems show very rough landscapes with multiple low-energy local minima separated by relatively large energy barriers. The consequences of this transition on the long-time Markovian dynamics of the nanostructures are quantified by calculating the field-free magnetic relaxation after saturation and after quenching. The simulations indicate that the relaxation of weakly disordered systems follows a slightly stretched exponential law, with a single characteristic timescale for a wide range of temperatures. In contrast, strongly disordered systems show a much more complicated relaxation dynamics involving multiple timescales, slowing down and trapping, which is reminiscent of spin glasses.},

  abstract     = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm designed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. Despite its promise for near-term quantum applications, not much is currently understood about the QAOA’s performance beyond its lowest-depth variant. An essential but missing ingredient for understanding and deploying the QAOA is a constructive approach to carry out the outer-loop classical optimization. We provide an in-depth study of the performance of the QAOA on MaxCut problems by developing an efficient parameter-optimization procedure and revealing its ability to exploit nonadiabatic operations. Building on observed patterns in optimal parameters, we propose heuristic strategies for initializing optimizations to find quasioptimal p -level QAOA parameters in O [ poly ( p ) ] time, whereas the standard strategy of random initialization requires 2 O ( p ) optimization runs to achieve similar performance. We then benchmark the QAOA and compare it with quantum annealing, especially on difficult instances where adiabatic quantum annealing fails due to small spectral gaps. The comparison reveals that the QAOA can learn via optimization to utilize nonadiabatic mechanisms to circumvent the challenges associated with vanishing spectral gaps. Finally, we provide a realistic resource analysis on the experimental implementation of the QAOA. When quantum fluctuations in measurements are accounted for, we illustrate that optimization is important only for problem sizes beyond numerical simulations but accessible on near-term devices. We propose a feasible implementation of large MaxCut problems with a few hundred vertices in a system of 2D neutral atoms, reaching the regime to challenge the best classical algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Because of the broken time-translation symmetry, in periodically driven vibrational systems fluctuations of different vibration components have different intensities. Fluctuations of one of the components are often squeezed, whereas fluctuations of the other component, which is shifted in phase by π / 2 , are increased. Squeezing is a multifaceted phenomenon; it attracts much attention from the perspective of high-precision measurements. Here we demonstrate a new and hitherto unappreciated side of squeezing: its direct manifestation in the spectra of driven vibrational systems. With a weakly damped nanomechanical resonator, we study the spectrum of thermal fluctuations of a resonantly driven nonlinear mode. In the attained sideband-resolved regime, we show that the asymmetry of the spectrum directly characterizes the squeezing. This opens a way to deduce squeezing of thermal fluctuations in strongly underdamped resonators, for which a direct determination by a standard homodyne measurement is impeded by frequency fluctuations. The experimental and theoretical results are in excellent agreement. We further extend the theory to also describe the spectral manifestation of squeezing of quantum fluctuations.},

De facto , the active turbulence naming suggests a connection with a second seminal class of out-of-equilibrium systems, inertial turbulence, even though the latter is of very different nature with energy injected at global system scale rather than at the elementary scale of single constituents. Indeed, the existence of a possible strong tie between active and canonical turbulence remains an open question and a field of profuse research. Using an assembly of self-propelled interfacial particles, we show experimentally that the statistical properties of particles’ velocities display a turbulentlike behavior, as described by the celebrated 1941 phenomenology of Kolmogorov. Moreover, the analogy between the dynamics of the self-propelled particles and inertial turbulence is observed to hold consistently both in the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks. Unlike the swimmers’ velocities distribution, the subsurface fluid flow is found not turbulent, thus making Marangoni surfers’ assemblies different from other active systems generating turbulence, such as living matter. Identifying an active system in the universality class of inertial turbulence not only benefits its future development but may also provide new insights into the long-standing description of turbulent flows, arguably one of the biggest remaining mysteries in classical physics.},

Unfortunately, current tools to detect relevant quantum properties of quantum states, such as entanglement and Bell nonlocality, suffer from severe scalability issues and can be computed only for systems of a very modest size of around six sites. In order to address large many-body systems, we propose a renormalization-type approach based on a class of local linear transformations called connectors , which can be used to coarse grain the system in a way that preserves the property under investigation. Repeated coarse graining produces a system of manageable size, whose properties can then be explored by means of the usual techniques for small systems. In the case of a successful detection of the desired property, the method outputs a linear witness which admits an exact tensor network representation composed of connectors. We demonstrate the power of our method by certifying entanglement, Bell nonlocality, and supraquantum Bell nonlocality in systems with hundreds of sites using a normal desktop computer.},

  abstract     = {We show that the commonly used lowest-order theory of phonon-phonon interactions frequently fails to accurately describe the anharmonic phonon decay rates and thermal conductivity ( κ ), even among strongly bonded crystals. Applying a first-principles theory that includes both the lowest-order three-phonon and the higher-order four-phonon processes to 17 zinc blende semiconductors, we find that the lowest-order theory drastically overestimates the measured κ for many of these materials, while inclusion of four-phonon scattering gives significantly improved agreement with measurements. We identify new selection rules on three-phonon processes that help explain many of these failures in terms of anomalously weak anharmonic phonon decay rates predicted by the lowest-order theory competing with four-phonon processes. We also show that zinc blende compounds containing boron (B), carbon (C), or nitrogen (N) atoms have exceptionally weak four-phonon scattering, much weaker than in compounds that do not contain B, C, or N atoms. This new understanding helps explain the ultrahigh κ in several technologically important materials like cubic boron arsenide, boron phosphide, and silicon carbide. At the same time, it not only makes the possibility of achieving high κ in materials without B, C, or N atoms unlikely, but it also suggests that it may be necessary to include four-phonon processes in many future studies. Our work gives new insights into the nature of anharmonic processes in solids and demonstrates the broad importance of higher-order phonon-phonon interactions in assessing the thermal properties of materials.},

Our approach is motivated by the separation of energy scales in organic molecular crystals, in which electrons couple to high-frequency intramolecular Holstein modes and to low-frequency intermolecular Peierls modes. We treat Peierls modes as quasiclassical dynamic disorder, while Holstein modes are included with a Lang-Firsov polaron transformation and no narrow-band approximation. Our method reduces to the popular polaron picture due to Holstein coupling and the dynamic disorder picture due to Peierls coupling. We derive an expression for efficient numerical evaluation of the frequency-resolved optical conductivity based on the Kubo formula and obtain the dc mobility from its zero-frequency component. We also use our method to calculate the electron-addition Green’s function corresponding to the inverse photoemission spectrum. For realistic parameters, temperature-dependent dc mobility is largely determined by the Peierls-induced dynamic disorder with minor quantitative corrections due to polaronic band narrowing, and an activated regime is not observed at relevant temperatures. In contrast, for frequency-resolved observables, a quantum-mechanical treatment of the Holstein coupling is qualitatively important for capturing the phonon replica satellite structure.},

Both NdNiO 2 and CaCuO 2 are found to be charge transfer materials. Important differences include the proximity of the oxygen 2 p bands to the Fermi level, the bandwidth of the transition metal-derived 3 d bands, and the presence, in NdNiO 2 , of both Nd-derived 5 d states crossing the Fermi level and a van Hove singularity that crosses the Fermi level as the out-of-plane momentum is varied. The low-energy physics of NdNiO 2 is found to be that of a single Ni-derived correlated band, with additional accompanying weakly correlated bands of Nd-derived states that dope the Ni-derived band. The effective correlation strength of the Ni-derived d band crossing the Fermi level in NdNiO 2 is found to be greater than that of the Cu-derived d band in CaCuO 2 , but the predicted magnetic transition temperature of NdNiO 2 is substantially lower than that of CaCuO 2 because of the smaller bandwidth.},

For addressing systems with underlying bosonic structure, it is advantageous to utilize a naturally bosonic platform. Optical photons passing through linear networks may be configured to perform quantum simulation tasks, but the efficient preparation and detection of multiphoton quantum states of light in linear optical systems are challenging. Here, we experimentally implement a boson sampling protocol for simulating molecular vibronic spectra [J. Huh et al. , Nat. Photonics 9 , 615 (2015) ] in a two-mode superconducting device. In addition to enacting the requisite set of Gaussian operations across both modes, we fulfill the scalability requirement by demonstrating, for the first time in any platform, a high-fidelity single-shot photon number resolving detection scheme capable of resolving up to 15 photons per mode. Furthermore, we exercise the capability of synthesizing non-Gaussian input states to simulate spectra of molecular ensembles in vibrational excited states. We show the reprogrammability of our implementation by extracting the spectra of photoelectron processes in H 2 O , O 3 , NO 2 , and SO 2 . The capabilities highlighted in this work establish the superconducting architecture as a promising platform for bosonic simulations, and by combining them with tools such as Kerr interactions and engineered dissipation, enable the simulation of a wider class of bosonic systems.},

At 250 K, above the previously established temperature T CDW ≈ 200 K that signifies the onset of quasistatic short-range CDW order, we observe significant dynamic correlations that are broadly peaked at about 40 meV and centered at the two-dimensional wave vector q CDW . This energy scale is comparable to both the superconducting gap and the low-energy pseudogap. At 70 K, we observe a quasistatic CDW peak at q CDW , but the dynamic correlations around 40 meV remain virtually unchanged, and we identify a new feature: dynamic correlations well above the optic phonon range that are broadly peaked in the 150–200 meV range. A similar energy scale was previously identified in other experiments as a high-energy pseudogap. The observation of three distinct features in the charge response is highly unusual for a CDW system and suggests that charge order in the cuprates is complex. We demonstrate that other single-layer cuprates exhibit approximately the same relative strength of high- to low-temperature energy-integrated charge signal, which points to the universal existence of significant dynamic correlations. Intriguingly, the two energy scales identified here are also comparable to those of the superconducting glue function extracted from other spectroscopic techniques, consistent with a dual charge and magnetic nature of the pairing glue. We further determine the paramagnon dispersion along [1, 0], across q CDW , and find it to be consistent with magnetic excitations measured by inelastic neutron scattering. Unlike for some other cuprates, our result points to the absence of a discernible coupling between charge and magnetic excitations.},

  abstract     = {The precise engineering of quantum states, a basic prerequisite for technologies such as quantum-enhanced sensing or quantum computing, becomes more challenging with increasing dimension of the system Hilbert space. Standard preparation techniques then require a large number of operations or slow adiabatic evolution and give access to only a limited set of states. Here, we use quantum optimal control theory to overcome this problem and derive shaped radio-frequency pulses to experimentally navigate the Stark manifold of a Rydberg atom. We demonstrate that optimal control, beyond improving the fidelity of an existing protocol, also enables us to accurately generate a nonclassical superposition state that cannot be prepared with reasonable fidelity using standard techniques. Optimal control thus substantially enlarges the range of accessible states. Our joint experimental and theoretical work establishes quantum optimal control as a key tool for quantum engineering in complex Hilbert spaces.},

On a lattice, gauge invariance and gauge-invariant (plaquette) interactions involve (at least) four-body interactions that are challenging to realize. Here, we show that Rydberg atoms in configurable arrays realized in current tweezer experiments are the natural platform to realize scalable simulators of the Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonian—a 2D U(1) lattice gauge theory that describes quantum dimer and spin-ice dynamics. Using an electromagnetic duality, we implement the plaquette interactions as Rabi oscillations subject to Rydberg blockade. Remarkably, we show that by controlling the atom arrangement in the array we can engineer anisotropic interactions and generalized blockade conditions for spins built of atom pairs. We describe how to prepare the resonating valence bond and the crystal phases of the Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonian adiabatically and probe them and their quench dynamics by on-site measurements of their quantum correlations. We discuss the potential applications of our Rydberg simulator to lattice gauge theory and exotic spin models.},

As a consequence of this bound, we obtain a speed limit on the evolution of stochastic observables: Changing the average of an observable requires a minimum amount of time given by the change in the average squared, divided by the fluctuations of the observable times the thermodynamic cost of the transformation. In particular, for relaxation dynamics, which do not depend on time explicitly, we show that the Fisher information is a monotonically decreasing function of time and that the minimal required time is determined by the initial preparation of the system. We further show that the monotonicity of the Fisher information can be used to detect hidden variables in the system and demonstrate our findings for simple examples of continuous and discrete random processes.},

  abstract     = {Using the deterministic, on-demand generation of two entangled phonons, we demonstrate a quantum eraser protocol in a phononic interferometer where the which-path information can be heralded during the interference process. Omitting the heralding step yields a clear interference pattern in the interfering half-quanta pathways; including the heralding step suppresses this pattern. If we erase the heralded information after the interference has been measured, the interference pattern is recovered, thereby implementing a delayed-choice quantum erasure. The test is implemented using a closed surface acoustic wave communication channel into which one superconducting qubit can emit itinerant phonons that the same or a second qubit can later recapture. If the first qubit releases only half of a phonon, the system follows a superposition of paths during the phonon propagation: either an itinerant phonon is in the channel or the first qubit remains in its excited state. These two paths are made to constructively or destructively interfere by changing the relative phase of the two intermediate states, resulting in a phase-dependent modulation of the first qubit’s final state, following interaction with the half-phonon. A heralding mechanism is added to this construct, entangling a heralding phonon with the signaling phonon. The first qubit emits a phonon herald conditioned on the qubit being in its excited state, with no signaling phonon, and the second qubit catches this heralding phonon, storing which-path information which can either be read out, destroying the signaling phonon’s self-interference, or erased.},

In this article, we show that adiabatic passage along the dark eigenstate of excitation exchange interactions can be used to implement fast multiqubit Toffoli ( C k -NOT) and fan-out (C- NOT k ) gates. This mechanism can be realized by simultaneous excitation of atoms to Rydberg levels, featuring resonant exchange interaction. Our theoretical estimates and numerical simulations show that these multiqubit Rydberg gates are possible with errors below 1\% for up to 20 qubits. The excitation exchange mechanism is ubiquitous across experimental platforms, and we show that similar multiqubit gates can be implemented in superconducting circuits.},

Because it typically relies on the weak magnetic fields produced by a small thermal nuclear spin polarization, NMR suffers from poor molecule-number sensitivity compared to other analytical techniques. Recently, a new class of NMR sensors based on optically probed nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum defects in diamond have allowed molecular spectroscopy from sample volumes several orders of magnitude smaller than the most sensitive inductive detectors. To date, however, NV NMR spectrometers have only been able to observe signals from pure, highly concentrated samples. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a technique that combines picoliter-scale NV NMR with fully integrated Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization to perform high-resolution spectroscopy on a variety of small molecules in dilute solution, with femtomole sensitivity. Our technique advances the state of the art of mass-limited NMR spectroscopy, opening the door to new applications at the picoliter scale in drug and natural-product discovery, catalysis research, and single-cell studies.},

By measuring the molecular-frame photoelectron emission patterns for a two-photon sequential K -shell ionization in coincidence with the fragment ions, and by sorting the data as a function of the measured kinetic energy release, we can resolve the elongation of the molecular bond by approximately 1.2 a.u. within the duration of the x-ray pulse.

  abstract     = {We study in detail the properties of the quantum East model, an interacting quantum spin chain inspired by simple kinetically constrained models of classical glasses. Through a combination of analytics, exact diagonalization, and tensor-network methods, we show the existence of a transition, from a fast to a slow thermalization regime, which manifests itself throughout the spectrum. On the slow side, by exploiting the localization of the ground state and the form of the Hamiltonian, we explicitly construct a large (exponential in size) number of nonthermal states that become exact finite-energy-density eigenstates in the large size limit, as expected for a true phase transition. A “superspin” generalization allows us to find a further large class of area-law states proved to display very slow relaxation. These states retain memory of their initial conditions for extremely long times. Our numerical analysis reveals that the localization properties are not limited to the ground state and that many eigenstates have large overlap with product states and can be approximated well by matrix product states at arbitrary energy densities. The mechanism that induces localization to the ground state, and hence the nonthermal behavior of the system, can be extended to a wide range of models including a number of simple spin chains. We discuss implications of our results for slow thermalization and nonergodicity more generally in disorder-free systems with constraints, and we give numerical evidence that these results may be extended to two-dimensional systems.},

The thermal conductivity of the fabricated aperiodic superlattice agrees well with the calculations over a temperature range of 77–300 K, indicating that complex aperiodic wave interference of coherent phonons can be controlled. The thermal conductivity of the aperiodic superlattice is significantly smaller than the conventional periodic superlattice due to enhanced phonon localization.

The interelement responses of this virtual array form a focused reflection matrix from which spatial maps of various characteristics of the propagating wave can be retrieved. Here we demonstrate (i) a local focusing criterion that enables the image quality and the wave velocity to be evaluated everywhere inside the medium, including in random speckle, and (ii) a highly resolved spatial mapping of the prevalence of multiple scattering, which constitutes a new and unique contrast for ultrasonic imaging.

These systems are composed of units which interact through intricate networks. The ability to predict sudden changes in the dynamics of these networks, known as critical transitions, from data is important to avert disastrous consequences of major disruptions. Predicting such changes is a major challenge as it requires forecasting the behavior for parameter ranges for which no data on the system are available. We address this issue for networks with weak individual interactions and chaotic local dynamics. We do this by building a model network, termed an effective network, consisting of the underlying local dynamics and a statistical description of their interactions. We show that behavior of such networks can be decomposed in terms of an emergent deterministic component and a fluctuation term. Traditionally, such fluctuations are filtered out. However, as we show, they are key to accessing the interaction structure. We illustrate this approach on synthetic time series of realistic neuronal interaction networks of the cat cerebral cortex and on experimental multivariate data of optoelectronic oscillators. We reconstruct the community structure by analyzing the stochastic fluctuations generated by the network and predict critical transitions for coupling parameters outside the observed range.},

  abstract     = {While a clean, driven system generically absorbs energy until it reaches “infinite temperature,” it may do so very slowly exhibiting what is known as a prethermal regime. Here, we show that the emergence of an additional approximately conserved quantity in a periodically driven (Floquet) system can give rise to an analogous long-lived regime. This can allow for nontrivial dynamics, even from initial states that are at a high or infinite temperature with respect to an effective Hamiltonian governing the prethermal dynamics. We present concrete settings with such a prethermal regime, one with a period-doubled (time-crystalline) response. We also present a direct diagnostic to distinguish this prethermal phenomenon from its infinitely long-lived many-body localized cousin. We apply these insights to a model of the recent NMR experiments by Rovny et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 , 180603 (2018) ] which, intriguingly, detected signatures of a Floquet time crystal in a clean three-dimensional material. We show that a mild but subtle variation of their driving protocol can increase the lifetime of the time-crystalline signal by orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {A lattice random walk is a mathematical representation of movement through random steps on a lattice at discrete times. It is commonly referred to as Pólya’s walk when the steps occur in either of the nearest-neighbor sites. Since Smoluchowski’s 1906 derivation of the spatiotemporal dependence of the walk occupation probability in an unbounded one-dimensional lattice, discrete random walks and their continuous counterpart, Brownian walks, have developed over the course of a century into a vast and versatile area of knowledge. Lattice random walks are now routinely employed to study stochastic processes across scales, dimensions, and disciplines, from the one-dimensional search of proteins along a DNA strand and the two-dimensional roaming of bacteria in a petri dish, to the three-dimensional motion of macromolecules inside cells and the spatial coverage of multiple robots in a disaster area. In these realistic scenarios, when the randomly moving object is constrained to remain within a finite domain, confined lattice random walks represent a powerful modeling tool. Somewhat surprisingly, and differently from Brownian walks, the spatiotemporal dependence of the confined lattice walk probability has been accessible mainly via computational techniques, and finding its analytic description has remained an open problem. Making use of a set of analytic combinatorics identities with Chebyshev polynomials, I develop a hierarchical dimensionality reduction to find the exact space and time dependence of the occupation probability for confined Pólya’s walks in arbitrary dimensions with reflective, periodic, absorbing, and mixed (reflective and absorbing) boundary conditions along each direction. The probability expressions allow one to construct the time dependence of derived quantities, explicitly in one dimension and via an integration in higher dimensions, such as the first-passage probability to a single target, return probability, average number of distinct sites visited, and absorption probability with imperfect traps. Exact mean first-passage time formulas to a single target in arbitrary dimensions are also presented. These formulas allow one to extend the so-called discrete pseudo-Green function formalism, employed to determine analytically mean first-passage time, with reflecting and periodic boundaries, and a wealth of other related quantities, to arbitrary dimensions. For multiple targets, I introduce a procedure to construct the time dependence of the first-passage probability to one of many targets. Reduction of the occupation probability expressions to the continuous time limit, the so-called continuous time random walk, and to the space-time continuous limit is also presented.},

  abstract     = {Periodic driving has emerged as a powerful tool in the quest to engineer new and exotic quantum phases. While driven many-body systems are generically expected to absorb energy indefinitely and reach an infinite-temperature state, the rate of heating can be exponentially suppressed when the drive frequency is large compared to the local energy scales of the system—leading to long-lived “prethermal” regimes. In this work, we experimentally study a bosonic cloud of ultracold atoms in a driven optical lattice and identify such a prethermal regime in the Bose-Hubbard model. By measuring the energy absorption of the cloud as the driving frequency is increased, we observe an exponential-in-frequency reduction of the heating rate persisting over more than 2 orders of magnitude. The tunability of the lattice potentials allows us to explore one- and two-dimensional systems in a range of different interacting regimes. Alongside the exponential decrease, the dependence of the heating rate on the frequency displays features characteristic of the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model, whose understanding is additionally supported by numerical simulations in one dimension. Our results show experimental evidence of the phenomenon of Floquet prethermalization and provide insight into the characterization of heating for driven bosonic systems.},

  abstract     = {Gauge theories are the cornerstone of our understanding of fundamental interactions among elementary particles. Their properties are often probed in dynamical experiments, such as those performed at ion colliders and high-intensity laser facilities. Describing the evolution of these strongly coupled systems is a formidable challenge for classical computers and represents one of the key open quests for quantum simulation approaches to particle physics phenomena. In this work, we show how recent experiments done on Rydberg atom chains naturally realize the real-time dynamics of a lattice gauge theory at system sizes at the boundary of classical computational methods. We prove that the constrained Hamiltonian dynamics induced by strong Rydberg interactions maps exactly onto the one of a U(1) lattice gauge theory. Building on this correspondence, we show that the recently observed anomalously slow dynamics corresponds to a string-inversion mechanism, reminiscent of the string breaking typically observed in gauge theories. This underlies the generality of this slow dynamics, which we illustrate in the context of one-dimensional quantum electrodynamics on the lattice. Within the same platform, we propose a set of experiments that generically show long-lived oscillations, including the evolution of particle-antiparticle pairs, and discuss how a tunable topological angle can be realized, further affecting the dynamics following a quench. Our work shows that the state of the art for quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is at 51 qubits and connects the recently observed slow dynamics in atomic systems to archetypal phenomena in particle physics.},

While they are often thought to be a heuristic construct, it has been established that this is in fact not the case. Here, we present a rigorous and formally exact analysis of generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) density-functional theory of hybrid functionals, in which exact remainder exchange-correlation potentials combine with a fraction of Fock exchange to produce the correct ground-state density. First, we extend formal GKS theory by proving a generalized adiabatic connection theorem. We then use this extension to derive two different definitions for a rigorous distinction between multiplicative exchange and correlation components—one new and one previously postulated. We examine their density-scaling behavior and discuss their similarities and differences. We then present a new algorithm for obtaining exact GKS potentials by inversion of accurate reference electron densities and employ this algorithm to obtain exact potentials for simple atoms and ions. We establish that an equivalent description of the many-electron problem is indeed obtained with any arbitrary global fraction of Fock exchange, and we rationalize the Fock-fraction dependence of the computed remainder exchange-correlation potentials in terms of the new formal theory. Finally, we use the exact theoretical framework and numerical results to shed light on the exchange-correlation potential used in approximate hybrid functional calculations and to assess the consequences of different choices of fractional exchange.},

Then we show that a simple geometrical arrangement, where the auxiliary and probe are crossing at 90° and the auxiliary is linearly s polarized (orthogonal to the plane of incidence), enables us to control the probe’s polarization even when its intensity exceeds the auxiliary’s intensity. These schemes are of particular interest when the nonlinear optical medium is a plasma, as it might enable dynamic polarization manipulations at ultrafast timescales and far beyond the optics damage threshold of crystal-based photonics devices.},

  abstract     = {Single photon detection is a key resource for sensing at the quantum limit and the enabling technology for measurement-based quantum computing. Photon detection at optical frequencies relies on irreversible photoassisted ionization of various natural materials. However, microwave photons have energies 5 orders of magnitude lower than optical photons, and are therefore ineffective at triggering measurable phenomena at macroscopic scales. Here, we report the observation of a new type of interaction between a single two-level system (qubit) and a microwave resonator. These two quantum systems do not interact coherently; instead, they share a common dissipative mechanism to a cold bath: the qubit irreversibly switches to its excited state if and only if a photon enters the resonator. We have used this highly correlated dissipation mechanism to detect itinerant photons impinging on the resonator. This scheme does not require any prior knowledge of the photon waveform nor its arrival time, and dominant decoherence mechanisms do not trigger spurious detection events (dark counts). We demonstrate a detection efficiency of 58\% and a record low dark count rate of 1.4 per millisecond. This work establishes engineered nonlinear dissipation as a key enabling resource for a new class of low-noise nonlinear microwave detectors.},

In a theory of quantum gravity, black holes must constitute ensembles of quantum microstates whose large number accounts for the entropy. We study this issue in the context of gravity with a negative cosmological constant. We exploit the most basic example of the holographic description of gravity ( AdS / CFT ): type IIB string theory on AdS 5 × S 5 , equivalent to maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. We thus resolve a long-standing question: Does the four-dimensional N = 4 SU ( N ) Super-Yang-Mills theory on S 3 at large N contain enough states to account for the entropy of rotating electrically charged supersymmetric black holes in 5D anti–de Sitter space? Our answer is positive. By reconsidering the large N limit of the superconformal index, using the so-called Bethe-ansatz formulation, we find an exponentially large contribution which exactly reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black holes. Besides, the large N limit exhibits a complicated structure, with many competing exponential contributions and Stokes lines, hinting at new physics. Our method opens the way toward a quantitative study of quantum properties of black holes in anti–de Sitter space.},

Our active metamaterial model can generate energy flows through an object in the absence of any temperature gradient. The nonreciprocal microscopic fluctuations responsible for generating the energy flows can further be used to power locomotion in, or exert forces on, a viscous fluid. Taken together, our analytical and numerical results elucidate how the geometry and interparticle interactions of the parity-violating material can couple with the nonequilibrium fluctuations of an active bath and enable rectification of energy and motion.},

Just like active colloids, their trajectories can be modeled with a constant velocity V and a slow angular diffusion, but the random changes in direction are not thermally driven. Instead, V is determined by the interfacial tension gradient along the droplet surface, while reorientation of the surfactant gradient leads to changes in direction with a persistence time τ . We show that the origin of locomotion is the difference in the critical micellar concentration in the front and the back of the droplet, Δ CMC . Tuning this parameter by salt controls V from 3 to 15 diameters d / s . Surfactant concentration has little effect on speed, but leads to a dramatic decrease in τ over 4 orders of magnitude. The corresponding range of the persistence length ℓ = V τ extends beyond the realm of synthetic or living swimmers, in which V is limited by fuel consumption and τ is set by thermal fluctuations or biological activity, respectively. Our tunable swimmers are ideal candidates for the study of the departure from equilibrium to high levels of activity.

  abstract     = {A Kitaev quantum spin liquid is a prime example of novel quantum magnetism of spin-orbit entangled pseudospin- 1 / 2 moments in a honeycomb lattice. Most candidate materials such as Na 2 IrO 3 have many competing exchange interactions beyond the minimal Kitaev-Heisenberg model whose small variations in the strength of the interactions produce huge differences in low-energy dynamics. Our incomplete knowledge of dynamic spin correlations hampers identification of a minimal model and quantification of the proximity to the Kitaev quantum spin-liquid phase. Here, we report momentum- and energy-resolved magnetic excitation spectra in a honeycomb lattice Na 2 IrO 3 measured using a resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectrometer capable of 12 meV resolution. Measured spectra at a low temperature show that the dynamic response lacks resolution-limited coherent spin waves in most parts of the Brillouin zone but has a discernible dispersion and spectral weight distribution within the energy window of 60 meV. A systematic investigation using the exact diagonalization method and direct comparison of high-resolution experimental spectra and theoretical simulations allow us to confine a parameter regime in which the extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model reasonably reproduces the main feature of the observed magnetic excitations. Hidden Kitaev quantum spin-liquid and Heisenberg phases found in the complex parameter space are used as references to propose the picture of renormalized magnons as explaining the incoherent nature of magnetic excitations. Magnetic excitation spectra are taken at elevated temperatures to follow the temperature evolution of the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering dynamic response in the paramagnetic state. Whereas the low-energy excitation progressively diminishes as the zigzag order disappears, the broad high-energy excitation maintains its spectral weight up to a much higher temperature of 160 K. We suggest that the dominant nearest-neighbor interactions keep short-range correlations up to quite high temperatures with a specific short-range dynamics which has a possible connection to a proximate spin-liquid phase.},

  abstract     = {We describe the phase diagram of electrons on a fully connected lattice with random hopping, subject to a random Heisenberg spin exchange interaction between any pair of sites and a constraint of no double occupancy. A perturbative renormalization group analysis yields a critical point with fractionalized excitations at a nonzero critical value p c of the hole doping p away from the half-filled insulator. We compute the renormalization group to two loops, but some exponents are obtained to all loop order. We argue that the critical point p c is flanked by confining phases: a disordered Fermi liquid with carrier density 1 + p for p &gt; p c and a metallic spin glass with carrier density p for p &lt; p c . Additional evidence for the critical behavior is obtained from a large- M analysis of a model which extends the SU(2) spin symmetry to SU ( M ) . We discuss the relationship of the vicinity of this deconfined quantum critical point to key aspects of cuprate phenomenology.},

  abstract     = {We show how a large family of interacting nonequilibrium phases of matter can arise from the presence of multiple time-translation symmetries, which occur by quasiperiodically driving an isolated, quantum many-body system with two or more incommensurate frequencies. These phases are fundamentally different from those realizable in time-independent or periodically driven (Floquet) settings. Focusing on high-frequency drives with smooth time dependence, we rigorously establish general conditions for which these phases are stable in a parametrically long-lived “preheating” regime. We develop a formalism to analyze the effect of the multiple time-translation symmetries on the dynamics of the system, which we use to classify and construct explicit examples of the emergent phases. In particular, we discuss time quasicrystals which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetries, as well as time-translation symmetry-protected topological phases.},

Our demonstration relies on the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling of the dipolar exchange interaction combined with time-reversal symmetry breaking by a homogeneous external magnetic field. Remarkably, the phase of the hopping amplitude between two sites strongly depends on the occupancy of the third site, thus leading to a correlated hopping associated with a density-dependent Peierls phase. We experimentally observe this density-dependent hopping and show that the excitations behave as anyonic particles with a nontrivial phase under exchange. Finally, we confirm the dependence of the Peierls phase on the geometrical arrangement of the Rydberg atoms.},

Here, using a postdeposition ozone annealing method, we obtain a series of oxygen stoichiometric SrCoO 3 thin films with the tensile strain up to 3.0\%. We observe a robust ferromagnetic ground state in all strained thin films, while interestingly the tensile strain triggers a distinct metal-to-insulator transition along with the increase of the tensile strain. The persistent ferromagnetic state across the electrical transition therefore suggests that the magnetic state is directly correlated with the localized electrons, rather than the itinerant ones, which then calls for further investigation of the intrinsic mechanism of this magnetic compound beyond the double-exchange mechanism.},

While these phenomena are challenging to describe both theoretically and experimentally, they are essential for the fundamental understanding of many-body systems and practical devices. In the context of spintronics, when a magnetic insulator (MI) is subjected to a thermal gradient, a pure spin current is generated in the form of magnons without the presence and dissipation of a charge current—attractive for reducing energy consumption and central to the emerging field of spin caloritronics. However, the experimental methods for directly quantifying a spin current in insulators and for probing local phonon-magnon nonequilibrium and the associated magnon chemical potential are largely missing. Here, we apply a heating laser to generate a thermal gradient in the MI yttrium iron garnet (YIG), Y 3 Fe 5 O 12 , and evaluate two components of the spin current, driven by temperature and chemical potential gradients, respectively. The experimental method and theory approach for evaluating quasiparticle chemical potential can be applied for analogous phenomena in other many-body systems.},

  abstract     = {In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the conventional dogma of Anderson localization asserts that all states localize in two dimensions, with a glaring exception: the quantum Hall plateau transition (QHPT). In that case, the localization length diverges and interference-induced quantum-critical spatial fluctuations appear at all length scales. Normally, QHPT states occur only at isolated energies; accessing them therefore requires fine-tuning of the electron density or magnetic field. In this paper we show that QHPT states can be realized throughout an energy continuum, i.e., as an “energy stack” of critical states wherein each state in the stack exhibits QHPT phenomenology. The stacking occurs without fine-tuning at the surface of a class AIII topological phase, where it is protected by U(1) and (anomalous) chiral or time-reversal symmetries. Spectrum-wide criticality is diagnosed by comparing numerics to universal results for the longitudinal Landauer conductance and wave function multifractality at the QHPT. Results are obtained from an effective 2D surface field theory and from a bulk 3D lattice model. We demonstrate that the stacking of quantum-critical QHPT states is a robust phenomenon that occurs for AIII topological phases with both odd and even winding numbers. The latter conclusion may have important implications for the still poorly understood logarithmic conformal field theory believed to describe the QHPT.},

Here we report the first experimental observation of quantized exciton energies in a macroscopic system with strong Coulomb interaction, monolayer WSe 2 crystal under a strong magnetic field. Employing helicity-resolved magnetoreflectance spectroscopy, we observe a striking ladder of plateaus as a function of the gate voltage for both exciton resonance in one valley and exciton-polariton branch in the opposite valley, thanks to the inter-Landau levels transitions governed by unique valley-selective selection rules. The observed quantized excitation energy level spacing sensitively depends on the doping level, indicating strong many-body effects.

Here, we study a nonequilibrium phase transition and observe signatures of self-organized criticality in a dilute thermal vapor of atoms optically excited to strongly interacting Rydberg states. Electromagnetically induced transparency provides excellent control over the population dynamics and enables high-resolution probing of the driven-dissipative dynamics, which also exhibits phase bistability. Increased sensitivity compared to previous work allows us to reconstruct the complete phase diagram, including in the vicinity of the critical point. We observe that interaction-induced energy shifts and enhanced decay only occur in one of the phases above a critical Rydberg population. This case limits the application of generic mean-field models; however, a modified, threshold-dependent approach is in qualitative agreement with experimental data. Near threshold, we observe self-organized dynamics in the form of population jumps that return the density to a critical value.},

Compared to the previous state of the art, it is an order of magnitude more compact, its characteristic impedance is in situ tunable, and its fabrication process requires only two lithography steps. The key is the engineering of a gap in the dispersion relation of the transmission line. This is obtained using a periodic modulation of the SQUID size, similarly to what is done with photonic crystals. Moreover, we provide a new theoretical treatment to describe the nontrivial interplay between nonlinearity and such periodicity.

We present an efficient implementation of symplectic neural coordinate transformations and two ways to train the model based either on the Hamiltonian function or phase-space samples. The learned model maps physical variables onto an independent representation where collective modes with different frequencies are separated, which can be useful for various downstream tasks such as compression, prediction, control, and sampling. We demonstrate the ability of this method first by analyzing toy problems and then by applying it to real-world problems, such as identifying and interpolating slow collective modes of the alanine dipeptide molecule and MNIST database images.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a complex-plane generalization of the consecutive level-spacing ratio distribution used to distinguish regular from chaotic quantum spectra. Our approach features the distribution of complex-valued ratios between nearest- and next-to-nearest-neighbor spacings. We show that this quantity can successfully detect the chaotic or regular nature of complex-valued spectra, which is done in two steps. First, we show that, if eigenvalues are uncorrelated, the distribution of complex spacing ratios is flat within the unit circle, whereas random matrices show a strong angular dependence in addition to the usual level repulsion. The universal fluctuations of Gaussian unitary and Ginibre unitary universality classes in the large-matrix-size limit are shown to be well described by Wigner-like surmises for small-size matrices with eigenvalues on the circle and on the two-torus, respectively. To study the latter case, we introduce the toric unitary ensemble, characterized by a flat joint eigenvalue distribution on the two-torus. Second, we study different physical situations where non-Hermitian matrices arise: dissipative quantum systems described by a Lindbladian, nonunitary quantum dynamics described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and classical stochastic processes. We show that known integrable models have a flat distribution of complex spacing ratios, whereas generic cases, expected to be chaotic, conform to random matrix theory predictions. Specifically, we are able to clearly distinguish chaotic from integrable dynamics in boundary-driven dissipative spin-chain Liouvillians and in the classical asymmetric simple exclusion process and to differentiate localized from delocalized regimes in a non-Hermitian disordered many-body system.},

  abstract     = {The delafossite metals PdCoO 2 , PtCoO 2 , and PdCrO 2 are among the highest conductivity materials known, with low-temperature mean free paths of tens of microns in the best as-grown single crystals. A key question is whether these very low resistive scattering rates result from strongly suppressed backscattering due to special features of the electronic structure or are a consequence of highly unusual levels of crystalline perfection. We report the results of experiments in which high-energy electron irradiation was used to introduce point disorder to the Pd and Pt layers in which the conduction occurs. We obtain the cross section for formation of Frenkel pairs in absolute units, and cross-check our analysis with first-principles calculations of the relevant atomic displacement energies. We observe an increase of resistivity that is linear in defect density with a slope consistent with scattering in the unitary limit. Our results enable us to deduce that the as-grown crystals contain extremely low levels of in-plane defects of approximately 0.001\%. This confirms that crystalline perfection is the most important factor in realizing the long mean free paths and highlights how unusual these delafossite metals are in comparison with the vast majority of other multicomponent oxides and alloys. We discuss the implications of our findings for future materials research.},

  abstract     = {Multistability in Kerr resonators which are driven by continuous or modulated optical waves gives rise to the superposition of distinct nonlinear states, yielding a unique platform for studying complex soliton dynamics. Here, by pumping a crystalline microresonator with two lasers that are frequency detuned from each other by one or multiple cavity free spectral ranges, we go beyond the traditional bichromatic pumping framework and enter an unexplored multistability regime that allows observing novel dynamics including composite solitons and successive soliton collisions. We generate complex frequency comb patterns, observing the velocity mismatch between the solitons and the dual-pumping-induced lattice traps and showing the synchronization of the repetition rates of constituent distinct solitons under the influence of index-barrier-induced intersoliton repulsion. We also demonstrate soliton collisions and observe transient soliton response with spectral analysis and ultrafast imaging, highlighting the eigenfrequency of dissipative soliton dynamics that coincides the “soliton ( S ) resonance.” Furthermore, we exploit the higher-order dispersion effect to manipulate the intrinsic group velocity mismatch between distinct solitons and demonstrate reversible switching between the composite soliton state and the soliton collisional state. Our findings bring to light the rich physics of the Kerr multistability and may equally be useful in microcomb-based spectroscopy and metrology.},

  abstract     = {Pump-probe measurements aim to capture the motion of electrons and nuclei on their natural timescales (femtoseconds to attoseconds) as chemical and physical transformations take place, effectively making “molecular movies” with short light pulses. However, the quantum dynamics of interest are filtered by the coordinate-dependent matrix elements of the chosen experimental observable. Thus, it is only through a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical calculations that one can gain insight into the internal dynamics. Here, we report on a combination of structural (relativistic ultrafast electron diffraction, or UED) and spectroscopic (time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, or TRPES) measurements to follow the coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics involved in the internal conversion and photodissociation of the polyatomic molecule, diiodomethane ( CH 2 I 2 ). While UED directly probes the 3D nuclear dynamics, TRPES only serves as an indirect probe of nuclear dynamics via Franck-Condon factors, but it is sensitive to electronic energies and configurations, via Koopmans’ correlations and photoelectron angular distributions. These two measurements are interpreted with trajectory surface hopping calculations, which are capable of simulating the observables for both measurements from the same dynamics calculations. The measurements highlight the nonlocal dynamics captured by different groups of trajectories in the calculations. For the first time, both UED and TRPES are combined with theory capable of calculating the observables in both cases, yielding a direct view of the structural and nonadiabatic dynamics involved.},

  abstract     = {Liquid foam is a dense dispersion of liquid bubbles in a surfactant solution. Because of its large surface area, it is an out-of-equilibrium material that evolves with space and time because of coarsening, coalescence, and liquid drainage. In many applications, it is required to control the lifetime of a foam by limiting the drainage or triggering the collapse at a specific location or a given time. We show here that applying an external electric field at the edge of the foam induces some liquid flows. Depending on the flow magnitude, it controls either gravity driven drainage, the foam stability, or the foam collapse at a specific location. Thus, applying an electric field to a liquid foam can control its stability. The experimental results are quantitatively described by a simple model taking into account first the electro-osmotic transport in such a deformable medium and second the Marangoni flows induced by heterogeneous heating due to Joule effect. More specifically, we show for the first time that electro-osmosis can be strongly enhanced due to thermal gradients generated by the applied electric field.},

  abstract     = {The creation of delocalized coherent superpositions of quantum systems experiencing different relativistic effects is an important milestone in future research at the interface of gravity and quantum mechanics. This milestone could be achieved by generating a superposition of quantum clocks that follow paths with different gravitational time dilation and investigating the consequences on the interference signal when they are eventually recombined. Light-pulse atom interferometry with elements employed in optical atomic clocks is a promising candidate for that purpose, but it suffers from major challenges including its insensitivity to the gravitational redshift in a uniform field. All of these difficulties can be overcome with the novel scheme presented here, which is based on initializing the clock when the spatially separate superposition has already been generated and performing a doubly differential measurement where the differential phase shift between the two internal states is compared for different initialization times. This scheme can be exploited to test the universality of the gravitational redshift with delocalized coherent superpositions of quantum clocks, and it is argued that its experimental implementation should be feasible with a new generation of 10-meter atomic fountains that will soon become available. Interestingly, the approach also offers significant advantages for more compact setups based on guided interferometry or hybrid configurations. Furthermore, in order to provide a solid foundation for the analysis of the various interferometry schemes and the effects that can be measured with them, a general formalism for a relativistic description of atom interferometry in curved spacetime is developed. It can describe freely falling atoms as well as the effects of external forces and guiding potentials, and it can be applied to a very wide range of situations. As an important ingredient for quantum-clock interferometry, suitable diffraction mechanisms for atoms in internal-state superpositions are investigated too. Finally, the relation of the proposed doubly differential measurement scheme to other experimental approaches and to tests of the universality of free fall is discussed in detail.},

  abstract     = {A grand challenge underlies the entire field of topology-enabled quantum logic and information science: how to establish topological control principles driven by quantum coherence and understand the time dependence of such periodic driving. Here we demonstrate a few-cycle THz-pulse-induced phase transition in a Dirac semimetal ZrTe 5 that is periodically driven by vibrational coherence due to excitation of the lowest Raman active mode. Above a critical THz-pump field threshold, there emerges a long-lived metastable phase, approximately 100 ps, with unique Raman phonon-assisted topological switching dynamics absent for optical pumping. The switching also manifests itself by distinct features: nonthermal spectral shape, relaxation slowing near the Lifshitz transition where the critical Dirac point occurs, and diminishing signals at the same temperature that the Berry-curvature-induced anomalous Hall effect magnetoresistance vanishes. These results, together with first-principles modeling, identify a mode-selective Raman coupling that drives the system from strong to weak topological insulators with a Dirac semimetal phase established at a critical atomic displacement controlled by the phonon coherent pumping. Harnessing of vibrational coherence can be extended to steer symmetry-breaking transitions, i.e., Dirac to Weyl ones, with implications for THz topological quantum gate and error correction applications.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional semiconductors provide an ideal platform for exploration of linear exciton and polariton physics, primarily due to large exciton binding energy and strong light-matter coupling. These features, however, generically imply reduced exciton-exciton interactions, hindering the realization of active optical devices such as lasers or parametric oscillators. Here, we show that electrical injection of itinerant electrons into monolayer molybdenum diselenide allows us to overcome this limitation: dynamical screening of exciton-polaritons by electrons leads to the formation of new quasiparticles termed polaron-polaritons that exhibit unexpectedly strong interactions as well as optical amplification by Bose-enhanced polaron-electron scattering. To measure the nonlinear optical response, we carry out time-resolved pump-probe measurements and observe polaron-polariton interaction enhancement by a factor of 50 ( 0.5 μ eV μ m 2 ) as compared to exciton-polaritons. Concurrently, we measure a spectrally integrated transmission gain of the probe field of ≳ 2 stemming from stimulated scattering of polaron-polaritons. We show theoretically that the nonequilibrium nature of optically excited quasiparticles favors a previously unexplored interaction mechanism stemming from a phase-space filling in the screening cloud, which provides an accurate explanation of the strong repulsive interactions observed experimentally. Our findings show that itinerant electron-exciton interactions provide an invaluable tool for electronic manipulation of optical properties, demonstrate a new mechanism for dramatically enhancing polariton-polariton interactions, and pave the way for realization of nonequilibrium polariton condensates.},

  abstract     = {In contrast to magnetic order formed by electrons’ dipolar moments, ordering phenomena associated with higher-order multipoles (quadrupoles, octupoles, etc.) are more difficult to characterize because of the limited choice of experimental probes that can distinguish different multipolar moments. The heavy-fermion compound CeB 6 and its La-diluted alloys are among the best-studied realizations of the long-range-ordered multipolar phases, often referred to as “hidden order.” Previously, the hidden order in phase II was identified as primary antiferroquadrupolar and field-induced octupolar order. Here, we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of collective excitations in phase II of CeB 6 . Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) in fields up to 16.5 T reveals a new high-energy mode above 14 T in addition to the low-energy magnetic excitations. The experimental dependence of their energy on the magnitude and angle of the applied magnetic field is compared to the results of a multipolar interaction model. The magnetic excitation spectrum in a rotating field is calculated within a localized approach using the pseudospin representation for the Γ 8 states. We show that the rotating-field technique at fixed momentum can complement conventional INS measurements of the dispersion at a constant field and holds great promise for identifying the symmetry of multipolar order parameters and the details of intermultipolar interactions that stabilize hidden-order phases.},

  abstract     = {When monitoring the dynamics of stochastic systems, such as interacting particles agitated by thermal noise, disentangling deterministic forces from Brownian motion is challenging. Indeed, we show that there is an information-theoretic bound, the capacity of the system when viewed as a communication channel, that limits the rate at which information about the force field can be extracted from a Brownian trajectory. This capacity provides an upper bound to the system’s entropy production rate and quantifies the rate at which the trajectory becomes distinguishable from pure Brownian motion. We propose a practical and principled method, stochastic force inference, that uses this information to approximate force fields and spatially variable diffusion coefficients. It is data efficient, including in high dimensions, robust to experimental noise, and provides a self-consistent estimate of the inference error. In addition to forces, this technique readily permits the evaluation of out-of-equilibrium currents and the corresponding entropy production with a limited amount of data.},

Here, we show that a “wrinkle-to-crumple” transition, previously observed in specific settings, is a ubiquitous response for confined sheets. This unified picture is borne out of a suite of model experiments on polymer films confined to liquid interfaces with spherical, hyperbolic, and cylindrical geometries, which are complemented by experiments on macroscopic membranes inflated with gas. We use measurements across this wide range of geometries, boundary conditions, and length scales to quantify several robust morphological features of the crumpled phase, and we build an empirical phase diagram for crumple formation that disentangles the competing effects of curvature and compression. Our results suggest that crumples are a generic microstructure that emerge at large curvatures due to a competition of elastic and substrate energies.},

It is of great interest whether ammonia and helium can react with each other under planetary conditions, and if so, what kinds of structures and states of matter can form. Here, using crystal structure prediction methods and first-principles calculations, we report three new stable stoichiometries and eight new stable phases of He − NH 3 compounds under pressures up to 500 GPa. These structures may exhibit perovskitelike structures for HeNH 3 and He 2 NH 3 , and a host-guest crystal structure for He ( NH 3 ) 2 . Superionic states are found in all these He − NH 3 compounds under high pressures and temperatures in which the hydrogen atoms are diffusive while the nitrogen and helium atoms remain fixed. Such dynamical behavior in helium ammonia compounds is quite different from that in helium water compounds, where weakly interacting helium is more diffusive than stronger bound hydrogen. The low-density host-guest phase of space group I 4 c m is found to be stable at very low pressures (about 3 GPa) and it enters into a plastic state, characterized by freely rotating ammonia molecules. The present results suggest that plastic or superionic helium ammonia compounds may exist under planetary conditions, and helium contributes crucially to the exotic physics and chemistry observed under extreme conditions.},

Here we implement quantum nondemolition measurements in a Si/SiGe two-qubit system, with one qubit serving as the logical qubit and the other serving as the ancilla. Making use of a two-qubit controlled-rotation gate, the state of the logical qubit is mapped onto the ancilla, followed by a destructive readout of the ancilla. Repeating this procedure enhances the logical readout fidelity from 75.5 ± 0.3\% to 94.5 ± 0.2\% after 15 ancilla readouts. In addition, we compare the conventional thresholding method with an improved signal processing method called soft decoding that makes use of analog information in the readout signal to better estimate the state of the logical qubit. We demonstrate that soft decoding leads to a significant reduction in the required number of repetitions when the readout errors become limited by Gaussian noise, for instance, in the case of readouts with a low signal-to-noise ratio. These results pave the way for the implementation of quantum error correction with spin qubits in silicon.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by recent experiments on graphene, we examine the nondissipative viscoelastic response of anisotropic two-dimensional quantum systems. We pay particular attention to electron fluids with point group symmetries and those with discrete translational symmetry. We start by extending the Kubo formalism for viscosity to systems with internal degrees of freedom and discrete translational symmetry, highlighting the importance of properly considering the role of internal angular momentum. We analyze the Hall components of the viscoelastic response tensor in systems with discrete point group symmetry, focusing on the hydrodynamic implications of the resulting forces. We show that though there are generally six Hall viscosities, there are only three independent contributions to the viscous force density in the bulk. To compute these coefficients, we develop a framework to consistently write down the long-wavelength stress tensor and viscosity for multicomponent lattice systems. We apply our formalism to lattice and continuum models, including a lattice Chern insulator and anisotropic superfluid.},

  abstract     = {Unraveling bacterial strategies for spatial exploration is crucial for understanding the complexity in the organization of life. Bacterial motility determines the spatiotemporal structure of microbial and controls infection spreading and the microbiota organization in guts or in soils. Most theoretical approaches for modeling bacterial transport rely on their run-and-tumble motion. For Escherichia coli , the run-time distribution is reported to follow a Poisson process with a single characteristic time related to the rotational switching of the flagellar motors. However, direct measurements on flagellar motors show heavy-tailed distributions of rotation times stemming from the intrinsic noise in the chemotactic mechanism. Currently, there is no direct experimental evidence that the stochasticity in the chemotactic machinery affects the macroscopic motility of bacteria. In stark contrast with the accepted vision of run and tumble, here we report a large behavioral variability of wild-type E. coli , revealed in their three-dimensional trajectories. At short observation times, a large distribution of run times is measured on a population and attributed to the slow fluctuations of a signaling protein triggering the flagellar motor reversal. Over long times, individual bacteria undergo significant changes in motility. We demonstrate that such a large distribution of run times introduces measurement biases in most practical situations. Our results reconcile the notorious conundrum between run-time observations and motor-switching statistics. We finally propose that statistical modeling of transport properties, currently undertaken in the emerging framework of active matter studies, should be reconsidered under the scope of this large variability of motility features.},

By itself, the use of Josephson junctions in volt metrology seems to imply an exquisite understanding of the component in every aspect. Yet, surprisingly, there have been long-standing subtle issues regarding the modeling of the interaction of a junction with its electromagnetic environment. Here, we find that a Josephson junction connected to a resistor does not become insulating beyond a given value of the resistance due to a dissipative quantum phase transition, as is commonly believed.

  abstract     = {Unraveling the structure and function of the brain requires a detailed knowledge about the neuronal connections, i.e., the spatial architecture of the nerve fibers. One of the most powerful histological methods to reconstruct the three-dimensional nerve fiber pathways is 3D-polarized light imaging (3D-PLI). The technique measures the birefringence of histological brain sections and derives the spatial fiber orientations of whole human brain sections with micrometer resolution. However, the technique yields only a single fiber orientation for each measured tissue voxel even if it is composed of fibers with different orientations, so that in-plane crossing fibers are misinterpreted as out-of-plane fibers. When generating a detailed model of the three-dimensional nerve fiber architecture in the brain, a correct detection and interpretation of nerve fiber crossings is crucial. Here, we show how light scattering in transmission microscopy measurements can be leveraged to identify nerve fiber crossings in 3D-PLI data and demonstrate that measurements of the scattering pattern can resolve the substructure of brain tissue like the crossing angles of the nerve fibers. For this purpose, we develop a simulation framework that permits the study of transmission microscopy measurements—in particular, light scattering—on large-scale complex fiber structures like brain tissue, using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and high-performance computing. The simulations are used not only to model and explain experimental observations, but also to develop new analysis methods and measurement techniques. We demonstrate in various experimental studies on brain sections from different species (rodent, monkey, and human) and in FDTD simulations that the polarization-independent transmitted light intensity (transmittance) decreases significantly (by more than 50\%) with an increasing out-of-plane angle of the nerve fibers and that it is mostly independent of the in-plane crossing angle. Hence, the transmittance can be used to distinguish regions with low fiber density and in-plane crossing fibers from regions with out-of-plane fibers, solving a major problem in 3D-PLI and allowing for a much better reconstruction of the complex nerve fiber architecture in the brain. Finally, we show that light scattering (oblique illumination) in the visible spectrum reveals the underlying structure of brain tissue like the crossing angle of the nerve fibers with micrometer resolution, enabling an even more detailed reconstruction of nerve fiber crossings in the brain and opening up new fields of research.},

However, the applications of such systems in mechanotransduction processes where the mechanosensing proteins are subject to mechanical forces of several piconewtons are poorly explored. In order to apply molecular optogenetic switch systems to mechanobiological studies, it is crucial to understand their mechanical stabilities which have yet to be quantified. In this work, we quantify a frequently used molecular optogenetic switch, iLID-nano, which is an improved light-induced dimerization between LOV2-SsrA and SspB. Our results show that the iLID-nano system can withstand forces up to 10 pN for seconds to tens of seconds that decrease as the force increases. The mechanical stability of the system suggests that it can be employed to modulate mechanotransduction processes that involve similar force ranges. We demonstrate the use of this system to control talin-mediated cell spreading and migration. Together, we establish the physical basis for utilizing the iLID-nano system in the direct control of intramolecular force transmission in cells during mechanotransduction processes.},

  abstract     = {Exploring new parameter regimes to realize and control novel phases of matter has been a main theme in modern condensed matter physics research. The recent discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnetism in nearly freestanding monolayer atomic crystals has already led to observations of a number of novel magnetic phenomena absent in bulk counterparts. Such intricate interplays between magnetism and crystalline structures provide ample opportunities for exploring quantum phase transitions in this new 2D parameter regime. Here, using magnetic field- and temperature-dependent circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy of phonons and magnons, we map out the phase diagram of chromium triiodide ( CrI 3 ) that has been known to be a layered antiferromagnet (AFM) in its 2D films and a ferromagnet (FM) in its three-dimensional (3D) bulk. However, we reveal a novel mixed state of layered AFM and FM in 3D CrI 3 bulk crystals where the layered AFM survives in the surface layers, and the FM appears in deeper bulk layers. We then show that the surface-layered AFM transits into the FM at a critical magnetic field of 2 T, similar to what was found in the few-layer case. Interestingly, concurrent with this magnetic phase transition, we discover a first-order structural phase transition that alters the crystallographic point group from C 3 i (rhombohedral) to C 2 h (monoclinic). Our result not only unveils the complex single-magnon behavior in 3D CrI 3 , but it also settles the puzzle of how CrI 3 transits from a bulk FM to a thin-layered AFM semiconductor, despite recent efforts in understanding the origin of layered AFM in CrI 3 thin layers, and reveals the intimate relationship between the layered AFM-to-FM and the crystalline rhombohedral-to-monoclinic phase transitions. These findings further open opportunities for future 2D magnet-based magnetomechanical devices.},

This problem serves as a reference model for the statistics of filtering and related sampling problems. The filter patterns in this problem conveniently allow a microscopic, combinatorial consideration. This allows us to find the statistics of outputs, namely the exact distribution of output degeneracies, for arbitrary input sizes. We observe that the resulting degeneracy distribution of outputs decays as e − c log α d with degeneracy d , where c is a constant and exponent α &gt; 1 , i.e., faster than a power law. Importantly, its form essentially depends on the size of the input dataset, appearing to be closer to a power-law dependence for small dataset sizes than for large ones. We demonstrate that for sufficiently small input dataset sizes typical for empirical studies, this distribution could be easily perceived as a power law. We extend our results to filter patterns of various sizes and demonstrate that the shortest filter pattern provides the maximum informative representations of the inputs.},

  abstract     = {We study the nonlinear dynamics of a surprising phenomenon arising in large networks of excitable elements in response to noise: while at low noise, solutions remain in the vicinity of the resting state and large-noise solutions show asynchronous activity, the network displays orderly, perfectly synchronized periodic responses at intermediate levels of noise. This noise-induced synchronization, distinct from classical stochastic resonance, is fundamentally collective in nature. Indeed, we show that, for noise and coupling within specific ranges, an asymmetry in the transition rates between a resting and an excited regime progressively builds up, leading to an increase in the fraction of excited neurons eventually triggering a chain reaction associated with a macroscopic synchronized excursion and a collective return to rest where this process starts afresh, thus yielding the observed periodic synchronized oscillations. We further uncover a novel antiresonance phenomenon in this regime: noise-induced synchronized oscillations disappear when the system is driven by periodic stimulation with frequency within a specific range (high relative to the spontaneous activity). In that antiresonance regime, the system is optimal for measures of information transmission. This observation provides a new hypothesis accounting for the efficiency of high-frequency stimulation therapies, known as deep brain stimulation, in Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by an increased synchronization of brain motor circuits. We further discuss the universality of these phenomena in the class of stochastic networks of excitable elements with specific coupling and illustrate this universality by analyzing various classical models of neuronal networks. Altogether, these results uncover some universal mechanisms supporting a regularizing impact of noise in excitable systems, reveal a novel antiresonance phenomenon in these systems, and propose a new hypothesis for the efficiency of high-frequency stimulation in Parkinson’s disease.},

  abstract     = {Cellular mechanics drives epithelial morphogenesis, the process wherein cells collectively rearrange to produce tissue-scale deformations that determine organismal shape. However, quantitative understanding of tissue mechanics is impaired by the difficulty of direct measurement of stress in vivo . This difficulty has spurred the development of image-based inference algorithms that estimate stress from snapshots of epithelial geometry. Such methods are challenged by sensitivity to measurement error and thus require accurate geometric segmentation for practical use. We overcome this difficulty by introducing a novel approach—the variational method of stress inference (VMSI)—which exploits the fundamental duality between stress and geometry at equilibrium of discrete mechanical networks that model confluent cellular layers. We approximate the apical geometry of an epithelial tissue by a 2D tiling with circular arc polygons in which arcs represent intercellular interfaces defined by the balance of local line tension and pressure differentials between adjacent cells. The mechanical equilibrium of such networks imposes extensive local constraints on circular arc polygon geometry. These constraints provide the foundation of VMSI which, starting with images of epithelial monolayers, simultaneously approximates both tissue geometry and internal forces, subject to the constraint of equilibrium. We find VMSI to be more robust than previous methods. Specifically, the VMSI performance is validated by the comparison of the predicted cellular and mesoscopic scale stress with the measured myosin II patterns during early Drosophila embryogenesis. VMSI prediction of a mesoscopic stress tensor correlates at the 80\% level with the measured myosin distribution and reveals that most of the myosin activity in that case is involved in a static internal force balance within the epithelial layer. In addition to insight into cell mechanics, this study provides a practical method for nondestructive estimation of stress in live epithelial tissue.},

Dealing with this nonmodal continuum poses a challenge to the design of nanophotonic systems aiming to combine compact sources and nanostructures into unified functional platforms. Here, we present a route to control forced nanostructures by engineering a discrete set of nonmodal degrees of freedom, originating from joint nanostructure-source antiresonances. We experimentally demonstrate that the forced response of ultrathin gold films is shaped by pairs of resonant-antiresonant plasmons, exhibiting joint creation and annihilation in momentum-energy space.

For a specific class of CMP processes, which represents a generalization of degree-ordered percolation, we derive a scaling solution on uncorrelated complex networks, unveiling the existence of diverse mechanisms leading to the formation of a percolating cluster. The scaling solution accurately reproduces universal properties of the transition. This finding is used to infer the critical properties of the susceptible-infected-susceptible model for epidemics in infinite and finite power-law distributed networks. Here, discrepancies between analytical approaches and numerical results regarding the finite-size scaling of the epidemic threshold are a crucial open issue in the literature. We find that the scaling exponent assumes a nontrivial value during a long preasymptotic regime. We calculate this value, finding good agreement with numerical evidence. We also show that the crossover to the true asymptotic regime occurs for sizes much beyond currently feasible simulations. Our findings allow us to rationalize and reconcile all previously published results (both analytical and numerical), thus ending a long-standing debate.},

The variational quantum Monte Carlo method is implemented with deep generative flows to search for gauge-invariant low-energy states. The ground state (and also long-lived metastable states) of an SU ( N ) matrix quantum mechanics with three bosonic matrices, and also its supersymmetric “mini-BMN” extension, are studied as a function of coupling and N . Known semiclassical fuzzy sphere states are recovered, and the collapse of these geometries in more strongly quantum regimes is probed using the variational wave function. We then describe a factorization of the quantum mechanical Hilbert space that corresponds to a spatial partition of the emergent geometry. Under this partition, the fuzzy sphere states show a boundary-law entanglement entropy in the large N limit.},

  abstract     = {Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are molten salts which exhibit unique physical and chemical properties, commonly harnessed for lubrication and energy applications. The pure ionic nature of RTIL leads to strong electrostatic interactions among the liquid, furthermore exalted in the presence of interfaces and confinement. In this work, we use a tuning-fork-based dynamic surface force tribometer, which allows probing both the rheological and the tribological properties of RTIL films confined between a millimetric sphere and a surface, over a wide range of confinements. When the RTIL is confined between metallic surfaces, we see evidence of an abrupt change of its rheological properties below a threshold confinement. This is reminiscent of a recently reported confinement-induced capillary freezing, here observed with a wide contact area. In parallel, we probe the tribological response of the film under imposed nanometric shear deformation and unveil a yielding behavior of the interfacial solid phase below this threshold confinement. This is characterized by a transition from an elastic to a plastic regime, exhibiting striking similarities with the response of glassy materials. This transition to yielding of the RTIL in metallic confinement leads overall to a reduction in friction and offers a self-healing protection of the surfaces avoiding direct contact, with obvious applications in tribology.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz)-based electron acceleration and manipulation has recently been shown to be feasible and to hold tremendous promise as a technology for the development of next-generation, compact electron sources. Previous work has concentrated on structures powered transversely by short, single-cycle THz pulses, with millimeter-scale, segmented interaction regions that are ideal for acceleration of electrons in the sub- to few-MeV range, where electron velocities vary significantly. However, in order to extend this technology to the multi-MeV range, an investigation of approaches supporting longer interaction lengths is needed. Here, we demonstrate first steps in electron acceleration and manipulation using dielectrically lined waveguides powered by temporally long, narrow-band, multicycle THz pulses that copropagate with the electrons. This geometry offers centimeter-scale single-stage interaction lengths and offers the opportunity to further increase interaction lengths by cascading acceleration stages that recycle the THz energy and rephase the interaction. We prove the feasibility of THz-energy recycling for the first time by demonstrating acceleration, compression, and focusing in two sequential Al 2 O 3 -based dielectric capillary stages powered by the same multicycle THz pulse. Since the multicycle THz energy achievable using laser-based sources is currently a limiting factor for the maximum electron acceleration, recycling the THz pulses provides a key factor for reaching relativistic energies with existing sources and paves the way for applications in future ultrafast electron diffraction and free-electron lasers.},

We experimentally demonstrate a linear dependence of resistance on current in microscopic thin-film metallic wires at cryogenic temperatures, and show that our results are inconsistent with common non-Ohmic mechanisms such as Joule heating. As the temperature is increased, the linear dependence becomes smoothed out, resulting in the crossover to behaviors consistent with Joule heating. A plausible explanation for the observed behaviors is the strongly nonequilibrium distribution of phonons generated by the current. Analysis based on this interpretation suggests that the observed anomalous current-dependent resistance can provide information about phonon transport and electron-phonon interaction at nanoscale. The ability to control the properties of phonons generated by current can lead to new routes for the optimization of thermal properties of electronic nanodevices.},

Magnetic fields are inseparable from light-matter interaction, yet due to the dominance of electric-field-induced effects in many systems, laser pulses have heretofore provided comparatively limited insight into the high-frequency magnetic response of matter. Conductors or superconductors arranged in a solenoidal configuration embody the state-of-the-art apparatus for generating spatially isolated magnetic fields, but the reliance on electrical circuitry limits the field amplitude, pulse brevity, and absolute timing of the generated fields. We transfer the concept of solenoidal currents commonly leveraged in electromagnets to photo-ionized electrons driven by moderately intense vector laser beams, in a scheme that does not require the laser mode to carry orbital angular momentum. We predict that this all-optical approach will enable magnetic fields exceeding 8 Tesla to be turned on within 50 femtoseconds using moderate laser intensities, an unprecedented combination of parameters that will open the possibility for ultrafast metrological techniques to be combined with intense, spatially isolated, magnetic fields.},

Here, we report our inelastic neutron scattering investigation on a large single crystal of a stacked honeycomb lattice magnet CoTiO 3 , which is part of a broad family of ilmenite materials. The magnetically ordered ground state of CoTiO 3 features ferromagnetic layers of Co 2 + , stacked antiferromagnetically along the c axis.

However, the role of the environmental noise during spin manipulation, which determines the control fidelity, is less understood. We demonstrate an electron spin qubit whose coherence in the driven evolution is limited by high-frequency charge noise rather than the quasistatic noise inherent to any semiconductor device. We employ a feedback-control technique to actively suppress the latter, demonstrating a π -flip gate fidelity as high as 99.04 ± 0.23\% in a gallium arsenide quantum dot. We show that the driven-evolution coherence is limited by the longitudinal noise at the Rabi frequency, whose spectrum resembles the 1 / f noise observed in isotopically purified silicon qubits.},

We show that the lasing state of the multielement laser system possesses the distinct characteristics of spatial topological edge states while exhibiting topologically protected transport. The topological synthetic-space edge mode imposes a constant-phase difference between the multifrequency modes on the edges, and together with modulation of the individual elements forces the ensemble of resonators to mode lock and emit short pulses, robust to disorder in the multiresonator system. Our results offer a proof-of-concept mechanism to actively mode lock a laser diode array of many lasing elements, which is otherwise extremely difficult due to the presence of many spatial modes of the array.

We employ the Langevin algorithm to sample the posterior probability measure for the spiked mixed matrix-tensor model. The typical behavior of this algorithm is described by a system of integrodifferential equations that we call the Langevin state evolution, whose solution is compared with the one of the state evolution of approximate message passing (AMP). Our results show that, remarkably, the algorithmic threshold of the Langevin algorithm is suboptimal with respect to the one given by AMP. This phenomenon is due to the residual glassiness present in that region of parameters.

Here, we present a comprehensive study of photoinduced nonequilibrium response in underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 + x . We find that upon photoexcitations, the Josephson plasma edge in the superconducting state is initially removed accompanied by quasiparticle excitations, and subsequently reappears at a frequency lower than the static plasma edge within a short time. In the normal state, an enhancement or weaker edgelike shape is indeed induced by pump pulses in the reflectance spectrum accompanied by simultaneous rises in both real and imaginary parts of conductivity. We compare the pump-induced effects between near- and midinfrared excitations and exclude phonon pumping as a scenario for the photoinduced effects above. We further elaborate that the transient responses in the normal state are unlikely to be explained by photoinduced superconductivity.},

  abstract     = {The relaxation of few-body quantum systems can strongly depend on the initial state when the system’s semiclassical phase space is mixed ; i.e., regions of chaotic motion coexist with regular islands. In recent years, there has been much effort to understand the process of thermalization in strongly interacting quantum systems that often lack an obvious semiclassical limit. The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) allows one to systematically derive an effective classical (nonlinear) dynamical system by projecting unitary many-body dynamics onto a manifold of weakly entangled variational states. We demonstrate that such dynamical systems generally possess mixed phase space. When TDVP errors are small, the mixed phase space leaves a footprint on the exact dynamics of the quantum model. For example, when the system is initialized in a state belonging to a stable periodic orbit or the surrounding regular region, it exhibits persistent many-body quantum revivals. As a proof of principle, we identify new types of “quantum many-body scars,” i.e., initial states that lead to long-time oscillations in a model of interacting Rydberg atoms in one and two dimensions. Intriguingly, the initial states that give rise to most robust revivals are typically entangled states. On the other hand, even when TDVP errors are large, as in the thermalizing tilted-field Ising model, initializing the system in a regular region of phase space leads to a surprising slowdown of thermalization. Our work establishes TDVP as a method for identifying interacting quantum systems with anomalous dynamics in arbitrary dimensions. Moreover, the mixed phase space classical variational equations allow one to find slowly thermalizing initial conditions in interacting models. Our results shed light on a link between classical and quantum chaos, pointing toward possible extensions of the classical Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem to quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {Generalized hydrodynamics is a recent theory that describes large-scale transport properties of one-dimensional integrable models. It is built on the (typically infinitely many) local conservation laws present in these systems and leads to a generalized Euler-type hydrodynamic equation. Despite the successes of the theory, one of its cornerstones, namely, a conjectured expression for the currents of the conserved charges in local equilibrium, has not yet been proven for interacting lattice models. Here, we fill this gap and compute an exact result for the mean values of current operators in Bethe ansatz solvable systems valid in arbitrary finite volume. Our exact formula has a simple semiclassical interpretation: The currents can be computed by summing over the charge eigenvalues carried by the individual bare particles, multiplied with an effective velocity describing their propagation in the presence of the other particles. Remarkably, the semiclassical formula remains exact in the interacting quantum theory for any finite number of particles and also in the thermodynamic limit. Our proof is built on a form-factor expansion, and it is applicable to a large class of quantum integrable models.},

  abstract     = {Optical excitation in the cuprates has been shown to induce transient superconducting correlations above the thermodynamic transition temperature T C , as evidenced by the terahertz-frequency optical properties in the nonequilibrium state. In YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 + x , this phenomenon has so far been associated with the nonlinear excitation of certain lattice modes and the creation of new crystal structures. In other compounds, like La 2 − x Ba x CuO 4 , similar effects were reported also for excitation at near-infrared frequencies, and were interpreted as a signature of the melting of competing orders. However, to date, it has not been possible to systematically tune the pump frequency widely in any one compound, to comprehensively compare the frequency-dependent photosusceptibility for this phenomenon. Here, we make use of a newly developed nonlinear optical device, which generates widely tunable high-intensity femtosecond pulses, to excite YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.5 throughout the entire optical spectrum (3–750 THz). In the far-infrared region (3–24 THz), signatures of nonequilibrium superconductivity are induced only for excitation of the 16.4- and 19.2-THz vibrational modes that drive c -axis apical oxygen atomic positions. For higher driving frequencies (25–750 THz), a second resonance is observed around the charge transfer band edge at approximately 350 THz. These findings highlight the importance of coupling to the electronic structure of the CuO 2 planes, mediated either by a phonon or by charge transfer.},

We address such structures via micromorphic continuum elasticity, which allows highly nonuniform deformations (missed in conventional elasticity) within unit cells that nevertheless vary smoothly between cells. We show that the bulk microstructure gives rise to boundary elastic terms. Discrete lattice theories have shown that critically coordinated structures possess a topological invariant that determines the placement of low-energy modes on edges of such a system. We show that in continuum systems, a new topological invariant emerges, which relates the difference in the number of such modes between two opposing edges. Guided by the continuum limit of the lattice structures, we identify macroscopic experimental observables for these topological properties that may be observed independently on a new length scale above that of the microstructure.},

Coherent Raman spectroscopy can combine the capabilities of multidimensional spectroscopy with structural sensitivity at ultrafast timescales. Here, we develop a three-color-based 2D impulsive stimulated Raman technique that can selectively probe vibrational mode couplings between different active sites in molecules by taking advantage of resonance Raman enhancement. Three temporally delayed pulses generate nuclear wave packets whose evolution reports on the underlying potential energy surface, which we decipher using a diagrammatic approach enabling us to assign the origin of the spectroscopic signatures. We benchmark the method by revealing vibronic couplings in the ultrafast dynamics following photoexcitation of the green fluorescent protein.},

Here, we report transport studies of gated Hall bar structures fabricated from approximately 50-nm-thick, (001)-oriented epitaxial films of cadmium arsenide, a prototype three-dimensional Dirac semimetal, in magnetic fields up to 45 T. The films exhibit a quantized Hall effect with pronounced odd-integer plateaus that is strikingly different from that of the more widely studied (112)-oriented films. We show that the unusual quantum Hall effect is a consequence of the inverted bulk band structure of cadmium arsenide that creates topological-insulator-like states at the bottom and top interfaces, each exhibiting a half-integer quantum Hall effect. A small potential offset between the two surfaces results in the crossing of the Landau levels and gives rise to the filling factor sequences observed in the experiments. Moreover, at large negative values of gate bias, the filling factor ν = 1 is abruptly preempted by an insulating state that is accompanied by the collapse of the well-developed quantum Hall effect. We suggest that this new phase cannot be explained within a single-particle picture and discuss the role of Coulomb interactions between spatially separated surface states.},

As a concrete example, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional spin-1 models that conserve charge (total S z ) and its associated dipole moment. First, we consider a minimal model including only three-site terms and find that the infinite temperature autocorrelation saturates to a finite value—showcasing nonthermal behavior. The absence of thermalization is identified as a consequence of the strong fragmentation of the Hilbert space into exponentially many invariant subspaces in the local S z basis, arising from the interplay of dipole conservation and local interactions. Second, we extend the model by including four-site terms and find that this perturbation leads to a weak fragmentation : The system still has exponentially many invariant subspaces, but they are no longer sufficient to avoid thermalization for typical initial states. More generally, for any finite range of interactions, the system still exhibits nonthermal eigenstates appearing throughout the entire spectrum. We compare our results to charge and dipole moment-conserving random unitary circuit models for which we reach identical conclusions.},

In addition, it minimizes the effect of unwanted decay channels such as the Purcell effect.

Despite each subchimera being linearly stable, switching chimeras are extremely sensitive to noise: Arbitrarily small noise triggers and sustains persistent switching between the two symmetric subchimeras. The average switching frequency scales as a power law with the noise intensity, which is in contrast with the exponential scaling observed in typical stochastic transitions. Rigorous numerical analysis reveals that the power-law switching behavior originates from intermingled basins of attraction associated with the two subchimeras, which, in turn, are induced by chaos and symmetry in the system. The theoretical results are supported by experiments on coupled optoelectronic oscillators, which demonstrate the generality and robustness of switching chimeras.},

  abstract     = {Using quantum gas microscopy, we study the late-time effective hydrodynamics of an isolated cold-atom Fermi-Hubbard system subject to an external linear potential (a “tilt”). The tilt is along one of the principal directions of the two-dimensional square lattice and couples mass transport to local heating through energy conservation. Because of this coupling, the system quickly heats up to near infinite temperature in the lowest band of the lattice. We study the high-temperature transport and thermalization in our system by observing the decay of prepared initial density waves as a function of wavelength λ and tilt strength and find that the associated decay time τ crosses over as the tilt strength is increased from characteristically diffusive to subdiffusive with τ ∝ λ 4 . In order to explain the underlying physics and emphasize its universal nature, we develop a hydrodynamic model that exhibits this crossover. For strong tilts, the subdiffusive transport rate is set by a thermal diffusivity, which we are thus able to measure as a function of tilt in this regime. We further support our understanding by probing the local inverse temperature of the system at strong tilts, finding good agreement with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we discuss the relation of the strongly tilted limit of our system to recently studied 1D models that may exhibit nonergodic dynamics.},

  abstract     = {It is widely assumed that photons cannot be manipulated using electric or magnetic fields. Even though hybridization of photons with electronic polarization to form exciton-polaritons has paved the way to a number of groundbreaking experiments in semiconductor microcavities, the neutral bosonic nature of these quasiparticles has severely limited their response to external gauge fields. Here, we demonstrate polariton acceleration by external electric and magnetic fields in the presence of nonperturbative coupling between polaritons and itinerant electrons, leading to formation of new quasiparticles termed polaron-polaritons. We identify the generation of electron density gradients by the applied fields to be primarily responsible for inducing a gradient in polariton energy, which in turn leads to acceleration along a direction determined by the applied fields. Remarkably, we also observe that different polarization components of the polaritons can be accelerated in opposite directions when the electrons are in ν = 1 integer quantum Hall state.},

  abstract     = {Driven-dissipative systems are expected to give rise to nonequilibrium phenomena that are absent in their equilibrium counterparts. However, phase transitions in these systems generically exhibit an effectively classical equilibrium behavior in spite of their nonequilibrium origin. In this paper, we show that multicritical points in such systems lead to a rich and genuinely nonequilibrium behavior. Specifically, we investigate a driven-dissipative model of interacting bosons that possesses two distinct phase transitions: one from a high- to a low-density phase—reminiscent of a liquid-gas transition—and another to an antiferromagnetic phase. Each phase transition is described by the Ising universality class characterized by an (emergent or microscopic) Z 2 symmetry. However, they coalesce at a multicritical point, giving rise to a nonequilibrium model of coupled Ising-like order parameters described by a Z 2 × Z 2 symmetry. Using a dynamical renormalization-group approach, we show that a pair of nonequilibrium fixed points (NEFPs) emerge that govern the long-distance critical behavior of the system. We elucidate various exotic features of these NEFPs. In particular, we show that a generic continuous scale invariance at criticality is reduced to a discrete scale invariance. This further results in complex-valued critical exponents and spiraling phase boundaries, and it is also accompanied by a complex Liouvillian gap even close to the phase transition. As direct evidence of the nonequilibrium nature of the NEFPs, we show that the fluctuation-dissipation relation is violated at all scales, leading to an effective temperature that becomes “hotter” and “hotter” at longer and longer wavelengths. Finally, we argue that this nonequilibrium behavior can be observed in cavity arrays with cross-Kerr nonlinearities.},

Aside from the straightforward benefit of allowing users to delegate computations to a more powerful server without revealing their inputs, a fully homomorphic cryptosystem can be used as a building block in the construction of a number of cryptographic functionalities. Designing such a scheme remained an open problem until 2009, decades after the idea was first conceived, and the past few years have seen the generalization of this functionality to the world of quantum machines. Quantum schemes prior to the one implemented here were able to replicate some features in particular use cases often associated with homomorphic encryption but lacked other crucial properties, for example, relying on continual interaction to perform a computation or leaking information about the encrypted data. We present the first experimental realization of a quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme. To demonstrate the versatility of a a quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme, we further present a toy two-party secure computation task enabled by our scheme.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a novel real-space renormalization group (RG) algorithm was introduced. By maximizing an information-theoretic quantity, the real-space mutual information, the algorithm identifies the relevant low-energy degrees of freedom. Motivated by this insight, we investigate the information-theoretic properties of coarse-graining procedures for both translationally invariant and disordered systems. We prove that a perfect real-space mutual information coarse graining does not increase the range of interactions in the renormalized Hamiltonian, and, for disordered systems, it suppresses the generation of correlations in the renormalized disorder distribution, being in this sense optimal . We empirically verify decay of those measures of complexity as a function of information retained by the RG, on the examples of arbitrary coarse grainings of the clean and random Ising chain. The results establish a direct and quantifiable connection between properties of RG viewed as a compression scheme and those of physical objects, i.e., Hamiltonians and disorder distributions. We also study the effect of constraints on the number and type of coarse-grained degrees of freedom on a generic RG procedure.},

  abstract     = {The importance of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect in Fe-based superconductors (FeSCs) has recently been under hot debate. Considering the Hund’s coupling-induced electronic correlation, the understanding of the role of SOC in FeSCs is not trivial and is still elusive. Here, through a comprehensive study of Se 77 and Fe 57 nuclear magnetic resonance, a nontrivial SOC effect is revealed in the nematic state of FeSe. First, the orbital-dependent spin susceptibility, determined by the anisotropy of the Fe 57 Knight shift, indicates a predominant role from the 3 d x y orbital, which suggests the coexistence of local and itinerant spin degrees of freedom in the FeSe. Then, we reconfirm that the orbital reconstruction below the nematic transition temperature ( T nem ∼ 90 K ) happens not only on the 3 d x z and 3 d y z orbitals but also on the 3 d x y orbital, which is beyond a trivial ferro-orbital order picture. Moreover, our results also indicate the development of a coherent coupling between the local and itinerant spin degrees of freedom below T nem , which is ascribed to a Hund’s coupling-induced electronic crossover on the 3 d x y orbital. Finally, because of a nontrivial SOC effect, sizable in-plane anisotropy of the spin susceptibility emerges in the nematic state, suggesting a spin-orbital-intertwined nematicity rather than a simple spin- or orbital-driven nematicity. The present work not only reveals a nontrivial SOC effect in the nematic state but also sheds light on the mechanism of nematic transition in FeSe.},

  abstract     = {The interplay of symmetry and topology has been at the forefront of recent progress in quantum matter. Here, we uncover an unexpected connection between band topology and the description of competing orders in a quantum magnet. Specifically, we show that aspects of band topology protected by crystalline symmetries determine key properties of the Dirac spin liquid (DSL), which can be defined on the honeycomb, square, triangular, and kagome lattices. At low energies, the DSL on all of these lattices is described by an emergent quantum electrodynamics ( QED 3 ) with N f = 4 flavors of Dirac fermions coupled to a U ( 1 ) gauge field. However, the symmetry properties of the magnetic monopoles, an important class of critical degrees of freedom, behave very differently on different lattices. In particular, we show that the lattice momentum and angular momentum of monopoles can be determined from the charge (or Wannier) centers of the corresponding spinon insulator. We also show that for DSLs on bipartite lattices, there always exists a monopole that transforms trivially under all microscopic symmetries owing to the existence of a parent S U ( 2 ) gauge theory. We connect our results to generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems and also derive the time-reversal and reflection properties of monopoles. Our results indicate that recent insights into free-fermion band topology can also guide the description of strongly correlated quantum matter.},

We study its properties when the system is close to its critical point. Even if this model violates detailed balance, within a physically relevant regime dominated by fluctuations, it is possible to calculate analytically the probability density function of the number of individuals living in a given volume, which captures the close-to-critical behavior of the community across spatial scales. We find that the resulting distribution satisfies an equation where spatial effects are encoded in appropriate functions of space, which we calculate explicitly. The validity of the analytical formulae is confirmed by simulations in the expected regimes. We finally discuss how this model in the critical-like regime is in agreement with several biodiversity patterns observed in tropical rain forests.},

While these processes crucially involve the ill-understood local mechanics of the nanotube, existing micromanipulation assays only give access to its global mechanical properties. Here we develop a new platform to study this local mechanics using atomic force microscopy (AFM). On a single coverslip we quickly generate millions of substrate-bound nanotubes, out of which dozens can be imaged by AFM in a single experiment. A full theoretical description of the AFM tip-membrane interaction allows us to accurately relate AFM measurements of the nanotube heights, widths, and rigidities to the membrane bending rigidity and tension, thus demonstrating our assay as an accurate probe of nanotube mechanics. We reveal a universal relationship between nanotube height and rigidity, which is unaffected by the specific conditions of attachment to the substrate. Moreover, we show that the parabolic shape of force-displacement curves results from thermal fluctuations of the membrane that collides intermittently with the AFM tip. We also show that membrane nanotubes can exhibit high resilience against extreme lateral compression. Finally, we mimic in vivo actin polymerization on nanotubes and use AFM to assess the induced changes in nanotube physical properties. Our assay may help unravel the local mechanics of membrane-protein interactions, including membrane remodeling in nanotube scission and vesicle formation.},

This approach is particularly promising in gases of ultracold atoms, where sophisticated shaking protocols can be realized and interparticle interactions are well controlled. The combination of interactions and time-periodic driving, however, often leads to uncontrollable heating and instabilities, potentially preventing practical applications of Floquet engineering in large many-body quantum systems. In this work, we experimentally identify the existence of parametric instabilities in weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates in strongly driven optical lattices through momentum-resolved measurements, in line with theoretical predictions. Parametric instabilities can trigger the destruction of weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates through the rapid growth of collective excitations, in particular in systems with weak harmonic confinement transverse to the lattice axis. Understanding the onset of parametric instabilities in driven quantum matter is crucial for determining optimal conditions for the engineering of modulation-induced many-body systems.},

We compare students’ engagement with experimentation during the lab as well as the impacts on students’ exam performance and attitudes and beliefs about experimental physics. We find no measurable differences between lab conditions on students’ exam performance. Nonetheless, we find measurable and significant improvements in students’ engagement in expertlike experimentation practices and attitudes and beliefs about experimental physics for students in the experimentation labs.

Tailoring the viscoelastic features of colloidal gels in real time thanks to an external stimulus currently appears as a major challenge in the design of “smart” soft materials. Here we introduce “rheoacoustic” gels, a class of materials that are sensitive to ultrasonic vibrations. By using a combination of rheological and structural characterization, we evidence and quantify a strong softening in three widely different colloidal gels submitted to ultrasonic vibrations (with submicron amplitude and frequency 20–500 kHz). This softening is attributed to micron-sized cracks within the gel network that may or may not fully heal once vibrations are turned off depending on the acoustic intensity. Ultrasonic vibrations are further shown to dramatically decrease the gel yield stress and accelerate shear-induced fluidization. Ultrasound-assisted fluidization dynamics appear to be governed by an effective temperature that depends on the acoustic intensity. Our work opens the way to a full control of elastic and flow properties by ultrasonic vibrations as well as to future theoretical and numerical modeling of such rheoacoustic gels.},

  abstract     = {There is much interest in employing terahertz (THz) radiation across a range of imaging applications, but so far, technologies have struggled to achieve the necessary frame rates. Here, we demonstrate a THz imaging system based upon efficient THz-to-optical conversion in atomic vapor, where full-field images can be collected at ultrahigh speeds using conventional optical camera technology. For a 0.55-THz field, we show an effective 1 − cm 2 sensor with near diffraction-limited spatial resolution and a minimum detectable power of ( 190 ± 30 ) fW s − 1 / 2 per ( 40 × 40 ) μ m 2 pixel capable of video capture at 3000 frames per second. This combination of speed and sensitivity represents a step change in the state of the art of THz imaging and will likely lead to its uptake in wider industrial settings.},

We find two different surface states in ZrSiTe—topological drumhead surface states and trivial floating band surface states, which can be easily distinguished in ARPES experiments. Using the spectra of Wilson loops, we show that a nontrivial Berry phase that exists in a confined region within the Brillouin zone gives rise to the topological drumhead-type surface states. The Z 2 structure of the Berry phase induces a Z 2 “modular arithmetic” of the surface states, allowing surface states derived from different nodal lines to hybridize and gap out, which can be probed by a set of Wilson loops. Our findings are confirmed by ab initio calculations and angle-resolved photoemission experiments, which are in excellent agreement with each other and the topological analysis. This work is the first complete characterization of topological surface states in the family of square-net-based nodal line semimetals, and thus it fundamentally increases the understanding of the topological nature of this growing class of topological semimetals.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies reveal a crucial effect of symmetries on the properties of a single particle moving in a disorder potential. More recently, a phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL) has been attracting much theoretical and experimental interest. MBL systems are characterized by the emergence of quasilocal integrals of motion and by the area-law entanglement entropy scaling of its eigenstates. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a non-Abelian S U ( 2 ) symmetry on the dynamical properties of a disordered Heisenberg chain. While S U ( 2 ) symmetry is inconsistent with conventional MBL, a new nonergodic regime is possible. In this regime, the eigenstates exhibit faster than area-law, but still strongly subthermal, scaling of the entanglement entropy. Using extensive exact diagonalization simulations, we establish that this nonergodic regime is indeed realized in the strongly disordered Heisenberg chains. We use the real-space renormalization group (RSRG) to construct approximate excited eigenstates by tree tensor networks and demonstrate the accuracy of this procedure for systems of sizes up to L = 26 . As the effective disorder strength is decreased, a crossover to the thermalizing phase occurs. To establish the ultimate fate of the nonergodic regime in the thermodynamic limit, we develop a novel approach for describing many-body processes that are usually neglected by the RSRG. This approach is capable of describing systems of size L ≈ 2000 . We characterize the resonances that arise due to such processes, finding that they involve an ever-growing number of spins as the system size is increased. Crucially, the probability of finding resonances grows with the system’s size. Even at strong disorder, we can identify a large length scale beyond which resonances proliferate. Presumably, this proliferation would eventually drive the system to a thermalizing phase. However, the extremely long thermalization timescales indicate that a broad nonergodic regime will be observable experimentally. Our study demonstrates that, similar to the case of single-particle localization, symmetries control dynamical properties of disordered, many-body systems. The approach introduced here provides a versatile tool for describing a broad range of disordered many-body systems, well beyond sizes accessible in previous studies.},

To address this issue we derive, via-principles calculations, essential facts related to the electronic structure and magnetism of R NiO 2 ( R = La , Nd) in comparison to their cuprate analog CaCuO 2 . From this detailed comparison, we find that R NiO 2 are promising as cuprate analogs. Besides the much larger d − p energy splitting, and the presence of R 5 d states near the Fermi energy in the parent compound, all other electronic-structure parameters seem to be favorable in the context of superconductivity as inferred from the cuprates. In particular, the large value of the longer-range hopping t ′ and the e g energy splitting are similar to those obtained in cuprates. Doping further acts to increase the cupratelike character of these nickelates by suppressing the self-doping effect of the R 5 d bands.},

Here, we apply it to the canonical problem of fluid dynamics: three-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. By doing numerical experiments we perform a systematic assessment of how well the technique reconstructs large- and small-scale features of the flow with respect to the quantity and the quality or type of data supplied to it. The types of data used are (i) field values on a fixed number of spatial locations (Eulerian nudging), (ii) Fourier coefficients of the fields on a fixed range of wave numbers (Fourier nudging), or (iii) field values along a set of moving probes inside the flow (Lagrangian nudging). We present state-of-the-art quantitative measurements of the scale-by-scale transition to synchronization and a detailed discussion of the probability distribution function of the reconstruction error, by comparing the nudged field and the truth point by point. Furthermore, we show that for more complex flow configurations, like the case of anisotropic rotating turbulence, the presence of cyclonic and anticyclonic structures leads to unexpectedly better performances of the algorithm. We discuss potential further applications of nudging to a series of applied flow configurations, including the problem of field reconstruction in thermal Rayleigh-Bénard convection and in magnetohydrodynamics, and to the determination of optimal parametrization for small-scale turbulent modeling. Our study fixes the standard requirements for future applications of nudging to complex turbulent flows.},

Both code families are implemented by assigning physical data and ancilla qubits to both vertices and edges of low-degree graphs. Such a layout is particularly suitable for superconducting qubit architectures to minimize frequency collisions and cross talk. In some cases, frequency collisions can be reduced by several orders of magnitude. The heavy-hexagon code is a hybrid surface and Bacon-Shor code mapped onto a (heavy-) hexagonal lattice, whereas the heavy-square code is the surface code mapped onto a (heavy-) square lattice. In both cases, the lattice includes all the ancilla qubits required for fault-tolerant error correction. Naively, the limited qubit connectivity might be thought to limit the error-correcting capability of the code to less than its full distance. Therefore, essential to our construction is the use of flag qubits. We modify minimum-weight perfect-matching decoding to efficiently and scalably incorporate information from measurements of the flag qubits and correct up to the full code distance while respecting the limited connectivity. Simulations show that high threshold values for both codes can be obtained using our decoding protocol. Further, our decoding scheme can be adapted to other topological code families.},

The basic unit of information in these traces is the arrival time of individual photons, which carry instantaneous information from the molecule, from which they are emitted, to the detector on timescales as fast as microseconds. Thus, it is theoretically possible to monitor molecular dynamics at such timescales from traces containing only a sufficient number of photon arrivals. In practice, however, traces are stochastic and in order to deduce dynamical information through traditional means—such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and related techniques—they are collected and temporally autocorrelated over several minutes. So far, it has been impossible to analyze dynamical properties of molecules on timescales approaching data acquisition without collecting long traces under the strong assumption of stationarity of the process under observation or assumptions required for the analytic derivation of a correlation function. To avoid these assumptions, we would otherwise need to estimate the instantaneous number of molecules emitting photons and their positions within the confocal volume. As the number of molecules in a typical experiment is unknown, this problem demands that we abandon the conventional analysis paradigm. Here, we exploit Bayesian nonparametrics that allow us to obtain, in a principled fashion, estimates of the same quantities as FCS but from the direct analysis of traces of photon arrivals that are significantly smaller in size, or total duration, than those required by FCS.},

Here, we develop a general pathway to extract the irreducible building blocks of quantum field theoretical descriptions and its parameters purely from experimental data. This determination is accomplished by extracting the one-particle irreducible (1PI) correlation functions from which one can construct all physical observables. To match the capabilities of experimental techniques, our approach employs a formulation of quantum field theory based on equal-time correlation functions only. We illustrate the theoretical foundations of our procedure by applying it to the sine-Gordon model in thermal equilibrium and then demonstrate explicitly how to extract these quantities from an experiment where we quantum simulate the sine-Gordon model by two tunnel-coupled superfluids. We extract all 1PI correlation functions up to the 1PI four-point function (interaction vertex) and their variation with momentum, encoding the “running” of the couplings. The measured 1PI correlation functions are compared to the theoretical estimates, verifying our procedure.

  abstract     = {Heat conduction in dielectric crystals originates from the dynamics of atomic vibrations, whose evolution is well described by the linearized Boltzmann transport equation for the phonon populations. Recently, it was shown that thermal conductivity can be resolved exactly and in a closed form as a sum over relaxons, i.e., collective phonon excitations that are the eigenvectors of Boltzmann equation’s scattering matrix [A. Cepellotti and N. Marzari, Phys. Rev. X 6 , 041013 (2016) ]. Relaxons have a well-defined parity, and only odd relaxons contribute to the thermal conductivity. Here, we show that the complementary set of even relaxons determines another quantity—the thermal viscosity—that enters into the description of heat transport, and is especially relevant in the hydrodynamic regime, where dissipation of crystal momentum by umklapp scattering phases out. We also show how the thermal conductivity and viscosity parametrize two novel viscous heat equations—two coupled equations for the temperature and drift-velocity fields—which represent the thermal counterpart of the Navier-Stokes equations of hydrodynamics in the linear, laminar regime. These viscous heat equations are derived from a coarse graining of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation for phonons, and encompass both the limit of Fourier’s law and that of second sound, taking place, respectively, in the regime of strong or weak momentum dissipation. Last, we introduce the Fourier deviation number as a descriptor that captures the deviations from Fourier’s law due to hydrodynamic effects. We showcase these findings in a test case of a complex-shaped device made of graphite, obtaining a remarkable agreement with the recent experimental demonstration of hydrodynamic transport in this material, and also suggesting that hydrodynamic behavior can appear at room temperature in micrometer-sized diamond crystals. The present formulation rigorously generalizes Fourier’s heat equation, extending the reach of physical and computational models for heat conduction also to the hydrodynamic regime.},

By improving measurements and at the same time minimizing perturbation of the environment, they form a central asset for quantum technologies.

Controlling inelastic spin-exchange processes between the probe and bath allows us to map motional and thermal information onto quantum-spin states. We show that the steady-state spin population is well suited for absolute thermometry, reducing temperature measurements to detection of quantum-spin distributions. Moreover, we find that the information gain per inelastic collision can be maximized by accessing the nonequilibrium spin dynamic. Keeping the motional degree of freedom thermalized, individual spin-exchange collisions yield information about the gas quantum by quantum. We find that the sensitivity of this nonequilibrium quantum probing effectively beats the steady-state Cramér-Rao limit by almost an order of magnitude, while reducing the perturbation of the bath to only three quanta of angular momentum. Our work paves the way for local probing of quantum systems at the Heisenberg limit, and moreover, for optimizing measurement strategies via control of nonequilibrium dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We address the long-standing problem of the structure of the low-energy eigenstates and long-time coherent dynamics in quantum spin-glass models. Below the spin-glass freezing transition, the energy landscape of the spin system is characterized by a proliferation of local minima where classical dynamics gets trapped. A theoretical description of quantum dynamics in this regime is challenging due to the complex nature of the distribution of the tunneling matrix elements between the local minima of the energy landscape. We study the transverse-field-induced quantum dynamics of the following “impurity band” (IB) spin model: zero energy of all spin configurations except for a small fraction of spin configurations (“marked states”) that form a narrow band at a large negative energy. At a zero transverse field, the IB model demonstrates the freezing transition at inverse temperature β f ∼ 1 characterized by a nonzero value of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter. At a finite transverse field, the low-energy dynamics can be described by the effective down-folded Hamiltonian that acts in the Hilbert subspace involving only the marked states. We obtain in an explicit form the heavy-tailed probability distribution of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the down-folded Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian is dense and belongs to the class of preferred basis Levy matrices. Analytically solving nonlinear cavity equations for the ensemble of down-folded Hamiltonians allows us to describe the statistical properties of the eigenstates. In a broad interval of transverse fields, they are nonergodic, albeit extended. It means that the band of marked states splits into a set of narrow minibands. Accordingly, the quantum evolution that starts from a particular marked state leads to a linear combination of the states belonging to a particular miniband. An analytical description of this qualitatively new type of quantum dynamics is a key result of our paper. Based on our analysis, we propose the population transfer (PT) algorithm: The quantum evolution under constant transverse field B ⊥ starts at a low-energy spin configuration and ends up in a superposition of Ω spin configurations inside a narrow energy window. This algorithm crucially relies on the nonergodic nature of delocalized low-energy eigenstates. In the considered model, the run-time of the best classical algorithm (exhaustive search) is t cl = 2 n / Ω . For n ≫ B ⊥ ≫ 1 , the typical run-time of the quantum PT algorithm t cl e n / ( 2 B ⊥ 2 ) scales with n and Ω as that of Grover’s quantum search, except for the small correction to the exponent. Unlike the Hamiltonians proposed for analog quantum unstructured search algorithms, the model we consider is nonintegrable and the transverse field delocalizes the marked states. As a result, our PT protocol does not require fine-tuning of the transverse field and may be initialized in a computational basis state. We find that the run-times of the PT algorithm are distributed according to the alpha-stable Levy law with tail index 1. We argue that our approach can be applied to study the PT protocol in other transverse-field spin-glass models, with a potential quantum advantage over classical algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Key to collective cell migration is the ability of cells to rearrange their position with respect to their neighbors. Recent theory and experiments demonstrate that cellular rearrangements are facilitated by cell shape, with cells having more elongated shapes and greater perimeters more easily sliding past their neighbors within the cell layer. Though it is thought that cell perimeter is controlled primarily by cortical tension and adhesion at each cell’s periphery, experimental testing of this hypothesis has produced conflicting results. Here we study collective migration in an epithelial monolayer by measuring forces, cell perimeters, and motion, and find all three to decrease with either increased cell density or inhibition of cell contraction. In contrast to previous understanding, the data suggest that cell shape and rearrangements are controlled not by cortical tension or adhesion at the cell periphery but rather by the stress fibers that produce tractions at the cell-substrate interface. This finding is confirmed by an experiment showing that increasing tractions reverses the effect of density on cell shape and rearrangements. Our study therefore reduces the focus on the cell periphery by establishing cell-substrate traction as a major physical factor controlling shape and motion in collective cell migration.},

  abstract     = {Evaluating the nonlinear dynamics of human descending thoracic aortas is essential for building the next generation of vascular prostheses. This study characterizes the nonlinear dynamics, viscoelastic material properties, and fluid-structure interaction of 11 ex-vivo human descending thoracic aortas the full range of physiological heart rates. The aortic segments are harvested from heart-beating donors screened for transplants. A mock circulatory loop is developed to reproduce physiological pulsatile pressure and flow. The results show cyclic axisymmetric diameter changes, which are satisfactorily compared to in-vivo measurements at a resting pulse rate of 60 bpm, with an additional bending vibration. An increase of the dynamic stiffness (i.e., storage modulus) with age is also observed. This increase is accompanied by a strong reduction with age of the cyclic diameter change during the heart pulsation at 60 bpm and by a significant reduction of the loss factor (i.e., damping). Large dissipation is observed at higher pulse rates due to the combined effects of fluid-structure interaction and viscoelasticity of the aortic wall. This study presents data necessary for developing innovative grafts that better mimic the dynamics of the aorta.},

  abstract     = {Here, we report the investigation of the anomalous Hall effect in the magnetically doped topological insulator ( V , Bi , Sb ) 2 Te 3 . We find it contains two contributions of opposite sign. Both components are found to depend differently on carrier density, leading to a sign inversion of the total anomalous Hall effect as a function of applied gate voltage. The two contributions are found to have different magnetization reversal fields, which in combination with a temperature dependent study points towards the coexistence of two ferromagnetic orders in the system. Moreover, we find that the sign of total anomalous Hall response of the system depends on the thickness and magnetic doping density of the magnetic layer. The thickness dependence suggests that the two ferromagnetic components originate from the surface and bulk of the magnetic topological insulator film. We believe that our observations provide insight into the magnetic behavior, and thus will contribute to an eventual understanding of the origin of magnetism in this material class. In addition, our data bear a striking resemblance to anomalous Hall signals often associated with skyrmion contributions. Our analysis provides a straightforward explanation for both the magnetic field dependence of the Hall signal and the observed change in sign without needing to invoke skyrmions, and thus suggest that caution is needed when making claims of effects from skyrmion phases.},

  abstract     = {Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) has been a key enabling technology in exploring quantum phenomena and their applications for decades. For instance, traditional SPDC, which splits a high-energy pump photon into two lower-energy photons, is a common way to produce entangled photon pairs. Since the early realizations of SPDC, researchers have thought to generalize it to higher order, e.g., to produce entangled photon triplets. However, directly generating photon triplets through a single SPDC process has remained elusive. Here, using a flux-pumped superconducting parametric cavity, we demonstrate direct three-photon SPDC, with photon triplets generated in a single cavity mode or split between multiple modes. With strong pumping, the states can be quite bright, with flux densities exceeding 60 photons per second per hertz. The observed states are strongly non-Gaussian, which has important implications for potential applications. In the single-mode case, we observe a triangular star-shaped distribution of quadrature voltages, indicative of the long-predicted “star state.” The observed state shows strong third-order correlations, as expected for a state generated by a cubic Hamiltonian. By pumping at the sum frequency of multiple modes, we observe strong three-body correlations between multiple modes, strikingly, in the absence of second-order correlations. We further analyze the third-order correlations under mode transformations by the symplectic symmetry group, showing that the observed transformation properties serve to “fingerprint” the specific cubic Hamiltonian that generates them. The observed non-Gaussian, third-order correlations represent an important step forward in quantum optics and may have a strong impact on quantum communication with microwave fields as well as continuous-variable quantum computation.},

Unlike hydrostatic compression, uniaxial strains inherent to shock compression result in plastic deformation and abundant lattice defects. At high pressures ( &gt; 50 GPa ), the role of shock-induced deformation and defects remains an open question. Because of the nanosecond time scales in shock experiments, real-time in situ observations of shock-induced lattice defects have been challenging. Here, we present synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements on laser-shock-compressed gold that provide the first unambiguous in situ measurements of stacking faults (SFs), likely formed by partial dislocations, during shock compression. SF abundance increases monotonically with shock compression up to 150 GPa, where SFs comprise almost every 6th atomic layer. Our results show that SFs play an important role in the plastic deformation of face-centered-cubic metals shocked to high stresses, providing a quantitative benchmark for future theoretical developments.},

In this work, we develop an ab initio few-mode theory, a framework connecting few-mode system-bath models to ab initio methods. We first present a method to derive exact few-mode Hamiltonians for noninteracting quantum potential scattering problems and demonstrate how to rigorously reconstruct the scattering matrix from such few-mode Hamiltonians. We show that, upon inclusion of a background scattering contribution, an ab initio version of the well-known input-output formalism is equivalent to standard scattering theory. On the basis of these exact results for noninteracting systems, we construct an effective few-mode expansion scheme for interacting theories, which allows us to extract the relevant degrees of freedom from a continuum in an open quantum system. As a whole, our results demonstrate that few-mode as well as input-output models can be extended to a general class of problems and open up the associated toolbox to be applied to various platforms and extreme regimes. We outline differences of the ab initio results to standard model assumptions, which may lead to qualitatively different effects in certain regimes. The formalism is exemplified in various simple physical scenarios. In the process, we provide a proof of concept of the method, demonstrate important properties of the expansion scheme, and exemplify new features in extreme regimes.},

Despite these practical roots, however, quantum theory is infamous for being highly counterintuitive, largely due to its intrinsically probabilistic nature. Neural networks have recently emerged as a powerful tool that can extract nontrivial correlations in vast datasets. These networks routinely outperform state-of-the-art techniques in language translation, medical diagnosis, and image recognition. It remains to be seen if neural networks can be trained to predict stochastic quantum evolution without a priori specifying the rules of quantum theory. Here, we demonstrate that a recurrent neural network can be trained in real time to infer the individual quantum trajectories associated with the evolution of a superconducting qubit under unitary evolution, decoherence, and continuous measurement from physical observations only. The network extracts the system Hamiltonian, measurement operators, and physical parameters. It is also able to perform tomography of an unknown initial state without any prior calibration. This method has the potential to greatly simplify and enhance tasks in quantum systems such as noise characterization, parameter estimation, feedback, and optimization of quantum control.},

Instead, their maximum matchings have a monomer density of 81 − 50 φ ≈ 0.098 in the thermodynamic limit, with φ = ( 1 + 5 ) / 2 the golden ratio. Maximum matchings divide the tiling into a fractal of nested closed regions bounded by loops that cannot be crossed by monomers. These loops connect second-nearest-neighbor even-valence vertices, each of which lies on such a loop. Assigning a charge to each monomer with a sign fixed by its bipartite sublattice, we find that each bounded region has an excess of one charge, and a corresponding set of monomers, with adjacent regions having opposite net charge. The infinite tiling is charge neutral. We devise a simple algorithm for generating maximum matchings and demonstrate that maximum matchings form a connected manifold under local monomer-dimer rearrangements. We show that dart-kite Penrose tilings feature an imbalance of charge between bipartite sublattices, leading to a minimum monomer density of ( 7 − 4 φ ) / 5 ≈ 0.106 all of one charge.},

This approximation allows one to treat more difficult problems using fewer qubits and lower gate depths than would otherwise be possible. However, while this approximation captures many important qualitative features, it may leave the results wanting in terms of absolute accuracy (basis error) of the representation. In traditional approaches, increasing this accuracy requires increasing the number of qubits and an appropriate increase in circuit depth as well. Here we explore two techniques requiring no additional qubits or circuit depth that are able to remove much of this approximation in favor of additional measurements. The techniques are constructed and analyzed theoretically, and some numerical proof-of-concept calculations are shown. As an example, we show how to achieve the accuracy of a 20-qubit representation using only four qubits and a modest number of additional measurements for a hydrogen molecule. We close with an outlook on the impact such techniques may have on both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum simulations.},

By synchronizing pulsed photoexcitation with dynamical decoupling of the sensor spin, we extend the sensor’s quantum coherence and resolve time-dependent, two-dimensional current densities as small as 20 nA / μ m , with a projected sensitivity of 200 nA / ( μ m Hz ) . Our spatially resolved measurements reveal that optical excitation can generate micron-sized photocurrent vortices in MoS 2 , manifesting a photo-Nernst effect exceeding that of gate-tuned graphene at comparable magnetic fields. We further probe the rise time of the photocurrents and show that thermal diffusion determines its spatial variation. These spatiotemporal capabilities establish an optically accessed, local probe for optoelectronic phenomena, ideally suited to the emerging class of two-dimensional materials, for which making contacts is challenging and can alter the intrinsic material properties.},

  abstract     = {Following significant progress in the visualization and characterization of Majorana end modes in hybrid systems of semiconducting nanowires and superconducting islands, much attention is devoted to the investigation of the electronic structure at the buried interface between the semiconductor and the superconductor. The properties of that interface and the structure of the electronic wave functions that occupy it determine the functionality and the topological nature of the superconducting state induced therein. Here we study this buried interface by performing spectroscopic mappings of superconducting aluminum islands epitaxially grown in situ on indium arsenide nanowires. We find unexpected robustness of the hybrid system as the direct contact with the aluminum islands does not lead to any change in the chemical potential of the nanowires, nor does it induce a significant band bending in their vicinity. We attribute this to the presence of surface states bound to the facets of the nanowire. Such surface states, which are present also in bare nanowires prior to aluminum deposition, pin the Fermi level, thus rendering the nanowires resilient to surface perturbations. The aluminum islands further display Coulomb blockade gaps and peaks that signify the formation of a resistive tunneling barrier at the InAs-Al interface. The extracted interface resistivity, ρ ≈ 1.3 × 10 − 6 Ω cm 2 , will allow us to proximity induce superconductivity with negligible Coulomb blockade effects by islands with interface area as small as 0.01 μ m 2 . At low energies we identify a potential energy barrier that further suppresses the transmittance through the interface. A corresponding barrier exists in bare semiconductors between surface states and the accumulation layer, induced to maintain charge neutrality. Our observations elucidate the delicate interplay between the resistive nature of the InAs-Al interface and the ability to proximitize superconductivity and tune the chemical potential in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid nanowires.},

  abstract     = {Qubit measurements are central to quantum information processing. In the field of superconducting qubits, standard readout techniques are limited not only by the signal-to-noise ratio, but also by state relaxation during the measurement. In this work, we demonstrate that the limitation due to relaxation can be suppressed by using the many-level Hilbert space of superconducting circuits: In a multilevel encoding, the measurement is corrupted only when multiple errors occur. Employing this technique, we show that we can directly resolve transmon gate errors at the level of one part in 1 0 3 . Extending this idea, we apply the same principles to the measurement of a logical qubit encoded in a bosonic mode and detected with a transmon ancilla, implementing a proposal by Hann et al. [ Phys. Rev. A 98 , 022305 (2018) ]. Qubit state assignments are made based on a sequence of repeated readouts, further reducing the overall infidelity. This approach is quite general, and several encodings are studied; the codewords are more distinguishable when the distance between them is increased with respect to photon loss. The trade-off between multiple readouts and state relaxation is explored and shown to be consistent with the photon-loss model. We report a logical assignment infidelity of 5.8 × 10 − 5 for a Fock-based encoding and 4.2 × 10 − 3 for a quantum error correction code (the S = 2 , N = 1 binomial code). Our results not only improve the fidelity of quantum information applications, but also enable more precise characterization of process or gate errors.},
