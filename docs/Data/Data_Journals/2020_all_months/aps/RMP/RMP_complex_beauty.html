  abstract = {Double-beta processes play a key role in the exploration of neutrino and weak interaction properties, and in the searches for effects beyond the standard model. During the last half century many attempts were undertaken to search for double-beta decay with emission of two electrons, especially for its neutrinoless mode 0 ν 2 β − , the latter having still not been observed. Double-electron capture (2EC) was not yet in focus because of its in general lower transition probability. However, the rate of neutrinoless double-electron capture 0 ν 2 EC can experience a resonance enhancement by many orders of magnitude when the initial and final states are energetically degenerate. In the resonant case, the sensitivity of the 0 ν 2 EC process can approach the sensitivity of the 0 ν 2 β − decay in the search for the Majorana mass of neutrinos, right-handed currents, and other new physics. An overview of the main experimental and theoretical results obtained during the last decade in this field is presented. The experimental part outlines search results of 2EC processes and measurements of the decay energies for possible resonant 0 ν 2 EC transitions. An unprecedented precision in the determination of decay energies with Penning traps has allowed one to refine the values of the degeneracy parameter for all previously known near-resonant decays and has reduced the rather large uncertainties in the estimate of the 0 ν 2 EC half-lives. The theoretical part contains an updated analysis of the electron shell effects and an overview of the nuclear-structure models, in which the nuclear matrix elements of the 0 ν 2 EC decays are calculated. One can conclude that the decay probability of 0 ν 2 EC can experience a significant enhancement in several nuclides.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in taking the large dimension limit of Einstein’s equations is reviewed. Most of the analysis is classical and concerns situations where there is a black hole horizon, although various extensions that include quantum gravitational effects are discussed. The review consists of two main parts: the first is a discussion of general aspects of black holes and effective membrane theories in this large dimension limit, and the second is a series of applications of this limit to interesting physical problems. The first part includes a discussion of quasinormal modes that leads naturally into a description of effective hydrodynamiclike equations that describe the near-horizon geometry. There are two main approaches to these effective theories, a fully covariant approach and a partially gauge-fixed one, which are discussed in relation to each other. In the second part the applications are divided up into three main categories: the Gregory-Laflamme instability, black hole collisions and mergers, and the anti–de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence ( AdS / CFT ). AdS / CFT posits an equivalence between a gravitational theory and a strongly interacting field theory, allowing the spectrum of applications to be extended to problems in hydrodynamics, condensed matter physics, and nuclear physics. The final, shorter part of the review describes further promising directions where there have been, as yet, few published research articles.},

  abstract = {This review addresses experiments on elasticity, plasticity, and flow of solid He 4 and He 3 , focusing on dislocations and other defects that are responsible for the unusual mechanical behavior of such quantum crystals. Helium’s zero point motion prevents it from freezing unless pressure is applied and makes the solid extremely compressible, with elastic constants orders of magnitude smaller than those of conventional solids. Tunneling allows defects to remain mobile at low temperatures, so dislocations have much larger effects on mechanical properties than in conventional solids. At temperatures below 400 mK, dislocations in hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) He 4 are essentially undamped and, in the absence of pinning by He 3 impurities, glide freely in the basal plane. In this regime, dislocation motion reduces the shear modulus by as much as 90\%, an effect that has been referred to as “giant plasticity” although it is reversible and so might be better described as “softening.” In this low temperature regime, macroscopic plastic deformation occurs via sudden dislocation avalanches with a wide range of time and length scales. At higher temperatures, dislocation motion is damped, introducing dissipation in elastic measurements, and thermally activated defect motion makes helium crystals extremely ductile, flowing under millibar stresses near melting. During the last decade, most of the properties of the dislocations that are responsible for the elastic effects described in this review have been accurately measured: their orientation, density, and length distributions, the nature of their networks, and their binding to isotopic impurities. Despite this detailed understanding of mobile dislocations, there remain open questions. Much less is known about defects’ roles in the elastic and plastic behavior of hcp and bcc He 3 crystals and even in hcp He 4 , and almost nothing is known about other types of dislocations that are immobile and thus do not affect elastic properties. These might be responsible for recently observed superfluidlike mass flow in He 4 at low temperatures, although it is now clear that the apparent mass decoupling seen in torsional oscillator experiments with solid He 4 was due to the elastic effects described in this review, not to supersolidity.},

  abstract = {Quantum crystallization of He 4 is a first-order phase transition from a superfluid liquid and can proceed extremely quickly at particularly low temperatures. The entropy difference between the two quantum phases, the quantum crystal and superfluid liquid, is small and atoms are carried to the crystal surface via a dissipationless superflow. A limiting process of the transition near absolute zero temperature is quasiparticle scattering off the crystal surface, which is less frequent at lower temperatures. It is known that interfacial phenomena, such as crystallization wave propagations and total reflection of ultrasound, occur on He 4 crystal surfaces as a result of the rapid crystallization. The rapid crystallization allows the fundamental physics of crystal shape and growth to be examined in a measurable timescale in laboratories, which otherwise cannot be observed in classical crystals. This Colloquium describes far from equilibrium phenomena of significantly deformed He 4 quantum crystals when they are subjected to original driving forces, which are small and usually believed to be irrelevant for ordinary classical crystals. Using driving forces such as gravity, superflow, wettability, acoustic waves, container oscillations, and frictional forces, He 4 crystals are placed under highly nonequilibrium conditions, showing various kinds of extraordinary crystallization and relaxation processes in a superfluid liquid. Rapid crystal shape deformations sometimes influence the surrounding superfluid field in return, resulting in instabilities of the flat crystal surface. Direct visualizations by a high-speed video camera are made, providing an unambiguous observation of the dynamics far from equilibrium of He 4 quantum crystals at extremely low temperatures.},

The resulting thermodynamic potentials all assume the form as the difference of the potentials for the total system and the bare environment in the absence of the system. In contrast to work as a mechanical notion, one faces several problems with the definition of heat, which turns out to be largely ambiguous in the case of strong coupling between system and environment. The general theory of the thermodynamics of open systems, in particular, in view of strong coupling, is reviewed and illustrated it with several examples. The vagueness of heat is discussed in the context of the ambiguities in the definitions of a fluctuating internal energy and other fluctuating thermodynamic potentials.},

  abstract = {The Sun is our nearest star; it is also the most important star that determines life on Earth. A large variety of phenomena observed on the Sun’s surface, with potential impact on Earth, is thought to arise from turbulent convection in Sun’s interior, this being the dominant mode of heat transport within the outer envelope at r ≳ 0.715 R ⊙ . However, convection in the Sun differs in most of its aspects from convection processes known on Earth, certainly those under controlled laboratory conditions, thus seriously challenging existing physical models of convective turbulence and boundary conditions in the Sun. Solar convection is a multiscale-multiphysics phenomenon including the transport of mass, momentum, and heat in the presence of rotation, dynamo action, radiation fluxes, and partial changes in chemical composition. Standard variables of state such as pressure, mass density, and temperature vary over several orders of magnitude within the convection region, thus introducing immense stratification. Although the Sun has been explored intensely, observational evidence on the structure and intensity of turbulent convection processes remains indirect and essentially limited to observations of the granular convection patterns at the surface and helioseismologic data that probe the propagation of sound waves in the interior. In this Colloquium characteristic scales and dimensionless parameters are discussed, particularly from the perspective of laboratory convection, a research field that has progressed significantly in the last few decades. The estimates and calculations of solar conditions given here are based mostly on the standard solar model S of Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. , which is a mean field model of solar convection. Light is shed on existing results to gain a deeper understanding of dynamical aspects of solar convection.},

  abstract = {A few decades ago, quantum optics stood out as a new domain of physics by exhibiting states of light with no classical equivalent. The first investigations concerned single photons, squeezed states, twin beams, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states, which involve only one or two modes of the electromagnetic field. The study of the properties of quantum light then evolved in the direction of more and more complex and rich situations, involving many modes of the spatial, temporal, frequency, or polarization type. Actually, each mode of the electromagnetic field can be considered as an individual quantum degree of freedom. It is then possible, using the techniques of nonlinear optics, to couple different modes and thus build in a controlled way a quantum network [H. Jeff Kimble, Nature (London) 453 , 1023 (2008) ] in which the nodes are optical modes, and that is endowed with a strong multipartite entanglement. In addition, such networks can be easily reconfigurable and are subject only to weak decoherence. They indeed open many promising perspectives for optical communications and computation. Because of the linearity of Maxwell equations a linear superposition of two modes is another mode. This means that a “modal superposition principle” exists hand in hand with the regular quantum state superposition principle. The purpose of this review is to show the interest of considering these two aspects of multimode quantum light in a global way. Indeed, using different sets of modes allows one to consider the same quantum state under different perspectives: a given state can be entangled in one basis and factorized in another. It is shown that there exist some properties that are invariant over a change in the choice of the basis of modes. The method of finding the minimal set of modes that are needed to describe a given multimode quantum state is also presented. It is then shown how to produce, characterize, tailor, and use multimode quantum light while also considering the effect of loss and amplification on such light and the modal aspects of the two-photon coincidences. Switching to applications to quantum technologies, this review shows that it is possible to find not only quantum states that are likely to improve parameter estimation but also the optimal modes in which these states “live.” Finally, details on how to use such quantum modal networks for measurement-based quantum computation are presented.},

  abstract = {Fluid flows hosting electrical phenomena are the subject of a fascinating and highly interdisciplinary scientific field. In recent years, the extraordinary success of electrospinning and solution-blowing technologies for the generation of polymer nanofibers has motivated vibrant research aiming at rationalizing the behavior of viscoelastic jets under applied electric fields or other stretching fields including gas streams. Theoretical models unveiled many original aspects in the underpinning physics of polymer solutions in jets and provided useful information to improve experimental platforms. This review examines advances in the theoretical description and numerical simulation of polymer solution jets in electrospinning and solution blowing. Instability phenomena of electrical and hydrodynamic origin, which play a crucial role in the relevant flow physics, are highlighted. Specifications leading to accurate and computationally viable models are formulated. Electrohydrodynamic modeling, theories on jet bending instability, recent advances in Lagrangian approaches to describe the jet flow, including strategies for dynamic refinement of simulations, and effects of strong elongational flow on polymer networks are reviewed. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives in the field are outlined and discussed, including the task of correlating the physics of the jet flows with the properties of relevant materials, as well as the development of multiscale techniques for modeling viscoelastic jets.},

  abstract = {This review covers the work of the three decades since the first spectroscopic identification of the H 3 + molecular ion outside of the laboratory in 1988, in the auroral atmosphere of the giant planet Jupiter. These decades have seen the astronomy related to this simple molecular ion expand to such an extent that a summary and evaluation of some 450 refereed articles is provided in the review. This enormous body of work has revealed surprises and illuminated the extensive role played by H 3 + in astrophysical environments in our Solar System and beyond. At the same time the physical chemistry and chemical physics of the molecule that has been revealed and studied during this time has proved to be fascinating and enabled high-resolution spectroscopy to benchmark its achievements against equally high-precision calculations. This review includes a brief look at some of the key foundational articles from before the original 1988 Jupiter detection (including the original 1911 ion discharge tube detection by J. J. Thomson and the key laboratory spectroscopy and quantum mechanics calculations on H 3 + structure and spectrum). The review explains the original detection and its serendipitous nature and looks at the astronomy that followed, all the way up to the latest results from NASA’s Juno mission. Also covered are the major advances in our understanding of the interstellar medium (known as ISM) that have resulted from the detection of H 3 + absorption lines there in 1996. The review closes by examining claims for the ion’s presence in other astrophysical environments and its potential role in the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs.},

  abstract = {The climate is a forced, dissipative, nonlinear, complex, and heterogeneous system that is out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The system exhibits natural variability on many scales of motion, in time as well as space, and it is subject to various external forcings, natural as well as anthropogenic. This review covers the observational evidence on climate phenomena and the governing equations of planetary-scale flow and presents the key concept of a hierarchy of models for use in the climate sciences. Recent advances in the application of dynamical systems theory, on the one hand, and nonequilibrium statistical physics, on the other hand, are brought together for the first time and shown to complement each other in helping understand and predict the system’s behavior. These complementary points of view permit a self-consistent handling of subgrid-scale phenomena as stochastic processes, as well as a unified handling of natural climate variability and forced climate change, along with a treatment of the crucial issues of climate sensitivity, response, and predictability.},

  abstract = {Electronic transport properties of single-molecule junctions have been widely measured by several techniques, including mechanically controllable break junctions, electromigration break junctions, and by means of scanning tunneling microscopes. In parallel, many theoretical tools have been developed and refined for describing such transport properties and for obtaining numerical predictions. Most prominent among these theoretical tools are those based upon density functional theory. In this review, theory and experiment are critically compared, and this confrontation leads to several important conclusions. The theoretically predicted trends nowadays reproduce the experimental findings well for series of molecules with a single well-defined control parameter, such as the length of the molecules. The quantitative agreement between theory and experiment usually is less convincing, however. Two main sources for the quantitative discrepancies can be identified. Experimentally, the atomic structure of the junction typically realized in the measurement is not well known, so simulations rely on plausible scenarios. In theory, correlation effects can be included only in approximations that are difficult to control for experimentally relevant situations. Therefore, one typically expects qualitative agreement with present modeling tools; in exceptional cases a quantitative agreement has already been achieved. For further progress, benchmark systems are required that are sufficiently well defined by experiment to allow quantitative testing of the approximation schemes underlying the theoretical modeling. Several key experiments can be identified suggesting that the present description may even be qualitatively incomplete in some cases. Such key experimental observations and their current models are also discussed here, leading to several suggestions for extensions of the models toward including dynamic image charges, electron correlations, and polaron formation.},

  abstract = {Immediately after the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates in 1987, properties in the metallic state above T c were discovered that violated the reigning paradigm in condensed matter physics: the quasiparticle concept due to Landau. The most discussed of such properties is the linear in temperature resistivity down to asymptotically low temperatures, sometimes called Planckian resistivity, above the region of the highest T c . Similar anomalies have since also been discovered in the heavy-fermion compounds and in the Fe-based superconducting metals, and most recently in twisted bilayer graphene. Innumerable papers in the past three decades have pointed out that the linear in T resistivity and associated properties are a mystery and the most important unsolved problem in condensed matter physics; superconductivity itself is a corollary to the normal state properties. Even in this prolifically investigated field, quantitative experimental results on crucial normal state and superconducting state properties have only recently become available. It is now possible to compare some of the detailed predictions of a theory for the normal and superconductive state in cuprates and in heavy fermions with the experiments. The theory gives the frequency and temperature dependence of various normal state properties and also their measured magnitudes in terms of the same values of two parameters. It also resolves the paradox of d -wave symmetry of superconductivity in the cuprates given that the scattering rate of fermions in the normal state is nearly momentum independent. The same parameters that govern the normal state anomalies are also deduced from the quantitative analysis of data in the superconducting state in cuprates. The simplicity of the results depends on the discovery of a new class of quantum-critical fluctuation in which orthogonal topological excitations in space and time determine the spectra, such that the correlations of the critical spectra are a product of a function of space and a function of time with the spatial correlation length proportional to the logarithm of the temporal correlation length. The fermions scattering with such fluctuations form a marginal Fermi liquid.},

  abstract = {The present status and development of strong-field nano-optics, an emerging field of nonlinear optics, is discussed. A nonperturbative regime of light-matter interactions is reached when the amplitude of the external electromagnetic fields that are driving a material approach or exceed the field strengths that bind the electrons inside the medium. In this strong-field regime, light-matter interactions depend on the amplitude and phase of the field, rather than its intensity, as in more conventional perturbative nonlinear optics. Traditionally such strong-field interactions have been intensely investigated in atomic and molecular systems, and this has resulted in the generation of high-harmonic radiation and laid the foundations for contemporary attosecond science. Over the past decade, however, a new field of research has emerged, the study of strong-field interactions in solid-state nanostructures. By using nanostructures, specifically those made out of metals, external electromagnetic fields can be localized on length scales of just a few nanometers, resulting in signficantly enhanced field amplitudes that can exceed those of the external field by orders of magnitude in the vicinity of the nanostructures. This leads not only to dramatic enhancements of perturbative nonlinear optical effects but also to significantly increased photoelectron yields. It resulted in a wealth of new phenomena in laser-solid interactions that have been discovered in recent years. These include the observation of above-threshold photoemission from single nanostructures, effects of the carrier-envelope phase on the photoelectron emission yield from metallic nanostructures, and strong-field acceleration of electrons in optical near fields on subcycle timescales. The current state of the art of this field is reviewed, and several scientific applications that have already emerged from the fundamental discoveries are discussed. These include, among others, the coherent control of localized electromagnetic fields at the surface of solid-state nanostructures and of free-electron wave packets by such optical near fields, resulting in the creation of attosecond electron bunches, the coherent control of photocurrents on nanometer length and femtosecond timescales by the electric field of a laser pulse, and the development of new types of ultrafast electron microscopes with unprecedented spatial, temporal, and energy resolution. The review concludes by highlighting possible future developments, discussing emerging topics in photoemission and potential strong-field nanophotonic devices, and giving perspectives for coherent ultrafast microscopy techniques. More generally, it is shown that the synergy between ultrafast science, plasmonics, and strong-field physics holds promise for pioneering scientific discoveries in the upcoming years.},

  abstract = {Many biological functions are executed by molecular machines, which like man-made motors are powered by chemical energy, released by adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. They have evolved to transport cargo, facilitate folding of proteins and ribonucleic acids, remodel chromatin, and replicate DNA. Biological machines also serve as the most natural systems for illustrating emergent phenomena in nonequilibrium active systems, thus providing a great impetus to illustrate the general principles governing their functions. Despite their architectural diversity, physics-based theories have provided unifying themes of the inner working of nanoscale biological machines. The theories address questions such as how the trade-off between precision, energetic costs, and optimal performances are balanced. However, many complexities associated with biological machines require molecular level descriptions. Simple point mutations in the enzyme could drastically alter functions, result in unexpected diseases, or dramatically restrict the capacity of molecular chaperones to help proteins fold. These examples are reminders that, while the search for principles of generality in biology is intellectually stimulating and necessary, molecular details must be accounted for to develop a deeper understanding of their functions.},

  abstract = {Bell’s theorem rules out many potential reformulations of quantum mechanics, but within a generalized framework it does not exclude all locally mediated models. Such models describe the correlations between entangled particles as mediated by intermediate parameters that track the particle worldlines and respect Lorentz covariance. These locally mediated models require the relaxation of an arrow-of-time assumption that is typically taken for granted. Specifically, some of the mediating parameters in these models must functionally depend on measurement settings in their future, i.e., on input parameters associated with later times. This option, often called retrocausal, has been repeatedly pointed out in the literature, but the exploration of explicit locally mediated toy models capable of describing specific entanglement phenomena has begun only in the past decade. A brief survey of such models is included here. These models provide a continuous and consistent description of events associated with spacetime locations, with aspects that are solved “all at once” rather than unfolding from the past to the future. The tension between quantum mechanics and relativity that is usually associated with Bell’s theorem does not occur here. Unlike in conventional quantum models, the number of parameters needed to specify the state of a system does not grow exponentially with the number of entangled particles. The promise of generalizing such models to account for all quantum phenomena is identified as a grand challenge.},

This may help to answer unresolved questions about phenomena such as high temperature superconductivity, solid-state physics, transition metal catalysis, and certain biochemical reactions. In turn, this increased understanding may help us to refine, and perhaps even one day design, new compounds of scientific and industrial importance. However, building a sufficiently large quantum computer will be a difficult scientific challenge. As a result, developments that enable these problems to be tackled with fewer quantum resources should be considered important. Driven by this potential utility, quantum computational chemistry is rapidly emerging as an interdisciplinary field requiring knowledge of both quantum computing and computational chemistry. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to both computational chemistry and quantum computing, bridging the current knowledge gap. Major developments in this area are reviewed, with a particular focus on near-term quantum computation. Illustrations of key methods are provided, explicitly demonstrating how to map chemical problems onto a quantum computer, and how to solve them.

  abstract = {The atomic nucleus is a quantum many-body system whose constituent nucleons (protons and neutrons) are subject to complex nucleon-nucleon interactions that include spin- and isospin-dependent components. For stable nuclei, several decades ago, emerging seemingly regular patterns in some observables could already be described successfully within a shell-model picture that results in particularly stable nuclei at certain magic fillings of the shells with protons and/or neutrons: N , Z = 8 , 20, 28, 50, 82, 126. However, in short-lived, so-called exotic nuclei or rare isotopes, characterized by a large N / Z asymmetry and located far from the valley of β stability on the nuclear chart, these magic numbers, viewed through observables, were shown to change. These changes in the regime of exotic nuclei offer an unprecedented view at the roles of the various components of the nuclear force when theoretical descriptions are confronted with experimental data on exotic nuclei where certain effects are enhanced. This article reviews the driving forces behind shell evolution from a theoretical point of view and connects this to experimental signatures.},

  abstract = {Quantum correlations between two parties are essential for the argument of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in favor of the incompleteness of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger noted that an essential point is the fact that one party can influence the wave function of the other party by performing suitable measurements. He called this phenomenon quantum steering and studied its properties, but only in recent years has this kind of quantum correlation attracted significant interest in quantum information theory. In this paper, the theory of quantum steering is reviewed. First, the basic concepts of steering and local hidden state models are presented and their relation to entanglement and Bell nonlocality is explained. Then various criteria for characterizing steerability and structural results on the phenomenon are described. A detailed discussion is given on the connections between steering and incompatibility of quantum measurements. Finally, applications of steering in quantum information processing and further related topics are reviewed.},

  abstract = {For over 40 years, physicists have considered possible uses for neutrino detectors in nuclear nonproliferation, arms control, and fissile materials security. Neutrinos are an attractive fission signature because they readily pass through matter. The same property makes neutrinos challenging to detect in systems that would be practical for nuclear security applications. This Colloquium presents a broad overview of several potential neutrino applications, including the near-field monitoring of known reactors, far-field monitoring of known or discovery of undeclared reactors, detection of reactor waste streams, and detection of nuclear explosions. Recent detector advances have made near-field monitoring feasible, whereas farther-field reactor detection and waste stream detection monitoring may be possible in some cases with further research and development. Very long-range reactor monitoring and nuclear explosion detection do not appear feasible for the foreseeable future due to considerable physical and/or practical constraints.},

  abstract = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) have become indispensable tools in the study of correlated quantum materials. Both probe complementary aspects of the single-particle excitation spectrum. Taken together, ARPES and STM have the potential to explore properties of the electronic Green’s function, a central object of many-body theory. This review explicates this potential with a focus on heavy-electron quantum criticality, especially the role of Kondo destruction. A discussion on how to probe the Kondo destruction effect across the quantum-critical point using ARPES and STM measurements is presented. Particular emphasis is placed on the question of how to distinguish between the signatures of the initial onset of hybridization-gap formation, which is the “high-energy” physics to be expected in all heavy-electron systems, and those of Kondo destruction, which characterizes the low-energy physics and, hence, the nature of quantum criticality. Recent progress and possible challenges in the experimental investigations are surveyed, the STM and ARPES spectra for several quantum-critical heavy-electron compounds are compared, and the prospects for further advances are outlined.},

  abstract = {In this Colloquium, the wave-function-based multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree approaches to the dynamics of indistinguishable particles (MCTDH-F for fermions and MCTDH-B for bosons) are reviewed. MCTDH-B and MCTDH-F or, together, MCTDH-X are methods for describing correlated quantum systems of identical particles by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation from first principles. MCTDH-X is used to accurately model the dynamics of real-world quantum many-body systems in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. The key feature of these approaches is the time dependence and optimization of the single-particle states employed for the construction of a many-body basis set, which yields nonlinear working equations. The historical developments that have led to the formulation of the MCTDH-X method and motivate the necessity for wave-function-based approaches are briefly described. The derivation of the unified MCTDH-F and MCTDH-B equations of motion for complete and also specific restricted configuration spaces are sketched. The strengths and limitations of the MCTDH-X approach are assessed via benchmarks against an exactly solvable model and via convergence checks. Applications to some instructive and experimentally realized quantum many-body systems are highlighted: the dynamics of atoms in Bose-Einstein condensates in magneto-optical and optical traps and of electrons in atoms and molecules. The current development and frontiers in the field of MCTDH-X are discussed: theories and numerical methods for indistinguishable particles, for mixtures of multiple species of indistinguishable particles, the inclusion of nuclear motion for the nonadiabatic dynamics of atomic and molecular systems, as well as the multilayer and second-quantized-representation approaches, and the orbital-adaptive time-dependent coupled-cluster theory.},
