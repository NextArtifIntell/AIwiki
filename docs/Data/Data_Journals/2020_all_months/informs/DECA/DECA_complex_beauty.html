  abstract     = {As has been known for over a century, aggregated preferences of a group may bear little or no similarity to the preference of any single individual, regardless of the aggregation method. Yet, it remains routine to fit or test theories of individual decision making on pooled data, and it remains routine to cast theories of individual decision making at the aggregate level. This mindset may have disastrous policy and business implications. A population of individuals who all satisfy one theory may behave collectively as though they satisfied a competing theory. A collection of individuals satisfying a given theory may collectively satisfy a version of the same theory with qualitatively different scientific or decision analytic implications. Because the resulting artifacts apply at the population level, replications, large samples, and high-quality data can do nothing to detect or repair them.},

We apply value-focused thinking to define and structure the objectives of the stakeholders and use multiattribute utility theory to evaluate the preferences of the stakeholders toward these objectives. The results show that 8 out of 11 stakeholders prefer the energy transition alternative with the highest climate protection ambitions.

Based on an alternative separation method, we formulate a questionnaire for simultaneous and consistent estimation of risk aversion, subjective discount rate, and EIS. From a representative group of 1,153 respondents, we estimate parameters for these preferences and their variability within the population. Risk aversion and the subjective discount rate are found to be in the orders of 2 and 0, respectively, not diverging far away from results from other studies. Our estimate of EIS in the order of 10 is larger than often reported. Background variables like age and income have little predictive power for the three estimates. Only gender has a significant influence on risk aversion in the usually perceived direction that females are more risk-averse than males. Using individual estimates of preference parameters, we find covariance between preferences toward risk and EIS. We present the background reasoning on objectives, the questionnaire, a statistical analysis of the results, and economic interpretations of these, including relations to the literature.},

  abstract     = {Initial valuations of entrepreneurial ventures offering uncertain payoffs can often be overvalued by investors; namely, the expected payoff postacquisition is smaller than the expected payoff prior to acquisition when the investor harbors uncertainties about various components of the business. Common explanations involve irrationality such as psychological preference for potential over realized payoffs. We provide a different, rational explanation, which we term the valuator’s curse. It is similar in nature to the winner’s curse in auctions and the optimizer’s curse in decision analysis, but the source of the curse is neither from the competitive effects of an auction-type mechanism nor from the optimization effects in a choice among alternatives. Rather the effect is generated from the nonlinear evaluation of the payoffs, even though the inputs to the evaluation are unbiased. We formalize the valuator’s curse and discuss its implications to entrepreneur’s learning. The valuator’s curse proves a boon to the entrepreneur as it leads to larger capitalizations.},

  abstract     = {Many business situations can be called “games” because outcomes depend on multiple decision makers with differing objectives. Yet, in many cases, the payoffs for all combinations of player options are not available, but the ability to experiment off-line is available. For example, war-gaming exercises, test marketing, cyber-range activities, and many types of simulations can all be viewed as off-line gaming-related experimentation. We address the decision problem of planning and analyzing off-line experimentation for games with an initial procedure seeking to minimize the errors in payoff estimates. Then, we provide a sequential algorithm with reduced selections from option combinations that are irrelevant to evaluating candidate Nash, correlated, cumulative prospect theory or other equilibria. We also provide an efficient formula to estimate the chance that given Nash equilibria exists, provide convergence guarantees relating to general equilibria, and provide a stopping criterion called the estimated expected value of perfect off-line information (EEVPOI). The EEVPOI is based on bounded gains in expected utility from further off-line experimentation. An example of using a simulation model to illustrate all the proposed methods is provided based on a cyber security capture-the-flag game. The example demonstrates that the proposed methods enable substantial reductions in both the number of test runs (half) compared with a full factorial and the computational time for the stopping criterion.},

  abstract     = {Over-the-top (OTT) service refers to content included in basic telecommunications subscriptions without the additional features provided by telecom operators. The booming OTT business has had a huge impact on traditional telecommunications businesses such as voice and short message services, and the sense of crisis among telecommunications operators shows that the channeling trend has become more and more obvious. Faced with competition on the distribution of interests between channels and contents, telecommunications operators and OTT service providers are engaged in a fierce competition and cooperation game. To explore this competition relationship, this paper first establishes an evolutionary model, discussing the competition and cooperation behaviors of telecommunications operators and OTT service providers, and then conducts research on the degree of the effects of cooperation in terms of the combination of strategic factors, including cooperation cost sharing, the benefits distribution mechanism, research and development benefits, spillover effect, and network externality. Additionally, a replicator dynamic system is developed to study the influence of related strategic factors on evolutionary equilibrium. Finally, to verify the theoretical results, a simulation experiment is conducted to further clarify the meaning of the model and obtain meaningful results. The evolutionary game model and method provided in this paper are expected to help both parties make better decisions for future operating strategies.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, firms tend to outsource security operations to professional managed security service providers (MSSPs) as a result of the sophistication of strategic hackers. Thus, how an MSSP makes security decisions according to a strategic hacker’s action is worth researching. Constructing a contract theory model, this paper examines the interaction between an MSSP and a strategic hacker based on both parties’ characteristics. We find that the hacker will give up less valuable information assets, and thus not all information assets are worth protecting for the MSSP. For both parties, their optimal efforts do not necessarily increase with their respective efficiency, and the firm’s reputation loss has an opposite effect on its respective efforts. Moreover, we distinguish two types of security externalities including MSSP-side externality and hacker-side externality, and we find that the two types of security externalities have different effects on both parties’ optimal efforts and expected payoffs. We also find that as a result of the trade-off between the integration effect of the MSSP and the effect of MSSP-side externality, firms are still willing to outsource their security operations to the MSSP even when an MSSP devotes fewer security efforts than those of firms that manage security in-house. Last, we extend our base model from two aspects to generalize the main results.},

Abilities are divided into skills and efficiency, where the former is an absolute notion and the latter a relative notion of ability. Timing is investigated by comparing players’ investments in a simultaneous and a Stackelberg game. In the simultaneous game, the Nash Equilibrium investment level in attack and defense resources is symmetric, increasing in the skills but non-monotonic in the relative efficiency. In the Stackelberg game, the equilibrium investment levels are asymmetric, increasing in the skills, but with their ranking affected only by the relative efficiency. Therefore, interestingly, players’ choice is mostly characterized by players’ relative efficiency rather than by their skills, in regards to timing.},

Requirements for code compliance and inspection vary throughout towns and states within the United States, and building owners who violate these codes can be penalized via fines and mandated compliance measures. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the strategic behavior of players in a fire-code inspection process. This paper fills the gap by presenting the game-theoretic approach to modeling building owners’ behaviors with respect to fire-code compliance and the inspection strategies of fire-inspection agencies. Both a decentralized model (sequential game in which the fire-inspection agency moves first) and a centralized model (simultaneous game controlled by one central decision maker) are developed to identify the best inspection strategies for the agency and the best compliance strategies for the building owner. This study provides prescriptive insights that can enable policymakers to improve fire-code compliance and inspection by identifying the conditions that motivate the players to participate positively in the inspection and compliance processes. Numerical sensitivity analyses of the equilibrium strategies and the expected losses of the players are provided, along with a comparison of the results between the decentralized and centralized models.},

It is straightforward to construct a multiattribute preference structure for one decision maker that includes the outcomes experienced by others. However, when multiple individuals incorporate one another’s well‐being into their decision making, this creates complex interdependencies that must be resolved before the preference models can be applied. We provide representation theorems for additive altruistic value functions for two-person, n-person, and group outcomes in which multiple individuals are altruistic. We find that in most cases it is possible to resolve the preference interdependencies and that modeling the preferences of altruistic individuals and groups is tractable.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new concept of almost second-degree stochastic dominance (ASSD), which we term almost risk-averse stochastic dominance (ARSD). Compared with existing ASSD conditions, ARSD can exclude extremely risk-averse utility functions. Hence, ARSD is able to reveal clear preferences of most risk-averse decision makers in practice, which are otherwise unable to be revealed. The simple closed-form of ARSD not only makes it easy to use in practice but also provides a clear insight into the preferences of decision makers and the difference in expected values and stochastic dominance violations. Moreover, we show that ARSD can be inferred based on mean and variance alone, and thus it is applicable even when distribution information is incomplete.},

Such generalized pricing concepts are especially useful for the valuation of research and development (R&amp;amp;D) projects, which are often characterized by unquantifiable uncertainties and nonnumeric inputs and outputs, such as know-how and intellectual property. Moreover, the generalized definitions are also applicable to the valuation of other kinds of features in the decision setting, such as decision opportunities embedded in R&amp;amp;D projects. To motivate the use of these pricing concepts, we show that the general definitions exhibit several consistency properties. The application of the generalized price definitions to the valuation of R&amp;amp;D projects and decision opportunities embedded in such projects is illustrated through an example.},

  abstract     = {Many domains require the use of sophisticated simulators to adequately model the effect of chosen alternatives on the decision maker’s value. Decision support in such complex systems brings unique challenges around efficiency, because simulating each combination of inputs can be time-consuming. In this paper, we conduct a value of information (VOI) analysis to study whether one should purchase information about critical input uncertainties in such complex systems. We propose a novel computational approach, where Gaussian processes are used to model the decision maker’s profit as a function of different alternatives and uncertainties. Under this modeling assumption, the expected improvement of the profit is analytically available, which we use to approximate the VOI effectively over batches of simulations, thus avoiding too many computer-intensive evaluations of the system. We illustrate the proposed computational approach with an offshore wind farm maintenance application, where the decision maker relies on outputs from large-scale simulations to determine the optimal vessel fleet mix and number of personnel for operation and maintenance. Such computer-intensive simulations mimic long-term energy production under different input conditions. It is often not possible to explore all the alternatives exhaustively, and one must therefore guide the simulations to run on promising alternatives. We conduct a VOI analysis to study whether one should purchase information about failure rates of wind turbines for this application. The proposed methodologies are general and apply to other domains involving expensive simulators.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop strictly proper scoring rules that may be used to evaluate the accuracy of a sequence of probabilistic forecasts. In practice, when forecasts are submitted for multiple uncertainties, competing forecasts are ranked by their cumulative or average score. Alternatively, one could score the implied joint distributions. We demonstrate that these measures of forecast accuracy disagree under some commonly used rules. Furthermore, and most importantly, we show that forecast rankings can depend on the selected scoring procedure. In other words, under some scoring rules, the relative ranking of probabilistic forecasts does not depend solely on the information content of those forecasts and the observed outcome. Instead, the relative ranking of forecasts is a function of the process by which those forecasts are evaluated. As an alternative, we describe additive and strongly additive strictly proper scoring rules, which have the property that the score for the joint distribution is equal to a sum of scores for the associated marginal and conditional distributions. We give methods for constructing additive rules and demonstrate that the logarithmic score is the only strongly additive rule. Finally, we connect the additive properties of scoring rules with analogous properties for a general class of entropy measures.},

  abstract     = {To develop effective counterterrorism strategies, it is important to understand the capabilities and objectives of terrorist groups. Much of the understanding of these groups comes from intelligence collection and analysis of their capabilities. In contrast, the objectives of terrorists are less well understood. In this article, we describe a decision analysis methodology to identify and structure the objectives of terrorists based on the statements and writings of their leaders. This methodology was applied in three case studies, resulting in the three objectives hierarchies of al-Qaeda, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and Hezbollah. In this article, we propose a method to compare the three objectives hierarchies, highlight their key differences, and draw conclusions about effective counterterrorism strategies. We find that all three terrorist groups have a wide range of objectives going far beyond the objective of killing and terrorizing people in the non-Muslim world. Among the shared objectives are destroying Israel and expelling Western powers from the Middle East. All three groups share the ambition to become a leader in the Islamic world. Key distinctions are the territorial ambitions of ISIL and Hezbollah versus the large-scale attack objectives of al-Qaeda. Objectives specific to ISIL are the establishment of a caliphate in Iraq and Syria and the re-creation of the power of Sunni Islam. Hezbollah has unique objectives related to the establishment of a Palestine State and to maintain the relationship with and support of Iran and Syria. Al-Qaeda’s objectives remain focused on large-scale attacks in the West. We also note a recent shift to provide support for small-scale attacks in the West by both al-Qaeda and ISIL. Our method can be used for comparing objectives hierarchies of different organizations as well as for comparing objectives hierarchies over time of one organization.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, in the bilevel optimization framework, a leader chooses her actions by solving an upper-level problem, assuming that a follower chooses an optimal reaction by solving a lower-level problem. However, in many settings, the lower-level problems might be nontrivial, thus requiring the use of tailored algorithms for their solution. More importantly, in practice, such problems might be inexactly solved by heuristics and approximation algorithms. Motivated by this consideration, we study a broad class of bilevel optimization problems where the follower might not optimally react to the leader’s actions. In particular, we present a modeling framework in which the leader considers that the follower might use one of a number of known algorithms to solve the lower-level problem, either approximately or heuristically. Thus, the leader can hedge against the follower’s use of suboptimal solutions. We provide algorithmic implementations of the framework for a class of nonlinear bilevel knapsack problem (BKP), and we illustrate the potential impact of incorporating this realistic feature through numerical experiments in the context of defender-attacker problems.},

We explored four opinion pools: the linear opinion pool (likely the most popular), the beta-transformed linear opinion pool, the geometric opinion pool, and a multiplicative method based on odds called Bordley’s formula. The data for our study came from our recent work in the inference of insider threats for our research sponsor. In this work, we created a multimodeling inference enterprise modeling (MIEM) process to either predict threats within a population or, given the threats, predict how well the enterprise system can detect those threats. As part of larger research challenges designed by the research sponsor, we applied the MIEM process quarterly to respond to a sequence of varying challenge problems (CPs). Via MIEM, we developed multiple, independent computation forecast models. These models generated certainty intervals to answer CP questions. These intervals were fused into a single interval for each question via an expert panel prior to submission. The sponsors scored the responses against ground truth. In this paper, we (a) ask which pooling functions work best on these data and consider why, and (b) compare this performance to the actual submissions to determine if one of the pooling functions performed better than our judgment-based fusion.},

  abstract     = {Policymakers often make decisions involving human-mortality risks and monetary outcomes that span across different time periods and horizons. Many projects or environmental-regulation policies involving risks to life, such as toxic exposures, are experienced over time. The preferences of individuals on lives lost or saved over time should be understood to implement effective policies. Using a within-subject survey design, we investigated our participants’ elicited preferences (in the form of ratings) for sequences of lives saved or lost over time at the participant level. The design of our study allowed us to directly observe the possible preference patterns of negative time discounting or a preference for spreading from the responses. Additionally, we embedded factors associated with three other prevalent anomalies of intertemporal choice (gain/loss asymmetry, short/long asymmetry, and the absolute magnitude effect) into our study for control. We find that our participants exhibit three of the anomalies: preference for spreading, absolute magnitude effect, and short/long-term asymmetry. Furthermore, fitting the data collected, Loewenstein and Prelec’s model for the valuation of sequences of outcomes allowed for a more thorough understanding of the factors influencing the individual participants’ preferences. Based on the results, the standard discounting model does not accurately reflect the value that some people place on sequences of mortality outcomes. Preferences for uniform sequences should be considered in policymaking rather than applying the standard discounting model.},

Forecast quality improves as lead time until the forecast events declines. Reducing the lead time required for preparation decisions can substantially improve the quality of forecasts available for decision making and thereby, reduce the expected total costs of preparations plus storm damage. Measures of forecast quality are only indirectly linked to their value in preparation decisions and changes in the parameters of those decisions—in particular lead time. This paper provides decision-relevant measures of the quality of recent National Hurricane Center forecasts from the 2014–2018 seasons, which can be used to evaluate reductions in decision lead time in terms of false alarm rate, missed detections, and expected annual costs. For decision makers in some regions with decision lead times of 48–72 hours—typical for evacuation decisions—every 6-hour reduction in required lead time can reduce the false alarm rate by more than 10\%.},
