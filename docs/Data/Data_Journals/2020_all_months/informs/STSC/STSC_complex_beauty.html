We argue that being similar to existing concepts, being located in a popular domain, and being combined with similar existing concepts are important for gaining attention early on but less important and even negative for sustaining popularity. To examine this question, we focus on the rise and fall of management concepts. We analyze data on the rise and fall of keywords in the Harvard Business Review between 1922 and 2010. Multiple tests confirm our hypotheses. The implication is that lessons learned from studies of popular concepts can be misleading as guides for how to make novel concepts popular.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we review resource allocation at former handset maker Sony Ericsson. Three observations reveal how innovation projects can escalate through a stage-gate process that is meant to minimize initial commitment. First, uncertainty makes business cases hard to disconfirm in the early stages of project development. Second, as information that can be used to disconfirm business cases becomes more readily attainable in later stages of development, an increasing focus on project completion discourages the updating of business cases. Third, if business cases are revised negatively, the heightened organizational attention appears to make discontinuations less likely. We contextualize these three findings, replicate them with data from a second company, and discuss their potential implications for organizing innovation under uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Learning is of paramount importance to organizations, often hinging on the accumulation of experience among workers. The returns from experience, however, are far from certain in large groups, marked by complex interdependencies and composed of a demographically diverse workforce. How do organizations manage to learn and improve their performance under these conditions? We claim that the standardization of work practices and procedures provides two key advantages. First, it magnifies the positive returns that a unit reaps from the experience of its workers. Second, standardization anchors the accumulated experience of workers to organizational routines that transcend the individual units in which they have worked. Increasing experience eases coordination among workers and attenuates the negative effects of diversity on a unit’s performance. We test these arguments using data tracking the composition of ship crews in the Dutch East India Company, an organization that witnessed significant efforts at standardizing work practices and procedures in the face of increasing national diversity. We find preliminary support for our hypotheses from analyses of the time to completion of 2,200 voyages to Asia during the period between 1700 and 1796.},

  abstract     = {How corporate decision makers respond to firm performance shortfalls has key implications for strategic change in corporate resource allocations. Performance feedback theory assumes problem-solving decision makers faced with performance below aspirations pursue problemistic search and greater strategic change to improve performance. Research on self-enhancement, however, assumes decision makers respond by engaging in lower levels of search and change to portray a favorable self-image. We contribute to advancing this dialogue by investigating contextual features of decision making that prompt self-enhancing behaviors. Specifically, we examine the moderating effects of product and geographic diversification, which reflect indicators of task complexity, and bright spots (defined as the greatest increases in percentage sales of product and geographic segments within a diversified firm’s respective portfolios) on the linkage between performance below aspirations and strategic change. We argue that diversification and bright spots create greater opportunities for corporate decision makers to make self-enhancing interpretations, thereby weakening the relationship between performance below aspirations and strategic change. Empirical tests on Standard &amp; Poor’s 1,500 firms from 1998 to 2006 largely supported the hypotheses.},

We conceive of agency as both constrained and enabled by structure, and we build on sociological views that treat market structures as pairings of cultural schemas and material resources that are mutually sustaining. Structures contain the seeds for change because contradictions and conflicts that are inherent to structure inspire agents to imagine a new order and provide pathways to enact them. We theorize three connected forms of agency. Constructive agency captures agents’ ability to differently apply schemas to mobilize resources and improve their strategic positions. Temporal agency underlies agents’ autonomy and individuation, and enables agents to envision new possibilities. Interactive agency captures the collective nature of agency, where interactions among heterogeneous actors provide opportunities for agents to persuade others of their changing conceptions and learn new schemas, expanding agents’ repertoires for shaping opportunities.},

Our work offers a “middle ground” alternative methodology for unpacking the “black box” of market incubation processes. Our middle ground approach is useful for exploring the complex interdependencies among four general mechanisms that shape market incubation: environmental shocks that open up new technological possibilities, firm-level capabilities that allow firms to differentially take advantage of these possibilities, various incentives (e.g., product cannibalization, rivalry) that influence a firm’s willingness to exploit new possibilities, and managerial beliefs about the viability of these possibilities. Complex nonlinear interdependencies exist among these mechanisms, and historical contingencies affect the way in which they interact. We identify important historical contingencies within and across GM, Ford, and Chrysler in their precommercialization managerial decisions prior to Chrysler’s introduction of the Voyager and Caravan in 1983. We use the historical details of actual market incubation to calibrate the simulation and develop plausible alternative (both near and hypothetical) histories of that incubation. Understanding why Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors made their respective product commercialization choices not only pertains to automotive history, but can also illuminate the complexities inherent in market incubation processes.},

Using rich archival and field data, we closely track five global consumer goods manufacturers and their associated advertising suppliers as they attempted to integrate social media into their advertising activities. Our primary contribution is to unpack the process by which firms reconfigure their supplier ecosystems to address disruptive new technologies. Our framework reveals that integrating new technologies may require firms to reconfigure the distributions of both activity and power, and that fundamental trade-offs may leave the value of new technologies unrealized. Broadly, we contribute to research and theory on buyer-supplier relationships, alliances, and technology disruption by bringing a more realistic perspective that considers firms’ network of suppliers and interfirm turf wars in technology adoption.},

Industry emergence through key milestones—commercialization, firm takeoff, and sales takeoff—is made possible by knowledge-generation processes by diverse actors within and across uncertainty dimensions, and knowledge-aggregation processes with appending, selecting, and collective mechanisms at play.

Specifically, we show that collective action problems occur when actors undervalue the benefits of market-oriented resource allocation and when actors contribute resources that are imperfectly substitutable. Furthermore, we show that collective action problems occur when actors are embedded in networks with others sharing a similar role in market formation.

Our conceptual framework suggests that grassroots collective action against the digital platform is most likely when the digital platform operates with localized scarce assets or localized precarious labor and when actors express their grievances through formalized channels. We combine business model design and stakeholder management perspectives to develop design-based solutions that involve a multisided business model structure, an inclusive stakeholder value proposition, and an ecosystem-centered governance. We call the combination of such design efforts relational business model design . To the incipient theory of digital platforms, we contribute a stakeholder-centered view of platform business models operating within local ecosystems, bridging research on collective action and stakeholder management with strategic management of platforms.},

  abstract     = {We examine whether firms learn from digital technology failures in the form of data breach events, based on the effectiveness of their failure responses. We argue that firms experiencing such technological failures interpret them broadly as organizational problems, and undertake unrelated divestitures and top management turnover to achieve better standardization and to remove dysfunctional routines. We test our hypotheses on unrelated subsidiary divestitures and chief technology officer (CTO) turnovers undertaken by 8,760 publicly traded U.S. firms that were at risk of experiencing data breaches involving the loss of personally identifiable information during the period 2005–2016. We find that data breaches significantly increase the hazard of unrelated divestitures and CTO turnover, and that these failure responses are sensitive to firms’ aspiration-performance feedback. However, whereas unrelated divestitures reduce the reoccurrence of data breaches, CTO turnover has no significant effect. Our findings suggest a corrective role of unrelated divestitures for failure learning, and the symbolic nature of CTO turnover as a failure response. Our study unpacks failure learning that hitherto has been inferred from a firm’s own failure experience and industry-wide failures, and highlights the interplay between the digital and nondigital components of a firm in the understudied context of data breaches.

Although access to diverse knowledge may aid knowledge recombination, which can facilitate innovation, prior literature has focused primarily on one way of achieving that: diversity of inventor-held knowledge within a given knowledge production team ( within-team knowledge diversity ). We introduce the concept of across-team knowledge diversity , which captures the distribution of inventor knowledge diversity across production teams, an overlooked dimension of a firm’s internal organization design. We study two contrasting forms of organizing the firm-level knowledge diversity environment in which a firm’s inventors are situated: diffuse (high within-team diversity and low across-team diversity) versus concentrated (low within-team diversity and high across-team diversity). Using panel data on new biotechnology ventures founded over a 21-year period and followed annually from inception, we find that concentrated structures are associated with higher firm-level innovation quality, and with more equal contributions from their teams (and the opposite for diffuse structures). Our empirical tests of the operative mechanisms point to the importance of within-team coordination costs in diffuse structures and across-team knowledge flows in concentrated knowledge structures. We end with a discussion of implications for future research on organizing for innovation.},

  abstract     = {Although many studies suggest a strong link between ownership and corporate strategy, little research has examined how ownership change matters for firm innovation. This paper leverages the context of privatization to study how firms’ transition from state ownership to private ownership shapes innovation. We argue that privatization helps to alleviate not only traditional principal–agent conflicts, but also principal–principal conflicts in firms of concentrated ownership, leading to greater innovation. Exploiting a major privatization reform in China, we show that privatization enhances firm innovation and that this effect is mediated by interest alignment between firm owners and managers as well as that between controlling and minority shareholders. This study contributes to a dynamic view of ownership and innovation by delineating the underlying mechanisms through which privatization affects innovation.},

  abstract     = {The spread of investments by sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) around the world has raised questions about what determines their location choices. We argue that SWFs, like multinational companies, consider a host of cross-country distance factors to guide their location decisions and that the effect of distances is significant not only for their direct investment in foreign affiliates, but also for the indirect stakes they hold via pyramids. Starting with a simple binary dependent variable indicating the presence of an investment of a given fund in a given country, we find that distances are key determinants of SWFs’ location choices for direct investments but are less important for indirect investments. Yet this difference in the effect of distances on direct and indirect location choices disappears when we adjust for the relative size of the investment. We thus confirm that SWFs pay more attention to indirect investments—as much as they do to direct ones—when those investments are relatively large. Our findings suggest that it is imperative that studies on foreign location and organizational distance account for indirect stakes and for the size of investments in order to see a more complete picture of firms’ investment strategies. In addition, we consider the moderating role of fund-level heterogeneous traits (such as their overall strategic orientation) but do not find consistent moderating effects on the link between distances and location choices.},

  abstract     = {Organizations often keep secret their decisions about what employees receive (e.g., salary, budgets, benefits) to manage fairness concerns. We propose that this can be counterproductive because of a mechanism we call the “escalation of deservingness under secrecy,” where the existence of peers can inflate one’s own sense of deservingness, even when the actual allocations to peers are unknown. Building on the ultimatum game, we developed a paired ultimatum game (PUG) in which a player and a peer respondent engage with the same offeror simultaneously but with no direct competition between respondents. Across three experiments—a live interaction study as well as two scenario studies—using the PUG, we analyze the conditions under which transparency may be better than secrecy in preventing the escalation of deservingness perceptions.},
