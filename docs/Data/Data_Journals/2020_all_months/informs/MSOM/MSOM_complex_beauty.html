  abstract     = {Problem definition : We examine how a profit-driven firm (she) can motivate better social responsibility (SR) practices by a supplier (he) when these practices cannot be perfectly observed by the firm. We focus on the firm’s investment in the supplier’s SR capabilities. To capture the influence of consumer demands, we incorporate the potential for SR information to be disclosed by the firm or revealed by a third party. Academic/practical relevance : Most firms have limited visibility into the SR practices of their suppliers. However, there is little research on how a firm under incomplete visibility should (i) invest to improve a supplier’s SR practices and (ii) disclose SR information to consumers. We address this gap. Methodology : We develop a game-theoretic model with asymmetric information to study a supply chain with one supplier and one firm. The firm makes her investment decision given incomplete information about the supplier’s current SR practices. We analyze and compare two settings: the firm does not disclose versus she discloses SR information to the consumers. Results : The firm should invest a high (low) amount in the supplier’s capabilities if the information she observes suggests the supplier’s current SR practices are poor (good). She should always be more aggressive with her investment when disclosing (versus not disclosing). This more aggressive strategy ensures better supplier SR practices under disclosure. When choosing between disclosing and not disclosing, the firm most likely prefers not to disclose when the supplier’s current SR practices seem to be average. Managerial implications : (i) Greater visibility helps the firm to better tailor her investment to the level of support needed. (ii) Better visibility also makes the firm more “truthful” in her disclosure, whereas increased third-party scrutiny makes her more “cautious.” (iii) Mandating disclosure is most beneficial for SR when the suppliers’ current practices seem to be average.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Under what conditions and how can a buying firm, by committing to publish a list of its suppliers and/or the identities and violations of terminated suppliers, increase its expected profit and supplier responsibility? Academic/practical relevance : This paper contributes to a recent thrust in the operations-management literature on how various sorts of transparency influence social and environmental responsibility in a supply chain. In practice, companies are under pressure to publish their supplier lists and suppliers’ violations, and some are beginning to do so. This paper could help guide their decisions. Methodology : The methodology is game theory. Results : This paper shows how a buying firm can use transparency to reward a supplier for responsibility effort to eliminate social or environmental violations. By publishing its supplier list, the buying firm can signal that a supplier is responsible and generate profitable new business for the supplier. However, the resulting competition for the supplier’s scarce capacity could cause the buying firm to obtain fewer units or pay a higher price. We identify the conditions under which a buying firm should commit to publish its supplier list and conditions under which the buying firm should also help a supplier with cost reduction or capacity expansion. In addition, the paper shows how a buying firm can use transparency to punish a supplier for a responsibility violation—by warning other buying firms not to source from that supplier. Commitment to do so increases the supplier’s responsibility effort and can screen out a supplier with a known responsibility violation, thereby increasing a buying firm’s expected profit. If the supplier is uncertain whether it has a violation (e.g., faulty electrical wiring likely to cause a fire), then the two forms of transparency can be complementary. Managerial implications : Buying firms should consider transparency as a potentially profitable approach to mitigating social and environmental violations in their supply chains.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Although they enjoy low costs in sourcing from emerging economies, global brands also face serious brand and reputation risks from their suppliers’ noncompliance with environmental and labor standards. Such a supplier problem can be viewed as a process quality problem concerning how products are sourced and produced. Academic/practical relevance : Addressing this problem is a key component of many global companies’ responsible sourcing programs. A common approach is to use an audit as an auxiliary supplier screening mechanism. However, in regions with lax law enforcement, an unethical, noncomplying supplier may attempt to bribe an unethical auditor to pass the audit. Such supplier-auditor collusion compromises the integrity of the audit and weakens its effectiveness. Methodology : In this paper, we develop a game-theoretical model to study the effect of supplier-auditor collusion on the buyer’s auditing and contracting strategy in responsible sourcing, as well as various driving factors that help reduce collusion. Results : We show that the buyer’s equilibrium contracting strategy is a shutout contract that takes three different forms, depending on the collusion risk level. We also define and analyze the screening errors and social efficiency loss caused by supplier-auditor collusion. By comparing the cost versus collusion elimination trade-off between a third-party audit and an in-house audit, we offer explanations for why many global brands fully rely on third-party audits and set higher process quality requirements for suppliers located in high-risk countries. The robustness of our insights is verified by two model extensions: one involving additional supplier audit cost and the other allowing for supplier process quality improvement before audit. Managerial implications : These model insights provide useful theoretical support and baseline guidance for the current supplier audit practices in responsible sourcing. Our extended model analysis further demonstrates the importance for global brands to lobby local governments to increase collusion penalties and to promote the ethical level of the third-party auditors located in high-risk countries.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies two cooperative approaches of firms in managing social responsibility violations of their supplier: auditing a common supplier jointly ( joint auditing ) and sharing independent audit results with other firms ( audit sharing ). We study this problem in a market with externalities and a large number of firms. A cademic/practical relevance : With numerous firms procuring their materials and parts worldwide, there are many cases in which overseas suppliers violate safety, labor, or environmental standards. Those violations have externalities in the sense that one firm’s violation affects other firms in the same market. It is not clear how such externalities affect competing firms’ incentives to cooperate and the effectiveness of such cooperation. Methodology : We develop a model based on a cooperative game in partition function form, which enables us to analyze the competitive and cooperative interactions of a large number of firms in a market. Results : Although there has been concern about cooperation for fear of compromising a competitive advantage, firms have incentives to cooperate in managing their suppliers when one firm can be hurt by others’ violations, that is, the negative externality is high. However, neither cooperative approach necessarily improves social responsibility, especially when one firm can benefit from others’ violations, that is, the positive externality is high. Finally, even if agreement is not reached for cooperation before conducting individual audits, social responsibility can still be improved by incentivizing firms to share their private audit results with others under a properly designed mechanism. Managerial implications : The careful assessment of the externalities associated with social responsibility violations is a key to the success of joint auditing and audit sharing. Although firms cooperate voluntarily in some cases, a government agency or an industry association should intervene in other cases to motivate cooperation if it is beneficial. In addition, caution must be taken to monitor manufacturers’ audit efforts, especially when cooperative approaches are implemented in the market where competition is fierce and consumers switch brands easily.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A key question in socially responsible supply networks is as follows: When firms audit some, but not all, of their respective suppliers, how do the degree centralities of the suppliers (i.e., the number of firms to which they supply) affect their auditing priority from the viewpoint of the firms? To investigate, we consider an assembly network consisting of two firms and three suppliers; each firm has one independent supplier that uniquely supplies to that firm and one common supplier that supplies to both. Academic/practical relevance : Most supply networks are characterized by firms that source from multiple suppliers and suppliers that serve multiple firms, thus resulting in suppliers who differ in their degree centrality. In such networks, any negative publicity from suppliers’ noncompliance with socially responsible practices—for example, employment of child labor, unsafe working conditions, and excessive pollution—can significantly damage the reputation of the buying firms. To mitigate this impact, firms preemptively audit suppliers although resource and time considerations typically restrict the number of suppliers a firm can audit. Consequently, it becomes important to understand the impact of the degree centralities of the suppliers on the priority with which firms audit them. Methodology : Game-theoretic analysis. Results : Downstream competition between the firms drives them away from auditing the supplier with higher centrality, that is, the common supplier, in equilibrium, despite the fact that auditing this supplier is better for the aggregate profit of the firms. We show that this inefficiency is corrected when the firms cooperate (via a stable coalition) to jointly audit the suppliers and share the auditing cost in a fair manner. We also identify conditions under which joint auditing improves social welfare. Managerial implications : We have two main messages: (i) individual incentives can lead firms to deprioritize the auditing of structurally important suppliers, which is inefficient; (ii) the practice of joint auditing can correct this inefficiency.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A manufacturer takes raw material with an exogenous quality distribution to make a traditional product and a coproduct using material of quality above and below a well-established standard, respectively. The market consists of traditional consumers, who are only willing to pay for a product’s consumption value, and some environmentally conscious (i.e., green) consumers, who additionally value the product’s material conservation. In this context, we study the firm’s optimal design of its coproduct, that is, its quality and price decisions. Academic/practical relevance : Motivated by emerging conservation-oriented business practices exemplified by companies such as Taylor Guitars, our study informs resource-dependent firms whether and how to design their product line to leverage a coproduct’s environmental value. Our findings also yield important policy implications regarding the conservation of natural resources. Methodology : We formulate and solve the firm’s challenge as a constrained optimization problem, supplemented with extensive sensitivity analyses and robustness tests. Results : When the material cost is intermediate and consumers are not sufficiently green, the firm should position the coproduct without exploiting its environmental value. Otherwise, the firm should position the coproduct by extracting its environmental value from green consumers, in which case the firm may strategically abandon some traditional consumers by leaving their demand unfulfilled. Managerial implications : Quotas and taxation on material supply in general act as policy substitutes. A greener market may inadvertently result in higher resource consumption and waste. Quotas can mitigate such adverse effects.},

Academic/practical relevance : Our work is in the area of agriculture operations, and we focus on the improvement of farmer’s expected total profit by optimizing planting schedules. Methodology : We model a farmer’s planting problem under limited planting capacity in a finite-horizon stochastic dynamic program. Results : We show that the optimal planting policy is a time-dependent, threshold-type policy, and the optimal threshold is dependent on the soil water content and planting capacity. In our computational study, we use the well-known Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer simulator used in agriculture to obtain the expected yield when planting in any given period. Utilizing field weather data from Southern Africa, in a real-size, large-scale problem, we demonstrate a significant relative profit advantage of the optimal planting schedule over commonly used heuristics in practice. We show that the relative advantage of the optimal policy increases as the climate condition becomes more severe for planting. We also develop a heuristic based on the secretary problem and demonstrate the increased efficacy of the secretary heuristic. Managerial implications : We show that the farmer should plant down to the optimal threshold of seed amount. However, in practice, farmers start to plant each year after observing enough cumulative rainfall. Utilizing field weather data, in a real-size, large-scale problem, we show significant improvement of the expected total profit if the farmer could adopt the optimal policy.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Governments have adopted various subsidy policies to promote investment in renewable energy sources such as rooftop solar panels. The German government uses a feed-in-tariff policy that provides a guaranteed stream of payments for each unit of electricity generated by a household. In contrast, the U.S. government uses a tax-rebate policy that reduces the initial investment cost, and the household receives the retail price for the generated electricity. In this paper, we study the key practical factors that favor one policy over the other from the perspective of the government. These factors are the heterogeneity in the generating efficiency, the variability in the electricity price, and the variability in the investment cost. Academic relevance : Unlike the previous literature on the feed-in-tariff and tax-rebate policies, we focus on the effects of variability on a household’s investment timing. We identify the optimal policy for the government to manage the aggregate household investment, accounting for the heterogeneity in efficiency. Methodology : We consider an infinite-horizon, continuous-time model where the government moves first and announces either a feed-in tariff or a tax rebate. Then each household dynamically decides if and when to invest in a unit of solar panels. The objective of the government is to maximize the expected value of a subsidy policy, that is, the difference between the societal benefit of solar panel investments and the subsidy cost over time. Results : We characterize the timing of the investment decision of the households and the optimal subsidy parameters for the government. We identify which practical factors favor the feed-in-tariff or the tax-rebate policy. Policy implications : Our results suggest that a government should prefer the feed-in-tariff policy when the electricity price is highly uncertain. Intuitively, feed-in-tariff policy eliminates the price variability; thus, it removes the strategic delay in the investment. The tax-rebate policy should be adopted if the households are heterogeneous in generating efficiency, if the investment cost is highly variable, or if the price and cost uncertainty are positively correlated.},

Academic/practical relevance : By introducing and analyzing development supply chains in which transactions are commercial but subsidies are needed for affordability, we explore different supply chain structures, with product substitution and retail competition motivated by a field study in Haiti of subsidized solar lantern supply chains. Methodology : We incorporate product substitution, retail competition, and demand uncertainty in a three-echelon supply chain model with manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. This model has transactions among the donor, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers as a four-stage Stackelberg game, and we solve different variations of this game by using backward induction. Results : The donor can subsidize the manufacturer, retailer, or customer as long as the total subsidy per unit across these echelons is maintained at the optimal level. Having more product choice and having more retail channel choice can increase the number of beneficiaries adopting the products; this increase becomes more pronounced as demand becomes more uncertain. Managerial implications : Donors must coordinate across different programs along the entire supply chain. They should look for evidence in their collective experience of more beneficiaries when subsidizing competing retailers selling diverse substitutable products.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This study examines the impact of disability diversity on the productivity of apparel manufacturing teams in the context of a work integration social enterprise. Two measures of disability diversity are examined: the number of disability categories employed in a production line and the evenness of disability category dispersion among workers employed in an apparel production line. Academic/practical relevance : The problem has both academic and practical relevance. From an academic standpoint, the current literature does not study the implications of employing individuals with disabilities and their impact on productivity with microdata. The issue also has practical relevance because it ties into recent managerial interest to employ individuals with disabilities in organizations. According to statistics, only 35% of workers with disabilities have some form of significant full-time employment. Methodology : The study uses panel regression analyses to test the impact of disability diversity (number of disability categories and evenness of disability category dispersion) of workers in a production line using detailed multiyear data on the productivity of apparel manufacturing cells. Results : Two key insights emerged from the analyses. First, productivity can be enhanced by increasing the diversity of workers with disabilities in the workforce within a garment-manufacturing cell. Specifically, productivity is best at moderate levels of disability categories in a team. Second, team productivity is higher at greater levels of evenness of disability category dispersion. Managerial implications : The analysis in this paper sheds light on the potential benefits of integrating individuals with disabilities into organizations and its implications on productivity. Specifically, the study finds evidence that having moderate levels of disability categories on a team with higher levels of evenness in disability category dispersion is associated with better productivity rather than having a concentrated team focused on a specific disability. The implications of the results and limitations for the study as well as its potential insights into the context of social enterprises that employ individuals with disabilities are discussed.},

Second, because maintaining continuity is costly and, at times, operationally impractical for both the organization (because of potentially lower utilization) and providers (because of high effort required), should certain customer types, such as those with complex needs, be prioritized for continuity? These questions are particularly important in healthcare services where patients with chronic conditions visit primary care offices repeatedly. Therefore, we explore these questions in the context of diabetes, a chronic disease. Academic/practical relevance : Although the operations management (OM) and healthcare literatures suggest that higher continuity is better for health outcomes, the possibility that one could have too much continuity has not been explored. We draw on literature on continuity of care from the healthcare literature and learning effects from the OM literature to theorize and then show a curvilinear relationship. In addition, we further the literature on continuity by examining different categories for prioritization. Methodology : We use a detailed and comprehensive data set from the Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States, which permits us to control for potential sources of heterogeneity. We analyze over 300,000 patients over an 11-year period who suffer from diabetes, a chronic disease whose successful management requires continuity of care, as well as kidney disease, a major complication of diabetes. We use an empirical approach to quantify the relationship between continuity of care and three important health outcomes: inpatient visits, length of stay, and readmission rate. We conduct extensive robustness checks and sensitivity analyses to validate our findings. Results : We find that continuity of care is related to improvements in all three health outcomes. Moreover, we find that the gains are not linearly improving in continuity, but rather the relationship is curvilinear, whereby outcomes improve and then decline in increasing continuity of care, suggesting that there may be value in having multiple providers. Additionally, we find that continuity of care is even more important for patients suffering from more complex conditions. Managerial implications : Identifying the amount of continuity of care to provide and determining which individuals to prioritize are both of interest to practitioners and policymakers because they can help in designing appropriate policies for staffing and work allocation.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Organ-transplanted patients typically receive high amounts of immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., tacrolimus) as a mechanism to reduce their risk of organ rejection. However, because of the diabetogenic effect of these drugs, this practice exposes them to a greater risk of new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT), and hence, becoming insulin dependent. We study and develop effective medication management strategies to address the common conundrum of balancing the risk of organ rejection versus that of NODAT. Academic/practical relevance : Our research contributes to the healthcare operations management literature by developing a robust stochastic decision-making framework that allows for incorporating (1) false-positive and false-negative errors of medical tests, (2) inevitable estimation errors when data sets are used, (3) variability among physician’ attitudes toward ambiguous outcomes, and (4) dynamic and patient risk-profile-dependent progression of health conditions. Methodology : We apply an ambiguous partially observable Markov decision process (APOMDP) approach where dynamic optimization with respect to a “cloud” of possible models allows us to make decisions that are robust to potential misspecifications of risks. Results : We first provide various structural results that facilitate characterizing the optimal medication policies. Utilizing a clinical data set, we then compare the performance of the optimal medication policies obtained from our APOMDP model with the policies currently used in the medical practice. We observe that, in one year after transplant, our proposed policies can improve the life expectancy of each patient up to 4.58%, while reducing the medical expenditures up to 11.57%. Managerial implications : Balancing the risks of organ rejection and diabetes complications and considering factors such as physicians’ attitudes toward ambiguous outcomes, partial observability of medical tests, and patient-specific risk factors are shown to result in more cost-effective strategies for management of post-transplant medications compared with the current medical practice. Finally, simultaneous management of medications can facilitate the care coordination process between transplantation/nephrology and endocrinology departments of a hospital that are typically in charge of administering such medications.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Innovation contest platforms are often organized around specific fields and host contests that span a variety of interdependent problem domains. Whereas contestants may benefit from related experience in contests whose problem domains share an interdependency with the focal problem domain, it is unclear whether the benefits of related experience arise symmetrically from upstream experience (i.e., experience in problem domains that provide input information to the focal problem domain) and downstream experience (i.e., experience in problem domains that use output information from the focal problem domain) or differ among them. Academic/practical relevance : Given that innovation contest platforms serve to effectively match contest problem requirements with contestants’ skills, it is important to understand how a contestant’s prior experience on a platform contributes to her problem-solving performance. Our research provides a more granular examination of the benefits of related experience than what has been examined in prior studies on individual learning or innovation contests. Methodology : We collected detailed archival data from TopCoder, a leading innovation contest platform that hosts contests across multiple interdependent software development problem domains, from its launch in 2001 to September 2013. Our data set comprises detailed participation histories of 821 contestants in 3,274 contests across eight interdependent problem domains involving 8,985 observations. Results : Whereas a contestant’s related experience on the innovation contest platform is more positively associated with her focal contest performance compared with unrelated experience, the benefits of related experience arise only from downstream experience. That is, there are no significant performance benefits of upstream experience. Furthermore, the performance benefits of downstream experience are greater when the contest duration is shorter, highlighting its role in enabling more efficient search and problem solving in innovation contest platforms with interdependent problem domains. Managerial implications : Contrary to the notion of “hyperspecialization,” our findings suggest that contestants can reap benefits from diversifying their experience into downstream problem domains on innovation contest platforms. Furthermore, innovation contest platforms could facilitate such targeted diversification of contestant experience by developing more granular metrics of contestant experience across problem domains. Our findings also have implications for resource allocation and job rotation decisions in software development projects within firms.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We investigate the impact of nonbinding (wage-irrelevant) goals, set by a manager, on a team of workers with “weak-link” production technology. Can nonbinding goals improve team production when team members face production complementarity? Academic/practical relevance : Nonbinding goals are easy to implement and ubiquitous in practice. These goals have been shown to improve individual performance, but it remains to be seen if such goals are effective in team production when there is production complementarity among workers. Methodology : We first develop a theoretical model where goals act as reference points for workers’ intrinsic motivation to complete the task. We then test our hypotheses in a controlled, human-subjects experiment. In our experiment, participants act as managers or workers, and we examine the impact of nonbinding goals on team outcomes. Results : Consistent with our model, we find evidence that team production does increase when managers are able to set goals. This effect is strongest when goals are challenging but attainable for weak-link workers. However, we also find evidence that many managers assign goals that are too challenging for weak-link workers, resulting in suboptimal team production, lower profits, and higher wasted performance (performance above the weak-link level). Managerial implications : Our analysis indicates that goals are effective motivators in teams, but some managers may have difficulty overcoming personal biases when setting goals. The task of setting team goals is more complex than setting individual goals, and many managers can benefit from training on how to set good goals for the team. Moreover, our finding that suboptimal goals also increase wasted performance suggests that improving goal-setting strategies is especially important in production settings where overperformance is costly for the firm (scrap, energy use, inventory costs, lower prices as a result of oversupply, etc.).},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a product-line design problem in which customer choice among multiple products is given by a multinomial logit (MNL) model. A firm determines product quality and prices in an evolving product line to maximize profit. In particular, given the prices and quality of products that already exist in a product line, the firm optimizes prices and/or quality of the new products. Academic/practical relevance : We extend the literature on discrete choice models to include the interaction between product quality and product price and consider two variations of the problem, each mirroring a relevant decision setting found in practice: Variation i is a price-optimization problem in which the firm determines prices of the new products given the quality. Variation ii is a joint price and quality optimization of the new products. Methodology : We apply convex optimization techniques and analyze properties of optimal solutions. Results : We establish concavity of the profit function under price optimization and present tractable solution approaches for the joint quality–price optimization. For each problem variation, we characterize the optimal solution and develop efficient algorithms. We show that the interaction of price and quality is central not only to reconciling the divergence of the existing literature’s equal-markup price prediction from differentiated markups observed in practice, but also for explaining differentiated quality measures across products; this empirically observed strategy can now be quantified and optimized with the model developed in this paper. In addition, we show that the presence of existing products tends to drive the firm to offer new products with both higher quality and prices because of the price–quality interaction. Managerial implications : Findings of this paper offer not only managerial guidelines, but also tools for decision support because of the wide empirical applicability of the MNL model. An important managerial implication is that the lack of realism in the linear utility of the MNL model can be addressed by including price–quality interaction, which is central to understanding the quality and price decision in product-line design. The interaction rationalizes the matching of high markup with high quality and justifies differentiated offering of new products in the presence of existing products.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a buyer sourcing from multiple competing suppliers who exert cost-reduction efforts before procurement contracts are awarded. Academic/practical relevance : The supply chain is subject to the classic hold-up problem—as the lack of a contract commitment hinders suppliers’ incentives to make investment upfront—complicated with supplier competition. Methodology : With deterministic cost-reduction outcomes, suppliers will not exert any effort if this effort is observable, and a pure-strategy equilibrium does not exist if the effort is unobservable. We analyze the mixed-strategy equilibrium with unobservable supplier effort, in which suppliers randomize their efforts and the buyer designs an optimal procurement mechanism. Results : We show that the optimal procurement mechanism can be implemented by a conventional single-price reverse auction with a random reserve price. The mixed strategy of supplier effort generates endogenous information asymmetry on supplier costs that provides suppliers with information rent, which sustains their efforts. The endogenous information asymmetry improves effort efficiency (by inducing positive supplier effort), yet introduces trade inefficiency (by causing the possible failure of trade between the parties). Although increasing supplier competition (measured by the number of suppliers) hurts the effort efficiency, it improves trade efficiency. As a result, the buyer is always better off introducing supplier competition by including more than one supplier in the supply base. However, the desired supply base size (number of suppliers) depends on the product revenue: For high-margin goods, the optimal size is achieved with two suppliers, whereas for low-margin goods, a larger supply base is better for the buyer. We show that the result based on deterministic cost reduction can be established as a limit of the case when uncertainty in cost reduction exists and shrinks to null. Managerial implications : Our study helps to understand the impact of supplier competition when supply-chain parties deliberately make their actions unpredictable to avoid being held up. The findings provide managerial guidance on procurement auction and supply base designs.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : People often make service-quality judgments based on information about the quality of each server even though they care primarily about the quality each customer experiences. When and how do server-level quality metrics differ from customer-experienced ones? Can people properly account for these differences, or do they drive human judgment and decision biases? Academic/practical relevance : Biased judgments about service quality can cause governments to fund programs suboptimally, organizations to promote the wrong employees, and customers to make disappointing purchases. We further our understanding of the role that cognitive biases play in services and how to manage quality information in light of them. Methodology : We use a mathematical model to define the gap between server-level and customer-experienced quality metrics. We use secondary data in the context of the higher-education industry to quantify the customer–server quality gap in practice. We construct a behavioral model to derive hypotheses about how environmental factors impact the direction and magnitude of judgment biases. Controlled laboratory experiments test the hypothesized biases and mitigation techniques. Results : Our empirical study reveals that the two measures differ enough to drive significant differences in the rank order of school majors, teachers, and airports. Our experiments support our main conjecture that judgments and decisions about customer-experienced metrics are biased toward server-level metrics. Consequently, (1) judgments about customer-experienced quality are biased high/low when quality and server load are negatively/positively correlated, (2) judgments about a server’s absolute impact on customer experience are biased high/low when a server has a smaller/larger load than average, and (3) providing customer-experienced quality metrics mitigate these biases. Managerial implications : Our results help identify when and why service-quality metrics are likely to mislead judgments and bias decisions as well as who is likely to benefit from such biases.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider two problems faced by an operating room (OR) manager: (1) how many baseline (core) staff to hire for OR suites, and (2) how to schedule surgery requests that arrive one by one. The OR manager has access to historical case count and case length data, and needs to balance the fixed cost of baseline staff and variable cost of overtime, while satisfying surgeons’ preferences. Academic/practical relevance : ORs are costly to operate and generate about 70% of hospitals’ revenues from surgical operations and subsequent hospitalizations. Because hospitals are increasingly under pressure to reduce costs, it is important to make staffing and scheduling decisions in an optimal manner. Also, hospitals need to leverage data when developing algorithmic solutions, and model tradeoffs between staffing costs and surgeons’ preferences. We present a methodology for doing so, and test it on real data from a hospital. Methodology : We propose a new criterion called the robust competitive ratio for designing online algorithms. Using this criterion and a robust optimization approach to model the uncertainty in case mix and case lengths, we develop tractable optimization formulations to solve the staffing and scheduling problems. Results : For the staffing problem, we show that algorithms belonging to the class of interval classification algorithms achieve the best robust competitive ratio, and develop a tractable approach for calculating the optimal parameters of our proposed algorithm. For the scheduling phase, which occurs one or two days before each surgery day, we demonstrate how a robust optimization framework may be used to find implementable schedules while taking into account surgeons’ preferences such as back-to-back and same-OR scheduling of cases. We also perform numerical experiments with real and synthetic data, which show that our approach can significantly reduce total staffing cost. Managerial implications : We present algorithms that are easy to implement and tractable. These algorithms also allow the OR manager to specify the size of the uncertainty set and to control overtime costs while meeting surgeons’ preferences.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Service providers often recruit a large number people over a short period of time, a practice known as high-volume recruitment. In this study, we describe a data-driven approach that can be used to streamline the recruitment process and aid decision making. The recruitment process consists of two stages: screening and interview. All candidates are evaluated in the screening stage, but only those with sufficiently high screening scores are short-listed for an interview. After the interview stage, offers are made based on the screening and interview scores. We define the error rate as the probability that a candidate who is rejected during either stage might have had a higher job performance than the median job performance of the candidates recruited had he or she been accepted. To ensure the error rate is no higher than a certain level, how many candidates should be short-listed, and, after the interview, how should candidates be ranked based on the two scores? Academic/practical relevance : High-volume recruitment is challenging because decisions have to be made for many people, under tight time constraints, and under uncertainty. Our approach does not require knowledge about the cost of evaluating candidates and the utility of selecting candidates; hence, it is easier to implement in practice. We apply the approach to the process of recruiting students for a postgraduate business program. Methodology : We use stochastic modeling and regression. Results : We provide a procedure for estimating the error rate as a function of the percentage of candidates short-listed for interviews. We show that the estimated error rate is asymptotically unbiased and converges to the true error rate in probability. We then run a linear regression analysis to estimate the relationship between job performance and the screening and interview scores. In a case study involving a postgraduate business program, the job performance measure we adopt is the grade point average in the program, observable only for the students enrolled in the program. We find that the interview score is statistically significant, but the screening score is not. Managerial implications : For the postgraduate program, our study demonstrates that the time-intensive interview process has substantial value. We should increase, rather than reduce, as suggested by the program administrators before our study, the weight assigned to the interview score and the time spent on the interview process. Knowing the relationship between the error rate and the percentage of candidates short-listed for interviews, the program administrators can determine the appropriate percentage for any given error rate deemed acceptable and improve the ranking of candidates. Our approach is general and can be applied to other high-volume recruiters.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : There is an ongoing debate on how providing a subsidy for one energy source affects the investment level of other sources. Academic/practical relevance : To investigate this issue, we study a capacity investment problem for a utility firm that invests in renewable and conventional energy, with a consideration of two critical factors. First, conventional sources have different levels of operational flexibility—inflexible (e.g., nuclear and coal) and flexible (e.g., natural gas). Second, random renewable energy supply and electricity demand are correlated and nonstationary. Methodology : We model this problem as a two-stage stochastic program in which a utility firm first determines the capacity investment levels followed by the dispatch quantities of energy sources to minimize the sum of investment and generation-related costs. Results : We derive the optimal capacity portfolio to characterize the interactions between renewable and conventional sources. Policy implications : We find that renewable and inflexible sources are substitutes, suggesting that a subsidy for nuclear or coal-fired power plants leads to a lower investment level in wind or solar energy. However, wind energy and flexible sources are complements. Thus, a subsidy for flexible natural gas-fired power plants leads to a higher investment in wind energy. This result holds for solar energy if the subsidy for the flexible source is sufficiently high. We validate these insights by using real electricity generation and demand data from the state of Texas.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Is a committee composed of more or less cognitively diverse members better at approving the “good” projects and rejecting the “bad” ones? Academic/practical relevance : We contribute to the operations management literature by accounting for the fact that critical selection decisions are often made by a committee rather than a single decision maker. Understanding how the magnitude of diversity affects the decision quality of such a committee is an important consideration for practitioners. Methodology : We utilize a game-theoretic model to show that diverse perspectives are rarely “averaged out.” Results : Diversity leads to systematic biases in project selection. To mitigate the effect of diverse perspectives, managers need to uncover the sources of diversity: do they originate from different individual valuations and preferences, or do they express different assimilations of the information that arises during the project execution? We show that this distinction is crucial. Higher preference diversity always leads to higher likelihood of making the wrong decision. Higher interpretive diversity may be beneficial for the organization. Managerial implications : A clear managerial action is the need to identify and reduce such preference diversity. Senior management can achieve this by highlighting the need for more transparency in the pipeline of the business units. Moreover, our analysis shows that interpretive diversity can be a powerful managerial lever to influence the propensity for Type I and II errors.

  abstract     = {A new generation of healthcare operations management (HOM) scholars is studying timely healthcare topics (e.g., organization design, design of delivery, and organ transplantation) using contemporary methodological tools (e.g., econometrics, information economics, and queuing games). A distinguishing feature of this stream of work is that it explicitly incorporates behavior, incentive, and policy considerations arising from the entanglements across multiple entities that make up the complex healthcare ecosystem . This focus is a departure from an earlier generation of research that primarily centered on optimizing given operations of a single entity. This paper provides an introduction to this burgeoning field and maps out research opportunities. We start with identifying key entities of healthcare delivery, financing, innovation, and policymaking, illustrating them on a healthcare ecosystem map (HEM). Next, we explore the HOM literature examining the interactions among various entities in the HEM. We then develop a taxonomy for the recent HOM literature (published in Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management , Management Science , and Operations Research between 2013 and 2017), provide a tool-thrust graph mapping methodological tools with research thrusts, and situate the HOM literature in context by connecting it with perspectives from medical journals and mass media. We close with a reference to technological innovations that have the potential to transform the healthcare ecosystem in future decades.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We study a shipper transporting and selling a short life-cycle product to a destination market via two competing transportation service providers (i.e., carriers). The two carriers offer distinct speeds and competing freight rates, whereas customers in the destination market obtain higher utility if they receive the product earlier and their time preferences are heterogeneous. Academic/practical relevance: Perishable products are commonly shipped via multiple means of transport. The faster the mode of transport, the more expensive it is, but speed enables the product to reach the market with higher quality. In addition to the trade-off between speed and cost, the competition between carriers can also influence the shipper&#39;s transportation procurement strategies. Our model highlights the implications of carrier competition in a dual sourcing problem. Methodology: We analyze a two-stage game in which carriers first compete on freight rates, and then the shipper determines the shipping quantities. Results: We show that the shipper may benefit from product differentiation via dual-mode shipping, in which the shipment that arrives earlier is sold at a premium price. In equilibrium, the shipper&#39;s profit can be U-shaped in the speed difference between carriers. Dual sourcing may be inferior to simply restricting a single shipping service in a winner-take-all fashion. Managerial implications: This study reveals an underlying trade-off between the operational advantage from product differentiation and the cost advantage from carrier competition. To benefit from either of these advantages, a shipper should use two carriers with either very distinct or very similar speeds. Single sourcing may bring an additional cost advantage that outweighs the value of production differentiation through dual sourcing.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : How should decision rights be allocated between firms occupying different positions in the value chain to maximize the value of a codevelopment project? Academic/practical relevance : We contribute to the operations management literature on the benefits and challenges of codevelopment initiatives by looking at the design of optimal governance structures that specify the allocation of rights to make certain decisions. Our problem is motivated by real-world challenges observed in codevelopment project initiation discussions between technology companies. Methodology : We utilize a game-theoretic model to study the allocation of the ex ante right to set the contract terms and the ex post right to choose which contract to implement, once the market potential is realized. Results : First, we find that delegating more control to a party does not necessarily imply that the party will be incentivized to exert greater effort. Specifically, we show that allocating both rights to the seller as opposed to only the ex ante right actually reduces the seller’s effort. Second, when the buyer has low bargaining power, the ex post decision right should be delegated to the seller, that is, the party with lower exposure to the effort-contingent outcome. Otherwise, the ex post decision right should be delegated to the buyer but the ex ante right should be held by the seller. Finally, we show that simple contracts with decision rights outperform a spot contract when the ex post bargaining power of one of the parties is substantially higher. Managerial implications : Our results offer insights for how managers should structure the optimal governance structure for codevelopment projects. We also identify when and how companies should delegate rights to their partners to maximize the value of the project. We show that the optimal governance structure depends crucially on the position in the value chain of the party with the higher bargaining power.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We bound the value of collaboration in a decentralized multisupplier multiretailer setting, where several suppliers ship to several retailers through a shared warehouse, and outbound trucks from the warehouse contain the products of multiple suppliers. Academic/practical relevance : In an emerging trend in the grocery industry, multiple suppliers and retailers share a warehouse to facilitate horizontal collaboration, lower transportation costs, and increase delivery frequencies. Thus far, these so-called mixing and consolidation centers are operated in a decentralized manner, with little effort to coordinate shipments from multiple suppliers with shipments to multiple retailers. Facilitating collaboration in this setting would be challenging (both technically and in terms of the level of trust that would be necessary), so it is useful to understand the potential gains of collaboration. Methodology : We extend the classic one-warehouse multiretailer analysis to incorporate multiple suppliers and per-truck outbound transportation cost from the warehouse and develop a cost lower bound on centralized operation as benchmark. We then analyze decentralized versions of the system, in which each retailer and each supplier maximizes his or her own utility in a variety of settings, and we analytically bound the ratio of the cost of decentralized to centralized operation to bound the loss resulting from decentralization. Results : We find analytical bounds on the performance of several decentralized policies. The best, a decentralized zero-inventory ordering policy, has a cost ratio when compared with a lower bound on the centralized policy of no more than 3/2. In computational studies, we find that costs of decentralized policies are even closer to those of centralized policies. Managerial implications : Easy-to-implement decentralized policies are efficient and effective in this setting, suggesting that centralization (and thus a potentially complex and expensive coordination effort) is unlikely to result in significant benefits.},

  abstract     = {Problem Definition : Many production systems deteriorate over time as a result of load and stress caused by production. The deterioration rate of these systems typically depends on the production rate, implying that the equipment’s deterioration rate can be controlled by adjusting the production rate. We introduce the use of condition monitoring to dynamically adjust the production rate to minimize maintenance costs and maximize production revenues. We study a single-unit system for which the next maintenance action is scheduled upfront. Academic/Practical Relevance : Condition-based maintenance decisions are frequently seen in the literature. However, in many real-life systems, maintenance planning has limited flexibility and cannot be done last minute. As an alternative, we are the first to propose using condition information to optimize the production rate, which is a more flexible short-term decision. Methodology : We derive structural optimality results from the analysis of deterministic deterioration processes. A Markov decision process formulation of the problem is used to obtain numerical results for stochastic deterioration processes. Results : The structure of the optimal policy strongly depends on the (convex or concave) relation between the production rate and the corresponding deterioration rate. Condition-based production rate decisions result in significant cost savings (by up to 50%), achieved by better balancing the failure risk and production output. For several systems a win-win scenario is observed, with both reduced failure risk and increased expected total production. Furthermore, condition-based production rates increase robustness and lead to more stable profits and production output. Managerial Implications : Using condition information to dynamically adjust production rates provides opportunities to improve the operational performance of systems with production-dependent deterioration.},

We study a firm’s pricing decisions with CM and the implications for the participating charity. We also consider the design and distribution of cause-linked products. Academic/practical relevance : CM has become popular in recent years. However, there is little analytical work on how a firm’s strategic actions (e.g., product pricing, design, and distribution) impact the effectiveness of a CM campaign. We address this gap. Methodology : Game theory. Results : First, it may be optimal for the firm to decrease the price after the implementation of CM despite the donation cost. Second, a higher level of firm–cause fit may lead to a smaller total donation amount to the charity in a CM campaign. Third, the choice to design a special version of the product for a CM campaign depends on the size of the prosocial segment in the market. Fourth, a decentralized supply chain may generate more social value through CM compared with the centralized case. Managerial implications : For firms, we show that it may not be optimal to increase the price of cause-linked products and identify conditions where firms should introduce a special product in a CM campaign. For charities, we show that a high firm–cause fit level may have a negative effect on the total donation amount and further identify conditions under which charities should collaborate with a downstream retailer or an upstream manufacturer in a CM campaign. Our results indicate that the correlation between customer preferences for the product and the social cause has a significant impact in a CM campaign for both firms and charities.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Collaboration is important in services but may lead to interruptions. Professionals exercise discretion on when to preempt individual tasks to switch to collaborative tasks. Academic/practical relevance: Discretionary task switching can introduce changeover times when resuming the preempted task and, thus, can increase total processing time. Methodology: We analyze and quantify how collaboration, through interruptions and discretionary changeovers, affects total processing time. We introduce an episodal workflow model that captures the interruption and discretionary changeover dynamics—each switch and the episode of work it preempts—present in settings in which collaboration and multitasking is paramount. A simulation study provides evidence that changeover times are properly identified and estimated without bias. We then deploy the model in a field study of hospital medicine physicians: “hospitalists.” The hospitalist workflow includes visiting patients, consulting with other caregivers to guide patient diagnosis and treatment, and documenting in the patient’s medical chart. The empirical analysis uses a data set assembled from direct observation of hospitalist activity and pager-log data. Results: We estimate that a hospitalist incurs a total changeover time during documentation of five minutes per patient per day. Managerial implications: This estimate represents a significant 20% of the total processing time per patient: caring for 14 patients per day, our model estimates that a hospitalist spends more than one hour each day on changeovers. This provides evidence that task switching can causally lead to longer documentation time.},

The objective of this study is to identify implementable strategies to support recipient selection decisions to improve MSROs’ value provision capability. Academic/practical relevance : MSRO supply chains face several challenges that differ from those in traditional for-profit settings, and there is a lack of both academic and practical understanding of how to better match supply with demand in this setting where recipient needs are typically private information. Methodology : We propose a mechanism design approach to determine which recipient to serve at each shipping opportunity based on recipients’ reported preference rankings of different products. Results : We find that when MSRO inventory information is shared with recipients, the only truthful mechanism is random selection among recipients, which defeats the purpose of eliciting information. Subsequently, we show that (1) eliminating inventory information provision enlarges the set of truthful mechanisms, thereby increasing the total value provision; and (2) further withholding information regarding other recipients leads to an additional increase in total value provision. Finally, we show that under a class of implementable mechanisms, eliciting recipient valuations has no value added beyond eliciting preference rankings. Managerial implications : (1) MSROs with large recipient bases and low inventory levels can significantly improve their value provision by appropriately determining the recipients to serve through a simple scoring mechanism; (2) to truthfully elicit recipient needs information to support the recipient selection decisions, MSROs should withhold inventory and recipient-base information; and (3) under a set of easy-to-implement scoring mechanisms, it is sufficient for MSROs to elicit recipients’ preference ranking information.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a dynamic market over a finite horizon for a single product or service in which buyers with private valuations and sellers with private supply costs arrive following Poisson processes. A single market-making intermediary decides dynamically on the ask and bid prices that will be posted to buyers and sellers, respectively, and on the matching decisions after buyers and sellers agree to buy and sell. Buyers and sellers can wait strategically for better prices after they arrive. Academic/practical relevance : This problem is motivated by the emerging sharing economy and directly speaks to the core of operations management that is about matching supply with demand. Methodology : The dynamic, stochastic, and game-theoretic nature makes the problem intractable. We employ the mechanism-design methodology to establish a tractable upper bound on the optimal profit, which motivates a simple heuristic policy. Results : Our heuristic policy is: fixed ask and bid prices plus price adjustments as compensation for waiting costs, in conjunction with the greedy matching policy on a first-come-first-served basis. These fixed base prices balance demand and supply in expectation and can be computed efficiently. The waiting-compensated price processes are time-dependent and tend to have opposite trends at the beginning and end of the horizon. Under this heuristic policy, forward-looking buyers and sellers behave myopically. This policy is shown to be asymptotically optimal. Managerial implications : Our results suggest that the intermediary might not lose much optimality by maintaining stable prices unless the underlying market conditions have significantly changed, not to mention that frequent surge pricing may antagonize riders and induce riders and drivers to behave strategically in ways that are hard to account for with traditional pricing models.},

Academic/practical relevance : A double-sided blind combinatorial auction is used to determine electricity prices for day-ahead markets in Europe. Considering the integer requirements associated with market participants’ bids and the nonlinear social welfare objective, a complicated problem arises. In Turkey, the total number of bids reaches 15,000, and this large problem needs to be solved within minutes every day. Given the practical time limit, solving this problem with standard optimization packages is not guaranteed, and therefore, heuristic algorithms are needed to quickly obtain a high-quality solution. Methodology : We use nonlinear mixed-integer programming and tabu search and genetic algorithms. We analyze the performance of our algorithms by comparing them with solutions commercially available to the market operator. Results : We provide structural results to reduce the problem size and then develop customized heuristics by exploiting the problem structure in the day-ahead market. Our algorithms are guaranteed to generate a feasible solution, and Energy Exchange Istanbul has been using them since June 2016, increasing its surplus by 448,418 Turkish liras (US$128,119) per day and 163,672,570 Turkish liras (US$46,763,591) per year, on average.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper provides empirical evidence on the effect of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) on the financial performance of firms. Academic/practical relevance: The GEJE was characterized as the most significant disruption ever for global supply chains. In its aftermath, there was a great deal of debate about the risks and vulnerabilities of global supply chains, and there were calls to redesign and restructure supply chains. Methodology: We empirically estimate the effect of the GEJE on the stock prices of firms. Our analyses are based on a global sample of 470 firms collected from articles and announcements in the business press that identify affected firms, as well as 382 firms that are not mentioned in the business press but are in industries potentially subject to contagion or competitive effects. Results: We estimate that firms experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the GEJE lost on average 5.21% of their shareholder value during the one-month period after the GEJE. For Japanese firms, the effect was much more severe with an average 9.32% loss in shareholder value. Non-Japanese firms averaged a 3.73% loss in shareholder value. We also find that upstream and downstream supply chain propagation effects from the GEJE are negative, and the contagion effect on firms related to the nuclear industry is very negative. For firms in the rebuilding industries or competitors to firms affected by the GEJE, the competitive effect from the GEJE is positive. Managerial implications: The loss suffered by both Japanese firms and non-Japanese firms experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the GEJE is economically significant. Although the loss is more severe for firms whose operations were directly affected by the GEJE, it is also significant for firms who experienced indirect effects from their upstream and downstream supply chain partners, further confirming the importance of supply chain risk mitigation strategies.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a compliance problem of healthcare workers (HCWs) in hospitals where hand hygiene compliance rates are generally low. We first analyze how peer effects impact compliance decisions of HCWs and then analyze how monitoring can improve compliance. Academic/practical relevance : Inducing process compliance of human operators is an ongoing challenge in operations management with significant implications on the productivity and the quality of the products or services rendered by standardized processes. In healthcare, low hand hygiene compliance of HCWs is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, which can be largely prevented by HCWs following standardized hand hygiene processes. Methodology : Using a game-theoretical approach, we model HCWs’ reactions to peers’ (non-)compliance to determine their equilibrium compliance levels. We integrate the model with a disease-transmission model to determine how the compliance affects disease prevalence in a hospital ward. Results : When the process compliance is endogenous, HCWs play a mixed strategy in equilibrium between complying and noncomplying. We establish that a macrolevel hand hygiene compliance rate of HCWs can result from a combination of four different types of microlevel noncompliance: free-riding, safe-playing, self-regarding, and opportunistic behaviors. Finally, we show that the marginal effect of monitoring on reducing disease prevalence depends on clinical factors, HCWs’ interpersonal learning, and other integration factors like goal setting. Managerial implications : The results demonstrate that the monitoring intervention may not effectively prevent disease transmission without understanding the microlevel behaviors of noncompliant HCWs. Our results provide an explanation as to why there is a significant variability in the effectiveness of management intervention as observed in practice.},

Much of this work relied on scratch modeling, that is, models created from scratch in real time. Applications included recommending event crowd-size restrictions, hospital surge planning, timing decisions (when to stop and possibly restart university activities), and scenario analyses to assess the impacts of alternative interventions, among other problems. This paper documents the problems faced, models developed, and advice offered during real-time response to the COVID-19 crisis at the local level. Results include a simple formula for the maximum size of an event that ensures no infected persons are present with 99% probability; the determination that existing intensive care unit (ICU) capacity was insufficient for COVID-19 arrivals, which led to creating a large dedicated COVID-19–negative pressure ICU; and a new epidemic model that showed the infeasibility of the university hosting normal spring and summer events, that lockdown-like stay-at-home and social distancing restrictions without additional public health action would only delay transmission and enable a rebound after restrictions are lifted, and that aggressive community screening to rapidly detect and isolate infected persons could end the outbreak.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We analyze a catalyst-activated batch-production process with uncertainty in production times, learning about catalyst-productivity characteristics and decay of catalyst performance across batches. The goal is to determine the quality level of batches and to decide when to replenish a catalyst so as to minimize average costs, consisting of inventory-holding, backlogging, and catalyst-switching costs. Academic/practical relevance : This is an important problem in a variety of process-industry sectors, such as food processing, pharmaceuticals, and specialty chemicals, but has not been adequately studied in the academic literature. This paper also contributes to the stochastic economic lot-sizing literature. Methodology : We formulate this problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) and develop a two-level heuristic to solve this problem. The heuristic consists of a lower-level problem that plans the duration of batches within the current campaign to maximize the efficiency of the catalyst while ensuring that the target attribute level for each batch is set to meet a quality specification represented by an average attribute level across all the batches in a campaign. The higher-level problem determines when to replace the costly catalyst as its productivity decays. To evaluate our heuristic, we present a lower bound on the optimal value of the SMDP. This bound accounts for all costs, as well as the randomness and discreteness in the process. We then extend our methods to multiple-product settings, which results in an advanced stochastic economic lot-sizing problem. Results : We test our proposed solution methodology with data from a leading food-processing company and show that our methods outperform current practice with an average improvement of around 22% in costs. In addition, compared with the stochastic lower bounds, our results show that the two-level heuristic attains near-optimal performance for the intractable multidimensional SMDP. Managerial implications : Our results generate three important managerial insights. First, our simulation-based lower bound provides a close approximation to the optimal cost of the SMDP, and it is nearly attainable by using a relatively simple two-level heuristic. Second, the reoptimization policy used in the lower-level problem adequately captures the value of information and Bayesian learning. Third, in the higher-level problem of choosing when to replace a catalyst, the intractable multidimensional state of the system is efficiently summarized by a single statistic: the probability of inventory falling below a specific threshold.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Standard choice models used to optimize product line prices are effective at capturing the effects of prices on the affordability of products but do not incorporate intraline price spillovers, or the effects of prices on consumer preferences for branded product lines. To date, no approach exists to measure such spillovers, and thus their existence and characteristics are subject to controversy. Academic/practical relevance : Different authors have proposed that different product line items, here referred to as known value items (KVIs), generate price spillovers. Yet product line prices and quality levels are typically highly correlated, and thus it is not clear which spillovers should be modeled. No empirical approach exists to test for multiple price spillovers simultaneously while controlling for quality spillovers. Methodology : This study proposes an empirical approach that includes a choice model to abstract rich demand patterns and an estimation algorithm that addresses the endogeneity and collinearity of KVI prices. An empirical application based on vehicle choice data illustrates how the approach can be implemented in practice and demonstrates the importance of modeling spillovers while yielding interesting managerial implications. Results : The results establish that different KVIs generate separate spillovers and illustrate their distinct roles. KVI price spillovers can be economically important, inducing large cross-price elasticities that range from −1.31 to 0.72. Furthermore, neglecting spillovers can bias own-price elasticity estimates by up to 15% and cross-price elasticities by more than 100%. Managerial implications : The empirical results generate KVI-specific insights that managers in the automobile industry can use to improve their pricing strategies. For other industries, the paper proposes an approach and an implementation algorithm that managers can use to estimate spillovers and optimize product line prices. The empirical application illustrates the implementation of the approach and shows how managers can model price spillovers to increase profits by almost 3%.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In fashion retailing, the display of product inventory at the store is important to capture consumers’ attention. Higher inventory levels might allow more attractive displays and thus, increase sales in addition to avoiding stockouts. Academic/practical relevance : By knowing how inventory levels affect consumer choices, retailers can adjust their inventory levels so as to maximize sales or profits. Methodology : We develop a choice model where product demand is indeed affected by inventory and controls for product and store heterogeneity, seasonality, promotions, and potential unobservable shocks in each market. We empirically test the model with daily traffic, inventory, and sales data from a large retailer at the store-day-product level. Results : We find that the impact of inventory level on sales is positive and highly significant, even in situations of extremely high service level. The magnitude of this effect is large: each 1% increase in product-level inventory at the store increases sales by 0.62% on average. This supports the idea that inventory has a strong role in helping customers choose a particular product within the assortment. Managerial implications : We describe how a retailer should optimally decide its inventory levels within a category and describe the properties of the optimal solution. Applying such optimization to our data set yields consistent and significant revenue improvements compared with policies that ignore the impact of inventory on sales.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A core problem in the area of revenue management is pricing goods in the presence of strategic customers. We study this problem when customers are heterogeneous with respect to their initial valuations for the good and their time sensitivities—that is, the customers differ in both their initial valuations and the rates at which their initial valuation decreases with a delay in the purchase. Academic/practical relevance : In many settings, especially in fashion and electronic retail, a customer’s valuation for the product is time-sensitive and decreases over time. In these situations, customers are not only different in terms of their initial willingness to pay for these products when they are first introduced to the market, but they are also different in terms of how rapidly they lose interest in these products. We show that when a firm sells products in such settings, it can realize significant benefits by incorporating dynamic pricing, even in the absence of demand uncertainty. Methodology : Dynamic mechanism design. Results : We characterize the optimal mechanism for selling durable goods when the customers differ in both their initial valuations and the rates at which their initial valuation decreases. We show that delayed allocation and dynamic pricing can be effective screening tools for maximizing firm profit and can also increase social welfare. We also investigate the impact of production and holding costs on the optimal mechanism. Managerial implications : Our work shows how firms can exploit scenarios in which their customers have time-sensitive valuations and are forward-looking to achieve a win–win, by both generating additional revenue and improving social welfare.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many small businesses (suppliers) use web platforms (retailers) to sell their products on a consignment basis. Suppliers are often financially constrained, which affects their profits. Academic/practical relevance : We derive the equilibrium terms of the loan that a retailer will offer to a supplier in a consignment selling environment and their implications for supply chain efficiency. Our model is inspired by the lending program initiated by a major web platform owner. Methodology : We formulate and solve a Stackelberg game. The retailer sets loan terms that may include a debt seniority requirement. The supplier may either accept the retailer’s offer or borrow only from the bank or rely solely on its own capital. A competitively priced bank loan is the supplier’s default option. Results : There exist parameter values for which the on-equilibrium loan terms include retailer debt seniority as well as parameter values that do not. In the latter case, the supplier makes the bank the senior lender. The retailer’s debt seniority choice depends on the supplier’s working capital. When the retailer chooses to be the senior lender, its loan terms may induce the supplier to produce more than the first-best quantity. Managerial implications : Direct financing under equilibrium loan terms weakly improves the expected profits of both the retailer and the supplier. However, it may induce the supplier to produce less than or equal to or greater than the first-best production quantity. Loan limits serve to reduce overproduction.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the following puzzle: why do firms sometimes nurture long wait lines, rather than raising prices (to eliminate these lines)? Academic/practical relevance : In economic theory, prices are studied as a signal of quality, in absence of congestion (wait lines). We study price signaling when customers not only infer quality information from the price, but also from wait lines. Methodology : We developed a stylized model based on queuing and price signaling theory. The firm, privately informed about its quality (high or low), first determines its price. Next, customers arrive according to a Poisson process, observe the price and the wait line upon arrival, and decide whether to purchase. Results : When the proportion of informed consumers is low, to separate on price a high-quality firm must raise its price above the monopoly price. We show that there exist pooling equilibria in which firms instead charge a price lower than the monopoly price. We characterize two pooling equilibria. In both equilibria, a high-quality firm on average has a longer queue than a low-quality one, and long lines signal high quality. In the first one, the price is sufficiently low that short lines in turn signal low quality, so that the queue length almost perfectly reveals the type of the firm. In the second one, the price is in an intermediate range (but remains lower than the monopoly price), and short lines are an imperfect signal of quality. In each of the pooling equilibria, the high-quality firm earns a higher profit than in the separating equilibrium, despite the longer lines. Managerial implications : An empirical implication of our model is that, over time, when more customers become informed about the quality, the price of a new high-quality good should increase and the expected waiting lines should decrease. Our model integrates elements of price signaling in economics and equilibrium queueing in operations research. We hope that our research stimulates further interest in signaling games in service operations environments.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider two competing electronic waste (e-waste) recovery channels, each of which consists of a collector and a recycler. Collectors obtain donated e-waste and sell the collected items to recyclers or in the secondary market, whereas recyclers process e-waste and sell the recycled material in the commodity market. Each recycler chooses for certification of one of two standards: e-Stewards or Responsible Recycling (R2). E-Stewards requires comparably more responsible handling, thus a higher processing cost, but attracts more e-waste from environmentally conscious donors. Academic/practical relevance : Despite the rapid growth of e-waste, the operations management community still understands little about e-waste processing supply chains. We add to this body of knowledge by capturing three salient features in the e-waste recovery industry: the existence of two recycling standards, the secondary market, and competition both within and between recovery channels. Methodology : We model the problem as a Stackelberg game and characterize the firms’ equilibrium decisions, deriving managerial insights through sensitivity analysis and numerical studies. Results : Competition between recovery channels is a key factor motivating e-Stewards adoption, whereas a recycler always chooses R2 in its absence. Interestingly, when competition exists both within and between recovery channels, recyclers with strong e-waste processing scale economies choose e-Stewards when incurring significantly higher processing costs than with R2. Furthermore, both the total environmental benefit and welfare might be higher when recyclers choose R2. Managerial implications : Policy makers who aim to encourage e-Stewards adoption should (1) lower entry barriers for new recyclers to induce competition, and (2) offer incentive programs to alleviate e-Stewards’ cost disadvantage, though only when recyclers have weak scale economies. Policy makers and nongovernmental organizations, however, should exercise caution in endorsing e-Stewards because R2 actually may generate a higher environmental benefit because of higher recycling volumes.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We examine a brick-and-mortar retailer’s choice of which product to include in a promotional display (e.g., an “endcap” display). The display provides a visibility advantage to both the featured product and its category, but it also has consequences for customer traffic and substitution. Academic/practical relevance : Although there has been considerable academic interest in the assortment planning problem (which products to offer?) and in the shelf-space allocation problem (how much space to devote to each product?), little attention has been paid to the problem of where to place products in the store. Promotional display choice can serve as a powerful demand-shaping lever for retailers. A good understanding of this problem can also facilitate a retailer’s negotiations with manufacturers. Methodology : We develop analytical insights using a problem formulation based on a nested multinomial logit model of customer choice. Results : When choosing a promotional product from a fixed category, the only possible optimal choices for promotional display lie along an “efficient set” drawn in terms of product popularities and margins. The optimal choice along the frontier depends on a quantity we call “aisle attractiveness” that depends on several category-level parameters. The value of the display to a category pivots on whether the display’s role is primarily to expand demand for the category or to shape substitution within the category. Managerial implications : Our work provides guidance for how retailers can use and value promotional displays effectively. We highlight the importance of considering externalities of a display decision on store traffic and demand for other products.},

We construct a model that recommends a personalized discounted product bundle to an online shopper that considers the trade-off between profit maximization and inventory management, while selecting products that are relevant to the consumer’s preferences. Academic/practical relevance : We provide analytical performance guarantees that illustrate the complexity of the underlying problem, which combines assortment optimization with pricing. We implement our algorithms in two separate case studies on actual data from a large U.S. e-tailer and a premier global airline. Methodology : We focus on simultaneously balancing personalization through individualized functions of consumer propensity-to-buy, inventory management for long-run profitability, and tractability for practical business implementation. We develop two classes of approximation algorithms, multiplicative and additive, to produce a real-time output for use in an online setting. Results : Our computational results demonstrate significant lifts in expected revenues over current industry pricing strategies on the order of 2%–7% depending on the setting. We find that on average our best algorithm obtains 92% of the expected revenue of a full-knowledge clairvoyant strategy across all inventory settings, and in the best cases this improves to 98%. Managerial implications : We compare the algorithms and find that the multiplicative approach is relatively easier to implement and on average empirically obtains expected revenues within 1%–6% of the additive methods when both are compared with a full-knowledge strategy. Furthermore, we find that the greatest expected gains in revenue come from high-end consumers with lower price sensitivities, and that predicted improvements in sales volume depend on product category and are a result of providing relevant recommendations.},

Methods : We use hospital inpatient data from the state of Florida for the years 2006–2010 to examine this problem in the context of obstetrics services. Results : Patients are more likely to choose hospitals that specialize in obstetrics services. They also show preferences for diversification across hospital units but not diversification within the focal unit. Specifically, they prefer hospitals offering wider ranges of services for newborns, which often involve different departments in the hospital but do not prefer hospitals offering wider ranges of obstetrics services. Managerial implications : Hospitals can gain an advantage by focusing on a small set of services. However, focus has important limits, as patients may have needs that cut across medical specialties and prefer facilities that can serve these sometimes complex needs.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In the U.S. automobile industry, manufacturers distribute products through dealers and rental agencies. To mediate direct competition between the two intermediaries, manufacturers adopted buyback programs to repurchase used rental cars from rental agencies and redistribute them through dealers. We investigate how the timing of buyback pricing affects manufacturers’ profitability and the intermediaries’ ordering decisions by studying two schemes: (1) a precommitted scheme in which a manufacturer precommits to a buyback price at the time of initial sale to rental agencies and (2) a postponed scheme in which a manufacturer postpones the buyback pricing decision to the time of repurchase. Academic/practical relevance : Prior research has not studied the timing of buyback pricing decisions, which is practically relevant because both precommitted and postponed schemes have been adopted by manufacturers in a range of durable-goods industries. Methodology : We used a two-period dynamic Stackelberg game between three types of firms: manufacturer, dealer, and rental agency. Results : A monopolist manufacturer earns a lower profit under the precommitted scheme than under the postponed scheme. The equilibrium buyback quantity is zero under the precommitted scheme but positive under the postponed scheme. These results can be explained by two trade-offs that only exist under the precommitted scheme. First, decreasing the buyback price increases the margin of the manufacturer’s buyback program but decreases the rental agency’s first-period order quantity. Second, increasing the first-period wholesale price offered to the dealer increases the manufacturer’s margin in the sales channel but decreases the rental agency’s first-period order quantity. When manufacturer competition in the rental market is sufficiently intense, a unique equilibrium may arise in which manufacturers choose the precommitted scheme, which maximizes the manufacturers’ profits and yields positive buyback quantity. Managerial implications : The timing of buyback pricing decisions for used durable goods critically affects the profitability of buyback programs in dual distribution channels with dealers and rental agencies. Precommitting to a buyback price may put a manufacturer at a disadvantage because of the intermediaries’ strategic adjustment of their order quantities. However, competition between manufacturers in the rental market may alleviate this disadvantage thanks to a strategic complementarity between competing manufacturers’ buyback prices.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This research focuses on elderly patients who have been hospitalized and are ready to be discharged, but they must remain in the hospital until a bed in a geriatric institution becomes available; these patients “block” a hospital bed. Bed blocking has become a challenge to healthcare operators because of its economic implications and the quality-of-life effect on patients. Indeed, hospital-delayed patients who do not have access to the most appropriate treatments (e.g., rehabilitation) prevent new admissions. Moreover, bed blocking is costly, because a hospital bed is more expensive to operate than a geriatric bed. We are thus motivated to model and analyze the flow of patients between hospitals and geriatric institutions to improve their joint operation. Academic/practical relevance : Practically, our joint modeling of hospital-institution is necessary to capture blocking effects. In contrast to previous research, we address an entire time-varying network, which enables an explicit consideration of blocking costs. Theoretically, our fluid model captures blocking without the need for reflection, which simplifies the analysis as well as the convergence proof of the corresponding stochastic model. Methodology : We develop a mathematical fluid model, which accounts for blocking, mortality, and readmission—all significant features of the discussed environment. Then, for bed allocation decisions, the fluid model and especially, its offered load counterpart turn out insightful and easy to implement. Results : The comparison between our fluid model, a two-year data set from a hospital chain, and simulation results shows that our model is accurate and useful. Moreover, our analysis yields a closed form expression for bed allocation decisions, which minimizes the sum of underage and overage costs. Solving for the optimal number of geriatric beds in our system shows that significant reductions in cost and waiting list length are achievable compared with current operations. Managerial implications : Our model can support healthcare managers in allocating geriatric beds to reduce operational costs. Moreover, our model facilitates three extensions: a periodic reallocation of beds, incorporation of setup costs into bed allocation decisions, and accommodating home care (or virtual hospitals) when feasible.},

Our research question then is whether (or not) loss aversion rules out price variation—and in particular, cyclic pricing. Academic/practical relevance : Pricing and revenue management subject to behavioral considerations are key research areas in operations management. Our approach contributes to this research by highlighting the importance of incorporating heterogeneity in consumers’ behavioral responses in pricing models. Methodology : We model a monopolist selling a product over time to loss-averse consumers who differ in their sensitivity to gains/losses. Although the market is thus segmented, the firm cannot price discriminate among consumers based on that sensitivity. We then characterize the structural properties of the firm’s optimal pricing policy. Results : We show that charging a long-run constant price may be suboptimal and then derive conditions under which the optimal policy is cyclic. These findings establish that loss aversion does not preclude price variation and thereby, underscore the importance of incorporating consumer heterogeneity into pricing policies. Managerial implications : For operations management scholars, our model highlights the importance of heterogeneity in consumers’ behavioral responses to firms’ policies and shows that structurally different insights are obtained from pricing models if this heterogeneity is appropriately accounted for. This approach offers new avenues in pricing and revenue management research. For managers, our model suggests that they could vary prices, under certain conditions, without worrying that price variation will antagonize consumers. Our model offers insights on what these conditions are, which managers may incorporate in devising the pricing policies.},

Academic/practical relevance : Certain unique characteristics of markets for durable products, which make designing EPR implementations more challenging, have not been explored to date in academia and practice. We fill this void by investigating the effect of EPR on durable-goods markets. Methodology : We develop a game-theoretic model to analyze durable-goods producers’ secondary market strategy under EPR and analytically explore its environmental implications. Results : The implications of EPR are not straightforward for durable products. On one hand, despite being focused on recycling, EPR may lead to an unintended benefit in the form of higher reuse levels by reducing producers’ secondary market interference. On the other hand, EPR can also induce or increase secondary market interference by producers. This diminishes environmental goals, such as reducing new production and increasing reuse levels—two key environmental goals with higher priority than increasing recycling. Policy implications : We offer insights for how the environmental effectiveness of EPR for durable products can be improved by appropriately choosing its implementation parameters. We show that implementation approaches that may be considered successful for nondurable products (e.g., packaging or end-of-life batteries) may not be suitable for durable products, such as electronics. For example, more stringent collection targets and infrastructure requirements can backfire in EPR implementations for durable products.},

What competitive inventory policy behavior arises under these various payment-timing arrangements? Academic/practical relevance : Technology advancements are increasing the variety of payment triggers between supply chain stages. However, traditional multiechelon inventory models, which were originally developed for vertically integrated systems, do not explicitly account for payments flowing up the supply chain nor issues of payment timing between stages. Methodology : We introduce an analytical modeling methodology to incorporate financial inventory costs generated by payment-timing arrangements between stages in multiechelon inventory models. We also combine these methods with established inventory theory to study competitive inventory policies in a two-echelon system. Results : Under a class of payment-timing contracts, we show how to express payment flows at each stage in terms of standard physical inventory metrics and the demand-arrival process. We also show how to calculate the average inventory costs for each stage under given inventory policies and payment-timing contracts. In the two-echelon base-stock model, we first show that the cost of decentralization under standard wholesale price contracts is significantly driven by too much inventory at the supplier; it is not exclusively driven by too little inventory at the retailer as in the selling-to-the-newsvendor literature. We show that wholesale price contracts with a type of popular consignment payment timing still leads to too little inventory at the retailer. However, we prove there exists a wholesale price contract with partial consignment timing that can achieve the centralized inventory levels at both the supplier and the retailer. Managerial implications : Researchers can leverage our methodology to incorporate the price transfers and timing aspects of contracts in multiechelon inventory models. Our insights also help managers better understand the impact of prices and payment timing on decentralized chain behavior and performance.},

  abstract     = {We consider the challenges and trade-offs involved in the manufacturing of engineered proteins. Manufacturing these proteins involves high risk of financial losses due to the purity and yield trade-offs, uncertainty in the process outcomes, and high operating costs. In this setting, the biomanufacturer must determine how much protein to manufacture in the upstream fermentation operations, and then how much of it to waste in each subsequent purification operation because of the purity–yield trade-offs. We develop a Markov decision model to optimize three layers of interdependent decisions in protein manufacturing: the optimal amount of protein to be produced in upstream operations, the optimal choice of chromatography technique to be used in downstream operations, and the optimal choice of pooling windows during chromatography. The proposed stochastic model dynamically optimizes these three layers of interdependent decisions to maximize the expected profit. The structural analysis derives functional relationships between the purity–yield trade-offs and operating costs, and characterizes the optimal operating policies. The optimal policy also suggests when the biomanufacturer is better off failing early and cutting losses. We use a state aggregation scheme to reduce the computational efforts, and quantify the savings obtained from the use of the optimization model in industry practice at Aldevron.},

  abstract     = {Network operations often suffer from chronic asset imbalance over time and across locations. This paper addresses the issue in the intermodal industry. The problem is mainly driven by myopic policies, environmental uncertainty, and network interdependence. To address the problem, we develop a unified framework that integrates two core operations: container repositioning and load acceptance. The central piece is the scarcity pricing scheme, which internalizes the externalities each acceptance imposes over time and across locations. The scheme plays two crucial roles: to transmit dynamic scarcity information and to incentivize container repositioning. It is most effective when network imbalance and supply risk are high. Exploiting random capacity and heterogeneous lead time, we further refine the load acceptance policy and develop efficient algorithms. We demonstrate that our approach can dynamically reduce network imbalance and improve efficiency. As such, our work provides analytical tools and insights on how to manage network capacity, when the information is dispersed and evolving over time.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The recent ubiquity of social networks allows firms to collect vast amount of data on their customers and on their social interactions. We consider a setting in which a monopolist sells an indivisible good to consumers who are embedded in a social network. Academic/practical relevance : This is an important problem as sellers can use available data to design and send targeted promotions that account for social externality effects and ultimately increase their profits. Methodology : We capture the interactions among consumers using a broad class of nonlinear utility models. This class extends the existing models by explicitly capturing externalities from subsets of agents (communities or groups) and includes several existing models as special cases (e.g., full information version of the triggering model). Assuming complete information about the interactions, we model the optimal pricing problem as a two-stage game. First, the firm designs prices to maximize profits and then consumers choose whether to purchase the item. Results : Under positive network externalities, we show the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium that is preferred by both the seller and the buyers. Using duality theory and integer-programming techniques, we reformulate the problem into a linear mixed-integer program (MIP). We derive efficient ways to optimally solve the MIP using its linear-programming relaxation for two pricing strategies: discriminative and uniform. Finally, we propose two intuitive heuristic algorithms to solve the problem for which we derive worst-case parametric performance bounds. Managerial implications : We draw interesting insights on the structure of the optimal prices and the seller’s profit. In particular, we quantify the effect on prices when using a nonlinear utility model relative to a linear model and identify settings with which it is beneficial to offer a price below cost to influential agents. Finally, we extend our model and results to the case in which the seller offers incentives (in addition to prices) to solicit actions so as to ensure network externality effects.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We compare two types of contracts that can govern business partnerships: indefinitely binding agreements (IBAs), wherein partners are bound together in a relationship of indefinite duration, and temporarily binding agreements (TBAs), wherein they are able to dissolve the relationship at any moment. Academic/practical relevance : Managers need to determine what type of contract they want to engage in with their business partners. Although Toyota famously argues for building strong, long-lasting relationships with its suppliers, such a commitment makes it difficult to escape from profit-losing relationships. Methodology : We conduct laboratory experiments in which subjects are matched in groups of two and play a two-person newsvendor game. In the IBA treatment, subjects are bound together; in the TBA treatment, they have the ability to dissolve their relationship and be subsequently rematched. We also consider a treatment where the subjects can choose between IBA and TBA, as well as treatments where dissolutions are made more difficult or lead to a fixed outside option rather than rematching. Results : We find that average earnings are higher in the IBA treatment. However, subjects in the TBA treatment with long-lasting partnerships tend to perform better than the average pair in IBA. We argue that TBA facilitates sorting between subjects, whereas IBA provides a greater incentive for forward-looking teaching behavior among subjects. When given the choice, most subjects choose TBA and do better than when the type of contract is imposed on them, irrespective of their choice. We also see evidence of better performance when dissolutions are no longer automatic upon request or lead to the subjects exiting the rematching pool. Managerial implications : Having the flexibility to dissolve a relationship can be beneficial—but this option must be used wisely. When entering into partnerships with suppliers and customers, managers should balance out the teaching benefits of long-term contracts, with the potential drawbacks of unpunished disingenuous behavior. Short-term contracts may be preferable if the parties can refrain from breaking up the partnership in dark times, which are beyond the control of the business partners.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Loyalty programs (LPs) introduce a new currency—the points—through which customers transact with firms. Such points represent a promise for future service, and their monetary value thus counts as a liability on the issuing firms’ balance sheets. Consequently, adjusting the value of points has a first-order effect on profitability and performance and emerges as a core operating decision. We study the problem of optimally setting the points’ value in view of their associated liabilities. Academic/practical relevance : Firms across numerous industries increasingly utilize LPs. The sheer magnitude of LPs coupled with recent changes in accounting rules have turned the associated liabilities into significant balance-sheet items, amounting to billions of dollars. Managers (from chief financial officers to chief marketing officers) struggle with the problem of adjusting the points’ value in view of these liabilities. Academic work is primarily aimed at understanding LPs as marketing tools, without studying the liability angle. Methodology : We develop a multiperiod model and use dynamic programming techniques and comparative statics analysis. Results : We show that the optimal policies depend on a new financial metric, given by the sum of the firm’s realized cash flows and outstanding deferred revenue, which we refer to as the profit potential . The total value of loyalty points is set to hit a particular target, which increases with the profit potential. We find that loyalty programs can act as buffers against uncertainty, with the value of points increasing (decreasing) under strong (weak) operating performance and increasing with uncertainty. Managerial implications : Setting the point values and adjusting operating decisions in view of LP liabilities should be done by tracking the firm’s profit potential. Loyalty programs can act as hedging tools against uncertainty in future operating performance, which provides a new rationale for their existence, even in the absence of competition.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: In this paper, we study the fleet repositioning problem for a free-float vehicle sharing system, aiming to dynamically match the vehicle supply and travel demand at the lowest total cost of repositioning and lost sales. Academic/practical relevance : Besides the analytical results on the optimal repositioning policy, the proposed optimization framework is applicable to practical problems by its computational efficiency as well as the capability to handle temporally dependent demands. Methodology : We first formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program. To solve for a multiregion system, we deploy the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach that can incorporate demand temporal dependence, motivated by real data. We first propose a “myopic” two-stage DRO model that serves as both an illustration of the DRO framework and a benchmark for the later multistage model. We then develop a computationally efficient multistage DRO model with an enhanced linear decision rule (ELDR). Results : Under a two-region system, we find a simple reposition up-to and down-to policy to be optimal, when the demands are temporally independent. Such a structure is also preserved by our ELDR solution. We also provide new analytical insights by proving the optimality of ELDR in solving the single-period DRO problem. We then show that the numerical performance of the ELDR solution is close to the exact optimal solution from the dynamic program. Managerial implications : In a real-world case study of car2go, we quantify the “value of repositioning” and compare with several benchmarks to demonstrate that the ELDR solutions are computationally scalable and in general result in lower cost with less frequent repositioning. We also explore several managerial implications and extensions from the experiments.},

Like the latter, we argue that we must contribute to a growing set of domains using all possible tools of inquiry. But sharing the concern of the former, we view fragmentation as a symptom of a problem. To get out of its rut, to have greater impact, the field needs to ask questions that are important and provide answers that are interesting. In particular, we should (i) avoid the trap of specificity (excellent answers to narrowly defined questions), (ii) expand our horizon beyond our (relatively) small field (connect and actively engage with diverse audiences), and (iii) be bold to pioneer new areas of inquiry.

The results show that although empirical operations management research has made great strides thus far, empirical research still lags analytic modeling, and much work remains to be done. We call on operations management scholars to broaden and increase their use of empirical tools as a vital source of new knowledge creation; and we highlight the benefits of filling methodological gaps, especially in case and survey research. Drawing on the dynamics associated with paradigm shifts, we offer a new research paradigm that we term combinative research value , in which these two empirical techniques, coupled with other approaches (e.g., web scraping, analyses of big data, and/or analytic modeling), can help accelerate our understanding of changing operating strategies and practices. We advocate for a tighter integration of analytical and empirical operations management knowledge in order to address the challenges and opportunities of the fast-paced, enormous forces of change in the 21st century.},

The need for effective humanitarian aid is, therefore, larger than ever. Humanitarian organizations have recognized the critical role of supply chain management in reaching beneficiaries, and they have introduced commercial routines and best practices. Academics realized that humanitarian operations constitute a fruitful new research area and adapted solution techniques developed for commercial operations to disaster situations with mitigated success. Meanwhile, the problems that humanitarian practitioners face quickly evolve. In this paper, we highlight challenges in matching practitioner needs with academic publications and outline the great opportunities for impactful and relevant research.},

We use these applications to highlight distinguishing features of sharing economy business models and to point out research questions that are new. Then we draw connections between classical operations management theory and models and those that have been used to study sharing economy applications.

Several different approaches and thematic lenses have emerged in the academic community to address diverse questions in innovation management; however, the work published in M&amp;SOM has a narrow focus. This gap reveals an opportunity for the M&amp;SOM community, which may be addressed in part by improvements in the review process of the journal.

The global supply chain management literature developed during this time provided theoretical frameworks and decision support tools for operational and supply chain decisions in the global context. Recent development in trade barrier debates as well as increasing uncertainties in countries’ trade policies have forced companies to rethink their global operational strategies. In this short paper, we draw insights from the existing global supply chain literature and in particular, focus on interpreting recent research contributions published in Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management ( M&amp;SOM ) on the topic to gain understanding of the implications of trade policies, especially tariffs, for firms’ global facility network design decisions. We also provide a discussion of important dimensions that were absent from the existing literature but are pertinent to providing a richer understanding of implications of trade policies for today’s interconnected supply chains. Future research that takes into consideration those previously less explored dimensions has the potential to offer insights not only to industry practitioners but also, to the policy makers. Developing an appreciation of potential reactions from complex connected supply chains in various industries would help policy makers better anticipate the impact of trade policy change.},
