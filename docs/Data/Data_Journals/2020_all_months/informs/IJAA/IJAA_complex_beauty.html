It has more than 60 retail franchises throughout the United States, which order in large lots from the commissary. We developed a low-cost, user-friendly, and creative solution for the franchises to easily improve their orders to minimize costs and maintain product freshness. Implemented benefits include an 80\% improvement in inventory at time of order, a 75\% reduction in the number of orders, and an improvement in product freshness.},

  abstract = {The first division clubs in Argentinean professional football maintain teams in each of six youth leagues, classed by age as major divisions (Under-20, Under-18, Under-17) and minor divisions (Under-16, Under-15, Under-14). Regular season play in these leagues typically follows a single round-robin format; the minor divisions play the same schedule as the majors but with the home-away status of the matches reversed. This setup can give rise to very significant differences in travel distances between the major and minor division teams of a given club, which is a frustrating situation for club officials, coaches, and players alike but almost impossible to avoid with manual season scheduling techniques. Nor are these methods able to take into account any number of other criteria that go into the design of a satisfactory match calendar. This paper reports on models developed using mathematical programming to simultaneously schedule multiple leagues while also meeting a series of other desirable conditions. The central criterion is a better balance in the travel distances of the various teams, pursued through the application of two alternative solution approaches: one based on regional team clusters and the other on explicit analysis of actual distances between the teams’ home venues. The solutions generated by these approaches have been used by the organizers of the Argentinean youth leagues to draw up their season schedules since 2018, which has resulted in a series of benefits for all stakeholders.},

  abstract = {The National Basketball Association (NBA) is divided into two conferences, each of which comprises 15 teams. At the end of the regular season, the top eight teams from each conference, based on winning percentage, compete in the playoffs. Mixed-integer-programming (MIP) models determine when a team has guaranteed its position in the playoffs (clinched) or, conversely, when it has been eliminated before the completion of the regular season. Our models incorporate a series of complex two-way tiebreaking criteria used by the NBA to determine how many more games are needed either to clinch or to avoid elimination. We compare the time at which a given team has clinched or been eliminated, in terms of the number of games played in the season to date, as posted in the NBA official standings, against results from our mixed-integer program. For the 2017–2018 season, when our models outperform those of the NBA, they do so by an average of 4.1 games. We also describe a scenario in which the NBA erroneously reported that the Boston Celtics had clinched a playoff spot and, conversely, show that the Golden State Warriors had clinched a playoff spot before the official announcement by the NBA.},

  abstract = {Mining operations determine a long-term production schedule, often to maximize net present value. For a time horizon of between years and decades, optimization models seek the extraction times—with monthly or yearly fidelity—of three-dimensional, notional blocks of ore and waste within a deposit to satisfy spatial precedence constraints, as well as resource constraints on the amount of material extracted and sent to the mill. With algorithmic advances, as well as those in mine planning software and in hardware, we are able to solve instances with a decade-long horizon at daily fidelity. The resulting objective, repeatable, and defensible schedules inform production and maintenance supervisory decisions based on resource availability, that is, loaders, shovels, haul trucks, and mineral processors. We implement our solutions at the Turquoise Ridge underground gold mine in Nevada, United States. These solutions indicate more than a 2\% increase in total ounces extracted over a decade while decreasing development footage by as much as 11\% over the same time horizon. Furthermore, we are able to incorporate rules governing a shared resource and to evaluate binding versus nonbinding capacity constraints.},

  abstract = {We provide an overview of the design and analysis of a simulation model that was used in designing, refining, planning, and implementing the world’s largest drive-through mass vaccination clinic in Louisville, Kentucky. The Louisville Metro Public Health and Wellness department provided the H1N1 vaccine to 19,318 residents via a drive-through and a walk-up clinic over 1.5 days. Almost two-thirds of the people vaccinated used the drive-through clinic. The simulation model and its results helped advise the project commissioners about the feasibility of the drive-through vaccination. It also allowed them to determine the proper layout and levels of staffing for efficient dispensing of the vaccines. General observations made at the actual clinic and a comparison of those with the simulation model are presented. Recommendations and shortcomings are discussed for improving the flow of the drive-through and the effectiveness of the data gathering, which could be helpful in future efforts. With the entire world having to react to the COVID-19 pandemic and plan for protecting citizens against the novel coronavirus, the models we developed and the experience we gained could be helpful in administering COVID-19 tests to large swaths of the population quickly or dispense vaccines, when the latter becomes available.},

In this Interfaces (INT) and INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics (IJAA) anniversary ranking, I analyze organizational contributions to the practice of OR/MS in INT since the inception of the journal in 1971. I calculate all three prior ranking measures—visibility, yield, and academic yield—and a blend of the rankings. This analysis considers only articles in INT/IJAA, which is a departure from prior rankings, which included applied work in some other journals. However, for the first time, we have a single database of every article ever published in INT/IJAA, allowing analysis of trends over time. I am also able to compute the all-time contributions of nonacademic institutions as done by Fricker in 2012.},

We provide some basic descriptive analytics about the participating organizations and authors, the impact of their work, and the methods they employed. We also conduct predictive analytics on finalist submissions, gauging contributors to success in establishing winning entries. We find that predicting Edelman winners a priori is extremely difficult; however, given a set of finalists, predictive models based on monetary impact could have predicted the winner over half the time in recent years, but would have had less predictive success in the early years of the competition. We suggest that, by characterizing the finalists, we can give future entrants a better picture of what it takes to compete for the Edelman Award.},

  abstract = {Improving airport collaborative decision making is at the heart of airport operations centers (APOCs) recently established in several major European airports. In this paper, we describe a project commissioned by Eurocontrol, the organization in charge of the safety and seamless flow of European air traffic. The project’s goal was to examine the opportunities offered by the colocation and real-time data sharing in the APOC at London’s Heathrow airport, arguably the most advanced of its type in Europe. We developed and implemented a pilot study of a real-time data-sharing and collaborative decision-making process, selected to improve the efficiency of Heathrow’s operations. In this paper, we describe the process of how we chose the subject of the pilot, namely the improvement of transfer-passenger flows through the airport, and how we helped Heathrow move from its existing legacy system for managing passenger flows to an advanced machine learning–based approach using real-time inputs. The system, which is now in operation at Heathrow, can predict which passengers are likely to miss their connecting flights, reducing the likelihood that departures will incur delays while waiting for delayed passengers. This can be done by off-loading passengers in advance, by expediting passengers through the airport, or by modifying the departure times of aircraft in advance. By aggregating estimated passenger arrival time at various points throughout the airport, the system also improves passenger experiences at the immigration and security desks by enabling modifications to staffing levels in advance of expected surges in arrivals. The nine-stage framework we present here can support the development and implementation of other real-time, data-driven systems. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed system is the first to use machine learning to model passenger flows in an airport.},

Working in collaboration with a major aircraft manufacturer, we aim to instill a new pricing culture and develop a scalable new pricing methodology. Pricing rotable spare parts presents unique challenges ranging from complex inventory dynamics and minimal demand information to limited data availability. We develop a novel pricing analytics approach that tackles all of these challenges and that can be applied across all rotable spare parts. We then describe a large-scale implementation of our approach with our industrial partner, which led to an improvement in profits of over 3.9\% over a 10-month period.},

  abstract = {Denver Public Schools (DPS) serves roughly 90,000 K–12 students using a mixed bus fleet. Developing and reviewing bus-route assignments manually has been challenging and time consuming for DPS. During 2017–2018, DPS analysts reviewed and adjusted over 700 routes assigned to approximately 200 buses, considering time and capacity feasibility. We developed a decision support tool (DST) to generate feasible bus-route assignments and help inform DPS’s decisions. The DST employs optimization models to solve the bus-route assignment problem using distance data from Google Maps Application Programming Interface and various interroute reposition-time scenarios to account for the impact of potential traffic delays. The model incorporates multiple objectives related to minimizing cost, meeting demand, and maximizing “consistency”—that is, the difference between a newly created and previously implemented solution The solutions generated by the DST for the 2017–2018 school year utilized significantly fewer buses and lower reposition mileage compared with the DPS solution. Considering the convenience, efficiency, and flexibility of generating high-quality bus-route assignments using the DST, the DPS transportation team has used the DST in the route planning process since 2018.},

Because of the dynamic and stochastic nature of supply and demand in this context, the ride-hailing order-dispatching problem is challenging to solve for an optimal solution. Added to the complexity are considerations of system response time, reliability, and multiple objectives. In this paper, we describe how our approach to this optimization problem has evolved from a combinatorial optimization approach to one that encompasses a semi-Markov decision-process model and deep reinforcement learning.

The prestigious Wagner Prize—awarded for achievement in implemented operations research, management science, and advanced analytics—emphasizes quality and originality of mathematical models and clarity of written and oral exposition. This year’s winning application is a ride-dispatching solution that the Chinese ride service DiDi developed to match ride requests to available drivers. The model uses a Markov decision process along with machine learning to optimize the assignments, resulting in improved response rates, fulfillment rates, and driver income. The remaining papers include an optimization model that generates daily tutoring schedules for students and teachers at Hopeful Journeys, a school for children with disabilities; integer programming models to develop bus-route assignments for the Denver Public Schools; a novel pricing methodology, in the context of limited historical data, for reusable spare parts; and a machine learning approach to improve airline passenger flows through London’s Heathrow airport.},

The tool is based on two interactive modules, PLANNER and SIMOPT, with different and complementary purposes. Each module is based on mixed-integer models with specific inputs, outputs, and user interfaces. PLANNER consists of three submodules: (i) planning assigns a batch of concentrated juice to be produced on a specific day, taking into account cleaning activities, rest days, raw material availability, and production and storage constraints; (ii) preprocessing organizes juice orders in batches; and (iii) pooling provides a detailed monitoring of semielaborated juice in storage pools in terms of inventories and sugar and acid content. Finally, SIMOPT provides a detailed optimal operative condition of the plant together with a thorough calculation of specific costs. This information is used by PLANNER to evaluate the corresponding economic objective functions. Besides providing optimal target conditions to the plant and feasible production schedules, the developed tools generate production guidelines in the long term and allow performing scenario studies.},

A comparative analysis of the competencies reveals that, although some of the competencies required by the jobs are taught adequately at the universities, a few key concepts and topics are not covered at sufficient depth as needed by the jobs. The research also shows that many traditional analytics topics are being over-taught at the universities when compared with the demand, whereas some key soft skills are not addressed at a sufficient level in many programs.

  abstract = {A vehicle content portfolio refers to a complete set of combinations of vehicle features offered while satisfying certain restrictions for the vehicle model. Vehicle Content Optimization (VCO) is a simulation-based decision support system at General Motors (GM) that helps to optimize a vehicle content portfolio to improve GM’s business performance and customers’ satisfaction. VCO has been applied to most major vehicle models at GM. VCO consists of several steps that demand intensive computing power, thus requiring trade-offs between the estimation error of the simulated performance measures and the computation time. Given VCO’s substantial influence on GM’s content decisions, questions were raised regarding the business risk caused by uncertainty in the simulation results. This paper shows how we successfully established an uncertainty quantification procedure for VCO that can be applied to any vehicle model at GM. With this capability, GM can not only quantify the overall uncertainty in its performance measure estimates but also identify the largest source of uncertainty and reduce it by allocating more targeted simulation effort. Moreover, we identified several opportunities to improve the efficiency of VCO by reducing its computational overhead, some of which were adopted in the development of the next generation of VCO.},

The CTO must utilize its rolling stock efficiently, select containers, and assign these containers to wagons optimally considering multiple conflicting requirements. I discuss a mathematical programming–based approach we developed for a major CTO for train-load planning, which reduces the average cost of container haulage and increases the timeliness desired by customers. After being used to plan more than 1,000 trains, my model has been estimated to save about 2\% in rail haulage cost, which corresponds to an annual saving of more than 300 million Indian rupees for Indian Railways trains. This study has led to a remarkable turnaround in the operations strategy of the operator, with a shift in emphasis from increasing train utilization to maximizing the contribution to profit.},

Verizon engages thousands of suppliers for many reasons—best price, diversity, short-term requirements, and so forth. Whereas managing a few larger spend suppliers can be done manually by dedicated sourcing managers, managing thousands of smaller suppliers at the tail spend is challenging, can often introduce risk, and can be expensive. At Verizon, a unique blend of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, as well as Verizon-specific sourcing acumen was leveraged to tackle this problem and rationalize Verizon’s tail spend suppliers. Through the creative application of operations research, machine learning, text mining, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence, Verizon reduced spend by millions of dollars and acquired the lowest PPU for the sourced products and services. Other benefits Verizon realized were centralized and transparent contract and supplier relationship management, overhead cost reduction, decreased contract execution lead time, and service quality improvement for Verizon’s strategic sourcing teams.},

Risk-based security is a paradigm for aligning security resources (i.e., personnel, technology, and time) with security risks. PreCheck is one approach that the TSA uses to implement this strategy. Given that passengers enrolled in PreCheck undergo background checks and fingerprinting, they experience expedited screening at airport security checkpoints, with standard screening lanes dedicated to passengers not enrolled in PreCheck. This difference can favorably impact the TSA’s ability to detect threat items like firearms. This paper uses publicly available data on firearm detection, number of passengers screened, and the fraction of passenger screenings in PreCheck lanes to estimate the number of firearms missed at airport security checkpoints in the United States. To achieve this, it defines risky firearms as firearms carried by passengers not enrolled in PreCheck and assumes that only standard screening lanes are where such firearms are brought to checkpoints. Under this assumption, the number of risky firearms missed in the recent past is estimated, given more current risky firearm detection rates. This analysis suggests that increasing the number of PreCheck passenger screenings may reduce the number of undetected risky firearms passing through security checkpoints.},

  abstract = {In many industries, multifacility service providers can save time and money and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by more efficiently allocating customers to their facilities. However, firms incur a reallocation cost when reassigning a customer to a different facility, something that has not received much attention in the literature. Software packages such as CPLEX can find the optimal solution for this type of problem, but managers rarely use them because they lack the specific knowledge, overestimate the cost, and/or underestimate the benefits. Including the reallocation costs, we modeled several common heuristics in Excel’s Visual Basic and compared the results with the optimal solution found by CPLEX. We collaborated with Van Dorp, a large service provider in the Netherlands, and found that (1) substantial savings can be achieved, (2) reallocation costs play a major role, and (3) the best heuristic achieves near-optimal results.

The company operates in several regions across Italy and aims to optimize the dispatching of technicians to customer locations where they perform installations, closures, or maintenance activities within time slots chosen by the customers. The system uses historical data and helps operations managers in performing a number of strategic decisions: grouping municipalities into clusters; designing sets of model-weeks for each cluster; evaluating the obtained solutions by means of a dynamic rolling horizon simulator; and providing as output several key performance indicators, as well as visual optimized technician routing plans to analyze different scenarios. The system uses mathematical models and heuristic algorithms that have been specifically developed to take into account different service levels. Computational experiments carried out on data provided by the company confirm the efficiency of the proposed methods. These methods also constitute a powerful tool that can be used by the company not only to reduce costs but also to help them in their strategic evaluation of existing and potential market opportunities.},

  abstract = {The Volkswagen Pre-Production Center (VPC) is responsible for the entire prototype assembly of the Volkswagen brand. In their assembly sites, however, they often cannot employ their manufacturing staff to the full utilization level, and therefore, the manufacturing volume is low. Maximizing the manufacturing volume for a given available capacity is a frequently pursued objective in industrial manufacturing. The planning task of capacity scheduling contributes to this objective by deciding on resource allocation and the selection and scheduling of orders. We were asked to evaluate possible operations research/management science (OR/MS) solutions for their capacity scheduling problem. To this end, we developed a prototype for capacity scheduling based on binary integer programming. After the prototype had revealed high improvement potential, we developed a spreadsheet-based decision support system (DSS) for daily capacity scheduling. The schedules generated by the DSS were substantially better than the solutions generated by the current manual procedure, in terms of both accomplished manufacturing volume and planning effort. After successful test implementation and rollout, the VPC estimated the annual cost savings to lie in the six-digit Euro range. Meanwhile, we continue spreading OR/MS methods to neighboring departments of the VPC.},

The fleet assignments have to satisfy certain operational constraints, such as coverage, maximum overnight stays, and airport compatibility. Fleet assignments are tactical decisions, and changes in demand and maintenance requirements require an intermediate decision-making process to capture these changes before a flight’s day of departure. In this paper, we describe an implementation of a swapper optimization suite (SOS) for one of the largest airlines in Japan. The scale of the flight legs, the equipment types, complex operational constraints, maintenance requirements, and other complex criteria specified by the route planners necessitated the development of a sophisticated optimization suite to generate swaps of flight legs among the different equipment types for the allotted fleet assignments. The SOS uses optimization models to generate the optimal swaps. The company has seamlessly integrated the SOS in its information systems to incorporate optimization into the decision-making process.},

@article{ ,
  abstract = {In this paper, we describe the use of operations research for offshore wind farm design in Vattenfall, one of the world’s leading companies in the generation of offshore wind energy. We focus on two key aspects that Vattenfall must address in its wind farm design process. The first is determining where to locate the turbines. This aspect is important because the placement of each turbine creates interference on the neighboring turbines, causing a power loss at the overall farm level. The optimizers must minimize this interference based on the wind conditions; however, they must also consider the other costs involved, which depend on factors such as the water depth or soil conditions at each position. The second aspect involves determining how to interconnect the turbines with cables (i.e., cable optimization). This requires Vattenfall to consider both the immediate costs and long-term costs connected with the electrical infrastructure. We developed mixed-integer programming models and matheuristic techniques to solve the two problems as they arise in practical applications. The resulting tools have given Vattenfall a competitive advantage at multiple levels. They facilitate increased revenues and reduced costs of approximately 10 million euros of net present value (NPV) per farm, while ensuring a much faster, more streamlined, and efficient design process. Considering only the sites that Vattenfall has already acquired using our optimization tools, the company experienced NPV gains of more than 150 million euros. This has contributed substantially to its competitiveness in offshore tenders and made green energy cheaper for its end customers. The tools have also been used to design the first wind farms that will be constructed subsidy-free.},

  abstract = {Many merchants conduct their businesses through e-commerce. One major challenge in tackling e-commerce fraud results from dynamic fraud patterns, which can degrade the detection power of risk models and can lead to them failing to detect fraud that has emerging unrecognized patterns. The problem is further exacerbated by the conventional decision frameworks that ignore the follow-up decisions made by other associated parties (e.g., payment-instrument-issuing banks and manual review agents). Microsoft developed a new fraud-management system (FMS) that effectively tackles these two challenges. It keeps features used by the machine learning (ML) risk models up to date by using real-time archiving, dynamic risk tables, and knowledge graphs. The FMS uses customized long-term and short-term sequential ML models to detect both historical and emerging fraud patterns. It also makes rapid real-time optimal decisions using a dynamic programming approach to optimize the long-term profit by taking into account the aforementioned multiple-party decisions. After implementing these innovations over a two-year period (2016–2018), Microsoft reduced its fraud loss by 0.52\%, thus generating $75 million in additional savings; reduced the incorrect fraud rejection rate by 1.38\%; and improved its bank authorization rate by 7.7 percentage points. The result was many millions of dollars in additional revenue. These innovations simultaneously prevent fraud and increase bank acceptance. In April 2019, Microsoft launched Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, a cloud-based service available for all e-commerce merchants.},

  abstract = {In the winter of 2016, Boston Public Schools (BPS) launched a crowdsourcing national competition to create a better way to construct bus routes to improve efficiency, deepen the ability to model policy changes, and realign school start times. The winning team came from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The team developed an algorithm to construct school bus routes by assigning students to stops, combining stops into routes, and optimally assigning vehicles to routes. BPS has used this algorithm for two years running; in the summer of 2017, its use led to a 7\% reduction in the BPS bus fleet. Bus routing optimization also gives BPS the unprecedented ability to understand the financial impact of new policies that affect transportation. In particular, the MIT research team developed a new mathematical model to select start times for all schools in the district in a way that considers transportation. Using this methodology, BPS proposed a solution that would have saved an additional $12 million annually and also shifted students to more developmentally appropriate school start times (e.g., by reducing the number of high school students starting before 8:00 a.m. from 74\% to 6\% and the average number of elementary school students dismissed after 4:00 p.m. from 33\% to 15\%). However, 85\% of the schools’ start times would have been changed, with a median change of one hour. This magnitude of change led to strong vocal opposition from some school communities that would have been affected negatively; therefore, BPS did not implement the plan.},

  abstract = {The Louisville and Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District (Louisville MSD) in Kentucky uses operations research, advanced analytics, and innovative engineering concepts to protect local community waterways by optimizing the collection, transport, and treatment of wastewater. When a large rainfall event overwhelms wastewater and stormwater system capacities, the results can be urban runoff pollution, sewer overflows, and localized flooding. To address the many challenges of reducing sewer overflows and protecting public health and the environment, while also considering their financial limitations, Louisville MSD looked for innovative ways to optimize its wastewater system design and operation. In partnership with Tetra Tech, Louisville MSD pioneered the application of real-time control (RTC) using Csoft®, which relies on sewer-monitoring data, weather forecasting, and data analytics for system-wide optimization, such as better flow routing, optimal filling and dewatering of storage basins and tunnels, and maximization of the use of treatment capacities. As a result of implementing this solution, Louisville MSD experiences fewer sewer overflows during rainfalls and also benefits by reducing the size of the storage facilities required. The use of RTC has avoided over $200 million of capital cost for the community to date, and it also improved operational efficiencies. In operation since 2006, the RTC system was implemented in phases in accordance with the Louisville MSD long-term overflow abatement plan to improve and increase system capacities. Currently, the RTC system reduces more than two billion gallons of sewer overflows per typical year.},
