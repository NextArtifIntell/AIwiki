  abstract     = {We consider a cloud provider that hosts interactive applications, such as mobile apps and online games. Depending on the traffic of users for an application, the provider commits a subset of its resources (hardware capacity) to serve the application. The provider must choose a dynamic pricing mechanism to indirectly select the applications hosted and maximize revenue. We model the provider’s pricing problem as a large-scale stochastic dynamic program. To approach this problem, we propose a tractable approach to enable decomposing the multidimensional stochastic dynamic program into single-dimensional subproblems. We then extend the proposed framework to define an individualized dynamic pricing mechanism for the cloud provider. We present novel upper bounds on the optimal revenue to evaluate the performance of our pricing mechanism. The computational results show that a contract-based model of selling interactive cloud services achieves significantly greater revenue than the prevalent alternative and that our pricing scheme attains near-optimal revenue.},

  abstract     = {Because electric vehicle sharing (EVS) offers the advantages of high flexibility and convenience, it has been receiving increasing attention worldwide as an effective approach to easing traffic congestion and environmental pollution. However, unbalanced electric vehicle distribution is an obstacle in the development of EVS. In this paper, we propose an integrated strategy to mitigate the imbalance issue and enhance customers’ adoption of EVS. We construct an integrated strategy that combines the price-incentive approach with the trip-selection policy and models uncertain travel demand in a continuous trip-adopting process based on our integrated strategy. Aiming to improve EVS operating profits, we apply spatiotemporal nonlinear mixed-integer programming to formulate the travel pricing and rebalancing plan. Additionally, we approximate the model in a tractable form after analyzing the optimal service adoption and develop an efficient exact algorithm to handle the nonlinear items. The computational results of a real-world car2go Amsterdam case study demonstrate several economic and environmental benefits generated by our integrated policy, including (i) higher profits for EVS operators, (ii) improved service satisfaction for consumers, and (iii) a higher level of carbon emissions reduction, from 381 grams per mile to 225 grams per mile, beneficial for the social environment. Moreover, according to the case study, an appropriate initial fleet size, high rebalancing frequency, low labor cost, high potential travel demands, and short charging time also benefit EVS operation.},

  abstract     = {As a consequence of the sharing economy attaining more popularity, there has been a shift toward shared-use mobility services in recent years, especially those that encourage users to share their personal vehicles with others. To date, different variants of these services have been proposed that call for different settings and give rise to different research questions. Peer-to-peer (P2P) ride sharing is one such service that provides a platform for drivers to share their personal trips with riders who have similar itineraries. Unlike ride-sourcing services, drivers in P2P ride sharing have their own individual trips to make and are not driving for the sole purpose of serving rider requests. Unlike traditional carpooling, P2P ride sharing can serve on-demand and one-time trip requests. P2P ride sharing has been identified as a sustainable mode of transportation that results in several individual and societal benefits. The core of a P2P ride-sharing system is a ride-matching problem that determines ride-sharing plans for users. This paper reviews the major studies on the operations of P2P ride-sharing systems, with a focus on modeling and solution methodologies for matching, routing, and scheduling. In this paper, we classify ride-sharing systems based on their operational features and review the existing methodologies for each class. We further discuss a number of important directions for future research.},

We assume that an autonomous vehicle is shared by a group of users, which is only accessible by the group. We use stable matching to help users find an appropriate group with which to share an autonomous vehicle and present a generalized stable matching model that allows flexible sizes of groups as well as various alternative objectives.

We develop two solution methods and compare them in terms of computational time and several performance metrics such as the probability of correct stopping decision. One proposed method is an application of the one-step look-ahead policy to this problem. The second proposal builds a diffusion approximation to the state variable in the continuous regime and approximates the trial’s stopping time by optimal stopping of a diffusion process. The secondary objective of the paper is to compare these methods on different dose-response curves, particularly when the true dose-response curve has no significant advantage over a placebo. Our results, which include a real clinical trial case study, show that look-ahead policies perform poorly in terms of the probability of correct decision in this setting, whereas our diffusion approximation method provides robust solutions.},

We sketch the evolution and design of LPs over the past 200 years and distinguish between several types of programs (free rewards-based programs and paid membership programs) and the types of benefits they offer (discounts and giveaways). We propose a theoretical model that hypothesizes that members who pay directly for LPs will use different benefits than customer who receive LP membership as a bundled package. Furthermore, we hypothesis that different benefit use moderates loyalty behavior. We test the hypotheses using a database of restaurant LP customers and find partial support for our hypotheses; in response to the sunk-cost effect and expectancy-value theory, a paid LP enrollment brings with it a need to self-justify and find the easiest path to investment payoff. Bundled members are more inclined to use lesser-used benefits. Our results suggest that proliferation of benefits may not translate into improved service, loyalty, or satisfaction.},

Whereas prior research has examined the impact of displaying authentic emotional expressions on service encounter satisfaction, empirical research on the joint impact of smile intensity and the service provider’s gender is scarce. To bridge that gap, the current study examines such interactive effects on customers’ authenticity perceptions. Our findings indicate that a broad smile is perceived as more authentic when the service provider is a female (versus a male). Conversely, a slight smile is more congruent with male stereotypes, thus leading to higher authenticity perceptions. This study further shows that perceived authenticity is the psychological mechanism explaining the link between smile intensity and service encounter satisfaction.},

We propose a two-phase methodological framework for designing an observation unit for heart failure patients. In the first phase, by studying various patient volumes and arrival patterns based on a data set from a large secondary hospital, we investigate the optimal number of beds to be installed in an observation unit by means of different analytical models. In the second phase, we study the possible admission and discharge policies for this observation unit with a prespecified capacity. We assess each policy under various quality-of-care and cost criteria, including the probability of postdischarge events, the likelihood of hospitalization, the total cost and the cost–gain ratio.

This study investigates the role of call interaction fluency in customer-employee interactions through call centres. Specifically, we conceptualise and develop a scale to measure call interaction fluency (study 1) and propose a model (study 2) in which fluency is linked to the customer’s emotional response (anger), an evaluation of the interaction (interaction satisfaction), and the customer-company relationship (call aversion, trust, and satisfaction with the company). We also introduce the role of the coping strategy used by customers depending on their initial emotional state (study 3). The results provide an easy-to-administer scale to measure call interaction fluency, and both direct and indirect effects are shown in a holistic model. Agent’s nationality and gender and customer’s age moderated the effect of call interaction fluency on interaction satisfaction; fluent interaction proved to be efficacious for both emotion-focused and problem-focused customers.
