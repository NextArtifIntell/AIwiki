  abstract     = {When using digital goods that extensively collect user information, privacy uncertainty, which is consumers’ difficulty in assessing the privacy of the data they entrust to others, is a major concern. We extend the existing literature on uncertainty in online marketplaces by incorporating privacy uncertainty, and we distinguish among three subdimensions of privacy uncertainty—namely collection, use, and protection. We subsequently theorize and empirically test the antecedents and consequences of this new construct in the context of mobile apps. Consistent with economic theory, we argue that because consumers possess less information than the app seller as a result of the presence of hidden characteristics and hidden action, privacy uncertainty is evoked. Using the factorial survey method, we test our theoretical model in the context of buying a mobile app. The results show that privacy uncertainty significantly influences potential users’ intention to use an app above and beyond their uncertainty about the seller and the product. Privacy uncertainty also affects the perceived risk associated with using an app and the price consumers are willing to pay for it. In addition, we find that privacy uncertainty is driven by the uncertainty about privacy practices in regard to the collection, use, and protection of data collected at the time of downloading the app—and more important, the data collected while the app is being used. The results of another factorial survey study suggest that privacy uncertainty is distinct from seller and product uncertainties and has unique drivers. The results of a survey of current users of existing mobile apps indicate that the effects of privacy uncertainty extend to the postadoption stage, where it remains a strong influencer of continued use intentions and perceived risk.},

Applying four estimation strategies at different levels of observation (town, movie, country, and consumer), we find that the introduction of the law is associated with a 9\% increase in the market share of American movies. This increase occurs at the expense of other movies. Although we find an increase in overall admissions, this effect is not statistically significant. These findings primarily originate from a high initial level of asymmetric piracy between American and other movies, which was attenuated by the antipiracy law, resulting in a fiercer competition between movies. The results can also be explained by the behavior of younger consumers and might be caused by consumers’ budget or time constraints. We exclude positive shocks on the relative quality of American movies, the advent of three-dimensional movies, supply-side reactions by firms, and word-of-mouth effects of illegal downloads as explanations for this redistributive effect.},

  abstract     = {Daily deals platforms have emerged as an integral part of the marketing mix for retailers and have enjoyed a wide acceptance among consumers. However, there is considerable ambiguity about the effects of deals on brand evaluations, in particular, the effects on preconsumption brand evaluations. This ambiguity can influence the decisions by retailers to join daily deals platforms, which operate as double-sided networked markets. We perform a series of laboratory experiments to test the effect of offering a deal in these platforms on consumers’ preconsumption brand evaluations. Our research shows that brand evaluations are contingent on retailer characteristics (price segment and age), customarily reported deal-performance statistics (number of views and purchases of the focal deal), and competitive deal intensity. Furthermore, the paper finds that the effect of daily deals on brand evaluation differs substantially from that associated with regular print coupons, which operate without the benefits of a platform-based model. Finally, local competition from deals in the platform is shown to have a significant negative spillover effect on neighboring retailers who do not offer deals. Our work thus informs retailers considering joining deals platforms about potential costs associated with such a decision, while also providing insights for platform owners on how they may help mitigate some of these losses in brand value for members of their ecosystem. Our research thus provides for a fuller and more nuanced evaluation of daily deals’ effects on brand evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Scarcity-based marketing strategies have been widely embraced to communicate the potential unavailability of an item to increase sales. Recently, a similar practice has been prevalently implemented in reward-based crowdfunding in the form of reward limits, whereby campaign creators restrict the number of backers for each reward tier. Whereas most current research has focused on the design strategies of crowdfunding campaigns, less attention has been paid to how campaign design implicates backer-as-consumer needs in reward-based crowdfunding. Drawing on the marketing literature regarding product scarcity and consumer psychology, the current study strives to fill this void by uncovering the effect of reward limits on eventual and concurrent funding performance. Specifically, we performed campaign-level and campaign day–level analyses on a unique data set from a dominant crowdfunding platform. At the campaign level, we determined that setting reward limits at the beginning of a campaign is beneficial, with the number of limited reward tiers exerting an inverted-U-shaped relationship with campaign performance. Further exploration of different forms of reward limits suggests that the scarcity effects largely originate from limited edition and price discount rewards. At the campaign day level, we determined that incorporating new limited edition rewards is helpful for attracting new contributions, whereas depleted price discount rewards will demotivate subsequent contributions. In addition, the goal-directed mechanism in crowdfunding plays an influential role in shaping scarcity effects. Our findings highlight the importance of considering backer-as-consumer needs in campaign design and the dynamics of campaign attribute changes in the fundraising process. The goal-directed mechanism in crowdfunding allows us to add further insights to the marketing literature on product scarcity by considering a noneconomic component of the scarcity effect. Our findings also provide important practical implications for platform operators, campaign creators, and marketers.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the impact of daily deals on local retailers’ (restaurants’) online ratings. We collected and utilized a comprehensive panel data set that combines information on restaurants’ deal offerings (Groupon or LivingSocial) with their Yelp review details. Although demonstrating a negative main effect of daily deals on a restaurant’s monthly average ratings, we worked to uncover the underlying mechanisms by focusing on the mediating role of consumers’ postconsumption perception. Our mediation analyses show that daily deals are associated with the reduction of both consumers’ perceived food quality and perceived service quality as revealed in review texts, which leads to subsequent declines in a restaurant’s online ratings. We further noted and studied two types of reviews that existed during the deal-redemption period: (1) reviews that mentioned daily deals ( DD Reviews ) and (2) reviews that did not mention daily deals ( NDD Reviews ). NDD Reviews are usually from regular customers, whereas DD Reviews are likely from a different base of customers, deal users. Our separate analyses demonstrate differential mediation processes between DD Reviews and NDD Reviews . For DD Reviews , both perceived food and service quality had mediation roles, suggesting a mismatch effect. That is, daily deals attract discount-focused consumers, including new customers, who are less likely to appreciate the food or service and, therefore, leave a negative review. In contrast, for NDD Reviews , only perceived service quality had a mediation role, suggesting a negative externality effect. That is, the large volume of deal redemptions by deal users may induce a longer waiting time (to be seated and/or served) and, thus, reduced perceived service quality for regular customers. These results deepen our understanding of the impact of daily deals on business online reputation and provide important practical guidance to both local retailers and daily deal platforms.},

While there is evidence that BI&amp;A systems can improve performance through search, our theoretical understanding of how and under what conditions firms leverage BI&amp;A systems to conduct search is rather limited. In particular, while problemistic search theory posits that performance failures motivate search, how firms respond to different types of performance failures remains unclear. We draw on and extend problemistic search theory by theorizing that BI&amp;A-enabled search is influenced by complex interactions between failures in financial and operational performance and performance-related aspirations. We refer to this notion as the Theory of Performance-driven Search (TPS) and test it using longitudinal data gathered for a four-year period from seven U.S. hospitals. We find evidence that firms employ BI&amp;A systems to search in a narrow set of circumstances. We find that performance failures are an important antecedent of BI&amp;A-enabled search. In particular, failures in financial performance, failures in operational performance, and their joint failures are important conditions that trigger BI&amp;A-enabled search. We find that historical and social aspiration levels of financial and operational performance influence BI&amp;A-enabled search during failures in operational performance. We also find that only in organizations experiencing a sustained failure in financial performance do operational performance failures trigger BI&amp;A-enabled search and that the latency of search response is dependent on the speed of failure in financial performance. Through our findings, we make two important contributions: we extend the business value of IT literature by identifying the contextual conditions that trigger BI&amp;A use for search and we extend problemistic search theory by theorizing for the differential effects of operational and financial performance failures.},

  abstract     = {Despite the proliferation of studies on sales distributions in e-commerce, little is known about how such a distribution in online markets is affected by the presence of mobile channels, which have become a significant conduit for e-commerce. Using a large transaction data set from a leading e-marketplace in South Korea, this study empirically investigates (1) how the sales distribution in the mobile commerce channel is different from the sales distribution in the traditional personal computer (PC) channel and (2) how mobile commerce channel adoption (as a search and purchase channel) affects e-market users’ search intensity and their aggregate sales distribution. Our analysis in comparing the sales distributions between the PC and mobile channels shows that transactions in the mobile channel are more concentrated on “head” products compared with PC channel sales. The subsequent user-level analysis, based on a difference-in-differences approach, reveals that mobile channel adopters search more but are less (more) likely to choose “tail” (head) products. This finding is contrary to our previous belief that more search activities lead to more tail product sales. The relationship between search intensity and head (tail) product sales, however, largely depends on the product categories. In the case of preference goods such as books, CDs, toys, and fashion items, adoption increased e-market users’ search activities and resulted in more tail product sales. For quality goods such as PCs, phones, cameras, and digital appliances, however, adoption intensified the search activities but resulted in more head product sales. Finally, for convenience goods such as home supplies and processed foods, adoption discouraged search activities and decreased the choice of tail products. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings.},

  abstract     = {Researchers using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) often subgroup or condition on auxiliary variables that are not the randomized treatment variable. There are many good reasons to condition on auxiliary variables—also referred to as control variables or covariates—in randomized experiments. In particular, designing and conducting RCTs is costly to researchers and subjects, and therefore it is important to derive greater value from RCT data; measuring not just the average treatment effect (ATE), but also finding more nuanced insights about the underlying theoretical mechanisms and generalizing the inferences. Unfortunately, there are many confusing and even contradictory guidelines on the use of subgroups or auxiliary variables in RCTs. We show how researchers can leverage covariates without biasing their causal inferences, by applying a few simple rules based on Judea Pearl’s causal diagramming framework. We demonstrate how to create a causal schema, through careful and deliberate operationalization of auxiliary covariates, in order to analyze the intermediate effects along a causal chain from the treatment to outcome; and we discuss some other ways to leverage covariates for theory development and generalization of findings from RCTs. We present a criterion for distinguishing pretreatment and posttreatment variables that is based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We provide a succinct set of guidelines to help readers begin to employ some essential techniques of DAG-based causal analysis. Finally, we provide a series of short tutorials (with accompanying simulated data and R scripts) to help readers explore the connections between RCT and observational contexts in causal diagramming. This commentary aims to raise awareness of the DAG methodology, explain its usefulness to experimental research, and encourage adoption in the IS community for studies using RCTs as well as observational data.},

Drawing from stakeholder theory and positioning employees and external hackers as key stakeholders of the firm with respect to information security, we propose a set of hypotheses that elaborate relationships between aspects of a firm’s CSP and the likelihood of experiencing a data breach. To test our hypotheses, we compiled a unique data set that consists of publicly available data on firms’ data breach incidents, external assessments of their CSP, and other firm-specific factors. Our contribution is an intriguing and previously unknown account of CSP as it relates to information security. Paradoxically, our results suggest that firms that are noted to have poor CSP records (i.e., CSP concerns) are no more likely to experience a data breach, although a positive CSP record (i.e., CSP strengths) in areas that are peripheral to core firm activities (e.g., philanthropy, recycling programs) results in an elevated likelihood of breach. Delving into this latter finding, our results suggest that firms that simultaneously have peripheral CSP strengths along with high CSP concerns in other areas are at increased risk of breach. The increased likelihood of breach for firms with seemingly disingenuous CSP records suggests that perceived “greenwashing” efforts that attempt to mask poor social performance make firms attractive targets for security exploitation.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear usage-based pricing is applied extensively in software markets. Different from other products, customers of software products usually cannot vary their required usage volume, a property we label local demand inelasticity. For instance, a client firm that needs a sales force automation software either buys one user license for every salesperson in its organization or does not buy at all. It is unlikely to buy licenses for some salespersons but not the others. This demand feature violates a critical assumption of the standard nonlinear pricing literature that consumers are flexible with their usage volume, and their valuation changes smoothly with usage volume. Consequently, standard nonlinear pricing solutions are inapplicable to many software products. This paper studies the optimal nonlinear usage-based pricing of software when customers’ demand is locally inelastic. This unique demand feature necessitates a new approach to solve the nonlinear pricing problem. We provide the solution to a complicated nonlinear pricing problem with discontinuous and inelastic individual demand functions, with virtually no restriction on demand distribution, and no single-crossing restriction on valuation functions. We show that under a weak ordering condition of customer types, this complex pricing problem can be decomposed into a set of much simpler subproblems with known solutions. Our pricing solution is easily implementable and applicable to a broad range of demand systems, including those described by the families of exponential and normal distributions. Moreover, local demand inelasticity has a critical impact on key efficiency results. Although in standard nonlinear pricing models, the optimal pricing schedule typically involves distortion (deviation from the first best) at all but one point, this is no longer the case with local demand inelasticity. We characterize the conditions under which the optimal nonlinear pricing strategy involves quantity discounts and compare nonlinear usage-based pricing with flat-fee (for unlimited usage) pricing strategies.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, we have witnessed substantial increases in the frequency, scope, and cost of data breaches. Accordingly, information security researchers have sought to understand why employees comply with or violate information security policies (ISPs) designed to prevent security incidents. Research suggests that compliance is not uniform but rather depends on contextual and individual factors, such as national culture. Scholars have long recognized that organizational subculture may be equally influential. A key example is professional subcultures, within which members typically share similar education, training, values, and identity. Research shows that behavior can vary widely across professional subcultures, and thus a single approach to promoting ISP compliance may not be equally effective across these subcultures. However, it is presently unclear how subculture influences ISP compliance. To address this need, we adopt a mixed-methods design to examine differences in ISP violation behavior among different professional subcultures in a healthcare organization. We first conducted an exploratory qualitative study to identify different attitudes toward ISP violations among three prominent professional healthcare groups: physicians, nurses, and support staff. Then, using a combination of qualitative interviews, observational fieldwork, and a quantitative survey, we explored how professional group membership moderates (1) the influence of perceptions of sanctions on intentions to violate the ISP and (2) the effect of intentions to violate on actual ISP violation behaviors. Our findings highlight the substantial effect of professional subculture on ISP violations in organizations and provide insights for researchers and managers that may be used to improve overall ISP compliance.},

Drawing on dynamic capabilities theory, we posit that firms that focus on IT–business alignment at the later stages (i.e., the IT delivery stage and IT change stage) of the IT lifecycle are better able to translate their IT investment into revenue than firms that focus on IT–business alignment at the early stage (i.e., IT investment planning stage) of the IT lifecycle. To test our theory, we leverage archival data from more than 120 firms in India that differ in terms of where in the IT lifecycle they focused on IT–business alignment as the key priority. We find that the positive relationship between IT investment and firm revenue is stronger for firms that focus on IT delivery alignment or IT change alignment than for firms that focus on IT investment planning alignment. In addition, we find that at higher levels of IT investment, firms that focus on IT change alignment or IT delivery alignment have higher revenue than firms that focus on IT investment planning alignment, whereas at low levels of IT investment, firms that focus on IT investment planning alignment outperform firms that focus on IT delivery alignment or IT change alignment. Overall, the study contributes by documenting that IT–business alignment at the IT delivery stage and IT change stage of the IT lifecycle are more critical for leveraging IT investment for firm performance than IT–business alignment at the IT investment planning stage.},

  abstract     = {Current trends on patient empowerment indicate that patients who play an active role in managing their health also seek and use information obtained from online reviews of physicians. However, it is far from certain whether patient-generated online reviews accurately reflect the quality of care provided by physicians, especially in the context of chronic disease care. Because chronic diseases require continuous care, monitoring, and multiple treatments over extended time periods, it can be quite hard for patients to assess the effectiveness of a particular physician accurately. Given this credence nature of chronic disease care, the research question is the following: what is the information value associated with online reviews of physicians who treat chronic disease patients? We address this issue by examining the link between online reviews of physicians and their patients’ actual clinical outcomes based on a granular admission–discharge data set. Contrary to popular belief, our study finds that there is no clear relationship between online reviews of physicians and their patients’ clinical outcomes, such as readmission risk or emergency room visits. Our findings have two major implications: (a) online reviews may not be helpful in the context of healthcare services with credence aspects; (b) because treatments of chronic diseases have more credence good characteristics when compared with surgeries or other acute care services, one should not extrapolate research on surgeries and acute care services to chronic disease care. Rather, one should acquire a better understanding of the information conveyed in online reviews regarding a physician’s ability to deliver certain clinical outcomes before drawing inferences. Our findings have important ramifications for all stakeholders including hospitals, physicians, patients, payers, and policymakers.},

  abstract     = {The ubiquitous deployment of mobile and sensor technologies enables observation and recording of human behavior in physical (off-line) settings in a manner similar to what has been possible to date in online settings. This provides researchers with a new lens through which to study and better understand previously unobservable individual decision-making processes. In this study, using a Bayesian learning model with a rich data set consisting of approximately two million fine-grained Global Positioning System (GPS) observations, we analyze the decision-making behavior of 2,467 single-shift taxi drivers in a large Asian city with the objective of understanding key factors that drive the supply side of urban mobility markets. The data set includes detailed taxi GPS trajectories, taxi occupancy data (i.e., whether the taxi is occupied or not), and taxi drivers’ daily incomes. This capacity to use data for which occupancy of the taxi is known is a distinctive feature of our data set and sets our work apart from prior work in the literature. The specific decisions we focus on pertain to actions drivers take to find new passengers after they have dropped off current passengers. In particular, we study the role of information derivable from GPS trace data (e.g., where passengers were dropped off, where they were picked up, longitudinal taxicab travel history with fine-grained time stamps) observable by or made available to drivers in enabling them to learn the distribution of demand for their services over space and time. We find significant differences between new and experienced drivers in both learning behavior and driving decisions. Drivers benefit significantly from their ability to learn from not only information directly observable in the local market but also aggregate information on demand flows across markets. Interestingly, our policy simulations indicate that information that is noisy at the individual level becomes valuable when aggregated across relevant spatial and temporal dimensions. Moreover, we find that the value of information does not increase monotonically with the scale and frequency of information sharing. Our results also provide important evidence that efficient information sharing can lead to a welfare increase among drivers because of potential market expansion. Efficient information sharing can bring, within the taxi market, additional income-generating opportunities that could be unfulfilled. Overall, this study not only explains driver decision-making behavior but also provides taxi companies with an implementable information-sharing strategy to improve overall market efficiency.},

Noting the public-good nature of online reviews, we draw on theories of pure altruism and competitive altruism to understand the effects of friend-contribution cues on review provision. We test our hypotheses using data from Yelp and find positive effects of friend-contribution cues. Users are three times more likely to provide a review after a recent friend review than after a recent stranger review, and this effect cannot be solely explained by homophily. Furthermore, reviews written after a friend’s review tend to be of higher quality, longer, and more novel. In addition, friend reviews tend to have a stronger effect on less-experienced users and less-reviewed products/services, suggesting friend-contribution cues can help mitigate the scarcity of contributions on long-tail products and from infrequent contributors.

In both cases, we find that the households that binge-watch TV shows are less likely to pay for SVoD after these free trials. Our results suggest that binge-watchers deplete the content of interest to them very quickly, which reduces their short-term willingness to pay for SVoD. We also show that recommendation reminders aimed at widening the content preferences of households offset the negative effect of binge-watching and lessen the concerns of binge-watchers with lack of content refresh.

Some platforms attempt to provide financial incentives to encourage users to contribute. Although past studies have demonstrated that monetary rewards can negatively affect individuals’ incentivized contributions, little is known about whether this effect spills over into individuals’ subsequent unincentivized prosocial activities. Our paper aims to bridge this gap by studying the potential spillover effect of financial incentives on subsequent prosocial contributions based on self-determination theory. Specifically, we conduct empirical analyses of a large Amazon review data set and use machine learning methods to identify reviewers who have received financial incentives. The econometric analyses show that the receipt of financial incentives has a significant spillover effect on reviewers’ subsequent unincentivized reviews, which tend to have a more positive sentiment, and the reviewers tend to reduce the review length and exert less linguistic effort in writing them. We conduct a series of robustness checks and find consistent results. We also study how the spillover effects differ based on the product type (i.e., search goods versus experience goods), incentive experience, prosocial experience, and reviewer quality, and we explore the within-product spillover effect. These findings advance the understanding of the interplay between financial incentives and prosocial behaviors and provide important managerial implications for platforms that hope to motivate users’ prosocial contributions.},

  abstract     = {Due to digitization, new mechanisms have emerged for achieving organizational ambidexterity, defined as the ability to pursue both efficiency and flexibility while balancing exploitation and exploration. This study investigates the role of digitization in achieving organizational structural ambidexterity by undertaking both exploitation and exploration simultaneously. Given the complex interdependencies between digitization and multiple intrafirm and interfirm factors in practice, this study adopts a configurational theory perspective. We posit that ambidexterity is better explained as an outcome of aligning digitization with several intrafirm and interfirm factors, rather than of any individual factors in isolation. We empirically derive configurations for achieving ambidexterity by applying fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to 1,325 Canadian firms that invested in new information technology system implementation. The results reveal the mechanisms in which digitization plays a multifaceted role in achieving ambidexterity. Notably, the mechanisms differ among intrafirm-oriented configurations and interfirm strategic alliance configurations, and among large firms and small firms. In the intrafirm solution, digitization and centralization are essential for achieving ambidexterity, with other factors being peripheral; however, in the interfirm solution, digitization plays a peripheral, and even a counterproductive role, in achieving ambidexterity. Particularly, intrafirm collaboration is a necessary condition in both the intrafirm and interfirm solutions for achieving ambidexterity. Interestingly, the results also suggest that small firms seeking ambidexterity require a high level of digitization only while pursuing an intrafirm (but not for an interfirm) solution, whereas large firms require a high level of digitization for both intrafirm and interfirm solutions. New insights and implications for theory and practice for achieving organizational ambidexterity with digitization are discussed.},

We posit that the relationship between virtual crowdedness and user contribution is driven by the tension between audience effects and bystander/content saturation effects. We analyze a panel data set of user contributions on Waze from New York City to test our hypotheses. First, our findings indicate that although virtual crowdedness has a positive influence on total number of contributions, the magnitude of the influence decreases as virtual crowdedness increases. Second, the concave-down increasing relationship is more pronounced for rush hours with high physical crowdedness than for non-rush hours with low physical crowdedness. A variety of robustness checks and alternative analyses based on matching estimators and spatial econometric models further support the main conclusions while mitigating concerns about endogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. Our findings provide several key practical implications for platform designers in that they should allow for users to visualize density of usage as well as improve the design of social features for encouraging user contribution to the mobile virtual community.},

Drawing on the notion of the purchase funnel, we develop a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian model to examine consumer click and conversion choices. A unique data set of geofencing ad impressions is collected from one of the largest location-based marketing agencies in the United States. The results suggest that local competition matters in the click stage, whereas distance influences the propensity of conversion. Quantitatively, one additional competitor in the consumer vicinity zone lowers the click-through rate by 1.03\%, whereas a 1-mile increase in distance results in a 17.64\% decrease in the conversion rate. We also find a significant interactive effect, whereby a higher degree of local competition amplifies the negative impact of distance on the likelihood of conversions. Additionally, product differentiation ameliorates the effects of distance and local competition, whereas these effects are found to be more prominent during office working hours. This study discovers the stage-varying roles of distance and local competition along the customer journey and offers new directions for more effective location-based targeting.},

We leverage this network to extract global cues about interfirm human capital overlap through structural equivalence and community classification. The online employee profiles also provide rich data on the explicit knowledge base of firms. In particular, they allow us to represent firms in the space of the skills possessed by their employees and measure the interfirm human capital overlap in terms of similarity in their employees’ skills. We validate our proposed human capital overlap metrics in a predictive analytics framework using future employee migrations as an indicator of labor market competition. The results show that our proposed metrics have superior predictive power over conventional firm-level economic and human resource measures.

  abstract     = {Online marketplaces thrive by offering products from a wide array of third-party stores. One major decision faced by the owners of online marketplaces is whether they should enter into the market and sell products directly to customers. Although a few game-theoretical models have addressed this issue, there is still no empirical research to guide the decisions of managers. To fill this gap, this paper empirically investigates the impact of a platform owner’s entry on the demand of third-party stores, as well as their potential reactions, using data from a Chinese e-commerce platform that supports both online and offline transactions. We establish several important findings. First, we find that the offline demand of competing third-party stores decreases with the entry of the platform, whereas their online demand does not change significantly. Second, we systematically investigate three potential mechanisms underlying the effects of platform entry in the online and offline channels: the competition effect, the spillover effect, and the disintermediation effect. We show that the decreased offline demand results from third-party stores’ defensive strategy to divert their offline customers away from the platform (i.e., disintermediation) rather than from the defection of customers under competition. Third, in contrast to the prior finding from mobile app platforms, we find that the demand of larger third-party stores decreases more with the entry of the platform, suggesting that the effect of platform entry is context dependent. Our study suggests that, while making entry decisions, platform owners should consider the nature of their marketplaces (i.e., whether the competition among sellers is exclusive) and the potential reactions from third-party sellers.},

  abstract     = {Despite massive investments in transportation infrastructure, traffic congestion remains a major societal and public policy problem. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have been proposed as a potential solution to this challenge, but their effectiveness has remained unclear in both research and practice. To understand whether and how ITS affect traffic congestion, we consolidate a unique longitudinal data set on road traffic and the deployment of a large federally supported ITS program in the United States—511 systems—in 99 urban areas between 1994 and 2014. The difference-in-differences estimates show that the adoption of 511 systems is associated with a significant decrease in traffic congestion, saving over $4.7 billion dollars and 175 million hours in travel time annually in U.S. cities. 511 systems also reduce about 53 million gallons of fossil fuel consumption and over 10 billion pounds of CO 2 emissions. We offer two theoretical explanations for this effect: (i) ITS help individual commuters to make better travel decisions, and (ii) ITS help local governments to develop an urban traffic management capability. Empirical evidence supports the underlying theoretical mechanisms and shows that ITS help commuters to schedule travel more efficiently, choose better navigation routes, and optimize their work-trip transportation mode. Second, the effect of ITS is contingent on road supply and public transit services. We also find that the traffic-reducing effect of ITS is larger when commuters use more online services for traffic information and when state governments incorporate more functionalities into their 511 systems. This study contributes to the literature on IT capabilities, public-sector IT value, and the societal impact of IT, while also extending the transportation economics to IT-enabled traffic interventions. Finally, we inform policymakers of ITS as a cost-effective means to mitigating traffic congestion.},

  abstract     = {Classifying information search behavior helps tailor recommender systems to individual customers’ shopping motives. But how can we identify these motives without requiring users to exert too much effort? Our research goal is to demonstrate that eye tracking can be used at the point of sale to do so. We focus on two frequently investigated shopping motives: goal-directed and exploratory search. To train and test a prediction model, we conducted two eye-tracking experiments in front of supermarket shelves. The first experiment was carried out in immersive virtual reality; the second, in physical reality—in other words, as a field study in a real supermarket. We conducted a virtual reality study, because recently launched virtual shopping environments suggest that there is great interest in using this technology as a retail channel. Our empirical results show that support vector machines allow the correct classification of search motives with 80\% accuracy in virtual reality and 85\% accuracy in physical reality. Our findings also imply that eye movements allow shopping motives to be identified relatively early in the search process: our models achieve 70\% prediction accuracy after only 15 seconds in virtual reality and 75\% in physical reality. Applying an ensemble method increases the prediction accuracy substantially, to about 90\%. Consequently, the approach that we propose could be used for the satisfiable classification of consumers in practice. Furthermore, both environments’ best predictor variables overlap substantially. This finding provides evidence that in virtual reality, information search behavior might be similar to the one used in physical reality. Finally, we also discuss managerial implications for retailers and companies that are planning to use our technology to personalize a consumer assistance system.},

We investigate the economic value of this app and how drivers build an initial preference for passenger matching, the cancellation feature, and online pay as well as how a two-sided sales promotion affects drivers’ willingness to use the TNC app. We estimate a structural model of drivers’ decisions to accept orders and to cancel generated orders and their perception of passengers’ willingness to utilize a sales promotion. Bayesian learning processes are introduced to account for drivers’ learning new features. We find evidence of the economic value of new features on a TNC app and drivers’ learning about the value of those features. Our results show that a platform subsidy and bids from passengers might signal low quality of service, and that platform cashback to passengers has a positive effect on drivers by increasing drivers’ chances of being rewarded. Our results further indicate that the substantial value of early promotion not only encourages current usage but also fosters learning that sustains drivers’ continued use of the app, and show how cashback for passengers affects the decisions of drivers. Finally, our policy simulations show improved performance with regard to drivers’ willingness to use the app as well as its cost effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In lending-based real estate crowdfunding, borrowers are required to pledge their housing properties as collateral to secure the loans. This nascent practice differs from ordinary peer-to-peer lending in that lenders, to make sound investment decisions, need to process additional information other than basic loan attributes. We examine how lender behavior of investing in real-estate-secured loans is shaped by information that is particularly relevant in such an emerging market. We collect and analyze the data from a large lending-based real estate crowdfunding platform, where each loan is secured by either a mortgage (a mortgage-secured or MS loan) or a borrower’s own house (a house-secured or HS loan). Our analysis reveals that lender decisions of how fast to invest and how much to invest are influenced by both on-platform and off-platform information. For on-platform information, we find that lenders as a whole prefer HS loans to MS loans, as reflected in quicker and larger lending transactions. Experienced lenders tend to invest more aggressively, in both time and amount, but exhibit a weaker preference for HS loans as compared with their inexperienced counterparts. As to off-platform information, our results show that a rise in housing prices is associated with quicker investment decisions, and this association is found to be even stronger on HS loans. Further, when stock market volatility is large, lenders tend to slow down their investment behavior; however, we find such a tendency weaker on MS loans. This research contributes to the literature by establishing relationships between crowdfunding activities, housing prices and stock market performance. Our findings also provide implications for managers and platform designers who desire to stimulate and leverage the fundraising momentum.},

In these communities, users often engage in informal conversations responding to questions and answers, and over time, they produce a huge amount of highly unstructured and implicit knowledge. How to effectively manage the knowledge repository and identify useful solutions thus becomes a major challenge. In this study, we propose a novel text analytic framework to extract important features from online forums and apply them to classify the usefulness of a solution. Guided by the design science research paradigm, we utilize a kernel theory of the knowledge adoption model, which captures a rich set of argument quality and source credibility features as the predictors of information usefulness. We test our framework on two large-scale knowledge communities: the Apple Support Community and Oracle Community. Our extensive analysis and performance evaluation illustrate that the proposed framework is both effective and efficient in predicting the usefulness of solutions embedded in the knowledge repository. We highlight the theoretical implications of the study as well as the practical applications of the framework to other domains.},

  abstract     = {The goal to continually reduce operating costs while meeting computational needs is common to all modern organizations that use cloud computing. We study the problem of selecting computing resources with the goal of minimizing the total rental cost of completing a computing task in the presence of a time constraint. The problem is formulated as a scheduling problem that assigns computing resources to time periods of the planning horizon (time available to complete a single computing task). This (NP-hard) preemptive-resume type scheduling problem—new to the scheduling literature—has not been carefully addressed in practice to provide an implementable solution. Typically, the approach taken in practice is to use a single resource (a single virtual machine instance, or a cluster of identical virtual machine instances) to complete a computing task. The main insight of this study is that rather than completing a computing task using a single computing resource, rental costs can be significantly lowered by using a few resources (sometimes even just two) to complete the task. Thus, the computing task is switched from one resource to another to exploit the cloud provider’s price-performance schedule. Cloud computing has been recognized as an economically attractive computing environment whose adoption has been growing over time. However, providers (such as Amazon Web Services) offer a confusing and diverse set of computing resources with different configurations and unit rental costs. Our near-optimal solution is based on switching the computing task from one resource to another in way that leverages the relationship between the price and performance of the available computing resources. The performance of a given resource can vary randomly as well as be correlated with the performance of another (stronger or weaker) resource. We present a worst-case performance guarantee of the proposed solution. In addition, we study the performance using a detailed computational study and a real-world example of an actual company that can benefit from our proposed solution. In the computational study as well as the real-world example, the cost of our solution is usually about 15\%–25\% lower than the benchmark solution of using the best single computing resource to process the computing task. Practicing information technology managers can use our approach to migrate in-house solutions to the cloud in a cost-effective manner.},

Specifically we document increased online content generation at Wikipedia, the world’s largest user generated knowledge repository. Leveraging German district-level and European country-level unemployment data we analyze the relationship between the economic crisis in 2008–2010 and contributions to Wikipedia. For both data sets we find increased socially valuable activity in the form of knowledge acquisition and contributions to Wikipedia. For German districts, we observe an increased rate of content generation on Wikipedia in districts that faced greater increases in unemployment. The effect of unemployment on content generation is even stronger at the European country level.

Our analysis indicates that, on average, ride-hailing services have led to significant reductions in the utilization of city bus services while increasing utilization of commuter rail services. These average effects are also subject to a great deal of contextual heterogeneity, depending on the size of the local population, rates of violent crime, weather, gas prices, transit riders’ average trip distance, and the overall quality of public transit options. We demonstrate the robustness of our findings to alternative model specifications.

  abstract     = {Avenues for the delivery of loyalty programs have rapidly shifted from plastic card schemes to mobile app–based initiatives, yet our understanding of the economic value presented by the latter (i.e., loyalty apps) has not kept pace with this development. We examine the effects of loyalty app adoption on customers’ offline purchase patterns, reward redemption, and deal-prone behaviors as well as store-level competition in a multivendor loyalty program (MVLP) context, where multiple offline brands collaborate in the operation of point-sharing initiatives. Mobile-driven loyalty apps substantially lower consumer search costs, thereby enhancing on-demand information accessibility and facilitating the monitoring of reward points. Based on a unique data set that comprises information on customers’ loyalty app adoption status, loyalty point redemption patterns, and purchase behaviors in MVLP environments, we investigate how the transition from plastic-based programs to loyalty apps influences the out-of-pocket spending and point redemption patterns of consumers. Our findings reveal that the adoption of loyalty apps is associated with an increase in purchases and the predilection for point redemption. Despite these positive outcomes, however, potential adverse consequences may arise in the form of deal-susceptible behaviors and reduced store-specific loyalty. Loyalty app adopters tend to be more vulnerable to deals, with these customers selectively buying highly discounted products of low margin. Additionally, loyalty app consumers visit more stores but spend less in a focal store, thereby diminishing loyalty to this specific store. These results have managerial implications on optimal mobile-based loyalty program designs and implementation, reward-driven platform strategies, and risk management initiatives in an MVLP setting.},

The associated security risk and low customization capability, however, create challenges for the adoption of cloud services. In this paper, we construct a game-theoretical model that involves two vendors—one that provides cloud service on a pay-per-use basis and the other that sells on-premises software at a one-time licensing fee—and consumers who are heterogeneous in their usage frequencies in an environment in which negative security externalities are present. We study the competitive implications of security risk and product customization capability on consumer purchase choice and vendors’ pricing and investment strategies. Although it is generally believed that cloud services are more vulnerable to security breaches, our results demonstrate that in high-security-loss environments in which consumers incur a large loss per use if struck by attacks, using cloud service yields a lower average expected loss for consumers compared with on-premises software. By endogenizing vendors’ investment decisions on security and customization, our investigation highlights that in low-security-loss environments, the cloud vendor has no incentive to invest effort in reducing security risk, but the on-premises vendor will increase security investment when the probability of attacks on its product becomes higher. We also find that the on-premises vendor’s security and customization investments act as strategic substitutes in low-security-loss environments and, under certain conditions, complements in high-security-loss environments. We further examine welfare-maximizing security investments and find that the socially optimal investment requires greater effort to improve cloud security in low-security-loss environments and to improve on-premises software security in high-security-loss environments.},

As the platform grows rapidly, with millions of apps and billions of users, search costs are increasing tremendously. The challenge is how app developers can target the right users with their apps and how consumers can find the apps that fit their needs. Cross-promotion, advertising a mobile app (target app) in another app (source app), is introduced as a new app-promotion framework to alleviate the issue of search costs. In this paper, we model source app user behaviors (downloads and postdownload usages) with respect to different target apps in cross-promotion campaigns. We construct a novel app similarity measure using latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling on apps’ production descriptions and then analyze how the similarity between the source and target apps influences users’ app download and usage decisions. To estimate the model, we use a unique data set from a large-scale random matching experiment conducted by a major mobile advertising company in Korea. The empirical results show that consumers prefer more diversified apps when they are making download decisions compared with their usage decisions, which is supported by the psychology literature on people’s variety-seeking behavior. Lastly, we propose an app-matching system based on machine-learning models (on app download and usage prediction) and generalized deferred acceptance algorithms. The simulation results show that app analytics capability is essential in building accurate prediction models and in increasing ad effectiveness of cross-promotion campaigns and that, at the expense of privacy, individual user data can further improve the matching performance. This paper has implications on the trade-off between utility and privacy in the growing mobile economy.},

Much of this work has been conducted in personal computer (PC)–based settings, although mobile devices are becoming increasingly central to the online shopping experience. It remains to be examined if the effects of recommendation systems in retail differ across these two channels, in terms of customer-level decision outcomes. In this paper, we examine these differences in some detail, studying how product views and sales attributed to a recommendation system are different across mobile and PC-based channels. Further, we examine how the effect of a recommendation system across channels influences sales diversity, an important outcome in the retail industry. We conduct our analysis using a randomized field experiment, conducted in partnership with an online retailing firm in South Korea, where the experimental treatment is access to a recommendation system. Our results show that the use of recommendation systems enhances customer-level outcomes, such as views and sales of recommended products, clickthrough rate, and conversion. More importantly, the marginal impacts of the recommendation system are significantly higher for mobile users, indicating that the higher search costs imposed through mobile devices are more effectively reduced through recommendation systems. With respect to sales diversity, we observe that although the mobile channel leads to more diverse sales, we see no interaction effects of the recommendation system and mobile use on sales diversity. These results provide boundary conditions for the efficacy of recommendation systems in retail contexts where online sales occur across both PC-based and mobile channels. We discuss the managerial implications of these results for online retailers and conclude with opportunities for further research.},

  abstract     = {Given the popularity and prevalence of medical question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) services, it is increasingly important to understand what constitutes a helpful answer in the medical domain. Prior studies on user-generated content have examined the independent impacts of content and source characteristics on reader perception of the content&#39;s value. In the setting of medical Q&amp;A sites, we propose a novel content-context congruence perspective with a focus on the role of congruence between an answer’s content and the answer’s contextual cues. Specifically, we identify two types of contextual cues critical in this unique setting—the language attributes (i.e., concreteness and emotional intensity) of the question’s content, and the acuteness of the disease to which the question is related. Building on the priming literature and construal-level theory, we hypothesize that an answer will be perceived as more helpful if the language attributes of the answer’s content are congruent with those of the preceding question, and if they are congruent with the disease’s acuteness. Analyses of a unique data set from WebMD Answers provide empirical evidence for our theoretical model.

  abstract     = {Impressions at first glance matter in the digital world in that they could lead to lasting impact on credibility perceptions, usage intention, and user satisfaction. Past studies have found that much of impression formation is affected by visual design-related features. Despite its importance, little is known of how different forms of visual aesthetics (i.e., classical vs. expressive aesthetics) influence web page impression formation. Drawing on impression formation literature and cue utilization theory, we formulate a theoretical model of web page impression formation with a temporal sequence of processing stages: automatic processing, initial perception confirmation, and impression formation, which in turn affects approach-avoidance tendency. We conduct two within-subject studies to collect both self-reported and eye movement data to test our predictions. Using real-world web pages as stimuli, the first study reveals that people engage in both automatic processing and attentive processing to form web page impressions, and arousal (measured by pupil size) shapes how people allocate attention (measured by peak duration and fixation count) to visual aesthetics. Using web pages with manipulated aesthetics in the second study, we illuminate the theoretical logic of web page impression formation by showing that people first engage in automatic processing and then engage in attentive processing. Both studies provide strong empirical support for the mediating role of arousal on the effects of visual aesthetics on attention allocation. These findings contribute to an initial theoretical understanding of visual aesthetics effects on impression formation in the digital world and provide important implications for website designers.},

  abstract     = {The growing interest in online product reviews for legitimate promotion has been accompanied by an increase in fraudulent reviews. However, beyond algorithms for initial fraud detection, little is known about what review portals should do with fraudulent reviews after detecting them. In this paper, we address this question by studying how consumers respond to potentially fraudulent reviews and how review portals can leverage this knowledge to design better fraud management policies. To do this, we combine theoretical development from the trust literature with randomized experiments and statistical analysis using large-scale data from Yelp. We find that consumers tend to increase their trust in the information provided by review portals when the portal displays fraudulent reviews along with non-fraudulent reviews, as opposed to the common practice of censoring suspected fraudulent reviews. The impact of fraudulent reviews on consumers’ decision-making process increases with the uncertainty in the initial evaluation of product quality. We also find that consumers do not effectively process the content of fraudulent reviews (negative or positive). This result furthers the case for a decision heuristic that will incorporate the motivational differences between positive fraudulent reviews and negative fraudulent reviews to effectively aid consumers’ decision making.},

  abstract     = {Overcrowding in emergency rooms (ERs) is a common yet nagging problem. It not only is costly for hospitals but also compromises care quality and patient experience. Hence, finding effective ways to improve ER care delivery is of great importance. Using a large data set covering all emergency visits in New York State from 2010 to 2014, we investigate whether telemedicine enhances ER care delivery. We show that, on average, telemedicine availability in the ER significantly reduces average patients’ length of stay (LOS), which is partially driven by the flexible resource allocation. Specifically, the adoption of telemedicine leads to a larger reduction in ER LOS when there is a demand surge or supply shortage. Furthermore, such improvement is not a by-product of other widely adopted health IT applications and does not come at the expense of care quality or patient cost. We also replicate the analysis using annual U.S. hospital data and find that ER telemedicine adoption significantly reduces average patients’ waiting time, which suggests that the LOS reduction partially comes from the reduction of waiting time.},

  abstract     = {Disinformation on social media—commonly called “fake news”—has become a major concern around the world, and many fact-checking initiatives have been launched to mitigate the problem. The way fact-checking results are presented to social media users is important because if the presentation format is not persuasive, then fact-checking may not be effective. For instance, Facebook tested the idea of flagging dubious articles in 2017 but concluded that it was ineffective and subsequently removed the feature. We conducted three experiments with social media users to investigate two different approaches to implementing a fake news flag—one designed to have its primary effect when processed by automatic cognition (System 1) and the other designed to have its primary effect when processed by deliberate cognition (System 2). We found that both interventions were effective, and an intervention that combined both approaches was about twice as effective. We also found that awareness training on the meaning of the flags increased the effectiveness of the System 2 intervention but not the System 1 intervention, exactly as theory predicts. Believability, in turn, influenced the extent to which users would engage with the article (e.g., read, like, comment, and share). Our results suggest that both theoretical routes can be used—separately or together—in the presentation of fact-checking results in order to reduce the influence of fake news on the users.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a two-step data analytic approach to the promotion planning for paid mobile applications (apps). In the first step, we use historical sales data to empirically estimate the app demand model and quantify the effect of price promotions on download volume. The estimation results reveal two interesting characteristics of the relationship between price promotion and download volume of mobile apps: (1) the magnitude of the direct immediate promotion effect is changing within a multiday promotion; and (2) due to the visibility effect (i.e., apps ranked high on the download chart are more visible to consumers), a price promotion also has an indirect effect on download volume by affecting app rank, and this effect can persist after the promotion ends. Based on the empirically estimated demand model, we formulate the app promotion optimization problem into a longest path problem, which takes into account the direct and indirect effects of promotions. To deal with the tractability of the longest path problem, we propose a moving planning window heuristic, which sequentially solves a series of subproblems with a shorter time horizon, to construct a promotion policy. Our heuristic promotion policy consists of shorter and more frequent promotions. We show that the proposed policy can increase the app lifetime revenue by around 10\%.},

  abstract     = {Many user-generated content websites are experimenting with disclosing users’ identities to increase accountability for the generated content. However, the effects of identity disclosure on users’ content-generation behaviors are not well examined. In this study, we address this critical issue by using a natural experiment—a large corporate online community chose to disclose users’ identities in one section (the focal section) but not the other (the neighbor section). Our results show that in the focal section, disclosing identity increases social presence and inhibits users’ willingness to generate content, resulting in greater effort spent per content but smaller content volume. Surprisingly, we find that users significantly change their content-generation behaviors in the neighbor section, where users remain anonymous. Specifically, identity disclosure has a strong displacement effect: the low-effort content, which is deterred by identity disclosure in the focal section, will be reallocated to the anonymous neighbor section. Furthermore, taking both sections together, we find that the content volume increases and content effort exerted on each content decreases overall. These findings demonstrate that identity disclosure is a double-edged sword with regard to user content generation. On the one hand, disclosure motivates users’ effort on each content in the focal section. On the other hand, the displacement effect meant that this benefit comes at the cost of reducing users’ effort per content in the neighbor section.},

  abstract     = {We use a differential games framework to study two modes of dynamic advertising competition, namely flexible (or closed loop) and committed (or open loop), between two e-retailers that compete for traffic. In closed-loop competition, the advertising contract allows firms to adjust their advertising levels during the advertising campaign. However, in open-loop competition, the contract requires the firms to commit upfront to an advertising plan (however, not necessarily one that advertises at a fixed rate). We ask the following question: Which contract (flexible or committed) is better for the firms (advertising agent)? We find that the firms advertise less and earn more under flexible contracts. As a result, the advertising agent earns less from the two firms under flexible contracts. Flexible and committed contracts become more interesting to study if operational considerations are included. These considerations arise from information technology (IT) costs incurred to process the traffic that arrives at the e-retailers’ websites. Operational considerations reduce the difference in advertising spending between the two contracts. Interestingly, to increase the revenue earned under flexible contracts, the advertising agent should offer such contracts at a price that is discounted relative to committed contracts. The discount exploits the force of competition and induces the firms to spend more on advertising. The optimal discount offered under a flexible contract decreases as the IT cost increases.},

Therefore, we strive to determine an optimal strategy to manage customer sentiment on social media sites such as Twitter.

To understand the antecedents of digital customer care, we model a diffusion process of customer sentiment over time. This diffusion process is influenced (or controlled) by the firm through the strategy employed to respond to customer tweets. We then use real data consisting of sentiments expressed by customers directed at Twitter’s service accounts of four major U.S. telecommunication-service providers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile) to estimate the parameters in our analytical model and shed several insights into digital customer care in this industry. First, we find a clear separation among the firms in terms of digital customer care effectiveness. Second, we find that good customer care is not merely a matter of responding to customer tweets. Third, the quality of digital customer care that customers expect varies across firms: Customers of higher priced firms (e.g., Verizon and AT&amp;T) expect better customer care. Fourth, seemingly unrelated events (such as signing an exclusive contract with a celebrity) can impact digital customer care. Our study has important implications for managers as it can help firms determine the optimal strategy to influence customer sentiment.},

We argue that information technologies that promote social integration facilitate more novel knowledge recombinations that help to overcome the difficulties arising from global operations. We draw on the knowledge-based view of the firm and hypothesize that IT-enabled social integration capacity influences exploratory innovation by enabling firms to leverage global cultural diversity and global geographical dispersion. Our empirical analyses using archival panel data from 120 public U.S. manufacturing firms from 2003 to 2014 support these hypotheses.

In this study, we examine the effect of gender on the likelihood of employee promotions. We further examine whether women get an equal lift in promotion likelihood from performance improvements, work experience, and training as men. We analyze archival promotion data, as well as demographic, human capital, and administrative data for 7,004 employees at a leading IT services firm located in India for the years 2002–2007 and for multiple levels of promotion. We develop robust econometric models that consider employee heterogeneity to identify the differential effect of gender and performance on promotions. We find that, contrary to expectations, women are more likely to be promoted, on average. However, looking deeper into the heterogeneous main effects using hierarchical Bayesian modeling reveals more nuanced insights. We find that, ceteris paribus, women realize less benefit from performance gains than men, less benefit from tenure within the focal firm, but more benefit from training than men. These results suggest that despite the disparity in returns to performance and experience improvements, women can rely on signaling mechanisms such as training to restore parity in promotions. We find that the effects of gender and performance vary with the level of employee promotion; although not as much as men, women benefit more from performance gains at higher organizational levels. Our findings suggest several actionable managerial insights that can potentially make IT firms more inclusive and attractive to women.},

Specifically, we analyze a platform-based market where consumers search and purchase products that potentially differ in quality. In addition, consumers have idiosyncratic tastes for a product, and the extent of this heterogeneity may vary from one product to another. In other words, there may be products with low taste dispersion (products for which there is less heterogeneity among consumers), as well as products with high taste dispersion. Our modeling framework elucidates how platform recommendation influences the market-level equilibrium outcomes, thereby informing the optimal recommendation strategy. We find that the quality and taste-dispersion dimensions can interact to affect the overall effectiveness of product-recommendation strategies. Conditioning on taste dispersion, recommending high-quality products increases both producer profits and consumer surplus. Conditioning on quality, recommending high-taste-dispersion products may, however, increase or decrease producer profits, depending on the joint effect of profit margin and purchase probability. The direction of change in consumer surplus is also uncertain—recommending a high-taste-dispersion product is more likely to increase (decrease) consumer surplus if the quality is low (high). Importantly, we show that when the platform cannot discern product types, recommendation strategies based on observed price or sales signals cannot guarantee the optimal outcome in the general case.},

  abstract     = {We study a new source of bias in online review platforms that originates from the popularity difference between the traveling reviewer’s hometown and destination (popularity-difference bias). In particular, we model popularity-difference bias as a function of two opposing forces: (1) the travelers’ evaluation of performance and (2) the travelers’ expectations. The net result of these two forces leads to two competing views regarding the nature of popularity-difference bias: the first view is performance-dominant, whereas the second one is expectation-dominant. Through analyzing a large set of restaurant reviews from a major online reputation platform, we find empirical evidence in support of the performance-dominant view. Specifically, we find that popularity-difference bias affects both the assigned rating and the text-encoded sentiment of a review. When reviewers travel to a less popular location than their hometown, popularity-difference bias is negative. To the contrary, when reviewers travel to a more popular location than their hometown, popularity-difference bias is positive. Popularity-difference bias affects the average rating of restaurants up to 11\%. As a result, a restaurant’s ratings skew lower if the restaurant tends to attract guests from more popular locations, whereas they skew higher if the restaurant tends to attract guests from less popular locations. This effect on ratings alters the probability that an average customer will consider a restaurant by up to 16\%. Finally, awareness of popularity-difference bias allows managers to improve the design of their ranking systems: we show that such improvements can lead to up to 12\% higher reviewer satisfaction, and up to 24\% more diversified top-restaurant recommendations.},

  abstract     = {The gig economy has low barriers to entry, enabling flexible work arrangements and allowing workers to engage in contingent employment, whenever , and in some cases, such as online labor markets, wherever , workers desire. The growth of the gig economy has been partly attributed to technological advancements that enable flexible work environments. In this study, we consider the role of an alternative driver, economic downturns, and associated financial stressors in the offline economy, for example, unemployment. As the exact nature of the relationship between online labor supply and offline unemployment is not immediately clear, in this work, we seek to quantify the relationship, exploring heterogeneity across a variety of county-specific characteristics. We study these relationships in the context of a leading online labor market, combining data on the participation of workers residing in counties across the United States with county-level data on unemployment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our results demonstrate a positive and significant association between local (county) unemployment in the traditional offline labor market and the supply of online workers residing in the same county, as well as significantly larger volumes of online project bidding activity from workers in the same county. Specifically, we estimate that a 1\% increase in county unemployment is associated with a 21.8\% increase in the volume of county residents actively working online at the platform. Furthermore, our results suggest significant heterogeneity in the relationship, such that a significantly larger supply of online labor manifests when unemployment occurs in counties characterized by better internet access, younger and more educated populations, and populations whose social ties are dispersed over a wider geographic area. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications for workers, online labor markets, and policy makers.},

  abstract     = {To inform product release and distribution strategies, research has analyzed cross-market spillovers in new product adoption. However, models that examine these effects for digital and viral media are still evolving. Given resistance to advertising, firms often seek to promote their own viral content to boost brand awareness. However, a key shortcoming of virality is its ephemeral nature. To gain insight into sustaining virality, we develop a quasi-experimental approach that estimates the backward spillover onto a focal platform by introducing a piece of content onto a new platform. We posit that introducing content to the audience of a new platform can generate word of mouth, which may affect its consumption within an earlier platform. We estimate these spillovers using data on 381 viral videos on 26 platforms (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo) and observe how consumption of videos on an initial “lead” platform is affected by their subsequent introduction onto “lag” platforms. This spillover is estimated as follows: for each multiplatform video, we compare its view growth after being introduced onto a new platform to that of a synthetic control based on similar single-platform videos. Analysis of 275 such spillover scenarios reveals that introducing a video onto a lag platform roughly doubles its subsequent view growth in the lead platform. This positive cross-platform spillover is persistent, bursty, and strongest in the first 42 days. We find that spillover is boosted when the video is consumed more in the lag platform, when the consumption rate peaks earlier in the lag platform, and when the lag platform targets a foreign market. Delaying a video’s introduction onto a lag platform affects spillover concavely, whereas its introduction onto additional platforms shows diminishing returns. We find further support for positive spillover through a small-scale randomized field experiment. Implications are discussed for platforms, content creators, and policy makers.},

  abstract     = {Retailers have been sharing transactional data with supply chain partners for a long time to the benefit of all involved. However, many are still reluctant to share, and there is evidence that the extent of sharing would be greater if information sensitive to retailers is concealed before data are shared. Although there has been considerable research into methods to hide sensitive information from transactional data, extant research has focused only on sensitive information at the organizational level. This is rarely the case in reality; the retail industry has recognized and adapted their offerings to region-wide differences in customer tastes for decades, and when stores offer a mix of standardized and customized products, the differences in customer characteristics across regions lead to sensitive information that is region-specific in addition to sensitive information at the organizational level. To date, this version of the problem has been overlooked, and no effective methods exist to solve it; this paper fills that gap. Although some existing approaches can be adapted to this more realistic context, the existence of region-level requirements substantially increases the size of an already difficult (NP-hard) problem to be solved, making such adaptations impractical. Traditional decomposition-based approaches, such as Lagrangian relaxation, are not viable either as they require the repeated solution of NP-hard problems involving millions of variables multiple times. In this paper, we present an ensemble approach that draws intuition from Lagrangian relaxation to maximize the accuracy of a shared transactional dataset. Extensive computational experiments show that this approach not only identifies near-optimal solutions, it can do so even when other approaches fail. We also show that the precision of recommendations made using datasets that have been modified using the ensemble approach is not statistically different from that of recommendations made using the original datasets; this demonstrates that using the ensemble approach to hide sensitive information before sharing transactional data has negligible negative impact.},

  abstract     = {Open collaboration platforms have fundamentally changed the way that knowledge is produced, disseminated, and consumed. In these systems, contributions arise organically with little to no central governance. Although such decentralization provides many benefits, a lack of broad oversight and coordination can leave questions of information poverty and skewness to the mercy of the system’s natural dynamics. Unfortunately, we still lack a basic understanding of the dynamics at play in these systems and specifically, how contribution and attention interact and propagate through information networks. We leverage a large-scale natural experiment to study how exogenous content contributions to Wikipedia articles affect the attention that they attract and how that attention spills over to other articles in the network. Results reveal that exogenously added content leads to significant, substantial, and long-term increases in both content consumption and subsequent contributions. Furthermore, we find significant attention spillover to downstream hyperlinked articles. Through both analytical estimation and empirically informed simulation, we evaluate policies to harness this attention contagion to address the problem of information poverty and skewness. We find that harnessing attention contagion can lead to as much as a twofold increase in the total attention flow to clusters of disadvantaged articles. Our findings have important policy implications for open collaboration platforms and information networks.},

  abstract     = {In the digital era, it is increasingly important to understand how privacy decisions are made because information is frequently perceived as a commodity that is mismanaged. The preponderance of privacy literature focuses on individual-level information privacy concern and personal self-disclosure decisions. We propose that a more versatile multilevel description is required to enable exploration of complex privacy decisions that involve co-owned (i.e., group) information in increasingly sophisticated digital environments. We define the concepts of group and individual information privacy, “we-privacy” and “I-privacy” respectively, as the ability of an individual or group to construct, regulate, and apply the rules for managing their information and interaction with others. We develop the theory of multilevel information privacy (TMIP), which uses the theory of communication privacy management and the developmental theory of privacy as foundations for a social rule-based (i.e., normative) process of making privacy decisions that evolve over time with experience. The TMIP contributes to the privacy literature by drawing from prominent social psychology theories of group behavior (i.e., social identity and self-categorization theories) to explain how privacy decisions can be made by individuals or groups (i.e., social units) or social units acting as members of a particular group. We contend that technology complicates the privacy decision-making process by adding unique environmental characteristics that can influence the social identity assumed for a particular privacy decision, the estimation of the cost-benefit components of the privacy calculus, and the application and evolution of the norms that define the rules for information and interaction management. We discuss the implications of the TMIP for information systems research and provide a research agenda.},

  abstract     = {Physicians’ participation in online healthcare platforms serves to integrate online healthcare resources with the offline medical system. This integration brings opportunities for reshaping healthcare delivery systems. In the field of telemedicine, there has been an extensive discussion about physician participation, but little is known about how physicians actually participate in online healthcare platforms and offline medical systems. Understanding physicians’ participation dynamics between online and offline channels is of great importance to academic researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. Such an understanding can reveal insights into how healthcare is actually delivered to patients through both channels, how to contribute to quantifying the social impacts of online healthcare services (Health 2.0), and how to improve healthcare delivery systems. Thus, in this study, we investigate physicians’ online-offline behavior dynamics using data from both online and offline channels to conduct our analysis. As physicians’ online and offline activities are highly endogenous, we deploy a time-series technique and develop a structural vector autoregression model to examine the behavior dynamics. We find that physicians’ online activities can lead to a higher service quantity in offline channels, whereas offline activities may reduce physicians’ online services because of resource constraints. Our results also show that the more offline patients physicians serve, the more articles the physicians will likely share online. These findings are robust to various econometric specifications and estimation methods. Our research advocates for the benefits Health 2.0 produces and provides evidence of the value of online healthcare communities and the policies that support them.},

Research on virality is of primarily two types. Content-based research focuses on how content characteristics influence virality, whereas creator-based research uses characteristics of the creator of the content to study virality. Through this research note, we aim to draw attention toward a relatively ignored set of constructs—the interactions between content characteristics and creator characteristics. We propose a typology of content features and content message on one hand and creator features and creator history on the other. We argue that adding nuanced content–creator interactions to the nomological network for virality will add conceptual richness and improve predictive validity of future studies. We demonstrate this by running models, with and without the interactions, on a data set of nearly 800,000 posts from Twitter. We find that many of these interactions are significant, improve goodness of fit by 20\%, provide clues about contextual factors in virality, and boost predictive power by 12\%. Our results and subsequent discussions of the findings hope to spur more research on content–creator interactions in understanding virality.},

  abstract     = {Digital advertisements offer a full spectrum of behavioral customization for timing and content capabilities. The existing research in display advertising has predominantly concentrated on the content of advertising; however, our focus is on optimizing the timing of display advertising. In practice, users are constantly adjusting their engagement with content as they process new information continuously. The recent development of emotional tracking and wearable technologies allows platforms to monitor the user’s engagement in real time. We model the user’s continuous engagement process through a Brownian motion. The proposed optimal policy regarding the timing of behavioral advertising is based on a threshold policy with a trigger threshold and target level. Specifically, the platform should insert the advertisement when the user’s engagement level reaches the trigger threshold, and the length of the advertisement should let the user’s engagement level drop to the target level. Analogous to the familiar idea of “price discrimination,” the methods we propose in this study allow the platforms to maximize their revenue by “discriminatory” customization of the timing and length of the advertisement based on the behavior of individual users. Finally, we quantify the benefits of the proposed policy by comparing it with the practically prevalent policies (i.e., preroll, midroll, and a mix of the two) through a simulation study. Our results reveal that, for a wide range of settings, the proposed policy not only significantly increases the platform’s profitability but also improves the completion rate at which consumers finish viewing the advertisement.},

In practice, however, the vast majority of a community’s users (≈90\%) remain inactive (lurk), simply observing contributions made by intermittent (≈9\%) and heavy (≈1\%) contributors. Our research examines increases and decreases of types of user engagement in online communities using hidden Markov models. These models characterize latent states of user engagement from trace user activity or lack of activity. The resulting framework then differentiates lurkers who can later become workers (i.e., engaged in the community) from those who will not. Differentiating lurkers who can be engaged from those who cannot enables managers to anticipate and proactively direct their resources toward the users who are most likely to become or remain workers (i.e., heavy contributors), thereby promoting community welfare. Analysis of 533,714 posts from an online diabetes community shows that incorporating latent user engagement variables can significantly improve the accuracy of welfare prediction models and guide managerial interventions. Application of our framework to five additional communities of various contexts demonstrates its generalizability.},

  abstract     = {Users who have an ad-blocker installed present a genuine predicament for a website (also known as the publisher): On the one hand, these users do not generate revenue for the website; on the other hand, denying them access can shrink the user base and adversely affect the popularity of the website, ultimately reducing traffic over the long run. This has led some websites to require that ad-block users “white-list” them for obtaining access to an “ad-light” experience. We model the decision problem for a website facing two user segments: regular users and ad-block users . The first-level decision or gating strategy is whether to allow ad-free access to ad-block users or require them to white-list the website for gaining access. When ad-block users are allowed ad-free access, the second-level decision is the level of advertising (or ad-intensity ) for regular users. When ad-block users are required to white-list, the second-level decisions are the ad-intensities for regular users and ad-block users. The net utility of a user from visiting the website depends on the intrinsic value of the website’s content, the value obtained due to network effects driven by the amount of traffic/popularity of the website, and the cost incurred due to the presence of ads. We derive an optimal gating and ad-intensity strategy for the website and also solve an identical model for a world without ad-block software. We show that the website can increase its revenue by discriminating between regular and ad-block users via the ad-intensities shown to them. More interestingly, we find that the discriminatory power bestowed on the website by ad-blockers can increase the social surplus and, in particular, increase the surplus of both user segments, namely, regular users and ad-block users, when the utility from their outside option is below a threshold. Thus, the advent of ad-blockers can lead to a win-win for both the website and its users. Finally, we propose a superior selective-gating strategy in which only a fraction of ad-block users are gated. We establish the robustness of our conclusions under several enhancements to our base setting: (a) heterogeneous profitabilities from regular users and ad-block users, (b) endogenous adoption of ad-blockers, (c) the presence of a subscription option, and (d) negative externality due to increased traffic. Our analysis ends with recommendations for three stakeholders in this problem, namely, publishers, web-browser developers, and policy makers.},

These data sets are a growing source of revenue for their owners—one that can generate millions of dollars each year. Given its proprietary nature, the value of the data to a potential buyer is often uncertain to both parties. Therefore, a mutually acceptable price is usually arrived at through a process of negotiation. A seller can choose to provide a demonstration (demo; presentation) to mitigate this uncertainty and/or reduce bias. We adapt a generalization of Nash bargaining to identify when such demonstrations are appropriate and when they are not. We find that a moderately high-valued outside option can help the seller gain from a demonstration even when the buyer is not underestimating the value of the data. Demonstrations can also be useful when the buyer is biased and underestimates data set value. When both an outside option and underestimation exist, the provision of a demo that corrects for bias can make otherwise unsuccessful negotiations succeed; it also has the potential to trigger the provision of uncertainty-reducing information in the demo. In the presence of a demo cost, the seller can provide a partially informative demo; demos can also mitigate the effects of cannibalization up to a point.},

  abstract     = {The underlying premise of referral marketing is to target existing, ostensibly delighted customers to spread awareness and influence adoption of a focal product among their friends who are also likely to benefit from adopting the product. In other words, referral programs are designed to accelerate organic word-of-mouth (WOM) exposure using financial incentives. This poses a challenge, in that it mixes an intrinsically motivated process (stemming from the desire to share a customer’s delight with a product or a service) with an extrinsic trigger in the form of a financial incentive. Prior research has shown that mixing intrinsic and extrinsic motivations can lead to suboptimal outcomes, which, in turn, presents a conceptual dilemma in the design of referral programs. In this paper, we demonstrate how firms can benefit from framing calls-to-action for referral programs in such a way as to move closer to the original intent of organic, intrinsically motivated WOM marketing and yet at the same time reap the benefits of using a financial incentive to increase referral rates. In particular, given a fixed incentive scheme, ceteris paribus , we show the efficacy of a prosocial call-to-action over some of the more commonly used calls-to-action observed in practice. We posit, and causally demonstrate via a large-scale randomized field experiment involving 100,000 customers, that an intrinsically prosocial element in framing the call-to-action to initiate the referral process is a necessary condition for success. When contrasted with egoistic and equitable framing of calls-to-action, the prosocial framing yields a significantly higher propensity to initiate a referral, as well as a significantly higher number of successful referrals. Additional mechanism-level analysis that interacts the treatments with customer characteristics such as repeat purchase, net promoter score, and time since last purchase, an additional field experiment with more attractive referral reward and an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment confirm the importance of an altruistic element in generating a higher quality of advocacy and reducing referral frictions. Subjects in the prosocial group report lower levels of guilt associated with sending a referral and are more able to identify family and friends’ benefit as a motive for sharing referrals and therefore are more selective in sharing the referral message.},

We study the effectiveness of two popular advertising tools, sponsored search and social media endorsement, in increasing traffic and sales for online sellers at a retail e-commerce platform. We find that, controlling for sellers’ self-selection behavior in choosing their strategies, both sponsored search and social media endorsement can significantly increase traffic for sellers, with sponsored search being more effective than social media endorsement. In contrast, only sponsored search has a positive and significant impact on sales. In examining the differential effects for sellers with low and high reputations, we find that sponsored search is more effective in increasing traffic for low-reputation sellers, but its effect on sales is larger for high-reputation sellers. Moreover, although social media endorsement increases traffic for sellers regardless of their reputation, it is effective in increasing sales for only high-reputation sellers.

  abstract     = {The U.S. healthcare system has experienced rapid growth in the adoption and use of clinical health information technology, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems. In a field as complex and pluralistic as healthcare, the introduction of these sweeping information technology platforms is transforming the practices, roles, interdependencies, and communication mechanisms that connect a heterogeneous mix of stakeholders. In this study, we assess the impact of EHR adoption and use on the practices of U.S. healthcare stakeholders and the institutional logics that they instantiate. We identify four prominent logics around the adoption and use of EHR systems—medical professionalism, private sector managerialism, technical design, and regulatory oversight. Our analysis reveals the ways in which practices enacted through EHR systems interact to engender a confluence of the institutional logics that mark the field. Specifically, we theorize a mechanism by which the reticulation, or intertwining, of practices mediated by an EHR system variously fosters complementarity and conflict between institutional logics based on the commensurability of the organizing principles invoked. This proposed framework offers a novel approach to the role of information system use in the institutional dynamics of the healthcare system. In addition, this research offers a range of practical insights regarding the ways in which the diverse institutional logics of the U.S. healthcare system may be impacted by the growth of EHR system use.},

  abstract     = {We develop a general agent-based modeling and computational simulation approach to study the impact of various factors on the temporal dynamics of recommender systems’ performance. The proposed agent-based simulation approach allows for comprehensive analysis of longitudinal recommender systems performance under a variety of diverse conditions, which typically is not feasible with live real-world systems. We specifically focus on exploring the product consumption strategies and show that, over time, user–recommender interactions consistently lead to the longitudinal performance paradox of recommender systems. In particular, users’ reliance on the system’s recommendations to make item choices generally tends to make the recommender system less useful in the long run or, more specifically, negatively impacts the longitudinal dynamics of several important dimensions of recommendation performance. Furthermore, we explore the nuances of the performance paradox via additional explorations of longitudinal dynamics of recommender systems for a variety of user populations and consumption strategies, as well as personalized and nonpersonalized recommendation approaches. One interesting discovery from our exploration is that a certain hybrid consumption strategy—that is, where users rely on a combination of both personalized- and popularity-based recommendations, offers a unique ability to substantially improve consumption relevance over time. In other words, for such hybrid consumption settings, recommendation algorithms facilitate the general “quality-rises-to-the-top” phenomenon, which is not present in the pure popularity-based consumption. In addition to discussing a number of interesting performance patterns, the paper also analyzes and provides insights into the underlying factors that drive such patterns. Our findings have significant implications for the design and implementation of recommender systems.},

  abstract     = {Digital advertisers often harness technology-enabled advertising-scheduling strategies, such as ad repetition at the individual consumer level, in order to improve advertising effectiveness. However, such strategies might elicit annoyance in consumers as indicated by anecdotal evidence, such as the popularity of ad-blocking technologies. Our study captures this trade-off between effective and annoying display advertising. We propose a hidden Markov model that allows us to investigate both the enduring impact of display advertising on consumers’ purchase decisions and the potential of persistent display advertising to stimulate annoyance in consumers. Additionally, we study the structural dynamics of these advertising effects by allowing them to be contingent on the latent state of the funnel path in which each consumer resides. Our findings demonstrate that a tension exists between generating interest and triggering annoyance in consumers; whereas display advertising has an enduring impact on transitioning consumers further down the purchase funnel, persistent display advertising exposures beyond a frequency threshold can have an adverse effect by increasing the chances that consumers will be annoyed. Investigating the dynamics of these annoyance effects, we reveal that consumers who reside in different stages of the purchase funnel exhibit considerably different tolerance for annoyance stimulation. Our findings also reveal that the format of display advertisements and the level of diversification of ad creatives as well as consumer demographics moderate consumers’ thresholds for annoyance elicitation. For instance, advertisers can reduce annoyance elicitation as a result of frequent display advertising exposures when they use static rather than animated display ads as well as when they diversify the display ad creatives shown to consumers. Our paper contributes to the literature on digital advertising and consumer annoyance and has significant managerial implications for the online advertising ecosystem.},

  abstract     = {In the mobile advertising ecosystem, the role of ad exchanges to match advertisers and publishers has grown significantly over the past few years. At a mobile ad exchange, impressions (i.e., opportunities to display ads) are sold to advertisers in real time through an auction mechanism. The traditional mechanism selects a single advertiser whose ad is displayed over the entire duration of an impression, that is, throughout the user’s visit. We argue that such a mechanism leads to an allocative inefficiency , as displaying only the winning ad throughout the lifetime of an impression precludes the exchange from exploiting the opportunity to obtain additional revenue from advertisers whose willingness to pay becomes higher during the lifetime of that impression. Our goal in this paper is to address this efficiency loss by offering mechanisms in which multiple ads can be displayed sequentially over the lifetime of the impression. We consider two plausible settings—one where each auction is individually rational for the advertisers and one where advertisers are better off relative to the traditional mechanism over the long run—and derive an optimal (i.e., revenue-maximizing for the ad exchange) mechanism for each setting. To efficiently compute the payment rule, the optimal mechanism for the former setting uses randomized payments. Under this mechanism, whereas the ad exchange always benefits relative to the traditional mechanism, the advertisers could either gain or lose—we demonstrate both these possibilities. The optimal mechanism for the latter setting is a “mutually beneficial” mechanism in that it guarantees a win–win for both the parties relative to the traditional mechanism, over the long run. Happily, for both the mechanisms, the allocation of ads and the payments from the advertisers are efficiently computable, thereby making them amenable to real-time bidding.},

  abstract     = {Information technology (IT) service providers are often advised to consider moving their service offerings along the value chain as a way to enhance their competitiveness. On the basis of this advice, service providers operating successfully at the lower end of the value chain have tried to expand into higher-order consulting services, whereas those operating higher up on the value chain have sought to expand into more routinized services. In both cases, such efforts have been met with limited success. In this paper, we examine why this might be the case, using an agent-based model developed specifically for this purpose. As part of the model, we use the resource-based view of the firm to construct agents, representing individual IT services firms with three distinct strategic orientations (archetypes) operating at different parts of the value chain with varying resource endowments. We then examine the outcomes associated with these firms when they transition along the value chain. Although we find that moving along the value chain is generally risky, we identify specific conditions under which such moves may be favorable to firms. We find that firms moving up the value chain are likely to be successful only if such moves are accompanied by significant resource changes. In contrast, firms moving down the value chain are likely to be successful only if such moves are accompanied by learning capability arising out of higher absorptive capacity. We find that resource fungibility moderates these relationships. We conclude with a discussion of the managerial implications of our study as well as opportunities for future empirical research within the IT services industry based on our propositions.},

  abstract     = {Banks today have been increasingly reducing their physical presence and redirecting customers to digital channels, and yet, the consequences of this strategy are not well studied. This paper investigates the effects of banks’ branch network changes (i.e., branch openings and branch closures) on customer omnichannel banking behavior. Using approximately 0.85 million (33 months’) anonymized individual-level banking transactions from a large commercial bank in the United States, this paper shows the asymmetric effects of branch openings and branch closures on customer omnichannel banking behavior. In particular, we find that branch openings increase customers’ branch transactions; however, the first branch opening leads to a migration of complex transactions to the branches, which might result in a net decrease in online banking in the short term. As consumers interact more with the physical channel, there is a gradual synergistic increase in customers’ transactions via online banking as well as alternative channels due to a learning spillover effect. The learning spillover effect goes from easy online inquiries to more complex online transactions as additional branches open. On the contrary, branch closures result in a favorable migration pattern from the branch channel to online banking. This pattern, however, could be reversed once the last branch closes within the customer’s residential neighborhood. Our study teases out the underlying mechanisms that drive customer omnichannel banking behavior in the context of branch openings and branch closures, and discusses the managerial implications for branch network restructuring and banking channel management.},

  abstract     = {With the increased penetration of digital technologies into entrepreneurship, the traditional need for proximity to specific locations or large amounts of funding for infrastructure development has diminished. Instead, digital entrepreneurs now pursue locations that provide more opportunities for funding (rounds) and greater social network support. In this paper, we empirically estimate the role of social networks and funding opportunities in a location on entrepreneurs’ decisions to create a start-up in their existing or a new location. We use economic indicators made publicly available by the U.S. government; investment information from CrunchBase and PricewaterhouseCoopers; and demographics, professional histories, and network data from LinkedIn. Analysis of 1,418 entrepreneurs who successfully secured funding suggests that funding rounds per year play a significant and positive role in influencing start-up creation in that location, and local social network density creates stickiness to that location, thus negatively influencing entrepreneurs&#39; willingness to relocate. If entrepreneurs do relocate, we assume that they will create a start-up immediately or delay it only by a short time. In the latter case, our results show that larger social network density (in a new location) affects start-up creation decision. Additionally, we find empirical evidence that midcareer individuals (like millennials) are more likely than early-career or late-career-stage individuals to create a successful technology start-up in the same or a new location. Also, entrepreneurs are less likely to relocate for an Internet-based start-up but are likely to move if they have larger social network density in the new location. This research enhances our understanding of the factors that influence decisions to launch a start-up in a particular location and contributes to the limited literature on technology entrepreneurship in the field of information systems.},

  abstract     = {Many two-sided platforms (for example, eBay, Google, iOS, Android, Twitter, and Amazon) provide integration tools, such as modular interfaces, interactive development environments, application programming interfaces, and help desks, to reduce the costs and improve the functionality of third-party content developed for the platform. The need for such investment is increasing with the rise of major new markets as the result of technologies, such as the “Internet of Things.” Although crucial to platform success, platform integration tools are costly to create. We develop an analytic model to explore the key tradeoffs behind investment in integration tools and how that investment interacts with pricing decisions in a two-sided market. We model these decisions for hardware/software platforms as well as hybrid retail platforms and analyze them under various scenarios, including monopoly and competition. Our results suggest that considering integration investment can create market regimes in which the standard pricing results from the extant platform literature no longer hold. For example, the tendency to reduce prices to one side of a market in response to increasing the benefit of the network to the other side may be suboptimal in the presence of integration investment. Therefore, integration investments must be well coordinated with pricing decisions made for both sides of the market. In general, higher levels of investment by hardware/software platforms into integration become desirable when the platform (1) has access to a large pool of content providers and consumers, (2) is able to develop integration tools that are highly effective in reducing third-party development costs, and (3) operates in a market in which content providers earn a high-enough profit margin creating content that is highly valued by the consumer market. Hybrid retail platforms often show similar behavior. However, there are some nuances. For example, business to business platforms can make investments in integration to facilitate participation by both sides of the market. We find that these investments are complements, not—as one might expect—substitutes. We conclude by discussing this work’s implications for theory and practice.},

Consumers, in response, find technical means to modify purchased devices—called jailbreaking —to remove those applications, thereby reducing the anticipated bloatware revenue for manufacturers. From the perspective of a monopolistic firm that manufactures a consumer electronic device and can preinstall a third-party app for a fee, we investigate whether bloatware inclusion is a viable strategy and how the firm should price its product with bloatware given that consumers can remove bloatware from the product after purchase. We show that it is not always optimal for the firm to sell a bloatware-included product. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that even if the firm can make it harder for consumers to jailbreak, the firm is not always better off by doing so. Consumers do not necessarily benefit from the reduced cost of jailbreaking either. Because the firm passes part of the bloatware revenue to consumers in the form of a lower price, whenever bloatware inclusion benefits the firm, consumers also benefit. Finally, we confirm that our results are robust to alternative modeling assumptions.},

To this end, we conceptualize and quantify two types of firms’ communication actions on social media: posts and responses to customer messages . Furthermore, we classify a firm’s responses to customer messages based on the valence of customer messages—positive versus negative—and examine the effects of volume as well as timeliness of the two types of a firm’s responses to customer messages on firm performance. Using a sample of 63 South Korean firms across industries over a three-year period (5,566 firm-week observations), we find that the volume and timeliness of a firm’s responses to negative customer messages, which are associated with an increase in customer satisfaction, have a significant positive impact on the firm’s market performance measured by abnormal returns and Tobin’s q . Interestingly, the results suggest that a firm’s posts and its responses to positive customer messages are not significantly associated with firm performance. Furthermore, we find that a firm’s posts and its responses to negative customer messages exhibit complementarities in contributing to firm performance. Our results are robust to various alternative specifications, econometric concerns, and Facebook’s policy changes, such as EdgeRank and Promoted Post . Our findings underscore the business value of firms’ actions on social media and provide unique and important implications for theory and practice regarding the appropriate ways to use social media for building and managing customer relationships.},
