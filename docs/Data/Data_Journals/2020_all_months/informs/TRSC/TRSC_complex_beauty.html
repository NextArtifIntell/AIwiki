  abstract     = {This paper models the profit maximizing capacitated hub location problem with multiple demand classes to determine an optimal hub network structure that allocates available capacities of hubs to satisfy demand for commodities from different market segments. A strong deterministic formulation of the problem is presented, and a Benders reformulation is described to optimally solve large-size instances of the problem. A new two-phase methodology is developed to decompose the Benders subproblem, and two effective separation routines are derived to strengthen the Benders optimality cuts. The algorithm is enhanced by the integration of improved variable-fixing techniques. The deterministic model is further extended by considering uncertainty associated with the demand to develop a two-stage stochastic program. To solve the stochastic version, a Monte Carlo simulation–based algorithm is developed that integrates a sample average approximation scheme with the proposed Benders decomposition algorithm. Novel acceleration techniques are presented to improve the convergence of the algorithm proposed for the stochastic version. The efficiency and robustness of the algorithms are evaluated through extensive computational experiments. Computational results show that large-scale instances with up to 500 nodes and three demand classes can be solved to optimality, and that the proposed separation routines generate cuts that provide significant speedups compared with using Pareto-optimal cuts. The developed two-phase methodology for solving the Benders subproblem as well as the variable-fixing and acceleration techniques can be used to solve other discrete location and network design problems.},

Whereas the first model considers both a constraint on the probability of covering the realized emergency demand and minimizing the expected cost of doing so, the second one employs probabilistic envelope constraints that allow us to control the degradation of coverage under the more severe scenarios. These models give rise to large mixed-integer programs, which can be tackled directly or by using a conservative approximation scheme. For the former, we implement the branch-and-Benders-cut method, which improves significantly the solution time when compared with using both a recently proposed state-of-the art branch-and-bound algorithm and the CPLEX solver. Finally, a practical study is conducted using historical data from the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and sheds some light on optimal EMS location configuration for this region and on necessary trade-offs that must be made between emergency demand coverage and expected cost. These insights are confirmed through an out-of-sample performance analysis.},

The management of vessel traffic and pilotage involves scheduling the vessels for sailing into and out of a seaport and scheduling the pilots for navigating the vessels in the port waters. In this paper, we study the integrated vessel traffic and pilot scheduling problem of a seaport. We manage the vessel traffic by optimizing the utilization of the navigation channels and the utilization of the anchorage areas in the terminal basin and incorporate the decision of pilot scheduling into the decision of vessel traffic management for congestion mitigation and vessel service enhancement. We formulate the problem on a time–space network with vessel- and pilot-dependent arc costs and develop an integer programming model that minimizes the sum of the berthing and departure tardiness cost of vessels, the cost of unsatisfied vessel service requests, and the pilot dispatching cost. For solving the model, we enumerate feasible vessel paths a priori and develop a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm that decomposes the problem into a vessel and pilot path assignment subproblems. Computational performance of the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is tested on problem instances generated based on the physical layout and operational data of the Waigaoqiao Port in Shanghai.},

In this paper, we extend the semianalytical Lax–Hopf algorithm in order to compute link inflows and outflows with the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards (LWR) model. Our proposed fast Lax–Hopf algorithm has a very low computational complexity. We demonstrate that some of the original algorithm’s operations (associated with the initial conditions) can be discarded, leading to a faster computation of boundary demands/supplies in network simulation problems for general concave fundamental diagrams (FDs). Moreover, the computational cost can be further reduced for triangular FDs and specific space–time discretizations. The resulting formulation has a performance comparable to the link transmission model and because it solves the original LWR model for a wide range of FD shapes, with any initial configuration, it is suitable to solve a broad range of traffic operations problems. As part of the analysis, we compare the performance of the proposed scheme with that of other well-known computational methods.},

  abstract     = {A category of congestion pricing that charges travelers based on their trips’ some particular measurable attribute has been proposed in the literature to avoid the difficulty of pricing individual links on dense urban networks. To dig into such pricing’s theoretical performance, given any readily measurable attribute, this paper aims to propose a general mathematical framework for determining the existence of the tolling functions that can induce the system optimum of a transportation network. Specifically, we first formulate tolled network equilibrium as variational inequality. Then, in the elastic demand case, we prove that determining the existence of the system-optimum–inducing tolling functions is equivalent to solving a linear programming problem. In the fixed demand case, we provide a mixed integer linear programming formulation and show that the existence is confirmed if and only if its optimal objective function value equals zero. To enhance computational efficiency, we also derive valid inequalities for the formulation. Furthermore, we identify a special case in which determining the existence in the fixed demand case can be reduced to solving a linear programming problem similarly to the one in the elastic demand case. Finally, numerical examples, using distance- and emission-based tolls, are presented to derive important insights and demonstrate the proposed approaches’ potential of solving large-scale problems.},

Instead, users are interested in fast routes on which the energy consumption does not exceed the battery capacity. For that, drivers can deliberately reduce speed to save energy. Hence, route planning should provide both path and speed recommendations. To tackle the resulting N P -hard optimization problem, previous work trades correctness or accuracy of the underlying model for practical running times. We present a novel framework to compute optimal constrained shortest paths (without charging stops) for electric vehicles that uses more realistic physical models, while taking speed adaptation into account. Careful algorithm engineering makes the approach practical even on large, realistic road networks: We compute optimal solutions in less than a second for typical battery capacities, matching the performance of previous inexact methods. For even faster query times, the approach can easily be extended with heuristics that provide high quality solutions within milliseconds.},

Two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations that use different discretization approaches are developed and compared. Discrete-Time Optimization (DTO) resembles a time-expanded network that discretizes the time and decisions to equal discrete slots. Discrete-Event Optimization (DEO) discretizes the time and decisions into nonuniform slots based on arrival and departure events in the network. In addition to the DEO’s higher practicability, the comparative computational study carried out on the transit-bus network in the city of Rotterdam, Netherlands, shows that the DEO is superior to the DTO in terms of computational performance. To show the potential benefits of the optimal schedule, it is compared with two reference common-sense greedy strategies: First-in-First-Served and Lowest-Charge-Highest-Priority.},

For the public transport industry, these new services offer new chances but also risks, making planning models and tools for integrated intermodal network planning indispensable. We develop a strategic network planning optimization model for bus lines that allows for intermodal trips with MoD as a first or last leg. Starting from an existing public transport network, we decide simultaneously on the use of existing line segments in the future fixed-route network, on areas of the city where an integrated MoD service should be offered, on how MoD interacts with the fixed-route network via transfer points, and on passenger routes fulfilling given service-level requirements. The main challenges from a modeling point of view are to capture the interplay between MoD services and the fixed public network, as well as the approximation of MoD costs taking into account that vehicle utilization is a key factor influencing these costs. We develop a path-based formulation and a branch-and-price algorithm, as well as an enhanced enumeration-based approach, to solve real-world instances to proven optimality. The solution methods are tested on instances generated with the help of real-world data from a medium-sized German city, Göttingen, that currently operates around 20 bus lines.},

To relieve this pressure, this paper studies a carpooling platform that would match riders and drivers while guaranteeing a ride back and exploiting spatial and temporal locality. In particular, the paper formalizes the commute trip-sharing problem (CTSP) to find a routing plan that maximizes ride sharing for a set of commute trips. The CTSP is a generalization of the vehicle routing problem with routes that satisfy time-window, capacity, pairing, precedence, ride-duration, and driver constraints. The paper introduces two exact algorithms for the CTSP: a route-enumeration algorithm and a branch-and-price algorithm. Experimental results show that on a high-fidelity real-world data set of commute trips from a midsize city, both algorithms optimally solve small and medium-sized problems and produce high-quality solutions for larger problem instances. The results show that carpooling, if widely adopted, has the potential to reduce vehicle usage by up to 57\% and decrease vehicle miles traveled by up to 46\% while incurring only a 22\% increase in average ride time per commuter for the trips considered.},

At the core of the OFEX routing problem is a combined pricing and bidding model that simultaneously (1) considers the probability of winning a load at a given bid price and current market competition, (2) anticipates the future profit corresponding to the current decision, and (3) prioritizes the bidding order among possible load options. Results from numerical experiments constructed using real-world data from a Chinese OFEX platform indicate that the proposed routing model could (1) improve a truck’s expected profit substantially, compared with the benchmark solutions built to represent the state of the practice, and (2) enhance the robustness of the overall profitability against the impact of market competition and spatial variations.},

Moreover, we show that the approximate value function is L ♮ -concave, thereby characterizing the structure of the optimal control policy for the approximate model.

  abstract     = {Periodic timetabling is an important, yet computationally challenging, problem in public transportation planning. The usual objective when designing a timetable is to minimize passenger travel time. However, in most approaches, it is ignored that the routes of the passengers depend on the timetable, so handling their routing separately leads to timetables that are suboptimal for the passengers. This has recently been recognized, but integrating the passenger routing in the optimization is computationally even harder than solving the classic periodic timetabling problem. In our paper, we develop an exact preprocessing method for reducing the problem size and a heuristic reduction approach in which only a subset of the passengers is considered. It provides upper and lower bounds on the objective value, such that it can be adjusted with respect to quality and computation time. Together, we receive an approach that is applicable for real-world problems. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the approach on a benchmark example and on three close-to-real-world instances. Furthermore, we prove that the ratio between the classic problem without routing and the problem with integrated routing is bounded under weak and realistic assumptions.},

  abstract     = {The shortest path problem with resource constraints (SPPRC) is often used as a subproblem within a column-generation approach for routing and scheduling problems. It aims to find a least-cost path between the source and the destination nodes in a network while satisfying the resource consumption limitations on every node. The SPPRC is usually solved using dynamic programming. Such approaches are effective in practice, but they can be inefficient when the network is large and especially when the number of resources is high. To cope with this major drawback, we propose a new exact primal algorithm to solve the SPPRC defined on acyclic networks. The proposed algorithm explores the solution space iteratively using a path adjacency–based partition. Numerical experiments for vehicle and crew scheduling problem instances demonstrate that the new approach outperforms both the standard dynamic programming and the multidirectional dynamic programming methods.},

  abstract     = {Variable fixing by reduced costs is a popular technique for accelerating the solution process of mixed-integer linear programs. For vehicle-routing problems solved by branch-price-and-cut algorithms, it is possible to fix to zero the variables associated with all routes containing at least one arc from a subset of arcs determined according to the dual solution of a linear relaxation. This is equivalent to removing these arcs from the network used to generate the routes. In this paper, we extend this technique to routes containing sequences of two arcs. Such sequences or their arcs cannot be removed directly from the network because routes traversing only one arc of a sequence might still be allowed. For some of the most common vehicle-routing problems, we show how this issue can be overcome by modifying the route-generation labeling algorithm in order to remove indirectly these sequences from the network. The proposed acceleration strategy is tested on benchmark instances of the vehicle-routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) and four variants of the electric VRPTW. The computational results show that it yields a significant speedup, especially for the most difficult instances.},

  abstract     = {We study the adaptive distributionally robust hub location problem with multiple commodities under demand and cost uncertainty in both uncapacitated and capacitated cases. The hub location decision anticipates the worst-case expected cost over an ambiguity set of possible distributions of the uncertain demand and cost, and the routing policy, being adaptive to the uncertainty realization, ships commodities through selected hubs. We investigate the adaptivity and tractability of the distributionally robust model under different distributional information about uncertainty. In the uncapacitated case in which demand and cost are independent and costs of different commodities are also mutually independent, the adaptive distributionally robust model is equivalent to a nonadaptive classical robust model and the second-stage routing decision follows an optimal static policy. We then relax the independence assumption and show that the second-stage routing decision follows an optimal scenario-wise policy if either the demand or the cost is supported on a convex hull of given scenarios. We extend our analysis to the capacitated case and show that the second-stage routing decision still follows an optimal scenario-wise policy if the demand is supported on the convex hull of given scenarios. In terms of tractability, for all mentioned cases, we reformulate the distributionally robust model as a moderate-sized mixed-integer linear program, and we recover the associated worst-case distribution by solving a collection of linear programs. Through numerical studies using the Civil Aeronautics Board data set, we demonstrate the advantages of the distributionally robust model by examining its superior out-of-sample performance against the classical robust model and the stochastic model.},

This causes autocorrelation in the time series of commuting flows and provides a rationale for introducing fixed components in the trip distribution model. The fixed components are assumed to be constant in time and separated from the observed trip distribution. We next consider the residuals and fit the model by a constrained entropy-maximization procedure. Based on commuting data from Stockholm County in Sweden, the fixed component spatial interaction model is demonstrated to lead to a substantial improvement in goodness of fit compared with conventional spatial interaction models. The identification of fixed components leads to significantly lower estimates of the distance deterrence parameter, and fixed components are further argued to be potentially useful in a prediction perspective. The distance deterrence parameter in the fixed component model reflects the spatial interaction of workers who are actually considering changes in their residential and/or job location. We also compare alternative measures of spatial separation and discuss differences in commuting behaviour by gender.},

In Japan, rural areas face sparse populations and rapid growth in the percentage of elderly people. In these areas, many bus lines offer fewer than 10 services per day. In addition to low-frequency services, it is also inconvenient to transfer to another bus or train service. Thus, there is a strong need to design a timetable that ensures smooth transfers among buses and trains. We tackle this problem by adopting existing bus lines and train timetables as much as possible to avoid drastic changes such as an increase in the number of services. Based on this approach, we present a mathematical optimization model to generate a revised bus timetable that shortens waiting time for transfers compared with the current timetable. We apply our model to a part of the Tohoku District in Japan and demonstrate its usefulness in the real world.},

We propose a matheuristic relying on a neighborhood search scheme to find solutions of good quality for real-world-sized problem instances in reasonable time. To produce starting solutions, we propose a construction heuristic decomposing the daytime redistribution process into three sequential phases: determine pickups and deliveries, link pickups and deliveries into transport requests, and assign transport requests to master tours. We evaluate the operational performance of master tours with a discrete-event simulation approach. We show that master tours improve the level of service in bike-sharing systems with high and regular mobility patterns, for example, commuting activities.},

The games fall into the class of network design games but have key distinctive features. We provide some general results as well as an instance without a pure Nash equilibrium for the general case. Subsequently, we focus on the special case with a single intermodal connection available. We show that a pure Nash equilibrium always exists but that this one is not always unique. We additionally identify key structural properties for this single-hub game. These properties enable us to identify all pure Nash equilibria and a system-optimal solution in polynomial time. We illustrate our results with an application related to the development of an extended gate in the Netherlands and derive a series of insights. Overall, the results show that the multiple user feature of intermodal hinterland networks is critical and needs to be accounted for at the network design stage. We believe that this latter statement holds for general network design problems with multiple users.},

  abstract     = {Semi-liner shipping transports various types of cargo, such as containers, break-bulk cargo, and heavy-lift project cargo, between different ports. Similar to liner shipping, semi-liner shipping publishes shipping routes for customers’ reference. However, it does not strictly follow the published route and usually makes some adjustments for each ship voyage by adding some port calls to transport more cargo considering the excess ship capacity. This study first proposes the semi-liner shipping service design (SLSSD) problem that aims to maximize the shipping profit by determining a shipping route subject to the potential adjustments. The proposed SLSSD problem is subsequently formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed integer programming model with integer recourse variables. The first stage determines the visit sequence of a set of compulsory ports under shipping demand uncertainty. The second stage decides whether to add or remove some ports in the route in view of the realized shipping demand for each ship voyage. To effectively solve the model, two decomposition methods are developed, namely, the stage decomposition method and the scenario decomposition method, that decompose the problem by stage and demand scenario, respectively. In addition, two novel acceleration techniques are also provided to expedite the scenario decomposition method. Numerical experiments reveal satisfactory efficiency of these two methods to solve the semi-liner shipping service design problem, especially the scenario decomposition method, which is generally better than the stage decomposition method and can be thousands of times faster than the classic branch-and-cut algorithm.},

One such reduction strategy proposed by the International Maritime Organization suggested imposing a carbon emission tax on ports as a long-term solution to reduce carbon emissions, but this would definitely increase the operating cost of ports. Quay cranes (QCs), as one type of handling equipment, play an important role in the service efficiency and carbon emission of ports. Therefore, this paper makes an effort to explore the study of the integrated berth allocation and QC assignment problem with the consideration of carbon emission taxation. This problem is formulated as a biobjective integer programming model, aimed at minimizing the total completion delay of all tasks and the total operating costs for all QCs.

A more general problem, called the extended single truck and trailer routing problem (XSTTRP), is used as a common baseline to describe and model this class of problems. In particular, the XSTTRP contains, all together, a variety of vertex types previously considered only separately: truck customers, vehicle customers with and without parking facilities, and parking-only locations. To solve the XSTTRP, we developed a fast and effective hybrid metaheuristic, consisting of an iterative core part, in which routes that define high-quality solutions are stored in a pool. Eventually, a set-partitioning-based postoptimization selects the best combination of routes that forms a feasible solution from the pool. The algorithm is tested on extensively studied problems from the literature, such as the multiple depot vehicle routing problem, the location routing problem, the single truck and trailer routing problem with satellite depots, and the single truck and trailer routing problem. Finally, computational results and a thorough analysis of the main algorithm’s components on newly designed XSTTRP instances are provided. The obtained results show that the proposed hybrid metaheuristic is highly competitive with previous approaches designed to solve specific specialized problems, both in terms of computing time and solution quality.},

Previous works have proved that this problem can be deterministically approximated when the path travel costs are independent and identically distributed. Such an approximation has been demonstrated to be of acceptable quality in terms of the estimation of an optimal solution compared with consolidated approaches such as stochastic programming with recourse, completely overcoming the computational burden of solving enormous programs exacerbated by the number of scenarios considered. Nevertheless, the hypothesis regarding the independence among the path travel costs does not hold when considering real settings. It is well known, in fact, that traffic congestion influences travel costs and creates dependence among them. In this paper, we demonstrate that the independence assumption can be relaxed and a deterministic approximation of the stochastic multipath traveling salesman problem can be derived by assuming just asymptotically independent travel costs. We also demonstrate that this deterministic approximation has strong operational implications because it allows the consideration of realistic traffic models. Computational tests on extensive sets of random and realistic instances indicate the excellent efficiency and accuracy of the deterministic approximation.},

Thus, charging stations must be built throughout the system’s operational area where cars can be charged between uses. In this work, we introduce and study an optimization problem that models the task of finding optimal locations and sizes for charging stations, using the number of expected trips that can be accepted (or their resulting revenue) as a gauge of quality. Integer linear programming formulations and construction heuristics are introduced, and the resulting algorithms are tested on grid-graph-based instances, as well as on real-world instances from Vienna. The results of our computational study show that the best-performing exact algorithm solves most of the benchmark instances to optimality and usually provides small optimality gaps for the remaining ones, whereas our heuristics provide high-quality solutions very quickly. Our algorithms also provide better solutions than a sequential approach that considers strategic and operational decisions separately. A cross-validation study analyzes the algorithms’ performance in cases where demand is uncertain and shows the advantage of combining individual solutions into a single consensus solution, and a simulation study investigates their behavior in car sharing systems that provide their customers with more flexibility regarding vehicle selection.},

Such auctions can be used when there exist multiple units of a single product and the value of a set of units depends on the total quantity sold. For example, a road network or airport will become congested as the number of users increase so that a permit for use becomes more valuable as the total number allocated decreases. A quantity-contingent auction determines both the number of items sold and an allocation of items to bidders. Because such auctions could be used by bidders to gain excessive market power, we impose constraints limiting market power. We focus on auctions that allocate airport arrival and departure slots. We propose a continuous model and an integer programming model for the associated winner determination problem. Using these models, we perform computational experiments that lend insights into the properties of the quantity-contingent auction.},

  abstract     = {In air traffic management, a fundamental decision with large cost implications is the planning of future capacity provision. Here, capacity refers to the available man-hours of air traffic controllers to monitor traffic. Airspace can be partitioned in various ways into a collection of sectors, and each sector has a fixed maximum number of flights that may enter within a given time period. Each sector also requires a fixed number of man-hours to be operated; we refer to them as sector-hours. Capacity planning usually takes place a long time ahead of the day of operation to ensure that sufficiently many air traffic controllers are available to manage the flow of aircrafts. However, at the time of planning, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the number and spatiotemporal distribution of nonscheduled flights and capacity provision, the former mainly due to business aviation, and the latter usually stemming from the impact of weather, military use of airspaces, etc. Once the capacity decision has been made (in terms of committing to a budget of sector-hours per airspace to represent long-term staff scheduling), on the day of operation, we can influence traffic by enforcing rerouting and tactical delays. Furthermore, we can modify which sectors to open at a given time (the so-called sector-opening scheme) subject to the fixed capacity budgets in each airspace. The fundamental trade-off is between reducing the capacity provision cost at the expense of potentially increasing displacement cost arising from rerouting or delays. To tackle this, we propose a scalable decomposition approach that exploits the structure of the problem and can take traffic and capacity provision uncertainty into account by working with a large number of traffic scenarios. We propose several decision policies based on the resulting pool of solutions and test them numerically using real-world data.},

A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model enriched by chance constraints is proposed in this paper. The first-stage optimization problem determines an aircraft sequence and target times over a reference point in the terminal area, called initial approach fix (IAF), so as to minimize the landing sequence length. Actual times over the IAF are assumed to deviate randomly from target times following known probability distributions. In the second stage, actual times over the IAF are assumed to be revealed, and landing times are to be determined in view of minimizing a time-deviation impact cost function. A Benders reformulation is proposed, and acceleration techniques to Benders decomposition are sketched. Extensive results on realistic instances from Paris Charles-de-Gaulle airport show the benefit of two-stage stochastic and chance-constrained programming over a deterministic policy.},

  abstract     = {Congestion at major airports worldwide results in increased taxi times, fuel burn, and emissions. Regulating the pushback of aircraft from their gates, also known as departure metering, is a promising approach to mitigating surface congestion. Departure metering algorithms require models of airport surface traffic and knowledge of when a flight would be to be ready for pushback, which is called the earliest off-block time (EOBT). While EOBTs are known to be inaccurate due to several reasons, there has been little prior research on characterizing EOBT uncertainty and its impact on departure metering. We present a new class of queuing network models for the airport surface that are capable of capturing congestion at multiple locations. We demonstrate our modeling approach using operational data from three major U.S. airports: Newark Liberty International Airport, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and Charlotte Douglas International Airport. We analyze the current levels of uncertainty in the EOBT information published by the airlines and conduct a parametric analysis of the reduction in departure metering benefits due to errors in the EOBT information. Our analysis indicates that the current levels of EOBT uncertainty lead to a 50\% reduction in benefits at some airports when compared with an ideal case with no EOBT uncertainty. Two approaches to departure metering are considered: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Airspace Technology Demonstration-2 logic and a new optimal control approach. We show that our queuing network models can help design and evaluate both approaches and that the optimal control approach is more effective in accommodating EOBT uncertainty while maintaining runway utilization.},

  abstract     = {Airlines must operate many jobs in airports, such as passenger check-in or runway tasks. In airlines’ hubs, airlines generally choose to perform these jobs with their own agents. Shift planning aims at building the sequences of jobs operated by the airline agents and has been widely studied given its impact on operating costs. The impact of delayed flights is generally not taken into account despite the propagation of flight delays along these sequences: If a flight is late, then the agents doing the corresponding jobs are delayed, and may arrive late to their next jobs and delay the corresponding flights. Since delay costs are much higher than the costs of outsourcing jobs, if the agent who is supposed to operate a job is still working elsewhere when the job begins, then airlines tend to outsource the job to their own dedicated team or to a third party. We introduce a stochastic version of the shift-planning problem that takes into account outsourcing costs due to delay. It can be seen as a natural stochastic generalization of the vehicle-scheduling problem in which delayed jobs are outsourced. We propose a column-generation approach to solve it, whose key element is the pricing subproblem algorithm, modeled as a stochastic resource-constrained shortest-path problem. Numerical results on Air France industrial instances show the benefits of using our stochastic version of the shift-planning problem and the efficiency of the solution method. Moving to the stochastic version enables Air France to reduce total operating costs by 3.5\%–4.8\% on instances with more than 200 jobs, and our algorithm can solve to near optimality instances with up to 400 jobs.},

  abstract     = {Air traffic disruptions result in flight delays, cancellations, passenger misconnections, and ultimately high costs to aviation stakeholders. This paper proposes a jointly reactive and proactive approach to airline disruption management, which optimizes recovery decisions in response to realized disruptions and in anticipation of future disruptions. The approach forecasts future disruptions partially and probabilistically by estimating systemic delays at hub airports (and the uncertainty thereof) and ignoring other contingent disruptions. It formulates a dynamic stochastic integer programming framework to minimize network-wide expected disruption recovery costs. Specifically, our Stochastic Reactive and Proactive Disruption Management (SRPDM) model combines a stochastic queuing model of airport congestion, a flight planning tool from Boeing/Jeppesen and an integer programming model of airline disruption recovery. We develop a solution procedure based on look-ahead approximation and sample average approximation, which enables the model’s implementation in short computational times. Experimental results show that leveraging even partial and probabilistic estimates of future disruptions can reduce expected recovery costs by 1\%–2\%, as compared with a myopic baseline approach based on realized disruptions alone. These benefits are mainly driven by the deliberate introduction of departure holds to reduce expected fuel costs, flight cancellations, and aircraft swaps.},

We study a dynamic airline maintenance scheduling problem, which daily decides the set of aircraft to maintain and the set of pending tasks to execute in each aircraft. The objective is to minimize the expected costs of expired maintenance tasks over the operating horizon. To increase flexibility and reduce costs, we integrate maintenance scheduling with tail assignment decisions. We formulate our problem as a Markov decision process and design dynamic policies based on approximate dynamic programming, including value function approximation, rolling horizon techniques, and a hybrid policy between the latter two that delivers the best results. In a case study based on LATAM airline, we show the value of dynamic optimization by testing our best policies against a simple airline decision rule and a deterministic relaxation with perfect future information. We suggest to schedule tasks requiring less resources first to increase utilization of residual maintenance capacity.

  abstract     = {An increasing number of e-commerce retailers offers same-day delivery. To deliver the ordered goods, providers dynamically dispatch a fleet of vehicles transporting the goods from the warehouse to the customers. In many cases, retailers offer different delivery deadline options, from four-hour delivery up to next-hour delivery. Due to the deadlines, vehicles often only deliver a few orders per trip. The overall number of served orders within the delivery horizon is small and the revenue low. As a result, many companies currently struggle to conduct same-day delivery cost-efficiently. In this paper, we show how dynamic pricing is able to substantially increase both revenue and the number of customers we are able to serve the same day. To this end, we present an anticipatory pricing and routing policy (APRP) method that incentivizes customers to select delivery deadline options efficiently for the fleet to fulfill. This maintains the fleet’s flexibility to serve more future orders. We model the respective pricing and routing problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). To apply APRP, the state-dependent opportunity costs per customer and option are required. To this end, we use a guided offline value function approximation (VFA) based on state space aggregation. The VFA approximates the opportunity cost for every state and delivery option with respect to the fleet’s flexibility. As an offline method, APRP is able to determine suitable prices instantly when a customer orders. In an extensive computational study, we compare APRP with a policy based on fixed prices and with conventional temporal and geographical pricing policies. APRP outperforms the benchmark policies significantly, leading to both a higher revenue and more customers served the same day.},

We formulate VRPS with stochastic times as a two-stage stochastic integer programming model that, unlike the deterministic models in the VRPS literature, does not have any big-M constraints. This advantage comes at the cost of a large number of second-stage integer variables. We prove that the integrality constraints on second-stage variables can be relaxed, and therefore, we can apply the L-shaped algorithm and its branch-and-cut implementation to solve the problem. We enhance the model by developing valid inequalities and a lower bounding functional. We analyze the subproblems of the L-shaped algorithm and devise a specialized algorithm for them that is significantly faster than standard linear programming algorithms. Computational results show that the branch-and-cut algorithm optimally solves stochastic home healthcare scheduling instances with 15 patients and 10\%–30\% of synchronized visits. It also finds solutions with an average optimality gap of 3.57\% for instances with 20 patients. Furthermore, the branch-and-cut algorithm optimally solves stochastic operating room scheduling problems with 20 surgeries.},

The proposed branch-price-and-cut algorithm relies on an efficient labeling procedure, exact and heuristic dominance rules, and completion bounds to price profitable columns. Instances with up to 76 nodes could be solved in less than five hours, and instances with up to 148 nodes could be solved in long runs of the algorithm. The experiments also allowed new findings on the problem. The solution to the stochastic problem is up to 10\% less costly than the deterministic equivalent solution. Opening new routes reduces restocking costs and in many cases results in solutions with less transportation costs. When the number of routes is not fixed, the optimal solutions under detour-to-depot and optimal restocking are nearly equivalent. However, when the number of routes is limited and the expected demand along a route is allowed to exceed the vehicle capacity, optimal restocking may be significantly more cost-effective than the detour-to-depot policy.},

We use this to develop a new tree-based data structure to improve the complexity of computations and memory usage. This approach also allows us to present methods that have the best known computational complexity but that do not require a lexicographic order of search. Our numerical experiments illustrate the trade-off between computation time and memory usage among the various methods. For 1,000 customer instances, our methods are able to speed up a construction heuristic by up to 8.89 times and an exchange neighborhood improvement heuristic by up to 3.94 times, without requiring excessive amounts of memory.},

  abstract     = {Using crowdsourced delivery capacity, that is, individuals offering their vehicle and their time to perform deliveries, can allow companies to provide faster delivery options and more easily accommodate fluctuations in demand. However, because of the uncertainty associated with crowdsourced delivery capacity, ensuring service quality is more challenging. To prevent or mitigate any negative effects of the uncertainty associated with crowdsourced delivery capacity, companies may choose to also have a scheduled delivery workforce that they can control more effectively. We investigate continuous approximation and value function approximation methods for scheduling this workforce, that is, deciding their shifts (start time and duration) to achieve a service level target at minimum cost. An extensive computational study demonstrates the efficacy of our methods and provides insights into the use of crowdsourced delivery capacity.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a carpool matching (CaMa) problem in which participants price shared rides based on both operating cost and schedule displacement (i.e., the absolute difference between the desired and actual arrival times). By reporting their valuation of this displacement, each participant in effect bids for every possible shared ride that generates a unique value to her. The CaMa problem can be formulated as a mixed integer program (MIP) that maximizes the social welfare by choosing matching pairs and a departure time for each pair. We show the optimal departure time can be determined for each pair a priori, independent of the matching problem. This result reduces the CaMa problem to a standard bipartite matching problem. We prove that the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) pricing policy ensures no participant is worse off or has the incentive to misreport their valuation of schedule displacement. To control the large deficit created by the VCG policy, we develop a single-side reward (SSR) pricing policy, which only compensates participants who are forced by the system to endure a schedule displacement. Under the assumption of overpricing tendency (i.e., no participant would want to underreport their value), we show the SSR policy not only generates substantial profits, but also retains the other desired properties of the VCG policy, notably truthful reporting. Even though it cannot rule out underreporting, our simulation experiments confirm that the SSR policy is a robust and deficit-free alternative to the VCG policy. Specifically, we find that (1) underreporting is not a practical concern for a carpool platform as it never reduces the number of matched pairs and its impact on profits is largely negligible; and (2) participants have very little to gain by underreporting their value.},

In this study, we focus on integrating dynamic time slot incentives and order delivery with the intention of reducing overall delivery cost and improving profitability. The proposed incentive mechanism is able to exploit the variability in the marginal fulfillment cost of an order and the customers’ preferences to influence the customers’ selection of delivery slots. We present an approximate dynamic programming approach to estimate the marginal fulfillment cost using the operational vehicle routing cost while accounting for future orders. We demonstrate that the proposed incentive mechanism can achieve a high level of savings (of up to 70\%) with respect to the benchmark customer-free-choice scenario. It is also noted that the proposed mechanism effectively exploits higher order density and vehicle availability to achieve a higher level of savings.},

Our work also considers a commitment horizon that is much shorter than the planning horizon. We show that the availability of partial information fundamentally changes the contracting policies in the presence of such commitment horizons, and if used optimally, this information can be highly valuable. Partial visibility of demand can increase the willingness of the decision maker to commit to contracts and expand the range of capacity levels selected in settings where the capacity level of a contract is a decision variable. We also identify settings in which the value of partial information is negligible, reducing the incentive of managers to acquire additional demand information for future periods. Finally, we show that with seasonal demand, information is leveraged by properly coordinating with expected demand shocks (e.g., Black Friday) using tailored strategies.},

The model parameters were estimated by using detailed, real-world data on commercial vehicle parking choices collected in two commercial urban areas in Singapore. The model analyzes the effect of several variables on the parking behavior of commercial vehicle drivers, including the presence of congestion and queueing, attitudes toward illegal parking, and pricing (parking fees).

Many urban supply chains are composed of small and independent actors that cannot efficiently organize their highly fragmented supply chains, thereby negatively affecting the quality of life in urban areas. Both companies and local administrators try to improve transport efficiency and reduce external costs, but the effects of such interventions are difficult to predict, especially when applied in combination with each other (an urban logistics scheme). This paper presents an agent-based simulation model to quantify the effects of urban logistics schemes on multiple actors. We provide a detailed mathematical representation in the form of a Markov decision process. Based on an extensive literature study, we aggregate data to represent various actors in typical Western European cities. We perform numerical experiments to obtain insights into urban logistics schemes. The results show that most schemes yield significant environmental improvements but that achieving long-term financial viability is challenging for urban consolidation centers in particular. We also demonstrate that interventions, such as subsidies and access restrictions, do not always yield the intended effect. In a backcasting experiment, we identify conditions and schemes to achieve a financially viable urban consolidation center.},

The problem allows for travel times that can depend on the time of departure. We consider two objectives for the problem: (1) a makespan objective that seeks to return the salesman to his home as early as possible and (2) a duration objective that seeks to minimize the amount of time that he is away from his home. The solution approach is based on an integer programming formulation of the problem on a time-expanded network, because doing so enables time dependencies to be embedded in the definition of the network. However, because such a time-expanded network (and thus, the integer programming formulation) can rapidly become prohibitively large, the solution approach uses a dynamic discretization discovery framework, which has been effective in other contexts.

  abstract     = {In this research, we address the railway multiterritory dispatch planning (RMTDP) problem. The goal of the RMTDP problem is to find the optimal movement of trains across consecutive dispatch territories, and it is one of the major challenges that decision makers face on a daily basis. It ideally takes into account the correct placement of maintenance windows, remaining capacity of terminals, and availability of train crews, among other critical aspects such as locomotive balance, fueling locations, and inspections. Although these train movement plans are made at the corridor level, which comprises several dispatch territories, when it comes to execution, the meet–pass decisions are made at the individual dispatch territories. This notion causes disruptions and misalignment at the boundaries of dispatch territories. The approach in this paper aims at finding a holistic conflict-free master plan by optimally matching train lineups at territory boundaries and smoothly routing trains through bottlenecks. We propose an efficient solution approach that iteratively constructs a master scheduling plan while minimizing the amount of train delay within a given planning horizon. This is accomplished by designing a time–space network model to identify feasible schedules and developing a mathematical programming–based heuristic to solve the underlying model. A thorough computational study shows the effectiveness of our heuristic approach, as we report reasonable average run times of 3.0 and 6.5 minutes to solve instances of moderate to large size problems, respectively. The results obtained from the algorithm using test snapshots from a Class I railroad company have been shown to assistant chief dispatchers and have received encouraging feedback for applicability.},

First, we propose an algorithm that finds an alternative line plan that can be operated in the affected part of the railway network. As the line plan should be feasible with respect to infrastructural and resource restrictions, we integrate these aspects in the algorithm in a Benders-like fashion. Second, to operate the railway system within the disrupted region, we propose several local train dispatching strategies requiring varying degrees of flexibility and coordination. Computational experiments based on disruptions in the Dutch railway network indicate that the algorithm performs well, finding workable and passenger-oriented line plans within a couple of minutes.

We propose to reschedule the rolling stock in such a way that the passenger delay is minimized and such that objectives on passenger comfort and operational efficiency are taken into account. We refer to this problem as the passenger delay reduction problem. We propose two models for this problem, which are based on two dominant streams of literature for the traditional rolling stock rescheduling problem. The first model is an arc formulation of the problem, whereas the second model is a path formulation. We test the effectiveness of these models on instances from Netherlands Railways (Nederlandse Spoorwegen). The results show that the rescheduling of rolling stock can significantly decrease passenger delays in the system. Especially, allowing flexibility in the assignment of rolling stock at terminal stations turns out to be effective in reducing the delays. Moreover, we show that the arc formulation–based model performs best in finding high-quality solutions within the limited time that is available in the rescheduling phase.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, optimization models for railway traffic rescheduling mostly focused on incorporating an increasing detail of the infrastructure, with the goal of proving feasibility and quality from the point of view of the managers of the infrastructure (tracks and stations). Different approaches that manage only the passenger flows instead focus more explicitly on the quality of service perceived by the passengers. This paper investigates microscopic railway traffic optimization models and algorithms, merging these two streams of research. In particular, we analyze the characterization of an equilibrium point between the reordering choices of train dispatchers in railway traffic optimization and the route choice of passengers in the available services of the railway transport network. We describe how passenger choice at stations along the route intertwines deeply with the problem of rescheduling trains over tracks and station resources in a very complicated setting that might not exhibit equilibrium points in general. Delaying trains and/or dropping passenger connections and/or giving particular route advice to passengers might influence the behavior of traffic controllers and passengers, determining a trade-off between the delays of trains, weighted by the passenger load, and the travel time of passengers. We study this problem with a game theoretical approach, focusing on the solutions corresponding to Nash equilibria of a game involving passengers and infrastructure managers. The proposed game theoretical approach is able to easily consider information and interdependence of the actions of multiple stakeholders. Computational results based on a real-world Dutch railway network quantify the trade-off between the minimization of train delays and passenger travel times and the performance, stability, and convergence of the equilibrium point given different algorithms and information available. The final aim of this work is to study the impact of effective implementations of railway traffic management and dissemination of information to passengers and operators.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider service applications where drivers serve subscription customers at their homes on a regular basis and at known times. To build trust with customers, the company requires that subscription customers are consistently served by the same driver. In addition to subscription customers, on-demand customers request delivery on a daily basis. For the company, the challenge is to consistently serve the subscription customers while simultaneously maximizing the daily profit from the on-demand customers. We model the problem as a two-stage stochastic decision problem. The first stage determines the assignment of drivers to subscription customers. The second stage is a team-orienteering problem with time windows and mandatory visits by fixed drivers. We present an anticipatory consistent customer assignment policy (ACCA) based on the multiple scenario approach framework. Our computational study shows that ACCA significantly outperforms consistency concepts from the literature, while increasing costs less than 5\%.},

The organizers of the challenge have proposed a real-world problem of inventory routing as a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. An exact method often fails to find a feasible solution to such problems. On the other hand, heuristics may be able to find a good quality solution that is significantly better than those produced by an expert human planner. There is a growing interest toward self-configuring automated general-purpose reusable heuristic approaches for combinatorial optimization. Hyper-heuristics have emerged as such methodologies. This paper investigates a new breed of hyper-heuristics based on the principles of sequence analysis to solve the inventory routing problem. The primary point of this work is that it shows the usefulness of the improved sequence-based selection hyper-heuristic, and in particular demonstrates the advantages of using a data science technique of hidden Markov model for the heuristic selection.},

The IRP-Challenge2016 seeks an optimal delivery schedule to minimize the unit distribution cost, while satisfying various hard constraints. It involves a single product, a heterogeneous fleet, heterogeneous drivers, multiperiods, a deterministic consumption forecast, and time-window constraints. We present a new mathematical formulation of the problem and introduce a matheuristic algorithm that integrates a local search-based metaheuristic with mathematical programming. Our algorithm combines mixed integer programming and linear programming as slave methods to optimize timing and delivery and embeds these procedures within a multineighborhood search metaheuristic to adjust routes. The method extends and enhances a preliminary version of our algorithm, which ranked third in the final round of the ROADEF/EURO Challenge 2016. Computational results for 20 challenge benchmark instances demonstrate the value of the proposed algorithm in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency with respect to the results reported in the competition.

  abstract     = {Dedicated algorithm and modeling improvements continue to advance the state of the art with respect to vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Despite these academic achievements, solving large VRP instances sufficiently fast for real-life applicability remains challenging. By exploiting VRP solution characteristics in an effective manner, this paper arrives at a powerful and fast optimization heuristic. Its primary contributions are threefold: a ruin method, a recreate method, and a fleet minimization procedure. The ruin method functions via adjacent string removal, introducing with it a novel property regarding vehicle routing problems that we term spatial slack , whereas the recreate method is categorized as greedy insertion with blinks. Combining these results in slack induction by string removals (SISRs), a powerful ruin and recreate approach. The fleet minimization procedure, meanwhile, introduces an absences-based acceptance criterion that serves as a complementary optimization component for when minimizing the number of vehicles constitutes the primary VRP objective. Together these three elements provide a suite of simple, powerful, and easily reproducible algorithmic methods that are successfully applied not only to the capacitated VRP but also to a wide range of related problems such as pickup and delivery problems and others that include time windows. SISRs serves to strip back the layers of complexity and specialization synonymous with the trend of algorithmic development throughout recent decades. Moreover, such simplicity and reproducibility are shown to not necessarily come at the expense of solution quality, with SISRs consistently outperforming alternative general approaches as well as dedicated single-purpose methods. Finally, aside from performance-related criteria, SISRs also serves to showcase a fresh perspective with respect to VRPs more generally, introducing a range of new terminology and procedures that, it is hoped, will invigorate further research and innovation.},

However, this assumption is violated in many applications arising in humanitarian and military logistics. This paper considers a joint vehicle and crew routing and scheduling problem in which crews are able to interchange vehicles, resulting in space and time interdependencies between vehicle routes and crew routes. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) model and a constraint programming (CP) model that overlay crew routing constraints over a standard vehicle routing problem. The constraint program uses a novel optimization constraint to detect infeasibility and to bound crew objectives. This paper also explores methods using large neighborhood search over the MIP and CP models. Experimental results indicate that modeling the vehicle and crew routing problems jointly and supporting vehicle interchanges for crews may bring significant benefits in cost reduction compared with a method that sequentializes these decisions.},

We propose a problem formulation that integrates service scheduling into the liner shipping network design problem. Furthermore, the model incorporates many industry-relevant modeling aspects: it allows for leg-based sailing speed optimization, it is not limited to simple or butterfly-type services, and it accounts for service-level requirements such as cargo transit time limits. The classic liner shipping network design problem is already a hard problem, and to solve the extended version, we propose a column-generation matheuristic that uses advanced linear programming techniques. The proposed method solves LINER-LIB instances of up to 114 ports and, if applied to the classic liner shipping network design problem, finds new best solutions to all instances, outperforming existing methods reported in the literature. Additionally, we analyze the relevance of scheduling for liner shipping network design. The results indicate that neglecting scheduling and approximating transshipments instead may result in the design of liner shipping networks that underestimate cargo transit times and their implications.},

  abstract     = {We address two shortcomings in online travel time estimation methods for congested urban traffic. The first shortcoming is related to the determination of the number of mixture modes, which can change dynamically within a day and from day to day. The second shortcoming is the widespread use of Gaussian probability densities as mixture components. Gaussian densities fail to capture the positive skew in travel time distributions, and consequently, large numbers of mixture components are needed for reasonable fitting accuracy when applied as mixture components. They also assign positive probabilities to negative travel times. To address these issues, this paper derives a mixture distribution with Gamma component densities, which are asymmetric and supported on the positive numbers. We use sparse estimation techniques to ensure parsimonious models and propose a generalization of Gamma mixture densities using Mittag–Leffler functions that provides enhanced fitting flexibility and improved parsimony. In order to accommodate within-day variability and allow for online implementation of the proposed methodology (i.e., fast computations on streaming travel time data), we introduce a recursive algorithm that efficiently updates the fitted distribution whenever new data become available. Experimental results using real-world travel time data illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.},

A daily activity–travel pattern is constructed from a sequence of decisions of when, where, why, and how to travel. Individuals’ preferences for activity–travel patterns are described by the sum of the utility of all travel and activity episodes in that pattern, but components of the utility functions, such as travel times, may be stochastic. In each decision stage, individuals act as if they maximized the expected utility of the remainder of the day. The DDCM-model presented allows for a detailed treatment of timing decision consistent with other choice dimensions, respects time–space constraints, and enables the inclusion of explicitly modeled uncertainties in, for example, travel time. In a case study, a model for daily planning of activity and travel on workdays is estimated whereby individuals can perform any number of trips that each is a combination of one of 1,240 locations, four modes, and six activities. Simulation results indicate that the model within sample accurately replicates timing decisions, trip lengths, and the distributions of the number of trips, tours, and trips per tour.},

  abstract     = {All existing day-to-day dynamics of departure time choice at a single bottleneck are unstable, and this has led to doubt over the existence of a stable user equilibrium in the real world. However, empirical observations and our personal driving experience suggest stable stationary congestion patterns during a peak period. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile the discrepancy by presenting a stable day-to-day dynamical system for drivers’ departure time choice at a single bottleneck. In our model, the decision variable in the execution stage is still drivers’ departure times on the next day, but in the planning stage before the execution stage, drivers determine their departure times in order to arrive at the destination at better times with lower scheduling costs. We first define within-day traffic dynamics with the point queue model, costs, the departure time user equilibrium (DTUE), and the arrival time user equilibrium (ATUE). We then identify three behavioral principles in the planning stage: (i) drivers choose their departure and arrival times in a backward fashion (backward choice principle); (ii) after choosing the arrival times, they update their departure times to balance the total costs (cost-balancing principle); (iii) they choose their arrival times to reduce their scheduling costs or gain their scheduling payoffs (scheduling cost–reducing or scheduling payoff–gaining principle). In this sense, drivers’ departure and arrival time choices are driven by their scheduling payoff choice. With a single tube or imaginary road model, we convert the nonlocal day-to-day arrival time shifting problem to a local scheduling payoff shifting problem. After introducing a new variable for the imaginary density, we apply the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards (LWR) model to describe the day-to-day dynamics of scheduling payoff choice and present splitting and cost-balancing schemes to determine arrival and departure flow rates accordingly. We define the scheduling payoff user equilibrium (SPUE) as the stationary state of the LWR model, formulate a new optimization problem for the SPUE, and prove the global stability of the SPUE and, therefore, ATUE and DTUE by using Lyapunov’s second method in which the objective function in the optimization formulation is the potential function. We also develop the corresponding discrete models for numerical solutions and use one numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the new day-to-day dynamical model. Different from existing ones, the new adjustment mechanism leads to stable day-to-day departure time choice dynamics by guaranteeing that drivers have better choices of departure/arrival times with larger scheduling payoffs on the next day, and such better choices are not over-chosen because of the constraint imposed by the single tube’s cross-section area, which is equal to the jam density in the LWR model. This study is the first step for understanding stable day-to-day dynamics for departure time choice, and many follow-up studies are possible and warranted.},

An integrated choice and latent variable model is adopted to explore the effects of three attitudinal and perceptual factors on bike- and car-sharing choices while simultaneously investigating the causes associated with each of the latent variables. A group of Chinese commuters’ stated preference mode choice data are collected. It is found that the probability to choose bike-sharing could be positively affected by “willingness to be a green traveler” and “satisfaction with cycling environment,” and car-sharing choice is positively correlated with “advocacy of car-sharing service.” By taking into account the interaction effects between the latent variables and travel time of the two services, a significant difference is discovered on the estimated value of travel time savings (VTTS) compared with other more restrictive model specifications. The finding highlights the importance to derive different VTTS for travelers with differentiated attitudes and perceptions as the tastes toward travel time spent could vary substantially. In other words, there would be different trade-off preferences across attitudinal groups, according to which transport service operators could customize their strategies on prices and levels of service offered.},

Viewed in isolation, this outcome would suggest that the events that produce aviation deaths are on the verge of extinction throughout the world. However, given the rarity of air disasters, year-to-year passenger death tolls are subject to considerable volatility. Here, we examine worldwide data about fatal aviation events on scheduled passenger flights for the decade 2008–2017 in conjunction with similar data for earlier decades. A major difference between this safety study and others is that we work with probabilistic models customized to aviation safety data, with the aim of distinguishing meaningful patterns from random fluctuations. We show that death risk per boarding over 2008–2017 fell by more than half compared with the previous decade, whereas the world’s nations continued to fall into three highly divergent risk categories. Major new developments in recent years include exceptionally strong safety achievements in China—which is slated to be the world’s largest aviation nation within five years—and the Eastern European members of the European Union—which had a fatality-free record in the last decade that constituted the Union’s strongest performance. A troubling aspect of the findings is that the less developed nations did not gain in aviation safety relative to other countries, despite having considerably more room for improvement.},

  abstract     = {A common strategy used by airlines to improve employee satisfaction is to create schedules that take into account crew preferences such as preferred legs or desired off-periods. Air crew scheduling usually involves two steps: the crew pairing problem (CPP) and the crew rostering problem (CRP). A pairing is a sequence of legs and deadheads separated by connections and rest periods that starts and ends at the same crew base and can legally be operated by a crew member. The CPP generates a set of pairings that covers every leg of a given schedule exactly once at a minimum cost. The CRP uses these pairings to create rosters composed of personalized schedules, with the goal of granting as many crew preferences as possible. A downside of this two-step approach is that the CPP does not take the crew preferences into account, resulting in CPP solutions that are often ill suited for the CRP. In this paper, we propose a new variant of the CPP, called the CPP with complex features (CPPCF), that considers the crew preferences in order to create pairings that are better suited for the CRP. Specifically, we identify six pairing features related to crew preferences that are beneficial for the CRP, and the objective function of the CPPCF rewards pairings that contain these features. We solve the CPPCF using a column generation algorithm in which new pairings are generated by solving subproblems consisting of constrained shortest path problems. For this purpose, we introduce a new type of path resources designed to handle complex features, and we adapt the dominance rules accordingly. We test the proposed CPPCF approach on seven real-world instances from a major North American airline and show that a combination of these features significantly improves the solutions of the CRP.},

  abstract     = {Congestion is a problem at airports where capacity does not meet demand. At many such airports, airlines must request time slots for the purpose of landing or take off. Given the imbalance between demand and capacity, slot requests cannot always be scheduled as requested. The difference between the requested and allocated time slots is called displacement. Minimization of the total displacement is a key slot-scheduling objective and expresses the efficiency of the slot-scheduling process. Additionally, fairness has been proposed as a slot-scheduling criterion. Fairness relates to the allocation of the total schedule displacement among the various airlines. Single- and multiobjective models have been proposed for slot scheduling. However, currently the literature lacks models that incorporate the preferences of airlines regarding the allocation of displacement to their flights. This paper proposes a two-stage mechanism for the scheduling of slots at congested airports. The proposed mechanism considers efficiency and fairness objectives and incorporates the preferences of airlines in allocating the total displacement associated with the flights of each airline. The first stage of the mechanism constructs a reference schedule that is fair to the participating airlines. In the second stage, the airlines specify how the displacement allocated to them in the reference schedule should be distributed among their requests. The mechanism then adjusts the fair reference schedule to meet as many of these preferences as possible. The development and implementation of the proposed slot-scheduling mechanism is demonstrated using real data from a coordinated airport and simulated displacement preference data. The proposed slot-scheduling mechanism provides useful information to decision makers regarding the equity–efficiency trade-off and enhances the transparency and acceptability of the slot-scheduling outcome.},

  abstract     = {Flight timetabling can greatly impact an airline’s operating profit, yet data-driven or model-based solutions to support it remain limited. Timetabling optimization is significantly complicated by two factors. First, it exhibits strong interdependencies with subsequent fleet assignment decisions of the airlines. Second, flights’ departure and arrival times are important determinants of passenger connection opportunities, of the attractiveness of each (nonstop or connecting) itinerary, and, in turn, of passengers’ booking decisions. Because of these complicating factors, most existing approaches rely on incremental timetabling. This paper introduces an original integrated optimization approach to comprehensive flight timetabling and fleet assignment under endogenous passenger choice. Passenger choice is captured by a discrete-choice generalized attraction model. The resulting optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. This paper also proposes an original multiphase solution approach, which effectively combines several heuristics, to optimize the network-wide timetable of a major airline within a realistic computational budget. Using case study data from Alaska Airlines, computational results suggest that the combination of this paper’s model formulation and solution approaches can result in significant profit improvements as compared with the most advanced incremental approaches to flight timetabling. Additional computational experiments based on several extensions also demonstrate the benefits of this modeling and computational framework to support various types of strategic airline decision making in the context of frequency planning, revenue management, and postmerger integration.},

The purpose of our tool is to find routes for the force elements involved in maritime surveillance operations, where the goal is to keep a maritime picture sufficiently updated. Our problem may be viewed as a variant of the classical periodic vehicle routing problem, but it differs from this problem in some major aspects. To cope with the specific issues of our problem, we introduce a novel time-indexed formulation, where each variable is associated with a set of contiguous time periods. We defined and implemented a branch-and-price procedure to solve this formulation to exact optimality. Moreover, to tackle instances of practical size, we defined and applied efficient and effective heuristic techniques for solving the pricing problem.

  abstract     = {We consider a road-ban problem in hazardous material (hazmat) transportation. We formulate the problem as a network design problem to select a set of closed road segments for hazmat traffic and obtain a bilevel optimization problem. While modeling probabilistic route choices of hazmat carriers by the random utility model (RUM) in the lower level, we consider a risk-averse measure called conditional value at risk (CVaR) in the upper level, instead of the widely used expected risk measure. Using the RUM and CVaR, we quantify the risk of having hazmat accidents and large consequences and design the network policy for road bans accordingly. Although CVaR has been used in hazmat routing problems, this paper is the first attempt to apply CVaR in risk averse hazmat network design problems considering stochastic route choices of hazmat carriers. The resulting problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, for which we devise a line search approach combined with Benders decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed computational method with case studies. The average computation time for a network with 105 nodes and 268 arcs is three hours. By applying CVaR to the route-choice behavior of hazmat carriers, we protect the road network from undesirable route choices that may lead to severe consequences. We define the value of RUM-CVaR solutions (VRCS) over the deterministic model based on shortest-path problems and the expected risk measure. Our case study shows that the VRCS can range from 4.9\% to 64.1\% depending on the probability threshold used in the CVaR measure.},

  abstract     = {We develop a numerical model using both artificial and empirical inputs to analyse taxi dynamics in an urban setting. More specifically, we quantify how the supply and demand for taxi services, the underlying road network, and the public acceptance of taxi ridesharing (TRS) affect the optimal number of taxis for a particular city and commuters’ average waiting time and trip time. Results reveal certain universal features of the taxi dynamics with real-time taxi booking: that there is a well-defined transition between the oversaturated phase when demand exceeds supply and the undersaturated phase when supply exceeds demand. The boundary between the two phases gives the optimal number of taxis a city should accommodate, given the specific demand, road network, and commuter habits. Adding or removing taxis may affect commuter experience very differently in the two phases revealed. In the oversaturated phase, the average waiting time is exponentially affected, whereas in the undersaturated phase it is affected sublinearly. We analyse various factors that can shift the phase boundary and show that an increased level of acceptance for TRS universally shifts the phase boundary by reducing the number of taxis needed. We discuss some of the useful insights for the benefits and costs of TRS, especially how, under certain situations, TRS not only economically benefits commuters but can also save the shared parties in overall travel time by significantly reducing the time commuters spend on waiting for taxis. Simulations also suggest that elementary artificial taxi systems can capture most of the universal features of the taxi dynamics. We give detailed methodologies of the microscopic simulations we employed. The relevance of the assumptions and the overall methodology are also illustrated using comprehensive empirical road network and taxi demand in the city-state of Singapore.},

  abstract     = {Recent scholars have developed a number of stochastic car-following models that have successfully captured driver behavior uncertainties and reproduced stochastic traffic oscillation propagation. Whereas elegant frequency domain analytical methods are available for stability analysis of classic deterministic linear car-following models, there lacks an analytical method for quantifying the stability performance of their peer stochastic models and theoretically proving oscillation features observed in the real world. To fill this methodological gap, this study proposes a novel analytical method that measures traffic oscillation magnitudes and reveals oscillation characteristics of stochastic linear car-following models. We investigate a general class of stochastic linear car-following models that contain a linear car-following model and a stochastic noise term. Based on frequency domain analysis tools (e.g., Z -transform) and stochastic process theories, we propose analytical formulations for quantifying the expected speed variances of a stream of vehicles following one another according to one such stochastic car-following model, where the lead vehicle is subject to certain random perturbations. Our analysis on the homogeneous case (where all vehicles are identical) reveals two significant phenomena consistent with recent observations of traffic oscillation growth patterns from field experimental data: A linear stochastic car-following model with common parameter settings yields (i) concave growth of the speed oscillation magnitudes and (ii) reduction of oscillation frequency as oscillation propagates upstream. Numerical studies verify the universal soundness of the proposed analytical approach for both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic scenarios, and both asymptotically stable and unstable underlying systems, as well as draw insights into traffic oscillation properties of a number of commonly used car-following models. Overall, the proposed method, as a stochastic peer, complements the traditional frequency-domain analysis method for deterministic car-following models and can be potentially used to investigate stability responses and mitigate traffic oscillation for various car-following behaviors with stochastic components.},
