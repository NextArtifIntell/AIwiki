  abstract     = {The drift method was recently developed to study queuing systems in steady state. It was used successfully to obtain bounds on the moments of the scaled queue lengths that are asymptotically tight in heavy traffic and in a wide variety of systems, including generalized switches, input-queued switches, bandwidth-sharing networks, and so on. In this paper, we develop the use of transform techniques for heavy-traffic analysis, with a special focus on the use of moment-generating functions. This approach simplifies the proofs of the drift method and provides a new perspective on the drift method. We present a general framework and then use the moment-generating function method to obtain the stationary distribution of scaled queue lengths in heavy traffic in queuing systems that satisfy the complete resource pooling condition. In particular, we study load balancing systems and generalized switches under general settings.},

  abstract     = {We consider a queue to which only a finite pool of n customers can arrive, at times depending on their service requirement. A customer with stochastic service requirement S arrives to the queue after an exponentially distributed time with mean S -α for some α ∈ [ 0,1 ] ; therefore, larger service requirements trigger customers to join earlier. This finite-pool queue interpolates between two previously studied cases: α = 0 gives the so-called Δ ( i ) / G / 1 queue and α = 1 is closely related to the exploration process for inhomogeneous random graphs. We consider the asymptotic regime in which the pool size n grows to infinity and establish that the scaled queue-length process converges to a diffusion process with a negative quadratic drift. We leverage this asymptotic result to characterize the head start that is needed to create a long period of activity. We also describe how this first busy period of the queue gives rise to a critically connected random forest.},

  abstract     = {Probability distributions over rankings are crucial for the modeling and design of a wide range of practical systems. In this work, we pursue a nonparametric approach that seeks to learn a distribution over rankings (aka the ranking model) that is consistent with the observed data and has the sparsest possible support (i.e., the smallest number of rankings with nonzero probability mass). We focus on first-order marginal data, which comprise information on the probability that item i is ranked at position j , for all possible item and position pairs. The observed data may be noisy. Finding the sparsest approximation requires brute force search in the worst case. To address this issue, we restrict our search to, what we dub, the signature family, and show that the sparsest model within the signature family can be found computationally efficiently compared with the brute force approach. We then establish that the signature family provides good approximations to popular ranking model classes, such as the multinomial logit and the exponential family classes, with support size that is small relative to the dimension of the observed data. We test our methods on two data sets: the ranked election data set from the American Psychological Association and the preference ordering data on 10 different sushi varieties.},

We study the design of easily implementable, static group testing schemes that take into account operational constraints, heterogeneous populations, and uncertainty in subject risk, while considering classification accuracy- and robustness-based objectives. We derive key structural properties of optimal risk-based designs and show that the problem can be formulated as network flow problems. Our reformulation involves computationally expensive high-dimensional integrals. We develop an analytical expression that eliminates the need to compute high-dimensional integrals, drastically improving the tractability of constructing the underlying network. We demonstrate the impact through a case study on chlamydia screening, which leads to the following insights: (1) Risk-based designs are shown to be less expensive, more accurate, and more robust than current practices. (2) The performance of static risk-based schemes comprised of only two group sizes is comparable to those comprised of many group sizes. (3) Static risk-based schemes are an effective alternative to more complicated dynamic schemes. (4) An expectation-based formulation captures almost all benefits of a static risk-based scheme.},

To do so, we focus on minimizing the number of voters needed for each assessment, subject to service-level constraints, which depends on a voting aggregation rule. We focus our attention on classes of voting aggregators that are simple, interpretable, and implementable, which increases the chance of adoption in practice. We consider static and dynamic variants of simple majority-rule voting, with which each vote is treated equally. We also study static and dynamic variants of a more sophisticated voting rule that allows more accurate voters to have a larger influence in determining the aggregate decision. We consider both independent and correlated voters and show that correlation is detrimental to performance. Finally, we take a system view and characterize the limit of a costless crowdvoting system that relies solely on volunteer voters. If this limit does not satisfy target service levels, then costly firm employees are needed to supplement the crowd.},

  abstract     = {This work concerns the asymptotic behavior of solutions to a (strictly) subcritical fluid model for a data communication network, where file sizes are generally distributed and the network operates under a fair bandwidth-sharing policy. Here we consider fair bandwidth-sharing policies that are a slight generalization of the α -fair policies introduced by Mo and Walrand [Mo J, Walrand J (2000) Fair end-to-end window-based congestion control. IEEE/ACM Trans. Networks 8(5):556–567.]. Since the year 2000, it has been a standing problem to prove stability of the data communications network model of Massoulié and Roberts [Massoulié L, Roberts J (2000) Bandwidth sharing and admission control for elastic traffic. Telecommunication Systems 15(1):185–201.], with general file sizes and operating under fair bandwidth sharing policies, when the offered load is less than capacity (subcritical conditions). A crucial step in an approach to this problem is to prove stability of subcritical fluid model solutions. In 2012, Paganini et al. [Paganini F, Tang A, Ferragut A, Andrew LLH (2012) Network stability under alpha fair bandwidth allocation with general file size distribution. IEEE Trans. Automatic Control 57(3):579–591.] introduced a Lyapunov function for this purpose and gave an argument, assuming that fluid model solutions are sufficiently smooth in time and space that they are strong solutions of a partial differential equation and assuming that no fluid level on any route touches zero before all route levels reach zero. The aim of the current paper is to prove stability of the subcritical fluid model without these strong assumptions. Starting with a slight generalization of the Lyapunov function proposed by Paganini et al., assuming that each component of the initial state of a measure-valued fluid model solution, as well as the file size distributions, have no atoms and have finite first moments, we prove absolute continuity in time of the composition of the Lyapunov function with any subcritical fluid model solution and describe the associated density. We use this to prove that the Lyapunov function composed with such a subcritical fluid model solution converges to zero as time goes to infinity. This implies that each component of the measure-valued fluid model solution converges vaguely on ( 0 , ∞ ) to the zero measure as time goes to infinity. Under the further assumption that the file size distributions have finite p th moments for some p &gt; 1 and that each component of the initial state of the fluid model solution has finite p th moment, it is proved that the fluid model solution reaches the measure with all components equal to the zero measure in finite time and that the time to reach this zero state has a uniform bound for all fluid model solutions having a uniform bound on the initial total mass and the p th moment of each component of the initial state. In contrast to the analysis of Paganini et al., we do not need their strong smoothness assumptions on fluid model solutions and we rigorously treat the realistic, but singular situation, where the fluid level on some routes becomes zero, whereas other route levels remain positive.},

We prove a functional weak law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem for this shot noise process in an asymptotic regime with a high intensity of shots. The deterministic fluid limit is unaffected by the presence of weak dependence. The limit in the diffusion scale is a continuous Gaussian process whose covariance function explicitly captures the dependence among the noises. The model and results can be applied in financial and insurance risks with dependent claims as well as queueing systems with dependent service times. To prove the existence of the limit process, we employ the existence criterion that uses a maximal inequality requiring a set function with a superadditivity property. We identify such a set function for the limit process by exploiting the ρ -mixing condition. To prove the weak convergence, we establish the tightness property and the convergence of finite dimensional distributions. To prove tightness, we construct two auxiliary processes and apply an Ottaviani-type inequality for weakly dependent sequences.},

Much effort has been previously made to design policies that use limited state information (e.g., the queue lengths in a small subset of the set of servers, or the identity of the idle servers). However, existing policies either do not achieve the stability region or perform poorly in terms of job completion time. We introduce Persistent-Idle (PI), a new, perhaps counterintuitive, load-distribution policy that is designed to work with limited state information. Roughly speaking, PI always routes to the server that has last been idle. Our main result is that this policy achieves the stability region. Because it operates quite differently from existing policies, our proof method differs from standard arguments in the literature. Specifically, large time properties of reflected random walk, along with a careful choice of a Lyapunov function, are combined to obtain a Lyapunov condition over sufficiently long-time intervals. We also provide simulation results that indicate that job completion times under PI are low for different choices of system parameters, compared with several state-of-the-art load-distribution schemes.},

These decisions affect the overall number of customers matched, because they impact whether future available drivers will be close to the locations of arriving customers. A common policy used in practice is the closest driver policy, which offers an arriving customer the closest driver. This is an attractive policy because it is simple and easy to implement. However, we expect that parameter-based policies can achieve better performance. We propose matching policies based on a continuous linear program (CLP) that accounts for (i) the differing arrival rates of customers and drivers in different areas of the city, (ii) how long customers are willing to wait for driver pickup, (iii) how long drivers are willing to wait for a customer, and (iv) the time-varying nature of all the aforementioned parameters. We prove asymptotic optimality of a forward-looking CLP-based policy in a large market regime and of a myopic linear program–based matching policy when drivers are fully utilized. When pricing affects customer and driver arrival rates and parameters are time homogeneous, we show that asymptotically optimal joint pricing and matching decisions lead to fully utilized drivers under mild conditions.},
