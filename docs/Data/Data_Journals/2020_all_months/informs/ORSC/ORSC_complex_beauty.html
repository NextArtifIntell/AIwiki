We examine how these suppliers create and use soft power to manage the opportunities and challenges they encounter trying to maintain their positions in large buyers’ supply chains. We find that these easily substitutable firms use a variety of information sources to identify and make themselves cognitively central to individuals inside and outside the buyer organizations who can serve as functional and political influencers. They then employ these influencers to affect the buyer’s decisions when their position in the supply chain is threatened, largely without the buyer noticing. Our study contributes to the literatures on the use of soft power buyer-supplier power relationships and supplier diversity.},

  abstract     = {Viewing entrepreneurship as a form of collective action, this paper investigates the tension between an entrepreneurial team’s reliance on collective efforts for achieving success and individual members’ tendencies to withhold their personal resources. We argue that the precarious nature of the early founding stage and the difficulty of redeploying some resources for other uses amplify the risk of early-stage resource contributions and may lead to team members withholding resources or even free riding. Two conditions may help overcome such collective action problems: adopting a formal contract to specify rewards and sanctions and encouraging reciprocal exchange among team members through the lead entrepreneur’s voluntary contributions. Analyzing a nationally representative multiwave panel study of entrepreneurial teams in the United States, we show that early-stage team members are reluctant to provide resources tailored to the business, even though such resources are critical to venture survival. We find that presigned formal contracts and founding entrepreneurs’ initial contributions make members’ contributions of such resources much more likely. Lead entrepreneurs’ voluntary contributions to their businesses, signified by their provision of resources that impose high risks on themselves but increase the viability of the business, help mitigate collective action problems within entrepreneurial teams.},

Building on the literature on cultural entrepreneurship, we theorize how foreign-listed firms engage in global framing in tailoring the description of their new governance practice to the host country investors. Our empirical study examines the relative emphasis of monitoring over resource-providing roles by the U.S.-listed Chinese companies’ independent directors when their roles are understood differently in the home and host countries. Our study finds that exposure to the alternative cultural repertoire of a host country via overseas education of board members and foreign institutional ownership enhance a firm’s organizational resources available to engage in global framing. The likelihood of global framing, however, is constrained by the home country’s institutional environment, which is characterized by local business history and connections to strong local resource providers such as the state. We also find that the effectiveness of global framing to obtain investor recognition in the host country is restricted when the company lacks the capacity to implement the declared role of independent director-as-monitor in its home country.},

  abstract     = {Novel external partnerships are valuable but risky, and scholars have examined the organization- and individual-level determinants of firms’ decisions to pursue these new relationships. Yet, in organizations performing complex and knowledge-intensive work, decisions about interorganizational relationships are often made within teams. We characterize these decisions as a two-stage process in which a team member proposes a partner and other team members respond, supporting or challenging the proposal. As novel partnerships are risky, and power is a key determinant of risk-taking propensity, we argue that the power of team members—both those who initiate proposals and those who respond—will shape the likelihood that the team will pursue a novel external partnership. Using personnel data from project teams in an automated equipment design and build firm, we find that the effect of power on the likelihood of novel partner adoption depends on both the type of power and the role of the person in the decision process. Novel partner selection is more likely when those initiating proposals hold formal structural power but less likely when initiators hold informal power. Both the formal and informal power of the initiator’s teammates attenuate the effect of initiator power, such that the more power one’s teammates have, the less one’s own power will affect the likelihood of novel external partner selection. Finally, we provide evidence that these effects on likelihood of novel partner adoption are as materially consequential for project outcomes as other strategic choices available to project teams. These findings have implications for the intraorganizational determinants of interorganizational networks.},

  abstract     = {A key assumption in past literature has been that human services workers become emotionally distant from their charges (such as clients or patients). Such distancing is said to protect workers from the emotionally draining aspects of the job but creates challenges to feeling and behaving compassionately. Because little is known about when and how compassion occurs under these circumstances, we conducted a multiphased qualitative study of 119 correctional officers in the United States using interviews and observations. Officers’ accounts and our observations of their interactions with inmates included cruel, disciplinary, unemotional, and compassionate treatment. Such treatment varied by the situations that officers faced, and compassion was surprisingly common when inmates were misbehaving—challenging current understanding of the occurrence of compassion at work. Examining officers’ accounts more closely, we uncovered a novel way that we theorize human services workers can be compassionate, even under such difficult circumstances. We find that officers describe engaging in practices in which they (a) relate to others by leveling group-based differences between themselves and their charges and (b) engage in self-protection by shielding themselves from the negative emotions triggered by their charges. We posit that the combined use of such practices offsets different emotional tensions in the work, rather than only providing emotional distance, and in doing so, can foster compassionate treatment under some of the most trying situations and organizational barriers to compassion.},

Discovering new opportunities requires speed and flexibility, and although many discoveries are easy to implement, this makes them easy to imitate. By comparison, creation is more complex, iterative, and cumulative, making these opportunities slower to implement yet harder to copy. In formal simulation modeling and analyses of the U.S. Compustat population from 1966 to 2015, we found a bimodal pattern of entry into golden eras of sustained superiority. One peak consisted of an initial spike as firms went public, and evidence suggests this was driven by entrepreneurial discovery. The other peak involved a long-term inverted U-shaped trajectory that reached its high point about 17 years later. Evidence suggests this was driven by entrepreneurial creation, which first enabled then later constrained durable superiority. Our results have implications for research on sustained superiority, entrepreneurial opportunities, and strategic renewal.},

  abstract     = {Becoming a manager is generally seen as a highly coveted step up the career ladder that corresponds to a gain in responsibility. There is evidence, however, that some individuals experience “managerial blues,” or disenchantment with their managerial jobs after being promoted. Although past scholarship points to individual differences (such as skills inadequacy) or the promotion circumstances (such as involuntary) as possible explanations for such blues, less is known as to how the expectations that people carry with them from past jobs—such as expectations about what responsibility entails—may shape their first managerial experience. To answer this question, we compare the experiences of supervisors coming from different jobs—that is, former Paris subway drivers (working independently and impacting the lives of others) and station agents (working interdependently with limited impact on others’ lives)—that left them with distinct sets of expectations around responsibility. Drawing on interviews and observations, we find that former drivers developed a deep sense of “personal” responsibility. After promotion, their perceived managerial responsibility paled in comparison with their expectations of what it felt like to have personal responsibility, leading the majority to experience managerial blues. In contrast, former agents had few expectations of what responsibility entailed and reported no disenchantment once they joined the managerial ranks. Overall, we show how imprinted expectations shape people’s future managerial experiences, including their managerial blues, and discuss the implications of our findings for literatures on job mobility and job design.},

First, human capital theory predicts that internal hires will be immediately more productive than external hires. Second, contextual learning predicts that internal hires will be more productive with time. Finally, theories of commitment, which are rarely applied to this literature, predict that internal advancement enhances retention among high performers (“positive retention”). Applying a general empirical framework for quantifying the relative contributions of these mechanisms to a retailer with 109,063 commissioned salespeople and their 12,931 managers, we find that the gap in our setting is primarily driven by positive retention: High performers and internal hires are less likely to quit, and crucially, high-performing internal hires are especially unlikely to quit. When high-performing internal hires do quit, they tend to cite reasons unrelated to work rather than advancement opportunities. By typically examining performance and retention in isolation, researchers and organizations may be underestimating the importance of internal advancement as a means of retaining of high performers.},

Drawing on social interdependence theory along with insights from social exchange and psychological ownership theories, we propose that the use of broad-based stock options granted to at least half the workforce creates the conditions supporting a positive relationship between workforce racial diversity and firm outcomes. We examine this proposition by analyzing panel data from 155 companies that applied for the “100 Best Companies to Work For” competition with responses from 109,314 employees over the five-year period from 2006 to 2010 (354 company-year observations). Findings revealed that racial diversity was positively related to subsequent firm financial performance and individual affective commitment and was not significantly associated with subsequent voluntary turnover rates, when accompanied by a firm’s adoption of broad-based stock options. However, under the nonuse of broad-based stock options, racial diversity was significantly related to higher voluntary turnover rates and lower employee affective commitment, with no financial performance gains. By documenting the beneficial effects of financial incentives in diverse workplaces, this paper extends theory asserting the value of incentives for performance.},

These effects have a multiplicative impact on innovative productivity when inventors who are core in the informal knowledge-sharing network are also affiliated with a core organizational unit.

Owing to limited educational and employment opportunities, poverty, and discrimination, these entrepreneurs frequently experience low business growth and performance. What factors influence the effectiveness of early-stage venture incubation and mentoring for promoting learning, scaling, and profitability among these entrepreneurs? Two studies in a business incubator serving low-income, underprivileged entrepreneurs in South Africa evaluate this question. Study 1 uses a matched, two-period case-control design to investigate the effects of incubation on business growth by comparing selected and incubated companies to similar also-selected but not incubated ones. The findings show that incubated companies grew 22\% more in revenue and 15\% more in employment than not incubated companies over the six months between applying to and graduating from the incubator. Study 2 uses instrumental-variable models to evaluate the role that mentoring played in improving business performance by analyzing data from seven cohorts of participants in the incubator randomly assigned to mentors. The findings show that participants assigned to high-ability (versus low-ability) mentors had 3.2\% higher revenue and 3.5\% higher profits one year after incubation. Further, the benefits of being mentored were more significant for businesses whose entrepreneurs had less pre-entry knowledge and experience, suggesting that mentoring supplemented gaps in human capital. These findings have implications for ways to support disadvantaged entrepreneurs and their businesses through mentoring and early-stage venture incubation.},

To do so, we draw on an ethnography of a social venture where the entrepreneurs left soon after founding. In examining how an initial organizational imprint evolves beyond a venture’s founding phase, we focus on the actions and interactions of organizational members, the founders’ imprint, the venture’s new leadership, and the external environment. The process model we develop shows how the organizational imprint evolves as a consequence of the interplay between top-down and bottom-up forces. We first find that the initial imprint is transmitted through a bottom-up mechanism of imprint reinforcement , and second, that the venture is reimprinted after the founding period through two processes which we call imprint reforming and imprint coupling . The result of this is the formation of a sedimented imprint . Our findings further illuminate that, although the initial imprint sticks, its function and manifestation changes over time.},

We conceptualize specialists as those who concentrate on a particular component of an organization’s task, whereas generalists perform all components of the task. As such, a specialist must coordinate with other group members to complete the group’s task, which makes a specialist more interdependent with other members and in possession of more organization-specific knowledge than a generalist. We predict that (1) groups receiving specialist new members do not perform as well after the new member joins as compared with groups receiving generalist new members and (2) groups with new members whose work experience and recipient group structure are aligned (i.e., generalist movers into generalist groups and specialist movers into specialist groups) perform better than groups with new members whose experience and recipient group structure are not aligned. We test our hypotheses using a laboratory study in which we manipulate the extent to which new members and incumbent members of recipient groups work as specialists or generalists. Participants work as generalists or specialists in three-person groups and receive a new member who acquired experience as a specialist or generalist in another group. We find support for our hypotheses and provide evidence on mechanisms through which potential new members’ backgrounds enable them to contribute significantly to their recipient groups. New members who acquire experience in a structure similar to that of their recipient organizations report that they experience greater fit with their new groups, which enables their recipient groups to perform better than groups where new members’ experience and recipient group structure are not aligned. Additionally, our results suggest generalists may be more likely than specialists to transfer knowledge to their new groups.},

  abstract     = {Several case studies suggest that firms targeting mass market services can align profitability with jobs offering a living wage, stable schedules, and engaging work. Yet, few do. To understand this puzzle, we draw on theories of firms as systems of interdependent choices. Building on a few cases, we map the processes connecting managerial choice to performance and formalize the resulting performance landscape. In a strategy space defined by two dimensions—task richness and compensation—two local profitability peaks emerge: one with low compensation and low task richness and one with high compensation and high task richness. The bimodal landscape results from complementarity among choices and is robust when the strategy space is expanded from two to six dimensions and under many alternative parameterizations. Exploring how firms discover, move to, and remain at the high-compensation–high-task richness peak, we find three challenges to this strategy: (a) contextuality —adoption, imitation, and replication are harder for strategies that rely on interdependences among components and thus, require significant customization for each context; (b) temporal complexity —strategies depending on long-term and synergistic investments and slow-moving reinforcing feedbacks are hard to learn owing to misleading performance feedback; and (c) variable demand with no inventory buffers —efforts to adjust labor supply to highly variable demand in services often lead to unstable schedules given with short notice that drive quality employees away and compromise the strategy. These mechanisms can undermine promising strategies even if the actual performance landscape includes a small number of local peaks.},

In response to losing competitiveness, lagging firms must release obsolete resources and increase experimentation with new resources. Limiting the pace and efficiency at which they can do so impedes their ability to innovate and challenge leading firms. I explore these ideas empirically by exploiting the staggered adoption of employment protection laws. Employment protection indeed reduces innovation by lagging firms, driven by a decrease in radical innovations. In contrast, I find a small yet positive effect on leading firms in low-velocity sectors, which prioritize the efficient use of existing resources. This study extends the prior contingency approach based on industry and task characteristics to incorporate a firm’s competitive position and provides a much more dynamic account of when and how firms experiment with new inventors, resources, and radical innovations.},

  abstract     = {Over the past two decades, organizations have established sanctioning systems as an important component of their ethical infrastructures to detect and punish wrongdoing. However, empirical knowledge about the overall effectiveness of such systems remains limited. Existing studies have mostly adopted a single-party perspective even though many wrongdoing situations involve dynamic multiparty interactions between actors, recipients, and observers of wrongdoing. Moreover, most existing research has emphasized an economic perspective—that sanctioning systems only affect behavior because of economic considerations while crowding out ethical ones. In this research, we develop a moral and normative perspective of sanctioning systems. Using a novel experimental game design, our study focuses on the investigative dimension of sanctioning systems to examine their psychological and behavioral effects in actor–recipient–observer wrongdoing interactions . Findings reveal that investigative sanctioning systems influence wrongdoing, reporting, and helping behaviors as well as alter ethical and normative considerations, such that as systems become stronger, wrongdoing behaviors are judged as more unethical and perceived as less typical than when weaker systems are in place. These moral judgments and norm perceptions mediate the effect of investigative sanctioning system strength on wrongdoing behavior. Our research extends previous empirical and theoretical work on sanctioning systems by applying a more holistic perspective and by demonstrating that highly effective systems can serve as important behavioral guides because they activate and alter moral and normative considerations about wrongdoing.},

We conceptualize three types of leadership risk perceptions (interpersonal, image, and instrumental) and investigate how changes in these risk perceptions over time impact the overall level of informal leadership that individuals contribute in their teams, as well as how these risk perceptions’ change trajectories are shaped by the level of conflict in a team. To address these issues, we conducted a series of studies, exploring the relevance of the three risk perceptions qualitatively, developing measures for them, and then testing our hypotheses in a field study following 454 individuals working in 89 master of business administration (MBA) consulting teams. We found that a decrease in an individual’s leadership risk perceptions over time was related to the individual’s overall informal leadership contributions in the team, though the pattern of relationship was not the same for all three risk perceptions. Furthermore, in teams with higher levels of relationship conflict, interpersonal and image risk perceptions decreased less over time, suggesting the importance of the social context in shaping perceived risks. Overall, this research calls attention to the much under-investigated risky side of leadership and highlights a temporal approach to understanding the impact of leadership risk perceptions.},

This study applies a neo-Penrosian perspective to transaction costs, with the notion that diversification may be driven by the redeployment of non-scale-free resources. An empirical analysis, using tax changes in the drink sector as a measure of exogenous demand variation, offers results consistent with the prediction that redeployment is particularly relevant when retailing is concentrated and single-product competition within a focal product niche (e.g., beer) is fragmented. This study also measures redeployment across a portfolio of a multiniche firm when changes in its sales-growth rates for a particular product niche might imply contrasting changes in other product niches. The resulting evidence is consistent with predictions that demand uncertainty, and transaction costs create viable redeployment opportunities for multiniche companies.},

  abstract     = {When outsourcing design tasks, firms want their suppliers to be both efficient and adaptive. Whereas efficiency is necessary to reap economic gains from outsourcing, adaptation is required to deal with interdependencies as the design evolves. Achieving both objectives simultaneously, however, is difficult because procurement contracts require a trade-off between providing incentives for efficiency and facilitating adaptation. In the presence of formal contracts that provide strong incentives for efficiency, ensuring adaptation thus requires effective relational contracts between the buyer and the supplier. But because the focus of prior research has been on dyadic buyer–supplier relationships, it is unclear how the efficiency–adaptation trade-off can be mitigated in the multitier supplier systems that are common in many industries. Addressing this gap, we argue that in hierarchical supplier systems, relational contracts between contractual partners become more important, but at the same time harder to establish, than in single-tier supplier systems. An in-depth case study of the adaptive frictions that arose in the Airbus A350 program allows us to illustrate this challenge of tiered outsourcing. Moreover, we show how Airbus came to resolve the frictions by leveraging skip-level ties—direct informal contacts to lower-level suppliers with which no contractual relationship existed, thus replacing the archetypal notion of a supplier hierarchy by a more complex relationship structure. We discuss the boundary conditions of our findings and suggest propositions for the emergence of skip-level ties in tiered outsourcing.},

  abstract     = {A long-standing question in the organizations literature is whether firms are better off by using simple or complex representations of their task environment. We address this question by developing a formal model of how firm performance depends on the process by which firms learn and use representations. Building on ideas from cognitive science, our model conceptualizes this process in terms of how firms construct a representation of the environment and then use that representation when making decisions. Our model identifies the optimal level of representational complexity as a function of (a) the environment’s complexity and uncertainty and (b) the firm’s experience and knowledge about the environment’s deep structure. We use this model to delineate the conditions under which firms should use simple versus complex representations; in doing so, we provide a coherent framework that integrates previous conflicting results on which type of representation leaves firms better off. Among other results, we show that the optimal representational complexity generally depends more on the firm’s knowledge about the environment than it does on the environment’s actual complexity. We also show that the relative advantage of heuristics vis-à-vis more complex representations critically depends on an unstated assumption of “informedness”: that managers can know what are the most relevant variables to pay attention to. We show that when this assumption does not hold, complex representations are usually better than simpler ones.},

Our study makes three significant theoretical contributions: First, by illustrating the ways and means by which employees take on different national identities to construct diverse and often contradictory resistant identities to their expected dual organizational identity, we highlight the changeable nature of national identity. Second, this study contributes to our understanding of contextual constituents that shape individuals’ identity-related resistance. By unraveling employees’ various resistance forms, we show how resistance dynamically takes on assorted manifestations according to the organizational level in which it occurs and the managerial demands being resisted.

Building on a 25-month field study of the da Vinci robot, an endoscopic system for minimally invasive surgery, we bring to the fore the role of the body in how coordination was reconfigured in response to a change in technological mediation. Using the robot, surgeons experienced both an augmentation and a reduction of what they can do with their bodies in terms of haptic, visual, and auditory perception and manipulative dexterity. These bodily augmentations and reductions affected joint task performance and led to coordinative adaptations (e.g., spatial relocating, redistributing tasks, accommodating novel perceptual dependencies, and mounting novel responses) that, over time, resulted in reconfiguration of roles, including expanded occupational knowledge, emergence of new specializations, and shifts in status and boundaries. By emphasizing the importance of the body in coordination, this paper suggests that an embodiment perspective is important for explaining how and why coordination evolves following the introduction of a new technology.},

Our paper highlights a second mechanism that we argue is especially relevant in cultural markets: how a new entrant&#39;s perceived distinctiveness varies based on its affiliations. Leveraging data on music concerts, interviews of musicians, and biographical and genre information from archival sources, we investigate the effects of early affiliations for 1,385 bands formed between 2000 and 2005. In particular, we consider whether a new band benefits from appearing with a high-status act. If the main value is signaling, then a newcomer would be better off opening for high status bands, because doing so maximizes both legitimacy and exposure. However, in such conditions entrants run the risk of not being allocated enough attention, and thus not being seen as sufficiently distinctive. While the literature typically emphasizes the positive role of signaling, we find that our results more strongly support the notion of distinctiveness: new bands that frequently appeared with high-status artists made less money and were more likely to subsequently dissolve. This suggests that social network approaches to cultural markets need to better incorporate how network position affects a newcomer&#39;s opportunity to be recognized as distinctive.},

We suggest that the dynamic structure of social networks and organizational vocabularies is contingent on the formal design of organizational subunits. Within subunit boundaries, members who interact with each other are more likely to develop similar vocabularies over time. Interestingly, between subunits, the more two members share similar organizational vocabularies, the more likely they are to form a tie over time. We find empirical evidence for these arguments in a longitudinal study conducted among the managers of a multiunit organization.

  abstract     = {Studies have demonstrated that foreign firms locate where immigrants from their home countries reside and have suggested that doing so can improve performance. We argue that to properly assess how immigrants impact the performance of co-national firms, research must account for heterogeneity in how independent foreign firms (owned by individual foreigners) versus multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries (owned by a foreign corporate parent) benefit from immigrant communities. Independent firms have a greater need for resources from the immigrant community and depend more on their individual managers’ personal connections within the community to obtain such resources. Subsidiaries of MNCs can instead rely on the impersonal organizational resources of their parent firm (e.g., brand, reputation, channels) to access valuable immigrant community resources. Using data on foreign firms in Russia during 2006–2011, we find that immigrants improve the profitability of co-national independent firms only if they are managed by immigrant chief executive officers (CEOs), whereas co-national MNC subsidiaries profit from immigrants regardless of their CEOs’ nationality.

  abstract     = {Early-stage experiments are central to the design-thinking approach to organizational innovation, and they are also a core practice in evidence-based management. Organizations use experiments to test new strategies in a low-stakes setting before escalating their commitment to a new initiative. Yet organizations also use experiments to evaluate managers who will implement these strategies in a high-stakes setting. I develop a formal model to demonstrate that these two types of evaluations are fundamentally incompatible. Managers who fear replacement in response to a poor experimental outcome pervert their experiments to maximize the likelihood that they succeed. This saps early experiments of much of their informational value. I show that if an organization can observe a manager&#39;s experimental strategies and the experiment’s outcomes and can commit ahead of time to an evaluation and replacement rubric, then it can resolve this agency problem. However, if a manager&#39;s experimental strategy cannot be credibly communicated, the organization will either replace good managers to induce a desirable experimental strategy or retain bad managers to alleviate the fear of replacement. I show that in low-uncertainty environments, the control exerted by the former replacement regime offers the best results, whereas, in high-uncertainty environments, commitment to retention regardless of experimental outcomes is best.},

By drawing on a longitudinal case analysis of strategic change in a Nordic city organization, we show how the proponents and challengers play a “rhetorical game” in which they simultaneously promote their own value-based interests and ideas and seek ways to enable change. In particular, we identify a pattern in which the discussion moved from initial contestation through gradual convergence to increasing agreement. In addition, we elaborate on four rhetorical practices used in this rhetorical game: voicing own arguments, appropriation of others’ arguments, consensus argumentation, and collective we argumentation. By so doing, our study contributes to research on strategic change in pluralistic organizations by offering a nuanced account of the use of rhetoric when moving from contestation to convergence and partial agreement. Furthermore, by detailing specific types of rhetorical practices that play a crucial role in strategy making, our study advances research on the role of rhetoric in strategy process and practice research more generally.},

By drawing on discursive incongruity theory, we examine the use of irony when managers are confronted with controversial issues in a multinational company. As a result, we identify and elaborate on four distinctively different pathways of how irony helps participants to move on: ‘acquiescing’ (framing understanding as having no alternative because of environmental constraints), ‘empowering’ (synthesizing a view through broad inputs from different individuals), ‘channelling’ (subsuming other interpretations under a single and often dominant view) and ‘dismissing’ (rejecting alternative interpretations and often reinforcing the status quo). On this basis, we develop a theoretical model that elucidates the process dynamics in dealing with and moving on with controversial issues and elaborates the specific characteristics of each of these four pathways. Our analysis also leads to a fuller understanding of the discursive underpinnings and intersubjective dynamics in irony use in organizations.},

  abstract     = {This research addresses the important question of how organizations can use financial incentives to influence the work tasks of their professional workforce—a constituency that is notoriously difficult to manage because of their specialized knowledge, considerable autonomy, strong socialization, and powerful professional norms. In particular, I explore how a baseline incentive effect is moderated by two features of professionals’ tasks and jurisdictions: jurisdictional dominance (i.e., how much the profession controls the provision of the task relative to other professions) and jurisdictional prominence (i.e., how commonly provided the task is within a profession relative to other tasks). Using data on thousands of physician tasks from Ontario, Canada, and a difference-in-differences empirical design, I find that professionals’ incentive responses are smaller when a profession has higher jurisdictional dominance over a task, but are larger when the task has higher jurisdictional prominence within the profession. This research contributes to the literature on professions and professionals in multiple ways. First, I introduce the concepts of jurisdictional dominance and jurisdictional prominence, distinguishing them from each other and from existing conceptions of professional control. Second, this study shows that financial incentives can be an effective tool for influencing professionals, but highlights that their efficacy is shaped by a task’s jurisdictional dominance and jurisdictional prominence. Finally, I show that these new conceptions of jurisdictional control influence professionals’ behaviors in meaningful ways and should therefore be considered in future studies of professions.},

Our analysis also identifies two distinct managerial approaches to applying merit when evaluating others: the focused approach, in which managers evaluate employees’ work actions quantitatively at the individual level; and the diffuse approach in which managers assess both employees’ work actions and personal qualities, quantitatively and qualitatively, at both the individual and team levels. We further find that, as a result of their different past experiences as subjects of evaluation, individuals who experience mostly negative evaluation outcomes as employees are more likely to adopt a focused approach to evaluating merit, whereas individuals who experience mostly positive evaluation outcomes are more likely to adopt a diffuse approach. Our study contributes to the scholarship on meritocracy and workplace inequality by showing that merit is not an abstract concept but a guiding principle that is produced and reproduced over time based on individuals’ evaluation experiences in the workplace.},

Beyond examining the main effect of CEO tenure on cognitive complexity, we consider three moderators of this relationship, each of which is expected to influence the accumulation of expertise over a CEO’s time in office: industry dynamism, industry jolts, and CEO positional power. We conduct our tests on a sample of 684 CEOs of public corporations. The analytic centerpiece of our study is a novel index of CEO cognitive complexity based on CEOs’ language patterns in the question-and-answer portions of quarterly conference calls. As part of our extensive theory of measurement, we provide evidence of the reliability and validity of our index. Our results indicate that CEOs, in general, experience substantial increases in cognitive complexity over their time in office. Examined moderators somewhat, but modestly, alter this general trajectory, and nonlinearities are not observed. We discuss the implications of our findings.},

Through an inductive analysis of entrepreneurs’ successful and unsuccessful non-equity crowdfunding campaigns, we derive a holistic framework of community-based resource mobilization. Our framework consists of three distinct processes entrepreneurs use to attain financial capital from non-professional resource providers over time: community building to establish psychological bonds with individuals possessing domain-relevant knowledge, community engaging to foster social identification with existing resource providers, and community spanning to leverage proofpoints with intermediaries who can help orchestrate resource mobilization with broader audiences. Entrepreneurs’ enactment and temporal sequencing of these three processes distinguish successful versus unsuccessful resource mobilization efforts in a crowdfunding setting. Community building is used by successful entrepreneurs primarily prior to a campaign’s launch, community engaging is used throughout a campaign, and community spanning is most effectively used after achieving a campaign’s initially-stated funding goal. This study empirically illustrates and theoretically conceptualizes the dynamics of resource mobilization in a crowdfunding setting.},

We argue that neo-institutional perspectives, which stress the constraining role of market categories and institutional logics, have to be complemented with demand-side perspectives that stress the enabling force of economic incentives to explain the origins of hybrids. We develop theory to predict the country-level diffusion of hybrid forms in Islamic banking in the 1975–2017 period, during which many conventional banks invaded the domain of Islamic banking by starting to sell Islamic banking services, or so-called “Islamic windows.” Our findings underscore the relevance of simultaneously studying the impact of constraining and enabling forces. Consistent with neo-institutional theory, we find strong evidence that a lack of constitutive legitimacy of the window form—only in countries where Muslims make up a large share of the population—and the ideological polarization of local audiences reify the ideological boundaries between the oppositional banking logics, which in turn hampers the diffusion of windows in the focal country. At the same time, however, it appears that the failure of local credit markets and country-level economic globalization, the latter even more in countries with a Muslim majority, provide potent economic incentives for the diffusion of windows. By stressing the role of utilitarian incentives and material exchange as drivers of hybridization, we bridge the gap between neo-institutional and more rationalist approaches of institutional change.},

In this study, we focus on one of the most important and commonly observed contractual mechanisms used to acquire external technologies: technology licensing. Surprisingly, licensing has been mostly overlooked by prior studies examining the effect of competition on firms’ allocation of R&amp;D. We take into account the unique properties of licensing and systematically link them to the demands arising from the competitive pressure caused by rivals’ launches of new products. Furthermore, we discuss how licensing-in decisions ultimately shape a firm’s subsequent innovation in areas where they are threatened by competitors and how such innovation depends on the cumulative R&amp;D investments inside the organization into which licensed knowledge is added. We test our theoretical model through a longitudinal design that tracks the licensing-in and innovation outcomes of firms in the global biopharmaceutical industry. Accounting for the endogenous selection of firms into licensing, our findings illustrate that licensing-in is motivated by competitive pressures. We also find that licensing-in increases a firm’s capacity to innovate in areas where competitors have exerted pressure, particularly in the presence of cumulative R&amp;D investments. In so doing, the paper anchors technology licensing as a key organizational action that helps increase our understanding of the important relationship between competition and innovation.},

This paper extends research on knowledge networks and innovation to propose three main processes of knowledge creation that are more likely to result in discoveries that are distant from existing inventions: long search paths , scientific reasoning , and distant recombination . We explore these processes with a combination of a large and unique data set on outlier patents filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and interviews with inventors of outlier patents.

I focus on religious diversity within Islam as an instance of intrainstitutional complexity and analyze a country-level panel dataset of Islamic investment funds in addition to complementary qualitative data. Intriguingly, I find that religious diversity within Islam plays a paradoxical role: it promotes the entrepreneurial supply of Islamic investment funds in a country, but it also reduces the investor demand for these funds. This complex effect is moderated by interinstitutional forces: the market logic positively moderates the effect on supply dynamics, whereas the state logic negatively moderates the effect on supply and positively that on demand.

We conceptualize how regional and caste similarity, two salient aspects of social similarity in India, affect two distinct aspects of deal pricing: premoney valuation and investors’ downside risk protection in the Indian venture capital market. We theorize that VCs reflect the benefits and costs of social similarity by setting higher premoney valuation when investing in companies led by socially similar founders while also minimizing their downside risks in these investments. We expect that social similarity’s impact on pricing is amplified when VCs face greater subjective uncertainty, such as for early-stage deals or if the VCs lack expertise in the start-up company’s product market. Finally, we claim that VCs achieve superior returns on investments when their deal pricing accurately reflects the impact of social similarity. We tested our conceptual model using both parametric and nonparametric methods on a hand-collected data set of all deals that occurred during 2005–2012, and we supplemented our analyses with in-depth, qualitative interviews that contextualize our findings. The pattern of findings on regional similarity are consistent with our model, but the effects of caste in our data are theoretically anomalous. Post hoc analyses to resolve the anomaly suggest an “intrinsic quality” mechanism, whereby higher-caste VCs set higher valuations when matching with lower-caste founders that signal high quality. Overall, our findings offer evidence that VCs incorporate social attributes into deal pricing in nuanced yet boundedly rational ways.},

  abstract     = {New entrants in established markets face competing recommendations over whether it is better to establish their legitimacy by conforming to type or to differentiate themselves from incumbents by proposing novel contributions. This dilemma is particularly acute in cultural markets in which demand for novelty and attention to legitimacy are both high. We draw upon research in organizational theory and entrepreneurship to hypothesize the effects of pursuing narrow or broad appeals on the performance of new entrants in the music industry. We propose that the sales of novel products vary with the distance perceived between the classes being combined and that this happens, in part, because combinations that appear to span great distances encourage consumers to adopt superordinate rather than subordinate classes (e.g., to classify and evaluate something as a “song” rather than a “country song”). Using a sample of 144 artists introduced to the public via the U.S. television program The Voice , we find evidence of a U-shaped relationship between category distance and consumer response. Specifically, consumers reward new entrants who pursue either familiarity (i.e., nonspanning) or distinctive combinations (i.e., combine distant genres) but reject efforts that try to balance both goals. An experimental test validates that manipulating the perceived distance an artist spans influences individual evaluations of product quality and the hierarchy of categorization. Together these results provide initial evidence that distant combinations are more likely to be classified using a superordinate category, mitigating the potential confusion and legitimacy-based penalties that affect middle-distance combinations.},

  abstract     = {We examine the managerial delegation decisions of foreign entrepreneurs and assess how these decisions are shaped by characteristics of the local product and labor market environment. We argue that actual or perceived home bias in court proceedings leads foreign entrepreneurs to place little reliance on formal contracts in their dealings with local agent-managers. Adopting the lens of relational contract theory, we develop hypotheses linking managerial delegation decisions to market conditions associated with stable self-enforcing agreements and test the hypotheses in the context of post-Soviet Russia. Consistent with our arguments, we find that foreign entrepreneurs are more likely to hire an agent-manager in local markets where industry growth creates a substantial “shadow of the future,” where managers’ outside employment options are relatively limited, and where competition and the variability of returns are not so high as to induce defection from an informal agreement. Similar observations on a sample of Russian-owned entrepreneurial firms suggest that these delegation decisions are relatively insensitive to local market conditions but that they are influenced by the density of local reputation networks. Our study thus contributes to understanding of the distinctive features of foreign entrepreneurs’ managerial delegation decisions and reinforces the view that contracting impediments constitute one important aspect of the “liability of foreignness” for entrepreneurial firms.},

Recent work highlights how supportive regional logics can give rise to products or organizations that resonate with these logics and how the geographic patterns that underlie industries may be understood by examining such relationships. This literature has not, however, offered deep attention to the ways in which features of technology—specifically, its inherent uncertainty—may interact with such dynamics. In this paper, we tackle the challenge. Our work examines how the level of support for an environmental-conservation logic within a region is associated with the number of wind and solar equipment manufacturers in that region in the years 1978–2006. By simultaneously exploring the effects of this logic on two similar technologies, our work not only reinforces how logics may interact with organizational activity but also shows how the magnitude and mechanisms of this effect depend on the technology in question. We build on these findings to discuss the importance of examining technologies in detail, including their dimensions of uncertainty, the role of timing in examining the effect of regionally tied logics, and the links between public policy and logics.},

From our longitudinal field study, we generated a process model of strategy making that helps to explain how firms work to shape the future in some preferred fashion. Specifically, we describe our findings on shaping-oriented forward-looking strategy making in terms of “artificial evolution” processes—interventions by which a firm’s leaders challenge the status quo and leverage the internal ecology of the organization to nudge the evolution of the business landscape toward a preferred direction. This is distinct from the more conventional and commonly invoked natural selection processes that describe how firms adapt to markets or unintentionally shape them. These findings on strategy making as akin to artificial evolution complement and extend the traditional view of strategic management, which has historically focused on processes anchored in models of search and adaptation. Our findings also shed light on an exceptional mode of strategy making—one that goes beyond concerns of firm survival and competitive advantage, and tackles societal grand challenges. By accounting for constructivist, forward-looking dimensions of strategic agency, our findings also contribute to the microfoundations of strategic decision making and to organization theories, more generally.},

We suggest that an investor can access private information on the focal firm’s underlying value through its strong indirect tie to the focal firm via the focal firm’s lead venture capitalist. Supporting our theory, we show that after the focal firm’s initial public offering, the investor with a strong indirect tie to the focal firm receives high risk-adjusted return when the investor chooses to invest in the focal firm’s stock in the stock exchange market.

  abstract     = {Research examining board efficacy often focuses on oversight and monitoring, particularly as evidenced by the sensitivity of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation to prior firm performance. In this study, we adopt an alternative perspective on CEO compensation—specifically over/underpayment, or the extent to which a CEO’s initial compensation is above or below prevailing market norms—that allows us to assess a board’s efficacy via the accuracy of its initial CEO selection and compensation decisions. We build on and extend human capital theory to argue that boards make initial CEO compensation decisions based a range of manifestations of CEO human capital (that are both observable and unobservable to outsiders) and that initial over/underpayment represents an implicit assessment of underlying CEO quality. Using a sample of 766 CEOs, we relate initial over/underpayment to subsequent CEO career performance. Our results show that this core relationship is positively significant and economically meaningful. Thus, U.S. public company boards, as a group, do tend to be making broadly accurate initial predictions regarding the underlying capabilities of new CEO hires. This relationship is amplified in situations where board assessments of CEO human capital are more unequivocal (greater current versus prospective compensation) and when CEO human capital can be expressed most comprehensively (high managerial discretion). In supplemental analyses we show that these relationships fundamentally changed following the implementation of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, suggesting that boards may be performing this important aspect of their governance role more effectively in recent times. We also find that our results are not symmetric—rather, they are strongest in situations where initial compensation is midrange or lower; high levels of initial overpayment are not associated with commensurate levels of career performance. Finally, we consider and account for a range of alternative explanations for our central finding.},

Furthermore, we suggest that the magnitude of the impact of vicarious learning is influenced by a firm’s own specific experience with a variety of actors. We use longitudinal data of the population of German biotechnology start-ups and pharmaceutical multinational corporations (MNCs) between 1996 and 2015 across 19 German biotechnology regions. We show that colocated start-ups’ international expansion is positively impacted by the regional network centrality of colocated MNCs and that this relationship is moderated by a start-up’s direct alliance experience with these entities. Our results highlight how important it is for researchers to differentiate the distinct and separate influences a wide variety of actors have on vicarious learning to more clearly identify outcomes of this influence. We also provide evidence that the influence of MNCs is heterogeneous and depends on whether MNCs are domestic or foreign and on their R&amp;D intensity, yet find that country of origin has no significant influence. Our study makes a number of contributions, one of which is research on alliances, supporting conflicting arguments on the subsequent impacts of experience. We further find that certain types of alliance experience may not be transferrable to induce start-ups’ future international expansion, and in some cases may even hinder it.},

Preentry technological experience (same product and different consumers) helps firms attract a larger share of intensive users (aligning with early adopters) but only if they enter the market early when these adopters make decisions. Preentry market experience (different product and same consumers) helps firms attract a larger share of lighter users, consistent with characterizations of mass market users. Exploiting different components of firm performance in the global second-generation mobile telecommunications industry (average usage intensity and market penetration) allows us to articulate and identify the paths and mechanisms that allow preentry experience to affect postentry performance.

This paper shifts the focus toward examining how cooperation is maintained in the face of potentially disruptive forces. To advance theory, research, and practice on how to maintain cooperation over time, we examine how systems of cooperation interact with, withstand, or succumb to a potentially disruptive force that is commonplace in organizational contexts: rankings. Using a longitudinal, no-deception, between-groups experimental design, we assess how systems of cooperation respond to the introduction of performance rankings. Examining data from more than 11,000 rounds of decision making from 592 participants clustered in 74 teams, we find that cooperation plummets when performance-rank information is introduced. However, the addition of reputation information—individuals’ histories of prosocial contributions—enables a system of cooperation to withstand the disruptive effects of performance rankings. Actors use reputation information to make decisions that reduce perceived inequity. Our study contributes to theories of cooperation, performance feedback, macrolevel prosocial behavior, and management practice.},

Moreover, we also find that, independent of confidence levels, individuals exhibit ambiguity-seeking behavior when the result of the competition depends on their skills, which, in turn, leads to higher levels of entry.

To estimate whether this technology induces changes in the type of knowledge produced, we employ novel measures based on machine learning (topic modeling) techniques and traditional measures based on bibliometric indicators. Our analysis demonstrates that the shock associated with the introduction of Kinect increased the production of ideas and induced researchers to pursue ideas more diverse than and distant from their original trajectories. We find that this holds for both researchers who had published in motion-sensing research prior to the Kinect shock (within-area researchers) and those who did not (outside-area researchers), with the effects being stronger among outside-area researchers.},

  abstract     = {In the wake of exogenous institutional change, organizational populations often experience a legitimacy shock. As a new institutional logic becomes dominant, old symbols and practices are delegitimated and new ones legitimated. Old symbols and practices persist into the postshock period, however, forming an ecology of diverse cohorts and audience schemas, some divergent and others convergent with the new institutional logic. Because new organizations look to their rivals for knowledge of how to cope, I examine how the shifting alignment of a rival cohort to changing audience schemas influences a new organization’s own alignment and, thus, mortality. I propose that density at founding of divergent preshock organizational cohorts early in the postshock period reduces a new organization’s mortality due to an initial endowment effect and then becomes more mortality-increasing over time as maladaptive imprints take over. Density at founding of convergent postshock organizational cohorts has a U-shaped effect on mortality—similar to that caused by a legitimacy vacuum—but this effect emerges after a delay as legitimation processes begin to dominate delegitimation processes. Also, following Red Queen theory, I argue that competitive experience with divergent organizational cohorts increases mortality, but competitive experience with convergent organizational cohorts decreases mortality. To test these arguments, I use the institutional shock of the American Civil War—during which the firearms industry of the U.S. South underwent a period of government-led command-and-control centralization—as a natural experiment. The findings are consistent with the main arguments, though the overall postshock effect of density at founding appears to be dominated by early stage endowment effects, contrary to assumptions.},

Moreover, relevant organizational literature suggests that, even if accelerators are associated with better venture outcomes, results could be due to mechanisms other than learning, such as sorting or signaling. Drawing on mixed empirical methods that include proprietary data on the ventures accepted and “almost accepted” to a set of top accelerators, we find evidence that some, but not all, of the early accelerators we study substantially aid and accelerate venture development. We also find some evidence of sorting dynamics. These findings are corroborated using an auxiliary quantitative data set constructed from publicly observable data. Complementary qualitative fieldwork suggests a key driver of these accelerator effects is a novel learning mechanism we label broad, intensive, and paced consultation. The implication of these insights is that the practices of early accelerators represent a beneficial and likely replicable form of intervention that may also have relevance for independent entrepreneurs, educational programs, and corporate innovation.},

  abstract     = {We study the introduction of the private logic into a mature Italian hospital that was governed previously as a hybrid of professional and public logics. Intriguingly, the reconstituted hospital was for several years widely praised for its strong clinical and financial performance, but quickly and with little warning, it became riven by political differences that led to its demise. Through our case analysis, we develop a multilevel model that reveals the destabilizing process that can unfold when a new logic enters an established organization. We contribute to the hybrids literature by explaining the puzzle of how a new logic can become accepted and then rejected in organizations, emphasizing the critical importance of the interaction between the audience, organization, and practice levels. Crucially, we reveal that positive feedback from multiple audiences may be a mixed blessing for hybrids: although it offers resource and legitimacy advantages, it can induce internal tensions with severe destabilizing consequences. Our findings and model also run counter to two core assumptions within the institutional literature: that social endorsement is advantageous and that alignment with institutional expectations results in stabilization. We qualify these assumptions and indicate the circumstances under which they are unlikely to hold.},

Previous studies report conflicting evidence: some find that gender-diverse firms experience more positive performance, and others find the opposite. However, most research to date has focused on a single country or industry and has not accounted for possible variation across social contexts. This paper advances an institutional framework and predicts that gender diversity’s relationship with performance depends on both its normative and regulatory acceptance in the broader institutional environment. Using a unique longitudinal sample of 1,069 leading public firms around the world, I find that the relationship between gender diversity and firm performance varies significantly across countries and industries owing to differences in institutional context. The more that gender diversity has been normatively accepted in a country or industry, the more that gender-diverse firms experience positive market valuation and increased revenue. These findings underscore the importance of the broader social context when considering the relationship between gender diversity and firm performance.},

  abstract     = {Leader exits at the work-unit level are prevalent, yet little attention has been devoted to understanding the impact of leader succession on employee turnover. In this paper, we draw from uncertainty-management theory to specify and test conditions under which leader exits are followed by increases (or decreases) in the turnover rates of remaining members. We theorize that leader exits disrupt the status quo and heighten remaining members’ feelings of uncertainty and propose that characteristics of the outgoing and incoming leaders help members forecast their future work situation and influence their decisions to stay or leave. Leveraging longitudinal data from 287 locations of a U.S. hospitality organization ( n = 6,357 unit-month observations), we test several attributes of the succession context that moderate the effects of leader departures on both the initial change in turnover levels and the longer-term change in turnover trends. Discontinuous growth models revealed both an initial spike and a longer-term rise in voluntary turnover rates following the departure of a high-performing leader. In addition, the longer-term turnover trajectory was found to trend upward when replacements lacked role experience, when replacements were internally promoted, and when post-succession involuntary termination rates were high. Overall, we conclude that the magnitude and direction of leader-succession effects on unit turnover rates depends on uncertainty-reducing characteristics associated with both outgoing and incoming leaders.},

A second stylized fact in the innovation literature is that R&amp;D investment increases with size. Taken together, these stylized facts create a puzzle of seemingly irrational behavior by large firms—they are increasing spending despite decreasing returns. There have been a number of proposals to resolve the puzzle. However, to date none of these proposals has been fully validated, so the puzzle remains. Accordingly, this paper empirically tests the proposals to see whether any resolves the puzzle. We found one proposal (use of alternative measures) was able to resolve the puzzle. When using a recent measure of firms’ R&amp;D productivity, RQ, we found that both R&amp;D spending and R&amp;D productivity increase with firm size. Thus, large firms seem to be acting rationally in their increasing R&amp;D investments, as one would expect.},

  abstract     = {Client capture is the process by which professionals become so dependent on certain clients that their professional judgment is compromised. We explore whether there are systematic differences across professionals in their likelihood of improperly biasing their judgment in the interests of clients on whom they highly depend. To do so, we examine the disclosure of prior art by patent lawyers when representing client patent applications submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Lawyers are obligated professionally to disclose all relevant prior art of which they are aware even if, in doing so, their clients receive narrower intellectual property rights. We suggest that patent lawyers are generally more dependent on clients with whom they repeatedly engage and when they have numerous similar clients. We find, however, that the influence of such dependency on lawyers’ withholding prior art is greater when they have entered the legal profession through a regulatory employment revolving door. Specifically, regulatory experience as a USPTO patent examiner provides patent lawyers with unique insight that enables them to compromise their judgment on behalf of clients on whom they depend. Further, patent lawyers who are associates in their law firms are more inclined than are partners to withhold prior art on behalf of clients with whom they repeatedly engage. Because associates’ employment with their professional service firms is relatively insecure, compromising their professional judgment on behalf of clients with whom they repeatedly engage is more alluring in their efforts to enhance future employment prospects.},

However, professions resist and challenge such innovation, framing it as unsafe and immoral. This paper theorizes a process by which innovative nonprofessional firms overcome the resistance, enter professionalized markets, and weaken professional control over work. It analyzes the rise of a new organizational form—retail health clinics—that deprofessionalized some medical tasks in U.S. primary healthcare. An analysis of newspaper articles, archival documents, and interviews with key industry participants suggests that retail clinic chains capitalized on long-standing jurisdictional tensions between the physician and nursing professions. The clinics operated by relying on nurses’ legal rights to perform physicians’ tasks and defended retail medicine as a safe and morally justified innovation by using the nursing profession’s established repertoire or frames and arguments. Sentiment analysis of over 1,600 newspaper articles suggests that the legitimacy of retail clinic chains in public discourse improved with the proliferation of the clinics, but the legitimacy of nurse practitioners did not. Nonprofessional firms thus introduced an innovation that weakened professional control over medical work by capitalizing on interprofessional tensions and repurposing professions’ own jurisdictional claims.},

Although this work has shown that perceived lack of commitment may be an important problem for diversifying firms, it has not been established what might resolve these commitment concerns and reduce demand-side penalties for diversifying to serve new customers. We argue that a firm’s ability to signal authenticity will increase perceptions of commitment and resolve ambiguities about commitment generated by diversification. We use a multimethod approach including qualitative evidence from a case in the behavioral health industry and experimental methods to isolate these observed effects. In a qualitative study, we examine a case in which two firms saw divergent outcomes when they tried to engage in the exact same diversification activity and show that when a firm signals that they are highly authentic (i.e., when stakeholders perceive the firm to be willing to fulfill commitments even while sacrificing short-term rewards), diversification does not threaten perceived commitment. However, those who cannot signal authenticity are less likely to be selected in the market because diversification is seen as a threat to perceived commitment. We then test these findings in two experiments using the primary customer audience, addiction recovery therapists, as participants. In a final experiment, we test some key boundary conditions of our argument, finding support in the context of markets for car mechanics, which suggests that our argument may be applicable more broadly than healthcare into markets for various types of credence goods.},

This study aims to address this lacuna, adopting Carroll and Wheaton’s typology of type and moral authenticity to examine how contemporary dance choreographers construct authenticity during the creation of a new choreography. Our analysis of data from 23 contemporary dance companies reveals that the two meanings of authenticity dynamically reconstitute one another in the creative process. First, choreographers construct moral authenticity through transformation of form , deconstructing established artistic dance forms and introducing new movements from a bricolage of techniques. Second, they construct type authenticity through wrapping expression, facilitating the deconstruction of the values attached to the bricolage of techniques into artistic dance aesthetics. Finally, choreographers evoke both moral and type authenticity through a creative process of reconstruction. Our noteworthy finding reveals how the construction of authenticity in the process of creating a new choreography, and the dynamics between the two meanings of authenticity, serve significantly as a means of communication among the involved actors, thereby enabling the creative process.},

Firms with a high degree of input overlap among their product units will be less likely to remove stigmatized inputs from their operations; as such, a change could be costlier for them.

This question has urgent practical importance, since competitive pressures in a wide variety of industries have resulted in organizations that increasingly strain their operating limits. This question is deeply connected with organizational learning theory, since organizations operating with constrained capacity may gain experience but lose the ability to digest it—challenging the overall organization’s ability to learn and improve. Some research, though, suggests a seemingly contradictory perspective, with constrained capacity perhaps motivating organizations to adopt more flexible approaches and learn out of necessity. This study integrates the perspectives to examine how constrained capacity impacts organizational learning. To explore this question, the study develops separate theory regarding the amount and timing of capacity crises, suggesting that increasingly constrained capacity tends to detract from learning, but, uniquely, that consistently constrained capacity, rather than periodic spikes, may instead lead to better learning. Hypothesis tests provide support for several of the study’s arguments.},

This concept is instrumental in resolving long-standing challenges in network research, such as capturing the interplay between different levels of analysis or time horizons. This is made possible by longitudinal network and mobility data (1743–2010) from the Palio di Siena—the famous horse race in Siena, Italy. The outcome of interest is Palio-related collective violence. The analysis shows that relationally loaded organizational ties of rivalry or friendship increase the likelihood of incidents, whereas mobility along the same lines reduces it. The results support sociological arguments that symmetrical social space of friendship or rivalry is conducive to conflict. Mobility is a factor of moderation—by connecting employers within the actor and transferring relational content between them, it creates misalignment between the assumption of a role and fulfillment of its expectations. Mobility relaxes the relational constraints of jockeys, reducing their compliance with bellicose demands. The uncertainty resulting from mobility may have a collective benefit that is ignored by employers: the moderation of conflict.},

Significant research focuses on understanding how teams develop, assimilate, and apply diverse information; yet, organizational practices have evolved in new ways that are not fully explored in the teams literature. Individuals with diverse motivations, knowledge, and perspectives are often assigned to teams, creating burdens for members to develop effective ways to work together, learn from each other, and achieve goals amid the complexity of today’s organizational contexts. In this paper, we examine a multilevel model of how team goal orientation affects cross-understanding—the extent to which team members understand the other members’ mental models—which in turn, affects team and individual performance. We examine these effects using 160 teams of 859 participants who completed a semester-long business simulation. Findings show that the more team members are motivated by learning goals, the greater a team’s cross-understanding and subsequent team and individual performance. These effects are dampened when members are motivated by performance goals—to avoid mistakes or prove competence. This study expands the cross-understanding literature, revealing motivational antecedents that explain why some teams develop higher cross-understanding than others. We also contribute to the goal orientation literature by demonstrating that team goal orientation influences members’ learning about other members and in so doing, also affects team and individual performance. Because team motivation can be influenced by organizational practices, our findings also contribute practical insights for organizational leaders.},

Our model proposes that such teams face a unique challenge—an initial asymmetry in feelings of psychological ownership for the idea between the creative lead who conceived the idea and new team members who are beginning to work on the idea. We suggest that the creative lead can resolve this asymmetry and foster the emergence of collective psychological ownership by enacting two interpersonal behaviors—help seeking and territorial marking. These behaviors build collective ownership by facilitating the unifying centripetal force of team identification and preventing the divisive centrifugal force of team ownership conflict. Our model also proposes that collective ownership positively relates to the early success of new creative teams. The results of a quantitative study of 79 creative teams participating in an entrepreneurship competition provided general support for our predictions but also suggested refinements as to how a creative lead’s behavior influences team dynamics. The findings of a subsequent qualitative investigation of 27 teams participating in a university startup launch course shed additional light on how collective ownership emerges in new creative teams launched to advance one person’s idea.},

  abstract     = {Management practices explain an important part of the heterogeneity in firm productivity, but the literature has largely focused on manufacturing, while leaving out research in the industrial setting. A key managerial practice in industrial research projects is the use of autonomy (through the delegation of decision rights). Our paper clarifies the drivers and the effects of autonomy in settings where other managerial instruments are less effective. We discuss that in industrial research projects, autonomy is set for efficiency reasons—autonomy allows researchers to make more competent decisions about a specific problem—as well as for motivational considerations—autonomy motivates researchers to exert greater effort. We also argue that project - relevant capital —the resources that enhance the productivity of researchers on a given project—is a key driver of autonomy. We theorize that the efficiency and motivational channels have opposite implications for the relationship between project-relevant capital and autonomy and find that, empirically, this relationship is U-shaped, which is suggestive evidence of the presence of both channels.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a model to predict when the subunits of a multidivisional firm implement a practice adopted by the firm more or less extensively, focusing on the intraorganizational environment. Drawing on institutional arguments, I propose that a subunit’s extent of practice implementation is a combined result of coercive pressures from its headquarters, imitation of its peer units, and its own perception of the practice’s legitimacy. More specifically, I argue that a subunit will implement new practices related to corporate social responsibility (CSR) more fully (1) when the corporate mandate from the headquarters is more pressing, (2) when its peer subunits have implemented similar actions, and (3) when the practice is perceived as consistent with the subunit’s own values. Regression results further suggest that peers and headquarters influence a subunit’s extent of implementation of a practice only when the subunit perceives it as highly consistent with its own values—a finding that points to the importance of values for practice legitimacy and the need to rethink practice implementation within complex organizations.},

  abstract     = {Building on work at the individual and organizational levels suggesting that an individual’s self-concept and an organization’s identity are dynamic, we relax the generally held assumption that perceptions of organizational identification are perceived as relatively stable over time and highlight the importance of understanding the perceived dynamism in members’ relationships with their organizations over broader time horizons. We introduce various identification trajectories—a member’s current perception of how his or her identification has evolved and will evolve over time—and investigate the sense of momentum that characterizes these trajectories. We also generate theory about the different action tendencies created by various types of trajectories and examine their influence on cognition, affect, and behavior in the present. Our theoretical model helps to explain why two members of the same organization with similar degrees of identification in the present might think, feel, and behave quite differently. In addition, our theoretical perspective enables us to understand why high (or low) identifiers might display cognition, affect, and behavior typically associated with low (or high) degrees of identification.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the social landscape at work helps employees accomplish organizational goals. A growing body of evidence, however, suggests that people are fallible perceivers of their work relationships. People do not always know how much others trust (or distrust) them, consider them a friend (or enemy), or rely on them for advice or information at work. Such relational misperceptions may be especially likely in the context of work organizations. Here, we develop theoretical accounts to explain how and why employees misinterpret the nature of their relationships with others at work—and what consequences ensue when they do. We direct attention to five key opportunities for future research on when and why relational misperceptions occur and matter in organizations. Building on the small body of organizational research and larger body of nonorganizational research on relationship misperception, we also identify areas that may be fruitful for exploration, highlighting several topics in the organizational literature that could be enlivened by considering the role of relational misperceptions. For example, we consider how employees’ relational misperceptions may affect how influential they are at work, how effectively they lead others, and how they navigate the social landscape in organizations.},
