  abstract     = {This paper presents an online educational game focusing on hierarchical procurement planning in a simulated forest supply chain with multiple companies. The purpose is to provide an understanding of the importance of individual decisions and their medium- to long-term impacts on the entire supply chain. The transportation game comprises three phases, each simulating hierarchical decision making when three competing companies (i.e., the game players) are making simultaneous decisions on the available resources. Each game phase also requires concurrent collaboration and competition. The phases represent different planning levels from long-term to short-term planning, considering the collaboration concept within the supply chain. The simulated supply chain objective is to minimize resource purchasing and transportation costs. The purchasing cost will be fixed after the first phase. The chance of decreasing transportation costs, however, is available until the end of the game. We develop three optimization models for each game phase. Once the game is finished, it compares the players’ results with optimal solutions prepared upfront. Finally, we present some comments about the game experience in various classrooms.},

  abstract     = {In this case study, students determine the relationship between point spreads and the probability of winning a game using data from the National Football League (NFL); although the data comes from the NFL, the models and insights are accessible to students who are unfamiliar with football. They model the relationship first with a linear fit and then with a logistic curve. The analysis requires a combination of several key Microsoft Excel functions, including PivotTables, trendlines, and Solver. The case is designed to be tailored to the needs of the instructor, the students, and the course—the basic case can be relatively short but several additional options add depth and reinforcement; similarly, it can be assigned as an unstructured or highly structured assignment. The case itself introduces the idea that with enough data on previous point spreads and game results, we can calculate the empirical probability that a team favored by a given point spread will win the game. The case Teaching Note provides detailed instructions for every step of the case, with hints for both instructors and students. This case article discusses the positive pedagogical aspects.},

Through this innovative dice-based classroom simulation, students are exposed to supply chain sustainability, total cost of ownership (TCO), and risk management while also understanding their linkages through effective instructor debrief. Student teams compete by selecting sourcing options such as supplier location, transportation methods, and sustainability reputation from a menu, then see how their decisions fare as the product-line life cycle is simulated with a dice. The debrief facilitated by the instructor compares and contrasts results across the teams, generating insights into the interrelationships between supply chain sustainability choices, TCO, and risk management. Successfully conducted by multiple instructors, in multiple countries, and across all levels of management education (undergraduate, master of science, and executive master of business administration), survey results ( n = 350) plus a pilot study ( n = 31) confirm that this dice-based simulation accomplishes multiple learning objectives while also providing a highly engaging experiential learning classroom environment for this sample.},

Regrettably, even with regulation and technology developing over the past years, most of the freight volumes are still shipped via road, the least sustainable means of transport. This paper presents a beer transportation game to support logistics decarbonization via a modal shift from road to rail. In the game, student teams play the role of a logistics manager of a beer brewer and decide on the transport mode and shipment volume from the brewery to a distribution center. Their decisions are evaluated by the impact on total logistics costs and emissions. The game consists of two rounds, each with a student participation part and a lecturer debriefing part. The first round helps students understand why firms are often reluctant to shift freight from road to the low-emission transport mode (e.g., rail), and the second round encourages students to overcome the obstacles and helps them design practical approaches to alter the modal split in favor of rail transport. The game can be sealed into a 90-minute session and incorporated into any courses covering the topic of sustainable logistics or supply chain management.},

In crayon production, proper sequencing of colors in production can result in significant savings in total production time. The primary objective of the case is to provide students with hands-on experience in applying the TSP model. The case requires the students to consider variations of the basic model with the goal of encouraging them to think logically through the process of mathematical modeling and to consider the decision-making implications of their models. This case study can be used in undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in linear/integer programming or in production planning. It was implemented as part of a term project in a graduate operations research course with overwhelmingly positive feedback.},

  abstract     = {This case study focuses on modeling and analyzing the practices concerning the staffing of the immigration agency at the Island of Tropical Paradise International Airport, which is responsible for processing arriving passengers into the country. Students are challenged to model the status quo of immigration employee scheduling and analyze various high-level policy changes to determine the reduction in staffing requirements while also being concerned with the wait time of passengers in the queue at immigration. The case has been used in an introductory operations research (OR) course in an engineering curriculum as a term project and was created based on a client of a major consulting organization. The main teaching objective of the case is to have students demonstrate an understanding of how to use OR models and analysis to impact practice. To this end, the case moves the students from standard classroom or textbook examples to an open-ended problem where there is not a single correct model or analysis to tackle it.},

  abstract     = {Faculty in business and engineering schools are increasingly focused on teaching the fundamentals of the innovation process to students at all levels. There has been a recent embrace of teaching the innovation process through a user-centered “design thinking” methodology and on experiential “making” activities within interdisciplinary teams. Although valuable as part of an innovation curriculum, a focus on only one set of tools and methods such as design thinking may detract from other valuable approaches, thereby limiting the full range of incremental to radical innovation outcomes that students need to learn to be effective innovation leaders. In this essay we review pedagogy related to teaching innovation processes, and we categorize approaches into four modes depending on teaching method (experiential or analytical) and participant context (disciplinary or interdisciplinary). We propose that in order to teach innovation effectively, students need to be exposed to all four modes, where learning opportunities differ. We illustrate our points drawing from courses among multiple settings, and we provide implications for curriculum design that will help faculty to innovate how they teach innovation.},

  abstract     = {In the business environment, the goal of data analytics can be characterized as improving decision making and its links to big data and other data-driven technologies. In UK higher education, degree apprenticeships are business-led and government-supported nationally recognized qualifications, where delivery is tailored to partner employer requirements. This paper focuses on the development of the data analytics specialism of the BSc Digital and Technology Solutions degree apprenticeship at the University of Winchester Business School informed by current research and practice. A data-driven analytical framework is first proposed to provide an overarching methodology for extracting knowledge and insights from (big) data. It covers key components of the analytics lifecycle from data management, data preprocessing, and integration through data modeling and business intelligence to insight management. Software tools related to collecting, cleansing, processing, analyzing, and visualizing data have been systematically discussed to provide the technological dimension. The methodology is then applied to the development of the specialist modules in data analytics, which represent the core thematic structure of the degree apprenticeship pathway. The culmination of the paper is an evaluation of the educational innovation of this digital technologies curriculum, highlighting teaching, learning, and assessment from the perspective of data-analytic thinking.},
