  abstract     = {This article investigates the effect of patent protection on the mobility of early-career employee-inventors. Using data on patent applications filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office between 2001 and 2012 and examiner leniency as a source of exogenous variation in patent protection, we find that one additional patent granted decreases the likelihood of changing employers, on average, by 23\%. This decrease is stronger when the employee has fewer coinventors, works outside the core of the firm, and produces more basic-research innovations. These findings are consistent with the idea that patents turn innovation-related skills into patent-holder-specific human capital.

  abstract     = {We study the pricing and return policy decisions of an omnichannel retailer serving customers who differ in how they realize their uncertain valuation for a product—by inspecting in store before purchase or by purchasing online and possibly returning misfit products. Customers may return misfit products either to stores for a full refund or online as per the firm’s return policy. We model prices to be identical across channels, allow crosschannel returns, and endogenize customers’ purchase and return decisions, capturing typical features of an omnichannel setting. Our analysis helps explain why some omnichannel firms choose full refunds, whereas others charge a fee for online returns. We find that omnichannel firms with good salvage partners for online returns (e.g., Nordstrom) as well as those with more store-based customers (e.g., Macy’s) should offer full refunds. Similarly, firms are incentivized to offer full refunds for products that customers are more likely to inspect in store (e.g., Express for footwear). In contrast, firms with a significant store network and better in-store salvage opportunities (e.g., J.C. Penney) might be better off charging a fee for online returns in order to nudge customers to return in store. Finally, an omnichannel firm should be cautious both in making the return process more convenient and in improving accessibility to its stores, because these seemingly beneficial policies, if combined with a partial-refund policy, could undermine the firm’s overall profit.

  abstract     = {Frequently, policy makers seek to roll out an intervention previously proven effective in a research study, perhaps subject to resource constraints. However, because different subpopulations may respond differently to the same treatment, there is no a priori guarantee that the intervention will be as effective in the targeted population as it was in the study. How then should policy makers target individuals to maximize intervention effectiveness? We propose a novel robust optimization approach that leverages evidence typically available in a published study. Our model can be easily optimized in minutes for realistic instances with off-the-shelf software and is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of resource and fairness constraints. We compare our approach with current practice by proving performance guarantees for both approaches, which emphasize their structural differences. We also prove an intuitive interpretation of our model in terms of regularization, penalizing differences in the demographic distribution between targeted individuals and the study population. Although the precise penalty depends on the choice of uncertainty set, we show that for special cases we can recover classical penalties from the covariate matching literature on causal inference. Finally, using real data from a large teaching hospital, we compare our approach to common practice in the particular context of reducing emergency department utilization by Medicaid patients through case management. We find that our approach can offer significant benefits over common practice, particularly when the heterogeneity in patient response to the treatment is large.

  abstract     = {A major result in the study of two-sided platforms is the strategic interdependence between the two sides of the same platform, leading to the implication that a platform can maximize its total profits by subsidizing one of its sides. We show that this result largely depends on assuming that at least one side of the market single-homes. As technology makes joining multiple platforms easier, we increasingly observe that participants on both sides of two-sided platforms multihome. The case of multihoming on both sides is mostly ignored in the literature on competition between two-sided platforms. We help to fill this gap by developing a model for platform competition in a differentiated setting (a Hotelling line), which is similar to other models in the literature but focuses on the case where at least some agents on each side multihome. We show that when both sides in a platform market multihome, the strategic interdependence between the two sides of the same platform will diminish or even disappear. Our analysis suggests that the common strategic advice to subsidize one side in order to maximize total profits may be limited or even incorrect when both sides multihome, which is an important caveat given the increasing prevalence of multihoming in platform markets.

  abstract     = {We study supply chains where multiple suppliers sell to multiple retailers through a wholesale market. In practice, we often observe that both suppliers and retailers tend to influence the wholesale market price that retailers pay to suppliers. However, existing models of supply chain competition do not capture retailers’ influence on the wholesale price (i.e., buyer power) and show that the wholesale price and the order quantity per retailer do not change with the number of retailers. To overcome this limitation, we develop a competition model based on the market game mechanism in which the wholesale price is determined based on both suppliers’ and retailers’ decisions. When taking into account retailers’ buyer power, we obtain the result that is consistent with the observed practice: As the number of retailers increases, each retailer’s buyer power decreases, and each retailer is willing to pay more for her order, so the wholesale price increases. In this case, supply chain expansion to include more retailers (or suppliers) turns out to be more beneficial in terms of supply chain efficiency than what the prior literature shows without considering buyer power. Finally, we analyze the integration of two local supply chains and show that although the profit of the integrated supply chain is greater than the sum of total profits of local supply chains, integration may reduce the total profit of firms in a retailer-oriented supply chain that has more retailers than suppliers.

  abstract     = {Consumers are often uncertain about their valuations for product quality when choosing among different products and will learn their valuations only after buying and using a product. Some consumers may thus experience overpurchase or underpurchase regret, depending on whether they have purchased a higher- or lower-quality level than what they would have chosen had they known their true valuations. When consumers anticipate their potential postpurchase regret, their purchase decisions may be affected. Our analysis shows that overpurchase regret lowers the firm’s profit, but underpurchase regret can benefit the firm if consumers’ overpurchase regret is not strong. When the firm optimally designs its product line, the quality difference between its offerings will be larger (smaller) if consumers’ anticipated regret increases (reduces) its profit. Surprisingly, although anticipated regret tends to reduce consumers’ utility, in equilibrium, the presence of anticipated regret can increase consumers’ expected surplus. We further examine when the firm should allow consumers to return their products by paying a restocking fee and how the optimal restocking fee will change with consumers’ propensities for the two types of regret. We also experimentally show that consumers’ propensities of underpurchase and overpurchase regret are different and can be influenced by the firm’s messages.

In this paper, I show that collusion may also in some cases facilitate the creation of unexpected new sources of value. I bring this possibility into focus through the lens of a historical episode from the 19th century, when colluding railroads in the U.S. South converted 13,000 miles of railroad track to standard gauge over the course of two days in 1886, integrating the South into the national transportation network. Route-level freight traffic data reveal that the gauge change caused a large shift in market share from steamships to railroads, but did not affect total shipments or prices on these routes. Guided by these results, I develop a model of compatibility choice in a collusive market and argue that collusion may have enabled the gauge change to take place as it did, while also tempering the effects on prices and total shipments.

  abstract     = {Models in which current utility depends solely on current consumption (a.k.a. time-separable preferences) are widely acknowledged to be unrealistic, especially when attempting to describe preferences over consumption rates. Alternatively, one may stipulate that instant utility also depends on a state, for example, some stock of past consumption. Escaping the gravitational pull of time separability, however, is difficult because (1) the behavioral axioms that characterize the state and the instant utility are not known, (2) how to elicit the preference parameters—most notably the initial level of the state and the decay rate—is not known, and (3) managerial applications where state-dependent preferences produce interesting insights and solutions are scarce. This paper makes advances on these three fronts by proposing a novel set of axioms that characterize the satiation model, a proof of concept on how to elicit all preference parameters using consumption rates, and a mixed-integer linear formulation to solve the optimal design of experiential services under satiation. Our preferences introduce a de-satiation motive, absent in separable preferences, and we explore how to optimally manage this motive.

  abstract     = {Combining forecasts is an established approach for improving forecast accuracy. So-called optimal weights (OWs) estimate combination weights by minimizing errors on past forecasts. Yet the most successful and common approach ignores all training data and assigns equal weights (EWs) to forecasts. We analyze this phenomenon by relating forecast combination to statistical learning theory, which decomposes forecast errors into three components: bias, variance, and irreducible error. In this framework, EWs minimize the variance component (errors resulting from estimation uncertainty) but ignore the bias component (errors from under-sensitivity to training data). OWs, in contrast, minimize the bias and ignore the variance component. Reducing one component in general increases the other. To address this trade-off between bias and variance, we first derive the expected squared error of a combination using weights between EWs and OWs (technically, OWs shrunk toward EWs) and decompose it into the three error components. We then use the components to derive the shrinkage factor between EWs and OWs that minimizes the expected error. We evaluate the approach on forecasts from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Survey of Professional Forecasters. For these forecasts, we first show that assumptions regarding the error distribution that are commonly used in theoretical analyses are likely to be violated in practice. We then demonstrate that our approach improves over EWs and OWs if the assumptions are met, for instance, as the result of using a standardization procedure for the training data.

  abstract     = {In this article, we examine whether consumers may “accidentally” endanger a product they own when a new version of the product is introduced. We propose that owners endanger their product when they want to upgrade to a new version but have difficulty justifying the upgrade and that owners find justification more difficult when a new version offers an improved design but does not offer a significant technological improvement. Owners endanger their product hoping that it will be fortuitously damaged. Product damage provides owners with a good reason to upgrade. Focusing on iPhone as a case study, field data and experiments provide evidence for product endangering, and they support the role of justification in three ways. First, as hypothesized, endangering occurs when the new product offers an improved design but does not offer a significant technological improvement. Second, owners are less likely to endanger a product that is under warranty; therefore, damage to it will not enable upgrading. Third, owners are more likely to endanger their product when their justification concerns are heightened. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, decision analysis .},

  abstract     = {We explore marketplace design in the context of a business-to-business platform specializing in liquidation auctions. Even when the platform’s aggregate levels of supply and demand remain fixed, we establish that the platform’s ability to use its design levers to manage the availability of supply over time yields significant value. We study two such levers, each using the platform’s availability of supply as a means to incentivize participation from buyers who decide strategically when/how often to participate. First, the platform’s listing policy sets the ending times of incoming auctions (hence, the frequency of market clearing). Exploiting a natural experiment, we illustrate that consolidating auctions’ ending times to certain weekdays increases the platform’s revenues by 7.3\% mainly by inducing a higher level of bidder participation. The second lever is a recommendation system that can be used to reveal information about real-time market thickness to potential bidders. The optimization of these levers highlights a novel trade-off. Namely, when the platform consolidates auctions’ ending times, more bidders may participate in the marketplace (demand-side competition); but ultimately auctions for substitutable goods cannibalize one another (supply-side competition). To optimize these design decisions, we estimate a structural model that endogenizes bidders’ dynamic behavior, that is, their decisions on whether/how often to participate in the marketplace and how much to bid. We find that appropriately designing a recommendation system yields an additional revenue increase (on top of the benefits obtained by optimizing the platform’s listing policy) by reducing supply-side cannibalization and altering the composition of participating bidders.

  abstract     = {We integrate the results of a social network survey and a forecast information sharing experiment to examine the roles of trust and trustworthiness in impacting high-ranking executives’ decisions in supply chain interactions. The members of our executive sample have, on average, 17 years of work experience. A significant portion of them holds positions at the C-level in world-leading organizations that span a wide range of industries. By examining the roles of trust and trustworthiness in the decision making of high-ranking executives, we find strong external validation for as well as demonstrate how these nonpecuniary, behavioral factors impact the outcomes of business interactions. We employ a multimethod research design that allows us to investigate the extent to which the executives’ trust beliefs toward a relevant network of exchange partners (which we define as their “network trust”) impact their trust behaviors when engaging in business interactions with members of this network. We determine the conditions pertaining to the executives’ professional experiences that strengthen or weaken the impact of network trust on the executives’ trust behaviors in supply chain interactions. For example, executives with more diverse professional experiences rely more on network trust to shape their trust behaviors. Conversely, executives with prior positive trust experiences rely less on network trust in their trusting behaviors. We quantify that improved trust and trustworthiness can yield up to 41\%, 6\%, and 5\% gain in the expected profit of the supplier, the retailer, and the supply chain. Our results offer tangible implications for how organizations can better leverage executives’ knowledge about how much to rely on network trust in business interactions to achieve better outcomes.

  abstract     = {Extant theories of intertemporal choice entangle two aspects of time preference: impatience and time inconsistency. Impatient people focus on present consumption without worrying too much about the future; they may spend freely and avoid exercise. An outsider might question their choices, but impatient people do not experience conflict over those choices. By contrast, people who are time-inconsistent intend to save and exercise, but they fail to do so when temptation is proximate. Such individuals are conflicted; their preferences today differ from their preferences tomorrow. I characterize the interaction between impatience and time inconsistency in three leading models of temporal discounting that go beyond the exponential model, which does not predict time inconsistency at any level of impatience. The quasi-hyperbolic model predicts that time inconsistency increases with patience, whereas the hyperbolic model makes the opposite prediction. The constant-sensitivity model predicts that time inconsistency peaks at a moderate level of impatience. The results of an experiment using real monetary consequences with delays of up to one year align most closely with the prediction of the constant-sensitivity model.

When agents have other-regarding preferences and imperfectly optimize, the encouragement effect is strongest. The explorative nature of the game raises the expected surplus compared with a payoff equivalent public goods game. We empirically confirm our main theoretical predictions using a novel experimental paradigm.

  abstract     = {Current regulations on e-cigarettes are minimal compared with cigarette regulations, despite their growing popularity globally. Advocates of e-cigarettes claim that they aid in ceasing smoking habits. However, leaving e-cigarettes unregulated has raised growing health concerns. Policymakers in several countries, including the United States and those in Europe, are considering and experimenting with policy interventions. To evaluate current policies and implement potential regulations on e-cigarettes, policymakers must understand the impact of e-cigarettes on consumers’ smoking behaviors. To address this issue, we construct a dynamic structural model that incorporates consumers’ purchases and consumption behaviors of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. The results from our proposed model indicate that consumption of e-cigarettes promotes, rather than counteracts, smoking. This is because the less costly e-cigarettes incentivize consumers to build their addiction to nicotine, which, in return, increases future consumption of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. This finding calls for regulations on e-cigarettes. We then conduct counterfactual analyses to evaluate two policy regulations on e-cigarettes: (1) e-cigarette taxes and (2) price regulation. Because both of these policies have been discussed extensively in both the United States and many countries in the European Union, results of our policy simulations address these policy debates. We find that both are effective in reducing overall consumption of cigarettes and e-cigarettes. We also examine the role of consumers’ heterogeneity on the simulation results as well as the policy implications. We conclude with future research directions, such as inclusion of social influence and cross-selling marketing. This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing .},

We use a field experiment on a massive open online course to study the role of forum size (number of people in a forum) in the contribution of content per person. We find that larger forums elicit more contributions per person. The number of questions and other help-seeking threads posted per person was unchanged by forum size, but replies and other more conversational posts increased sharply. Most of the positive effect of size was in a subset of socially responsive subjects. The implication of social responsiveness driving our results is that the unequal distribution of contribution in online platforms is unlikely to be easily changed: if more contributions are elicited from infrequent contributors, the greatest contributors would contribute even more because there would be more to respond to.

  abstract     = {How does market competition affect pay inequality between and within firms? Using division managers as a pool of similar workers and the Canada–U.S. Free Trade Agreement, we find that greater competition increases overall pay inequality between, but not within, firms. This null effect within firms is not driven by a lack of statistical power. Instead, we find that it arises primarily within subsamples of firms with higher predicted levels of social comparison. Increased competition leads to greater pay-performance sensitivity among the higher-paid managers within firms, while it leads to greater overpayment among the other managers. These patterns are consistent with firm principals offering higher-powered incentives to their best managers and overpaying the rest. Altogether, this study suggests that, while competition leads to greater pay inequality overall, principals aim to maintain equality within firms and do so through the differential provision of incentives among employees.

The paper also shows that issuers often delay less favorable ratings until after a bond is sold. Consistent with theoretical models of ratings shopping, these effects are strongest among more complex bonds that are more difficult to rate. Bonds with upward-biased ratings are more likely to be downgraded and default, but investors account for this bias and demand higher yields when buying these bonds.

  abstract     = {We develop a conceptually grounded approach, based on the International Accounting Standards Board’s conceptual framework, to the accounting for the rights and obligations embodied in a cap-and-trade program. Under this approach, firms recognize allowances as intangible assets, initially measured at fair value with a credit to cash for purchased allowances and to a current period gain for allocated allowances; firms recognize current period expense and accrue liabilities, at fair value, as they emit; both asset and liability are remeasured at fair value at every reporting date. We apply our treatment and three alternative treatments, based on current practice and proposals considered by standard setters, to transaction-level data from the U.S. sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program to calculate as-if financial statement outcomes using actual data. The alternative treatments result in noncomparable accounting for otherwise similar arrangements. To provide ex ante evidence on the effects of noncomparable accounting, we analyze reporting outcomes and show that alternative accounting treatments of the same arrangement result in meaningful differences in reported assets and liabilities, income volatility, and commonly used performance and leverage metrics. Because the financial reporting effects of noncomparable accounting are exacerbated by business combinations and plant-level purchases of allocated allowances that may have been initially recorded at zero, our analysis explicitly accounts for the effects of these transactions. Finally, we find that among the four accounting treatments we consider, reporting outcomes under our proposed approach are most aligned with investor perceptions, as indicated by the associations between the market value of equity and assets, liabilities, and income.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem faced by a firm that receives highly differentiated products in an online fashion. The firm needs to price these products to sell them to its customer base. Products are described by vectors of features and the market value of each product is linear in the values of the features. The firm does not initially know the values of the different features, but can learn the values of the features based on whether products were sold at the posted prices in the past. This model is motivated by applications such as online marketplaces, online flash sales, and loan pricing. We first consider a multidimensional version of binary search over polyhedral sets and show that it has a worst-case regret which is exponential in the dimension of the feature space. We then propose a modification of the prior algorithm where uncertainty sets are replaced by their Löwner-John ellipsoids. We show that this algorithm has a worst-case regret which is quadratic in the dimension of the feature space and logarithmic in the time horizon. We also show how to adapt our algorithm to the case where valuations are noisy. Finally, we present computational experiments to illustrate the performance of our algorithm.

  abstract     = {What can be done to combat political misinformation? One prominent intervention involves attaching warnings to headlines of news stories that have been disputed by third-party fact-checkers. Here we demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated potential consequence of such a warning: an implied truth effect , whereby false headlines that fail to get tagged are considered validated and thus are seen as more accurate. With a formal model, we demonstrate that Bayesian belief updating can lead to such an implied truth effect. In Study 1 ( n = 5,271 MTurkers), we find that although warnings do lead to a modest reduction in perceived accuracy of false headlines relative to a control condition (particularly for politically concordant headlines), we also observed the hypothesized implied truth effect: the presence of warnings caused untagged headlines to be seen as more accurate than in the control. In Study 2 ( n = 1,568 MTurkers), we find the same effects in the context of decisions about which headlines to consider sharing on social media. We also find that attaching verifications to some true headlines—which removes the ambiguity about whether untagged headlines have not been checked or have been verified—eliminates, and in fact slightly reverses, the implied truth effect. Together these results contest theories of motivated reasoning while identifying a potential challenge for the policy of using warning tags to fight misinformation—a challenge that is particularly concerning given that it is much easier to produce misinformation than it is to debunk it.

We derive positive and normative implications depending on the extent of competition among senders, whether receivers are wary of senders collecting personalized data, and whether firms are able to personalize prices. We show how both senders and receivers can benefit from selective disclosure. Privacy laws requiring senders to obtain consent to acquire personal information that enables such selective disclosure increases receiver welfare if and only if there is little or asymmetric competition among senders, if receivers are unwary, and if firms can price discriminate.

  abstract     = {Lacking credible rule-enforcement mechanisms to punish misconduct, existing reward-based crowdfunding platforms can leave backers exposed to two risks: entrepreneurs may run away with backers’ money (funds misappropriation), and product specifications may be misrepresented (performance opacity). We show that each of these risks can materially impact crowdfunding efficiency, and, when jointly present, they interact with each other in ways that can dampen or, more worryingly, amplify their individual adverse effects. To mitigate these risks, we propose two mechanisms based on deferred payments. The first involves stopping the campaign once the funding goal is reached and servicing any unmet demand in the aftermarket. The second involves escrowing any funds raised in excess of the goal, as insurance for backers. We show that early stopping dominates escrow and boosts platform revenues. Pairing these deferred payment designs with (costly) performance verification contingencies can bring additional gains, but doing so can flip their relative performance, with escrow coming out on top. Overall, by accounting for different timing (pre- versus post-campaign) and enforcement rules (mandatory versus optional) of the verification contingencies, we analyze a total of 10 different designs and show that two of them dominate: the early stopping design and the escrow design with mandatory ex-post verification. We conclude by providing recommendations for which design works best under different conditions and exploring the potential of crowdsourced performance checks.

  abstract     = {We study how three matching institutions, differing in how relationships are dissolved, affect cooperation in a repeated prisoner’s dilemma and how cooperation rates are affected by the presence of a reputation mechanism. Although cooperation is theoretically sustainable under all institutions, we show experimentally that cooperation rates are lowest under random matching, highest under fixed matching, and intermediate in a flexible matching institution, where subjects have the option to dissolve relationships. Our results also suggest important interactions between the matching institution and reputation mechanism. Under both the random matching and flexible matching institutions, both subjective (based on subjects’ ratings) and objective (based on subjects’ actions) reputation mechanisms lead to substantial increases in cooperative behavior. However, under fixed matching, only the subjective reputation mechanism leads to higher cooperation. We argue that these differences are due to different reputation mechanisms being more forgiving of early deviations from cooperation under certain matching institutions, which gives subjects the ability to learn the value of cooperation rather than getting stuck with a bad reputation and, consequently, uncooperative relationships.

A long–short portfolio that exploits this differential firm behavior earns abnormal returns of up to 149 basis points per month or almost 18\% per year. We find similar evidence in an international sample of earnings call transcripts from the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Japan.

  abstract     = {We study the role of ad networks in the online advertising market. Our baseline model considers two publishers that can outsource the sale of their ad inventories to an ad network, in a market where consumers and advertisers multi-home. The ad network increases total advertising revenue by tracking consumers across outlets and reduces competition between publishers by centralizing the sale of ads. Consequently, outsourcing to the ad network benefits the publishers, but may penalize the advertisers. We show that the ad network’s ability to track consumers may either expand or reduce the provision of ads, depending on consumers’ preferences for the publishers and how advertisers use tracking information. Specifically, tracking is more likely to expand (respectively, reduce) the provision of ads when consumers’ preferences for the publishers are positively (respectively, negatively) correlated. Tracking is also more likely to expand (respectively, reduce) the provision of ads when advertisers use tracking information to cap the frequency of impressions (respectively, target specific consumers). Furthermore, we study the implications of consumers’ choice to block tracking. Generally, blocking negatively impacts the advertising industry by making ad allocation less effective. Blocking also entails an externality on consumers, which is negative when tracking reduces the provision of ads. Given these conditions, regulatory restrictions on tracking may reduce consumer surplus as well as advertising revenue. These findings contrast with the presumption that regulation should make it easier for consumers to avoid tracking. We propose further extensions, including competing ad networks, more than two publishers, and networks that do not sell ads, but only tracking information to the advertisers.

In a 2 × 2 between-subjects design, we vary the length of the journey and whether a business card is elicited. We find that (1) the majority of drivers give at least part of the journey for free, (2) giving is proportional to the length of the journey, and (3) 27\% of drivers complete the journey. Evidence of outgroup negativity against black testers is also reported. In order to link our empirical analysis to behavioral theory, we estimate the parameters of a number of utility functions.

Current customers’ incentives to engage in WoM can affect the contracting problem of a firm in the presence of positive externalities of users. Formally, we consider a classic Maskin–Riley contracting problem for the receiver of WoM where the firm can pay the senders referral rewards and a sender experiences positive externalities if the receiver adopts. A free contract can incentivize WoM because the higher adoption probability increases the expected externalities that the sender receives. We characterize the optimal incentive scheme and show when the two tools serve as substitutes and complements to each other depending on whether the market is niche and whether the product is social. We show that offering a free contract is optimal only if the fraction of premium users in the population is small, which is consistent with the observation that companies that successfully offer “freemium” contracts oftentimes have a high percentage of free users.

  abstract     = {We consider an inventory control problem with multiple products and stockout substitution. The firm knows neither the primary demand distribution for each product nor the customers’ substitution probabilities between products a priori, and it needs to learn such information from sales data on the fly. One challenge in this problem is that the firm cannot distinguish between primary demand and substitution (overflow) demand from the sales data of any product, and lost sales are not observable. To circumvent these difficulties, we construct learning stages with each stage consisting of a cyclic exploration scheme and a benchmark exploration interval. The benchmark interval allows us to isolate the primary demand information from the sales data, and then this information is used against the sales data from the cyclic exploration intervals to estimate substitution probabilities. Because raising the inventory level helps obtain primary demand information but hinders substitution demand information, inventory decisions have to be carefully balanced to learn them together. We show that our learning algorithm admits a worst-case regret rate that (almost) matches the theoretical lower bound, and numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm performs very well.

In a 2 × 2 design, we manipulate the size of the outside option, ω , and whether the number of entrants is disclosed between the stages. Theory predicts more entry for lower ω and the levels of entry and aggregate investment to be independent of disclosure in all cases. We find empirical entry frequencies decreasing with ω . For aggregate investment, we find no effect of disclosure when ω is low but a strong positive effect of disclosure when ω is high. The difference is driven by substantial overinvestment in contests with a small, publicly known number of players contrasted by more restrained investment in contests in which the number of players is uncertain and may be small.

  abstract     = {Providing patients with timely care from the appropriate unit involves both correct clinical evaluation of patient needs and making admission decisions to effectively manage a unit with limited capacity in the face of stochastic patient arrivals and lengths of stay. We study human decision behavior in the latter operations management task. Using behavioral models and controlled experiments in which physicians and MTurk workers manage a simulated hospital unit, we identify cognitive and environmental factors that drive systematic admission decision bias. We report on two main findings. First, seemingly innocuous “occupancy information hurdles” (e.g., having to type a password to view current occupancy) can cause a chain of events that leads physicians to maintain systematically lower unit utilization. Specifically, these hurdles cause physicians to make most admission decisions without checking the current unit occupancy. Then—between the times that they do check—physicians underestimate the number of available beds when occupancy increases from admissions are more salient than occupancy decreases from discharges. Second, decision-related random error or “noise” leads to higher- or lower-than-optimal utilization of hospital units in predictable patterns, depending on the system parameters. We provide evidence that these patterns are due to some settings providing more opportunity for physicians to mistakenly admit patients and other settings that provide more opportunity to mistakenly reject patients. These findings help identify when and why clinicians are likely to make inefficient decisions because of human cognitive limitations and suggest mitigation strategies to help hospital units improve their capacity management.

Racial biases are particularly worrisome in healthcare, where underrepresented minorities suffer disparities in access to care, quality of care, and clinical outcomes. In this paper, we examine the role clinical decision support systems (CDSS) play in attenuating systematic biases among black patients, relative to white patients, in rates of amputation and revascularization stemming from diabetes mellitus. Using a panel of inpatient data and a difference-in-difference approach, results suggest that CDSS adoption significantly shrinks disparities in amputation rates across white and black patients—with no evidence that this change is simply delaying eventual amputations. Results suggest that this effect is driven by changes in treatment care protocols that match patients to appropriate specialists, rather than altering within physician decision making. These findings highlight the role information systems and digitized patient care can play in promoting unbiased decision making by structuring and standardizing care procedures.

  abstract     = {Data-driven decision-making (DDD) is rapidly transforming modern operations. The availability of big data, advances in data analytics tools, and rapid gains in processing power enable firms to make decisions based on data rather than intuition. Yet, most firms still allow managers to override decisions from DDD tools, as managers might possess private information not present in the DDD tool.

  abstract     = {Using data from 44 countries, we document a new channel through which a family business group’s internal capital market supports its members. We find that groups use internal capital to incubate difficult-to-finance projects, making it feasible for them to rapidly scale up, thus facilitating their initial public offering (IPO) market access. This IPO support role is particularly valuable when groups find capital-raising through seasoned equity offerings less attractive because of control-retention concerns and in capital markets with high new-firm financing barriers. Unlike carve-outs employed as a corporate restructuring strategy, group-affiliated IPOs primarily appear to serve a group’s expansion goals rather than its liquidation needs.

  abstract     = {We examine a model of Cournot competition with congestion motivated by recent policy to allow commercial sharing of wireless spectrum that is assigned to other users such as government agencies. A key feature of such spectrum is that it is intermittently available because of the incumbent user’s activity. In our model, wireless service providers (SPs) compete for a common pool of customers using their own proprietary (exclusively licensed) bands of spectrum along with access to an additional intermittent band. When the intermittent band is unavailable, any traffic carried on that band must be shifted to the proprietary bands. Customers are sensitive to both the price they pay and the average congestion they experience across the bands of spectrum from which they receive service. We compare two different access policies for this intermittent band: one in which it is open to all SPs and one in which it is licensed to a single SP. We also allow the band to be divided into multiple subbands where each subband is either open or licensed. We characterize trade-offs between social welfare and consumer welfare that depend on the choice of different access policies and assignments of subbands to SPs. These can involve subtle issues related to the ability of a larger SP to make more efficient use of intermittent spectrum and the increase in competition by assigning more spectrum to smaller SPs.

The MSA’s Transparency in Supply Chains clause introduced new reporting requirements mandating certain firms to provide an annual statement outlining how they identify and mitigate modern slavery in their business and supply chain. An event study of stock price reactions of UK firms covered by the MSA to eight events associated with its adoption provides no evidence of abnormal stock returns. We do, however, uncover significant cross-sectional differences in stock price reactions, with results suggesting that the MSA provides a competitive advantage to firms with a demonstrated track record of addressing slavery risk. We find no effects for preregulatory corporate social responsibility disclosure levels on stock price reactions. Our findings highlight the economic value of maintaining socially responsible sourcing practices and inform the current policy debate on the importance of greater transparency in corporate supply chains.

We investigate the implications of such social comparisons on sales agents’ effort decisions and their incentives to help or collaborate with each other. We then characterize the firm’s optimal sales force compensation scheme and the conditions under which wage transparency benefits the firm. Our results show that the work environment—which includes such aspects as demand uncertainty, correlation across sales territories, and the possibility of help/collaboration—plays a significant role in the firm’s compensation and wage transparency decisions. In particular, wage transparency is more likely to benefit the firm when demand uncertainty is low, sales outcomes are positively correlated across different sales territories, and sales agents can collaborate at low cost. We find that, contrary to conventional wisdom, social comparisons need not reduce collaboration among agents.

  abstract     = {Prospect Theory’s value function suggests that investors would be risk averse in the gain domain and risk seeking in the loss domain—that is, the reflection effect. However, most of the experimental evidence relies on choice tasks in the gain domain between prospects marked in dollar amounts and considering non-mixed lotteries. There is not much work that examines environments with properties typical in investment decisions where the task is fund allocation involving mixed lotteries with outcomes being rate of return. The recent negative deposit rates in Europe demonstrate the importance of this question and, in particular, understanding investment decisions in the loss domain. This paper fills this gap by using a series of laboratory experiments mimicking these properties of investment decisions with a range of investment amounts and with the money to invest either being earned and literally on the table or not. Yet, no matter the settings, we find no evidence for the reflection effect in investment, and behavior is most consistent with maximizing expected return. This holds regardless of the language used (abstract or not), whether we use a two- or a three-state lottery, whether the task is continuous rather than discrete, or the risky portfolio is a mixed lottery.

  abstract     = {In the school choice market, where scarce public school seats are assigned to students, a key operational issue is how to reassign seats that are vacated after an initial round of centralized assignment. Practical solutions to the reassignment problem must be simple to implement, truthful, and efficient while also alleviating costly student movement between schools. We propose and axiomatically justify a class of reassignment mechanisms, the permuted lottery deferred acceptance (PLDA) mechanisms. Our mechanisms generalize the commonly used deferred acceptance (DA) school choice mechanism to a two-round setting and retain its desirable incentive and efficiency properties. School choice systems typically run DA with a lottery number assigned to each student to break ties in school priorities. We show that under natural conditions on demand, the second-round tie-breaking lottery can be correlated arbitrarily with that of the first round without affecting allocative welfare and that reversing the lottery order between rounds minimizes reassignment among all PLDA mechanisms. Empirical investigations based on data from New York City high school admissions support our theoretical findings. This paper was accepted by Gad Allon, operations management.},

We explore how the response of aggregate demand to price changes with temporal distance in a large, proprietary data set of Florida cruise prices, bookings, and product attributes. We offer the first evidence that cruise demand becomes more sensitive to price during the advance sales period, unlike extant findings in other settings. The results also show that demand is greatest late in the advance sales period, providing the first finding that a late-season high-demand period coincides with a late-season increase in aggregate price sensitivity. The high-demand effect more than offsets the high-price-responsiveness pattern, leading the firm to increase prices throughout the advance sales period. Although the data do not disentangle multiple competing explanations for the main findings, they are large enough to appear in simple data visualizations and robust enough to replicate across many model specifications, parameterizations, and partitions of the data.

ATO problems with general structure and integrality constraints are well known to be difficult to solve, and we provide new insight into these issues by establishing worst-case approximation guarantees through primal-dual analyses and linear programming (LP) rounding. First, we relax the one-period ATO problem using a natural newsvendor decomposition and use the dual solution for the relaxation to derive a lower bound on optimal cost, providing a tight approximation guarantee that grows with the maximum product size in the system. Then, we present an LP rounding algorithm that achieves both asymptotic optimality as demand grows large, and a 1.8 approximation factor for any problem instance. In addition to theoretical guarantees, we perform comprehensive numerical simulations and find that our rounding algorithm outperforms existing techniques and is close to optimal. Finally, we demonstrate that our one-period LP rounding results can be used to develop an asymptotically optimal integral policy for dynamic ATO problems with backlogging and identical component lead-times.

  abstract     = {A substantial collection of work in operations management considers settings where a firm faces uncertain demand that depends on parameters that are ex ante unknown but can be learned by observing historical data. This work typically assumes that future demand is unaffected by the firm’s learning process. However, in the new era of social media, it is increasingly the case that the information used by the firm to gauge future demand (for example, sales and stockouts or consumer feedback) is now also observable to the consumers and may influence their purchase decisions. In this paper, we consider a newsvendor model where a product of ex ante unknown value is sold in an environment where learning is “two-sided” in that both the firm and the consumers learn the product’s value over time by observing the same information. The analysis establishes a consequential insight: When learning is two-sided, the value of information is often negative for the firm; as a result, the firm’ optimal stocking quantity is often lower than that under one-sided learning. Moreover, under certain conditions that we identify, we show that the optimal stocking quantity can be even lower than the critical fractile policy, in stark contrast to the recurring prescription found in existing literature of “stocking more” in the presence of learning. Additional results and numerical experiments suggest that the loss for the firm from failing to account for the two-sidedness of the learning process can be significant.

Specifically, the growth of domestic (national) corporate profits, on average, has outpaced the growth of the domestic (national) economy, and this disconnect increases as the difference between the U.S. corporate income tax rate and the average tax rate of the other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries increases. The underlying mechanism is fewer corporate profits being channeled into subsequent domestic investments when the U.S. tax rate is relatively higher, leading to lower economic growth.

These exchange hazards are higher when the seller can engage in unverifiable deliberate obfuscation. Although cost-plus contracts reduce holdup losses, they suffer from cost inefficiency. Past research has underscored the importance of trust as a control instrument to mitigate losses from exchange hazards, especially social relational trust that develops from past experiences. However, trust can also be calculative when it develops from the expectation of future economic gains to the buyer-seller dyad. We identify two dyadic mechanisms that generate calculative trust and curtail the likelihood of cost-inefficient behavior in cost-plus contracts. These mechanisms include future potential and bilateral reputation capital for cost containment. Analysis using probit estimations on 149 information technology outsourcing contracts for the period 1998 to 2005 suggests that calculative trust increases the likelihood of cost-plus contracts. Thus, calculative trust can mitigate inefficiencies in interfirm contracts. This paper was accepted by Shiva Rajgopal, accounting.},

Signaling through inventory being only tenable when inventory transactions are verifiable at low enough cost, we then turn our attention to how this verifiability can be achieved in practice and argue that blockchain technology could enable it more efficiently than traditional monitoring mechanisms. To demonstrate, we develop b_verify, an open-source blockchain protocol that leverages Bitcoin to provide supply chain transparency at scale and in a cost-effective way. The paper identifies an important benefit of blockchain adoption—by opening a window of transparency into a firm’s supply chain, blockchain technology furnishes the ability to secure favorable financing terms at lower signaling costs.

  abstract     = {How individuals manage, organize, and complete their tasks is central to operations management. Recent research in operations focuses on how under conditions of increasing workload individuals can decrease their service time, up to a point, to complete work more quickly. As the number of tasks increases, however, workers may also manage their workload by a different process—task selection. Drawing on research on workload, individual discretion, and behavioral decision making, we theorize and then test that under conditions of increased workload, individuals may choose to complete easier tasks to manage their load. We label this behavior task completion preference (TCP). Using six years of data from a hospital emergency department, we find that physicians engage in TCP, with implications for their performance. Specifically, TCP helps physicians manage variance in service times; however, although it initially appears to improve shift-level throughput volume, after adjusting for the complexity of the work completed, TCP is related to worse throughput. Moreover, we find that engaging in easier tasks compared with hard ones is related to lower learning in service times. We then turn to the laboratory to replicate conceptually the short-term task selection effect under increased workload and show that it occurs because of both fatigue and the sense of progress individuals get from task completion. These findings provide another mechanism for the workload-speedup effect from the literature. We also discuss implications for both the research and the practice of operations in building systems to help people succeed. This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management .},

  abstract     = {Auctions are widely used in practice. Although auctions are also extensively studied in the literature, most of the developments rely on the significant common prior assumption. We study the design of optimal prior-independent selling mechanisms: buyers do not have any information about their competitors, and the seller does not know the distribution of values but only knows a general class to which it belongs. Anchored on the canonical model of buyers with independent and identically distributed values, we analyze a competitive ratio objective in which the seller attempts to optimize the worst-case fraction of revenues garnered compared with those of an oracle with knowledge of the distribution. We characterize properties of optimal mechanisms and in turn establish fundamental impossibility results through upper bounds on the maximin ratio. By also deriving lower bounds on the maximin ratio, we are able to crisply characterize the optimal performance for a spectrum of families of distributions. In particular, our results imply that a second price auction is an optimal mechanism when the seller only knows that the distribution of buyers has a monotone nondecreasing hazard rate, and it guarantees at least 71.53\% of oracle revenues against any distribution within this class. Furthermore, a second price auction is near optimal when the class of admissible distributions is that of those with nondecreasing virtual value function (a.k.a. regular). Under this class, it guarantees a fraction of 50\% of oracle revenues, and no mechanism can guarantee more than 55.6\%.

This result is obtained after controlling for investor-year fixed effects and date fixed effects, as well as local weather conditions. More strikingly, abnormal trade performance decreases monotonically with the levels indicating the severity of air pollution. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that air pollution makes investors more susceptible to the disposition effect and attention-driven buying behavior.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of A-B testing when the impact of the treatment is marred by a large number of covariates. Randomization can be highly inefficient in such settings, and thus we consider the problem of optimally allocating test subjects to either treatment with a view to maximizing the precision of our estimate of the treatment effect. Our main contribution is a tractable algorithm for this problem in the online setting, where subjects arrive, and must be assigned, sequentially, with covariates drawn from an elliptical distribution with finite second moment. We further characterize the gain in precision afforded by optimized allocations relative to randomized allocations, and show that this gain grows large as the number of covariates grows. Our dynamic optimization framework admits several generalizations that incorporate important operational constraints such as the consideration of selection bias, budgets on allocations, and endogenous stopping times. In a set of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method simultaneously offers better statistical efficiency and less selection bias than state-of-the-art competing biased coin designs.

  abstract     = {Some industries, such as healthcare and financial services, have reported significant productivity gains from introduction of new technologies. However, other more traditional, labor-intensive industries are lagging behind. We use granular data to examine the impact of a customer-facing technology (a tabletop device that facilitates the table service process) on the check size and meal duration aspects of restaurant performance. The restaurant chain in our study implemented tabletop devices in a staggered manner, offering us a quasi-experimental setting in which to apply a difference-in-difference technique and identify the causal effect of the technology. We find that the tabletop technology is likely to improve average sales per check by approximately 1\% (95\% confidence interval is from 0.8\% to 1.02\%), and reduce the meal duration by close to 10\% (95\% confidence interval ranges from −9.94\% to −9.54\%). The combination of these two effects increases the sales per minute or sales productivity by approximately 11\%. Various robustness checks of our empirical strategy and post hoc analyses find that tabletop technology allows low-ability waiters to improve their performance more significantly than high-ability waiters. In addition, the technology does not change the staffing level. Overall, our results indicate great potential for introducing tabletop technology in a large service industry that currently lacks digitalization.

There is a seller who dynamically sets the price of a product over a multiperiod time horizon. The expected demand for the product is a piecewise continuous and parametric function of the charged price, allowing for possibly multiple discontinuity points. The seller initially knows neither the locations of the discontinuity points nor the parameters of the demand function but can infer them by observing stochastic demand realizations over time. We measure the seller’s performance by the revenue loss relative to a clairvoyant who knows the underlying demand function with certainty. We construct a dynamic estimation-and-pricing policy that accounts for demand discontinuities, derive the convergence rates of discontinuity- and parameter-estimation errors under this policy, and prove that it achieves near-optimal revenue performance. We also extend our analysis to the cases of time-varying demand discontinuities and inventory constraints. This paper was accepted by Noah Gans, stochastic models and simulation .},

Specifically, we first examine a Big-4 effect and then explore three sources of the Big-4 effect. To test the Big-4 effect, we use a unique data set of individual audit partners for a large sample of private companies and a novel research design exploiting the fact that auditees may follow the auditor who switches affiliation from a non-Big-4 firm to a Big-4 firm. Thus, we compare audit quality and audit fees of the same partner–auditee pairs before and after the switch. The results show that the Big-4 effect exists in the private-firm segment. More important, we find evidence for three sources of the Big-4 effect. First, Big-4 firms are able to recruit non-Big-4 partners who deliver higher audit quality than other non-Big-4 partners in the preswitch period. Second, enhanced learning has taken place after the switch. Third, the increased audit quality can also be attributed to stronger incentives/monitoring . These are new findings to the literature.

This paper, for the first time, uses archivally sourced primary market records to model returns on art and introduces a novel fractional equity structure for artists. We first model what would happen if the American artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg had retained 10\% equity in their work when it was first sold. Second, we model a portfolio return using data from the Betty Parsons Gallery and the Green Gallery. To add a portfolio analysis to the performance of “star” artists, we model the galleries as a fund invested in all of artworks sold, using auction sales as the realization event. We find that the individual Johns and Rauschenberg works would have vastly outperformed equities markets. The gallery portfolio still substantially outperforms the S&amp;P, even including 20\% transaction costs. Beyond the art market, our larger conceptual framework for retained fractional equity has broad implications for compensation of early-stage creative work in any field and for potential applications of blockchain technology.

  abstract     = {The World Health Organization seeks effective ways to alert its member states about global pandemics. Motivated by this challenge, we study a public agency’s problem of designing warning policies to mitigate potential disasters that occur with advance notice. The agency privately receives early information about recurring harmful events and issues warnings to induce an uninformed stakeholder to take preemptive actions. The agency’s decision to issue a warning critically depends on its reputation, which we define as the stakeholder’s belief regarding the accuracy of the agency’s information. The agency faces then a trade-off between eliciting a proper response today and maintaining its reputation to elicit responses to future events. We formulate this problem as a dynamic Bayesian persuasion game, which we solve in closed form. We find that the agency sometimes strategically misrepresents its advance information about a current threat to cultivate its future reputation. When its reputation is sufficiently low, the agency downplays the risk and actually downplays more as its reputation improves. By contrast, when its reputation is high, the agency sometimes exaggerates the threat and exaggerates more as its reputation deteriorates. Only when its reputation is moderate does the agency send warning messages that fully disclose its private information. Our study suggests a plausible and novel rationale for some of the false alarms or omissions observed in practice. We further test the robustness of our findings to imperfect advance information, disasters without advance notice, and heterogeneous receivers.

The equivalent distribution conditions for the new rules are provided, and the fractional degree “increase in risk” is defined.

However, the customers can observe and post their observations online, and future arrivals can take into account such user-generated information when deciding whether to go to the service facility. We perform pairwise comparisons of the shared, full, and no queue-length information structures in terms of social welfare. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that the shared queue-length information may provide greater social welfare than full queue-length information when the hassle cost of the customers entering the service facility falls into some ranges, and the shared and full queue-length information structures always generate greater social welfare than no queue-length information. Therefore, the discrete disclosure of congestion through user-generated sharing can lead to as much, or even greater, social welfare as the continuous stream of real-time queue-length information disclosure and always generates greater social welfare than no queue-length information disclosure at all. These results imply that a little shared queue-length information—inaccurate and lagged—can go a long way and that it may be more socially beneficial to encourage the sharing of user-generated information among customers than to provide them with full real-time queue-length information.

  abstract     = {We study online demand fulfillment in a class of networks with limited flexibility and arbitrary numbers of resources and request types. We show analytically that such a network is both necessary and sufficient to guarantee a performance gap independent of the market size compared with networks with full flexibility, extending the previous literature from the long chains to more general sparse networks. Inspired by the performance bound, we develop simple inventory allocation rules and guidelines for designing such network structures. Numerical experiments including one using some real data from Amazon China are conducted to confirm our findings as well as some of the flexibility principles conjectured in the literature.

  abstract     = {Do people have an irrational dislike for risk? People pay less for uncertain prospects than their worst possible outcomes, and researchers have proposed that this effect occurs because people strongly dislike risk. We challenge this proposition across seven studies. Though people seem to irrationally dislike risky prospects when preference is assessed with open-ended pricing measures, such as willingness-to-pay, people display rational responses toward risky prospects when preference is assessed using rating measures, such as ratings of expected enjoyment. This discrepancy does not seem to arise because these measures (a) focus on different components of the uncertainty, (b) rely on context-dependent versus normed scales, or (c) involve voluntarily opting into an uncertain situation. Accordingly, we find that people also display rational responses toward risky prospects with time measures (i.e., willingness-to-wait and anticipated time usage) and choice. We discuss alternative explanations and crucial implications of our effects for both theory and application. This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, judgment and decision making .},

  abstract     = {In China’s transitional economy, one of the major objectives of the government is to maintain social stability. We hypothesize that, through state ownership and appointment of executives, Chinese government officials can influence firms’ labor employment decisions by limiting layoffs when firms’ sales decline. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have stickier labor costs than non-SOEs, and the presence of politically connected managers makes labor costs even stickier in SOEs while having little effect in non-SOEs. Such effects are stronger in regions with weak market institutions and during time periods when government officials are to be promoted. We also show that the government reciprocates SOEs’ sticky labor policies with subsequent subsidies. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting .},

  abstract     = {Financial models incorporating a reference point, such as the Capital Gains Overhang (CGO) model, typically assume it is fixed at the purchase price. Combining experimental and market data, this paper examines whether such models can be improved by incorporating reference-point adjustment. Using real stock prices over horizons from 6 months to 5 years, experimental evidence demonstrates that a number of salient points in the prior share price path are key determinants of the reference point, in addition to the purchase price. Market data testing is then undertaken by using the CGO model. We show that composite CGO variables, created by using a mix of salient points with weights determined in the experiment, have greater predictive power than the traditional CGO variable in both cross-sectional U.S. equity-return analysis and when analyzing the performance of double-sorted portfolios. In addition, future trading volume is more sensitive to changes in the composite CGO variables than to the traditional CGO, further emphasizing the importance of adjusting reference points.

They have become increasingly important, as reflected by the more frequent involvement of IR officers with senior executives on a day-to-day basis. We also find that large and complex firms receiving greater media attention engage more in IR activities. In addition, firms domiciled in countries with weaker legal protections for investors and poorer disclosure standards, those cross-listed in the stock markets that are outperforming, and those with high global media visibility invest in greater global outreach efforts with IR activities. Firms’ IR efforts to investors worldwide are associated with higher Tobin’s q valuation ratios.

Second, the effects were more pronounced for older and larger firms, potentially because these firms have more experience and resources to leverage exchanges and safeguard against knowledge spillovers.

  abstract     = {Many platform strategies focus on indirect network effects between sellers through platform expansion. In this paper, we show sellers on the console video game platform generate a positive intertemporal spillover effect and expand the demand for other sellers, holding the set of platform adopters fixed. We propose a novel identification strategy that leverages exogenous variation in the release timing of games exclusively available on a console platform, and examine how this variation affects the sales of games available on both platforms. We find a sizable intertemporal demand spillover effect between games: A 1\% increase in total copies sold on a platform leads to a 0.153\% increase in the sales of other games in the next month (i.e., an elasticity of 0.153). Additional analysis suggests this demand spillover effect is reminiscent of habit formation on the consumer side, in that past purchases keep end users active on the platform. Our finding provides a potential explanation for recent platform sales events and subscription services that provide free games to consumers every month.

  abstract     = {Charity organizations differ in their practice of offering donors the option to earmark their contribution: allowing donors to select the project in which their money should be invested. This paper presents two studies that provide the first empirical evidence on the appeal of such earmarking. The empirical basis of Study 1 is a unique data set consisting of 7,383 potential donors from 25 countries who participated in a randomized survey experiment. First, we find that the willingness to donate is significantly higher when earmarking is allowed. Second, we find that the effect of earmarking substantially differs in magnitude across countries. Third, we identify two cross-cultural interactions. Specifically, earmarking is less effective in countries that score lower on autonomy relative to embeddedness and in those scoring lower on egalitarianism relative to hierarchy. Fourth, we find that the earmarking effect is driven mainly by the activation of more donors and not by increases in the amounts that donors contribute. Study 2 is a follow-up experiment that replicates the basic earmarking effect, addresses limitations of our cross-cultural study, and sheds some preliminary light on the effect’s underlying process. We find that earmarking options increase potential donors’ perceptions of being able to make specific impact and also that this sense of agency helps us to understand an individual’s increased willingness to donate.

Thus, platforms exploit their market power over consumers by implementing a prominent position and allowing for large levels of obfuscation. This paper also finds that in equilibrium, there is tension between platforms and firms regarding how much price complexity is used: firms would like to use even more obfuscation than what the platform allows, so the platform must monitor firms’ prices to make sure that they are not excessively complex.

The design of equity split agreements has attracted considerable attention in the entrepreneurial community, with no convergence on a single preferred contract form. This paper experimentally examines the effectiveness of different contractual arrangements, focusing in particular on the effects of contract form and contracting timing on founder effort and on the value of the venture. Our results suggest that performance improves with the incentive strength of the contract, but they question the conventional logic that this effect is causal. Instead, we suggest a novel causal sequence. Rather than the contract form being the primitive and the behavior the derived consequence, our results suggest the reverse. The differences in contract performance are driven primarily by the sorting of high contributors into nonequal contracts and of low contributors into equal contracts; that is, equal contracts are bad for team performance not because of their incentive strength but because of the founder types that adopt them. Taken together, these results suggest that both investors and founders should pay as much (or more) attention to personality type as they do to contract form.

  abstract     = {Compensation systems have rapidly been shifting away from a fixed wage contractual payment basis. Many companies today are creating incentive compensation contracts to reward hard-working employees for jobs done well. Profit sharing (“sharing compensation contract”) and target with bonus (“target compensation contract”) are two common performance-based compensation contracts prevalent in business. We theoretically and behaviorally study the sharing and target compensation contracts in an operational context where a firm sets the parameters of the compensation contracts and a store manager, after observing the compensation contract offered to him, chooses his effort level (unobservable by the firm) and makes ordering decisions for the store. Our experimental data suggest systematic deviations from the theoretical benchmark and reveal behavioral promise and pitfalls under the two compensation contracts. In particular, the store manager is more willing to exert high effort under the target contract all else being equal. However, the store manager is also more likely to punish the firm for perceived “unfair” offers by submitting an extremely low order quantity. We find that bounded rationality plays an important role in driving a higher effort rate under the target contract than the sharing contract. We introduce a new formulation of the fairness concerns, which is referred to as by-state fairness, where individuals, rather than considering whether the expected profits received are fair, consider the fairness in the potential realized outcomes. This new formulation explains why managers are more likely to order very little to punish the firm under the target contract. In addition, we conduct validation experiments to verify our behavioral explanation. This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management .},

  abstract     = {The cities of Paris, London, Chicago, and New York (among many others) have set up bike-share systems to facilitate the use of bicycles for urban commuting. This paper estimates the impact of two facets of system performance on bike-share ridership: accessibility (how far the user must walk to reach stations) and bike-availability (the likelihood of finding a bicycle). We obtain these estimates from a structural demand model for ridership estimated using data from the Vélib’ system in Paris. We find that every additional meter of walking to a station decreases a user’s likelihood of using a bike from that station by 0.194\% (±0.0693\%), and an even more significant reduction at higher distances (&gt;300 m). These estimates imply that almost 80\% of bike-share usage comes from areas within 300 m of stations, highlighting the need for dense station networks. We find that a 10\% increase in bike-availability would increase ridership by 12.211\% (±1.097\%), three-fourths of which comes from fewer abandonments and the rest of which comes from increased user interest. We illustrate the use of our estimates in comparing the effect of adding stations or increasing bike-availabilities in different parts of the city, at different times, and in evaluating other proposed improvements.

  abstract     = {Hospital managers struggle with the day-to-day variability in patient admissions to different clinical services, each of which typically has a fixed allocation of hospital beds. In response, many hospitals engage in capacity pooling by assigning patients from a service whose designated beds are fully occupied to an available bed in a unit designated for a different service. This “off-service placement” occurs frequently, yet its impact on patient and operational measures has not been rigorously quantified. This is, in part, because of the challenge of properly accounting for the endogenous selection of off-service patients. We use an instrumental variable approach to quantify the causal effects of off-service placement of hospitalized medical/surgical patients, having accounted for the endogeneity issues. Using data from a large academic medical center with 19.6\% of medical/surgical patients placed off service on average, we find that off-service placement is associated with a 22.8\% increase in remaining hospital length of stay (LOS) and a 13.1\% increase in the likelihood of hospital readmission within 30 days. We find no significant effect on in-hospital mortality or clinical trigger (rapid response) activation. We identify longer distances to the service’s home unit as a key mechanism that drives the effect on LOS. In contrast, a mismatch in nursing specialization does not seem to explain this effect. By quantifying the effects of off-service placement on patient and operational outcomes, we enable clinicians and hospital managers to make better-informed short-term decisions about off-service placement and longer-term decisions about capacity allocation.

  abstract     = {Blockchain-based platforms often rely on token-weighted voting (“ τ -weighting”) to efficiently crowdsource information from their users for a wide range of applications, including content curation and on-chain governance. We examine the effectiveness of such decentralized platforms for harnessing the wisdom and effort of the crowd. We find that τ -weighting generally discourages truthful voting and erodes the platform’s predictive power unless users are “strategic enough” to unravel the underlying aggregation mechanism. Platform accuracy decreases with the number of truthful users and the dispersion in their token holdings, and in many cases, platforms would be better off with a “flat” 1/ n mechanism. When, prior to voting, strategic users can exert effort to endogenously improve their signals, users with more tokens generally exert more effort—a feature often touted in marketing materials as a core advantage of τ -weighting—however, this feature is not attributable to the mechanism itself, and more importantly, the ensuing equilibrium fails to achieve the first-best accuracy of a centralized platform. The optimality gap decreases as the distribution of tokens across users approaches a theoretical optimum, which we derive, but tends to increase with the dispersion in users’ token holdings.

  abstract     = {We present a general framework to study the design of spare parts logistics in the presence of three-dimensional (3-D) printing technology. We consider multiple parts facing stochastic demands and adopt procure/manufacture-to-stock versus print-on-demand to highlight the main difference of production modes featured in traditional manufacturing and 3-D printing. To minimize long-run average system cost, our model determines which parts to stock and which to print. We find that the optimal 3-D printer’s utilization increases as the additional unit cost of printing declines and the printing speed improves. The rate of increase, however, decays, demonstrating the well-known diminishing returns effect. We also find the optimal utilization to increase in part variety and decrease in part criticality, suggesting the value of 3-D technology in tolerating large part variety and the value of inventory for critical parts. By examining the percentage cost savings enabled by 3-D printing, we find that, although the reduction in printing cost continuously adds to the value of 3-D printing in a linear fashion, the impact of the improvement of printing speed exhibits S-shaped growth. We also derive various structural properties of the problem and devise an efficient algorithm to obtain near optimal solutions. Finally, our numerical study shows that the 3-D printer is, in general, lightly used under realistic parameter settings but results in significant cost savings, suggesting complementarity between stock and print in cost minimization.

  abstract     = {Consumers regard product delivery as an important service component that influences their shopping decisions on online retail platforms. Delivering products to customers in a timely and reliable manner enhances customer experience and companies’ profitability. In this research, we explore the extent to which customers value a high-quality delivery experience when shopping online. Our identification strategy exploits a natural experiment: a clash between SF Express and Alibaba, the largest private logistics service provider with the highest reputation in delivery quality in China and the largest online retail platform in China, respectively. The clash resulted in Alibaba unexpectedly removing SF Express as a shipping option from Alibaba’s retail platform for 42 hours in June 2017. Using a difference-in-differences design, we analyze the market performance of 129,448 representative stock-keeping units on Alibaba to quantify the economic value of a high-quality delivery service to sales, product variety, and logistics rating. We find that the removal of the high-quality delivery option from Alibaba’s retail platform reduced sales by 14.56\% during the clash, increased the contribution of long-tail to total sales—sales dispersion—by 3\%, but did not impact the variety and logistics rating of sold products. Furthermore, we also identify product characteristics that attenuate the value of high-quality logistics and find that the removal of SF Express is more obstructive for (1) star products as compared with long-tail products because the same star products are likely to be supplied by competing retail platforms that customers can easily switch to, (2) expensive products because customers need a reliable delivery service to protect their valuable items from damage or loss, and (3) less-discounted products because customers are more willing to sacrifice the service quality over a price markdown.

The incentive to protect current consumption is stronger with a medium wealth level than with a high or low wealth level. Furthermore, this individual adopts a conservative investment strategy in normal states and typically a more aggressive strategy in good and bad states. Endogeneity of the reference level increases overall risk-taking and generates an incentive to reduce risk exposure with age even without human capital. The welfare loss that this individual would suffer under the conventional constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) consumption and portfolio policies easily exceeds 10\%.

  abstract     = {This paper endogenizes auction timing and initiation in auctions of real options. Because bidders have information rent, a seller faces a “virtual strike price” higher than the actual exercise cost. The seller inefficiently delays the auction to encourage bidder participation and uses the irreversible nature of time to gain partial control over option exercises. The seller’s private benefit at option exercise may restore efficient auction timing, but option exercises are always inefficiently late. When the seller lacks commitment to auction timing, bidders always initiate in equilibrium, resulting in earlier option exercise and higher welfare than auctions proscribing bidder initiation. Overall, auction timing modifies the distribution of the bidder valuations and has important implications for bidding strategies, auction design, and real outcomes.

  abstract     = {Risk is an integral part of many economic decisions and is vitally important in finance. Despite extensive research on decision making under risk, little is known about how risks are actually perceived by financial professionals, the key players in global financial markets. In a large-scale survey experiment with 2,213 finance professionals and 4,559 laypeople in nine countries representing ~50\% of the world’s population and more than 60\% of the world’s gross domestic product, we expose participants to return distributions with equal expected return, and we systematically vary the distributions’ next three higher moments. Of these, skewness is the only moment that systematically affects financial professionals’ perception of financial risk. Strikingly, variance does not influence risk perception, even though return volatility is the most common risk measure in finance in both academia and the industry. When testing other, compound risk measures, the probability to experience losses is the strongest predictor of what is perceived as being risky. Analyzing professionals’ propensity to invest, skewness and loss probability also have strong predictive power, while volatility and kurtosis have some additional effect. Our results are very similar for laypeople, and they are robust across and within countries with different cultural backgrounds, as well as for different job fields of professionals.

  abstract     = {We study a model where each competing firm has a target segment where it has full consumer information and can exercise personalized pricing, and consumers may engage in identity management to bypass the firm’s attempt to price discriminate. In the absence of identity management, more consumer information intensifies competition because firms can effectively defend their turf through targeted personalized offers, thereby setting low public prices offered to nontargeted consumers. But the effect is mitigated when consumers are active in identity management because it raises the firm’s cost of serving nontargeted consumers. When firms have sufficiently large and nonoverlapping target segments, identity management can enable firms to extract full surplus from their targeted consumers through perfect price discrimination. Identity management can also induce firms not to serve consumers who are not targeted by either firm when the commonly nontargeted market segment is small. This results in a deadweight loss. Thus, identity management by consumers can benefit firms and lead to lower consumer surplus and lower social welfare. Our main insight continues to be valid when a fraction of consumers are active in identity management or when there is a cost of identity management. We also discuss the regulatory implications for the use of consumer information by firms as well as the implications for management. This paper was accepted by Juanjuan Zhang, marketing.},

We report the results of an experiment in which a platform marketplace—an online labor market—guaranteed select sellers for treated buyers. The presence of a guarantee strongly steered buyers to these guaranteed sellers, but offering guarantees did not increase sales overall, suggesting financial risk was not determinative for the marginal buyer. This preference for guaranteed sellers was not the result of their lower financial risk, but rather because buyers viewed the platform’s decision to guarantee as informative about relative seller quality. Indeed, a follow-up experiment showed that simply recommending the sellers that the platform would have guaranteed was equally effective at steering buyers.

  abstract     = {Worker attrition is a costly and operationally disruptive challenge throughout the world. Although large bodies of research have documented drivers of attrition and the operational consequences of attrition, managers still lack an integrated approach to understanding attrition and making decisions to address it on a forward-going basis. To fill this need, we build a structural model that both captures the firm’s decision to terminate a worker’s employment (involuntary attrition) and uses an optimal stopping problem process to model a worker’s decision to leave the firm (voluntary attrition). We then estimate the parameters of the model and conduct counterfactual analyses on the population of 1,118 agents serving one client over 3 years for an Indian business process management company. Our model reveals a number of interesting findings. We find that supervisors have a strong impact on whether employees stay because they reshape the way that agents make their decisions. We also find that the impact of supervisors on agent attrition is more significant than the impact of salary. For example, increasing salary by 20\% decreases the total attrition level by 5\%. However, if agents were managed by the best supervisors, among those that manage similar agents, the attrition rate decreases by 10\%. Altogether, our paper contributes to the burgeoning literature on people operations and managerial practice. This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.},

  abstract     = {We conjecture that for online retailers, experience-centric offline store formats do not simply expand market coverage, but rather, serve to significantly amplify future positive customer behaviors, both online and offline. We term this phenomenon “supercharging” and test our thesis using data from a digital-first men’s apparel retailer and a pioneer of the so-called zero inventory store (ZIS) format—a small-footprint, experience-centric retail location that carries no inventory for immediate fulfillment, but fulfils orders via e-commerce. Using a risk-set matching approach, we calibrate our estimates on customers who are “treated,” that is, have a ZIS experience, and matched with identical customers who shop online only. We find that after the ZIS experience, customers spend more, shop at a higher velocity, and are less likely to return items. The positive impact on returns is doubly virtuous as it is more pronounced for more tactile, higher-priced items, thus mitigating a key pain point of online retail. Furthermore, the ZIS shopping experience aids product discovery and brand attachment, causing sales to become more diffuse over a larger number of categories. Finally, we demonstrate that our results are robust to self-selection and potentially confounding effects of unobservable factors on the matched pairs of customers. Implications for retailing practice, including for legacy, offline-first retailers, are discussed. This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.},

Few scholars have examined whether and how scientists’ motives to engage in commercial activities differ across fields. Similarly, efforts to understand academics’ choices have focused on three self-interested motives—recognition, challenge, and money—ignoring the potential role of the desire to have an impact on others. Using panel data for a national sample of over 2,000 academics employed at U.S. institutions, we examine how the four motives are related to commercial activity measured by patenting. We find that all four motives are correlated with patenting, but these relationships differ systematically between the life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering. These field differences are consistent with differences across fields in the rewards from commercial activities as well as in the degree of overlap between traditional and commercializable research, which affects the opportunity costs of time spent away from “traditional” academic work. We discuss potential implications for policy makers, administrators, and managers as well as for future research on the scientific enterprise.

  abstract     = {New Internet-based “sharing-economy” markets enable consumer-owners to rent out their durable goods to nonowners. We model such markets and explore their equilibria both in the short run, in which ownership decisions are fixed, and in the long run, in which ownership decisions can be changed. We find that sharing-economy markets always expand consumption and increase surplus, but may increase or decrease ownership. Regardless, ownership is decoupled from individual preferences in the long run, as the rental rates and the purchase prices of goods become equal. If there are costs of bringing unused capacity to the market, they are partially passed through, creating a bias toward ownership. To test our theoretical work empirically, we conduct a survey of consumers, finding broad support for our modeling assumptions. The survey also allows us to offer a partial decomposition of the bring-to-market costs, based on attributes that make a good more or less amenable to being shared.

  abstract     = {We study the role of vertical differentiation in the adoption of LEED (Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design), a multitier environmental building certification system. Our identification strategy relies on the timing of adoption and shows that builders seek to differentiate from each other by choosing a different certification level from previously certified buildings. A common concern in this framework is that mean-reverting behavior could be mistaken for differentiation. We develop a new method for establishing the importance of strategic interactions based on simulating from a model with independent choice and unobserved heterogeneity, and showing that such a model cannot generate the level of interaction that we observe. Finally, we estimate a model that incorporates both differentiation incentives and correlated market-level unobservables and use our estimates from this model to simulate the impact of reducing the number of LEED tiers from four to two. The simulations indicate that environmental investments depend on the location of the threshold between tiers. This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy.},

  abstract     = {We develop a model of oligopolistic firms that produce partially differentiated products and generate pollution as a byproduct. We analyze and compare two types of pollution regulation: Cap-and-Trade and Taxes. Firms can respond to regulation by any combination of pollution abatement, output reduction, emissions trading (under Cap-and-Trade), or payment of pollution taxes (under Taxes). We prove that well-chosen regulation can, besides reducing pollution, actually improve firms’ profits relative to laissez-faire (unregulated markets), and simultaneously improve consumer surplus and welfare. Thus, regulation Pareto-dominates laissez-faire under a wide range of plausible conditions. These results are driven by an unintended consequence of pollution regulation: Competing firms can use the regulation to tacitly (and credibly) collude to reduce production and improve their profits. We show that the degree of competition plays a critical role in determining the economic consequences of pollution regulation. Our results suggest that the regulator’s primary consideration should be the impact of regulation on consumers rather than producers. This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.},

  abstract     = {We study the value of commitment in a business environment that is both competitive and uncertain, in which two firms face stochastic demands and compete in positioning and repositioning. If the future demand tends to disperse or the demand uncertainty is sufficiently large, one firm chooses rigidity (i.e., commits not to change its positions), and the other chooses flexibility (i.e., to reposition freely). We find that a firm’s rigidity can benefit not only itself, but also its flexible rival. When uncertainty is larger, rigidity becomes more valuable relative to flexibility. These results arise because the asymmetric equilibrium generates two collective gains in addition to the usual individual gain (in terms of competitive advantages) accrued to the committing firm. A firm’s rigid repositioning can soften competition and generate a commitment value, and the other firm’s flexible repositioning generates an option value. Both values then spill over to competitors within the ecosystem. These results suggest that, when firms compete under uncertainty, commitment and options are valuable not only for the party that is making the choice, but also for all competing parties collectively. Commitment value and option value do not have to be mutually exclusive; they can coexist and even strengthen each other through unilateral commitment, which achieves the best of both strategies.

  abstract     = {Developing marketing campaigns for a new product or a new target population is challenging because of the scarcity of relevant historical data. Building on dynamic Bayesian learning, a sequential optimization assists in creating new data points within a finite number of learning phases. This procedure identifies effective advertisement design elements as well as customer segments that maximize the expected outcome of the final marketing campaign. In this paper, the marketing campaign performance is modeled by a multiplicative advertising exposure model with Poisson arrivals. The intensity of the Poisson process is a function of the marketing campaign features. A forward-looking measurement policy is formulated to maximize the expected improvement in the value of information in each learning phase. A computationally efficient approach is proposed that consists of solving a sequence of mixed-integer linear optimization problems. The performance of the optimal learning policy over a set of benchmark policies is evaluated using examples inspired from the property and casualty insurance industry. Further extensions of the model are discussed. This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.},

We show that simpler models existing in the literature—namely proportional reinsurance—greatly underestimate contagion risk. We characterize the fixed points of our model and develop efficient algorithms to compute contagion with guarantees on convergence and speed under conditions on network structure. We characterize exotic cases of problematic graph structure and nonlinearities, which cause network effects to dominate the overall payments in the system. Last, we apply our model to data on real-world reinsurance networks. Our simulations demonstrate the following. (1) Reinsurance networks face extreme sensitivity to parameters. A firm can be wildly uncertain about its losses even under small network uncertainty. (2) Our sensitivity results reveal a new incentive for firms to cooperate to prevent fraud, because even small cases of fraud can have outsized effect on the losses across the network. (3) Nonlinearities from excess of loss contracts obfuscate risks and can cause excess costs in a real-world system. This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.},

This negative relation is a result of the current decision to invest and the associated change in leverage, which, in the presence of external financing needs and financing frictions, increase credit spreads while reducing the value of future investments.

Although constrained firms behave as if averse to transitory fluctuations in net worth, they can endogenously pursue increased exposure to both persistent factors that predict future productivity and fluctuations in credit tightness. The most constrained firms abstain from financial hedging, while still distorting capital-allocation decisions, thereby influencing firm-level volatility.

We find that women under heightened stress perform worse than women in the control group when compensated with tournament incentives, whereas there is no treatment difference under piece-rate incentives. For men, stress does not affect output under competition or under piece rate. The gender gap in willingness to compete is not affected by stress, but stress decreases competitiveness overall, which is related to performance for women.

  abstract     = {A buying firm might in the future incur costs associated with a supplier’s carbon dioxide emissions, safety violations, or other social or environmental impacts. Learning about a supplier’s impacts requires costly effort, but it is necessary (and sometimes sufficient) to reduce those impacts. The capital market valuation of a buying firm reflects investors’ estimate of future costs associated with a supplier’s impacts, as well as any costs that the buying firm incurs in order to learn about and reduce a supplier’s impacts. This paper analyzes a game theoretic model in which a manager—with the objective of maximizing the capital market valuation of the buying firm—decides whether to learn about a supplier’s impacts, how much cost to incur to reduce the supplier’s impacts, and whether to disclose the supplier’s impacts to investors. The investors have rational expectations (e.g., that a manager might withhold bad news about the supplier’s impacts) and value the buying firm accordingly. The paper considers a mandate to disclose information learned about a supplier’s impacts. The paper shows that the disclosure mandate deters learning and thus, under plausible conditions, results in higher expected impacts. The disclosure mandate can result in lower expected impacts only if buying firms face moderately high future costs associated with suppliers’ impacts. In contrast, a disclosure mandate always increases a buying firm’s expected discounted profit and capital market valuation. A disclosure mandate can induce cooperation among buying firms with a shared supplier, yet result in higher expected impacts by the supplier. When a buying firm has alternative suppliers, the disclosure mandate favors commitment to a supplier to facilitate learning about that supplier’s impacts (instead of searching for a lower-impact supplier).

We also develop a new algebraic modeling package, Robust Stochastic Optimization Made Easy (RSOME), to facilitate the implementation of RSO models. The model of uncertainty incorporates both discrete and continuous random variables, typically assumed in scenario-tree-based stochastic linear optimization and distributionally robust optimization, respectively. To address the nonanticipativity of recourse decisions, we introduce the event-wise recourse adaptations, which integrate the scenario-tree adaptation originating from stochastic linear optimization and the affine adaptation popularized in distributionally robust optimization. Our proposed event-wise ambiguity set is rich enough to capture traditional statistic-based ambiguity sets with convex generalized moments, mixture distribution, φ-divergence, Wasserstein (Kantorovich-Rubinstein) metric, and also inspire machine-learning-based ones using techniques such as K-means clustering and classification and regression trees. Several interesting RSO models, including optimizing over the Hurwicz criterion and two-stage problems over Wasserstein ambiguity sets, are provided.

  abstract     = {We develop a simple theoretical framework for thinking about how geographic frictions, and in particular travel costs, shape scientists’ collaboration decisions and the types of projects that are developed locally versus over distance. We then take advantage of a quasi-experiment—the introduction of new routes by a low-cost airline—to test the predictions of the theory. Results show that travel costs constitute an important friction to collaboration: after a low-cost airline enters, the number of collaborations increases between 0.3 and 1.1 times, a result that is robust to multiple falsification tests and causal in nature. The reduction in geographic frictions is particularly beneficial for high-quality scientists that are otherwise embedded in worse local environments. Consistent with the theory, lower travel costs also endogenously change the types of projects scientists engage in at different levels of distance. After the shock, we observe an increase in higher-quality and novel projects, as well as projects that take advantage of complementary knowledge and skills between subfields, and that rely on specialized equipment. We test the generalizability of our findings from chemistry to a broader data set of scientific publications and to a different field where specialized equipment is less likely to be relevant, mathematics. Last, we discuss implications for the formation of collaborative research and development teams over distance. This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.},

Using network analysis, we examine multiple dimensions of connectedness and find that after controlling for operating performance and corporate governance characteristics, firms with well-connected audit committees are less likely to misstate annual financial statements. In addition, our study demonstrates that audit committee connectedness through director networks moderates the negative effect of board interlocks to misstating firms on financial reporting quality. We conduct several tests to address identification concerns and find similar results.

  abstract     = {We find that Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX) had two significant effects on the audit market for nonpublic entities. The first short-run effect stems from inelastic labor supply coupled with an audit demand shock from public companies. As a result, private companies reduced their use of attested financial reports in bank financing by 12\%, and audit fee increases for nonprofit organizations (NPOs) more than doubled. The second long-run effect was a transformation in the audit supply structure. After SOX, NPOs were less likely to match with auditors most exposed to public companies, whereas auditors increasingly specialized their offices based on client type. Audit market concentration for NPOs dropped by more than one-half within five years of SOX and remained at this level through the end of our sample in 2013, whereas the number of suppliers increased by 26\%. Our results demonstrate how regulation directed at public companies generates economically important spillovers for nonpublic entities. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.},

These experiments randomly assign customers to receive marketing actions recommended by either the existing (champion) policy or the new (challenger) policy, and then compare the aggregate outcomes. We recommend an alternative experimental design and propose an alternative estimation approach to improve the evaluation of targeting policies. The recommended experimental design randomly assigns customers to marketing actions. This allows evaluation of any targeting policy without requiring an additional experiment, including policies designed after the experiment is implemented. The proposed estimation approach identifies customers for whom different policies recommend the same action and recognizes that for these customers there is no difference in performance. This allows for a more precise comparison of the policies. We illustrate the advantages of the experimental design and estimation approach using data from an actual field experiment. We also demonstrate that the grouping of customers, which is the foundation of our estimation approach, can help to improve the training of new targeting policies.

We posit that hubs play the role of bridges between academic science and corporate technology. Tracking citations from patents to approximately 10 million academic articles, we find that hubs facilitate the flow of academic science into corporate inventions in two ways. First, hub-based discoveries in academia are of higher quality and are more applied. Second, firms—in particular young, innovative, science-oriented ones—pay disproportionate attention to hub-based discoveries. We address concerns regarding unobserved heterogeneity by confirming the role of firms’ attention to hub-based science in a set of 147 simultaneous discoveries. Importantly, hubs not only facilitate localized knowledge flow but also extend the geographic reach of academic science, attracting the attention of distant firms.

Such belief-crossing makes it almost impossible to construct a portfolio that is composed solely of every investor’s most favored companies. This causes the level of excitement for portfolios to be generally lower than the levels of excitement that individual companies generate among their most fervent supporters. Coupled with short-sale constraints, wherein prices are set by the most optimistic investors, this causes portfolios to trade at discounts. Utilizing several settings whereby the value of a portfolio and the values of the underlying components can be evaluated separately (e.g., closed-end funds), we present evidence supporting our proposition that, in financial markets, the “whole” is often less than the “sum of its parts.” This paper was accepted by Karl Diether, finance.},

The term idleness (respectively, near idleness ) is, instead, used to define staleness when trading activity is absent (respectively, close to absent). Using statistical and pricing metrics, we show that zeros are a genuine economic phenomenon linked to the dynamics of trading volume and, therefore, liquidity. Zeros are, in general, not the result of institutional features, like price discreteness. In essence, spells of idleness or near idleness are stylized facts suggestive of a key, omitted market friction in the modeling of asset prices. We illustrate how accounting for this friction may generate sizable risk compensations in short-dated option returns. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies how to schedule medical appointments with time-dependent patient no-show behavior and random service times. The problem is motivated by our studies of independent datasets from countries in two continents that unanimously identify a significant time-of-day effect on patient show-up probabilities. We deploy a distributionally robust model, which minimizes the worst-case total expected costs of patient waiting and service provider’s idling and overtime, by optimizing the scheduled arrival times of patients. This model is challenging because evaluating the total cost for a given schedule involves a linear program with uncertainties present in both the objective function and the right-hand side of the constraints. In addition, the ambiguity set considered contains discrete uncertainties and complementary functional relationships among these uncertainties (namely, patient no-shows and service durations). We show that when patient no-shows are exogenous (i.e., time-independent), the problem can be reformulated as a copositive program and then be approximated by semidefinite programs. When patient no-shows are endogenous on time (and hence on the schedule), the problem becomes a bilinear copositive program. We construct a set of dual prices to guide the search for a good schedule and use the technique iteratively to obtain a near-optimal solution. Our computational studies reveal a significant reduction in total expected cost by taking into account the time-of-day variation in patient show-up probabilities as opposed to ignoring it.

However, although load balancing benefits the system overall, it may negatively impact some of the queueing nodes. For example, it may reduce throughput rates or engender unfairness with respect to some performance measures. For queueing systems with multiple single-server nodes, we propose a set of constrained load-balancing policies that ensures the expected arrival rate to each queueing node is not reduced, and we show that such policies provide multiple benefits for each queueing node: stochastically fewer customers and lower variance of the number of customers at each queueing node. These results imply performance improvement as measured by multiple general objective functions, including but not limited to the expected number of customers at a queueing node, probability of having a high number of customers, variance of the number of customers, and expected number of customers conditional on exceeding a threshold defined by a fixed service level. We demonstrate numerically that our proposed policies capture a large portion of the potential maximal improvement. This paper was accepted by Noah Gans, stochastic models and simulation.},

Our intention-to-treat estimates suggest that subjects invited to the Registry, regardless of joining, are 66\% more responsive to critical shortage appeals than control subjects. While the Registry increases supply during a critical shortage episode, it does not increase supply when there is no shortage; thus, the Registry significantly improves coordination between volunteer donors and collection centers, thereby improving market outcomes.

Opportunistic financing maneuvers by a firm can negatively affect its uninformed stock owners because of adverse selection and the change in the firm’s short-term price, whereas the long-term returns do not accumulate to departing stockholders. The negative effect of market timing on stockholders increases with the share turnover. Furthermore, the effect of timing is asymmetric: shareholders prefer that the firm corrects underpricing rather than overpricing.

Tighter financing constraints reduce the ability of the monopolist to extract surplus but, contrary to the usual result, may increase production. We evaluate how uncertainty and market size reduce the price-discriminating power of the monopolist and affect the optimal contract regime.

This first-mover advantage may lead to fund failure through a cycle of falling prices and increasing redemptions. Our analysis shows that (i) the first-mover advantage introduces a nonlinear dependence between a market shock and the aggregate impact of redemptions on the fund’s NAV; (ii) as a consequence, there is a critical magnitude of the shock beyond which redemptions brings down the fund; (iii) properly designed swing pricing transfers liquidation costs from the fund to redeeming investors and, by removing the nonlinearity stemming from the first-mover advantage, it reduces these costs and prevents fund failure.

We estimate the total amount of contagion, the marginal contribution of each firm to contagion, and the number of defaulting firms for a systemic shock to credit spreads.

In this work, we study how such platforms should rank products displayed to consumers and utilize the top and most salient slots. We present a model that considers consumers’ search costs and the externalities sellers impose on each other. This model allows us to study a multiobjective optimization, whose objective includes consumer and seller surplus as well as the sales revenue, and derive the optimal ranking decision. In addition, we propose a surplus-ordered ranking mechanism for selling some of the top slots. This mechanism is motivated in part by Amazon’s sponsored search program. We show that the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism would not be applicable to our setting and propose a new mechanism. This mechanism is near optimal, performing significantly better than those that do not incentivize sellers to reveal their private information regarding each consumer purchase, such as their profit. Moreover, we generalize our model to settings in which platforms can provide partial information about the products and facilitate the consumer search and show the robustness of our findings.

  abstract     = {Mixture models are versatile tools that are used extensively in many fields, including operations, marketing, and econometrics. The main challenge in estimating mixture models is that the mixing distribution is often unknown, and imposing a priori parametric assumptions can lead to model misspecification issues. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for nonparametric estimation of the mixing distribution of a mixture of logit models. We formulate the likelihood-based estimation problem as a constrained convex program and apply the conditional gradient (also known as Frank–Wolfe) algorithm to solve this convex program. We show that our method iteratively generates the support of the mixing distribution and the mixing proportions. Theoretically, we establish the sublinear convergence rate of our estimator and characterize the structure of the recovered mixing distribution. Empirically, we test our approach on real-world datasets. We show that it outperforms the standard expectation-maximization (EM) benchmark on speed (16 times faster), in-sample fit (up to 24\% reduction in the log-likelihood loss), and predictive (average 28\% reduction in standard error metrics) and decision accuracies (extracts around 23\% more revenue). On synthetic data, we show that our estimator is robust to different ground-truth mixing distributions and can also account for endogeneity.

  abstract     = {I investigate three goals of school choice: welfare, encouraging neighborhood schools, and diversity. I use optimization problems to find the best stable and incentive compatible match for any combination of these objectives. These problems assume there is a continuum of students and school seats, which allows me to describe the incentive compatibility conditions in a tractable form. I prove that the set of stable matchings is generically continuous in the distribution of students and the school capacities, which implies that the characterization of the possible stable matches in the continuum model approximates the set of stable matches in a matching market with a large, but finite, number of students. I then apply my framework to data from Boston Public Schools. If the mechanism conditions on demographics, the improvement (relative to the status quo) in student welfare is equivalent to moving 291 students (out of 3,479) to schools one rank higher in their preference lists. In contrast, if the mechanism does not condition on demographics, the welfare improvement is equivalent to moving only 25.1 students to schools one rank higher. Improvements in the distributional goals can be made (e.g., increasing enrollment in neighborhood schools by 50\%) without reducing welfare or diversity.

  abstract     = {Safety alerts are announcements made by health regulators warning patients and doctors about new drug-related side effects. However, not all safety alerts are equally effective. We provide evidence that the day of the week on which the safety alerts are announced explains differences in safety alert impact. Specifically, we show that safety alerts announced on Fridays are less broadly diffused: they are shared 34\% less on social media, mentioned in 23\% to 66\% fewer news articles, and are 12\% to 51\% less likely to receive any news coverage at all. As a consequence of this, we propose Friday alerts are less effective in reducing drug-related side effects. We find that moving a Friday alert to any other weekday would reduce all drug-related side effects by 9\% to 12\%, serious drug-related complications by 6\% to 15\%, and drug-related deaths by 22\% to 36\%. This problem is particularly important because Friday was the most frequent weekday for safety alert announcements from 1999 to 2016. We show that this greater prevalence of Friday alerts might not be random: firms that lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the past are 49\% to 56\% more likely to have safety alerts announced on Fridays.

  abstract     = {Many products have similar or common attributes and are thus correlated. We show that, when these attributes are uncertain for consumers, a complementarity effect can arise among competing products in the sense that the lower price of one product may increase the demands for the others. This effect occurs when consumers sequentially search for information about both common and idiosyncratic product attributes before purchase. We characterize the optimal search strategy for the correlated search problem, provide the conditions for the existence of the complementarity effect, and show that the effect is robust under a wide range of alternative assumptions. We further explore the implications of the effect for pricing. When firms compete in price, although product correlation may weaken differentiation between the firms, the complementarity effect owing to correlated search may raise equilibrium price and profit.

In this research, we investigate the behavioral and welfare implications of negative devaluing for intertemporal consumptions in an intrapersonal game. Our general framework accounts for two distinctions: desired versus undesired consumptions, and naive versus sophisticated beliefs about future selves’ preferences. Naive people procrastinate desired consumptions and preproperate undesired ones. The behavior of sophisticated people generally exhibits a cyclical pattern. Sophistication may either mitigate or exacerbate the time-inconsistency problem, and hence may improve or undermine long-run welfare, depending on the valence and the units of consumptions and on whether consumptions are tied consecutively. In addition, our comparative statics analysis generates surprising results with respect to the impacts of decision parameters (e.g., deadline, consumption units). We also discuss implications for targeted pricing, product design, promotion strategies, and savings. This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.},

  abstract     = {We consider a lender (bank) that determines the optimal loan price (interest rate) to offer to prospective borrowers under uncertain borrower response and default risk. A borrower may or may not accept the loan at the price offered, and both the principal loaned and the interest income become uncertain because of the risk of default. We present a risk-based loan pricing optimization framework that explicitly takes into account the marginal risk contribution, the portfolio risk, and a borrower’s acceptance probability. Marginal risk assesses the incremental risk contribution of a prospective loan to the bank’s overall portfolio risk by capturing the dependencies between the prospective loan and the existing portfolio and is evaluated with respect to the value-at-risk and conditional value-at-risk measures. We examine the properties and computational challenges of the formulations. We design a reformulation method based on the concavifiability concept to transform the nonlinear objective functions and to derive equivalent mixed-integer nonlinear reformulations with convex continuous relaxations. We also extend the approach to multiloan pricing problems, which feature explicit loan selection decisions in addition to pricing decisions. We derive formulations with multiple loans that take the form of mixed-integer nonlinear problems with nonconvex continuous relaxations and develop a computationally efficient algorithmic method. We provide numerical evidence demonstrating the value of the proposed framework, test the computational tractability, and discuss managerial implications.

However, we report five studies in which adding small ranges to future payoffs increases future payoff appeal, an emergent property designated the future ambiguity effect . This effect generalizes across various choice sets, payoff levels, and delays, and it prevails even when a future smaller ambiguous payoff is preferred more than a future larger precise payoff. Two underlying processes are proposed and supported: (1) the payoff ambiguity’s explicit risk of receiving a smaller payoff distracts people from the future’s larger implicit risk of receiving nothing, and (2) payoff ambiguity restores some of the excitement lost to the future’s psychological distance. Nonetheless, the future ambiguity effect is not universal, given that larger ranges can reduce and even eliminate it (boundary condition).

We use two proxies related to investor ex ante uncertainty and corresponding pricing of such uncertainty: option-implied volatilities and variance risk premiums; both are measured with maturities surrounding the impending quarterly earnings announcement. Consistent with prior research, we measure reporting streak as the number of consecutive quarters the firm meets or beats the consensus analyst earnings-per-share forecast. Empirical results confirm expectations that the two uncertainty-related constructs are decreasing in the length of the reporting streak. These results, combined with further evidence documenting that lower uncertainty leads to lower stock returns surrounding the earnings announcements, suggest that longer reporting streaks reflect lower risk during earnings announcements.

We show that the increase in the auditor’s legal liability induces the auditor to choose more informative and more conservative efforts. Although the increased informative effort has a favorable spillover effect that increases the equityholder’s expected payoff, the increased conservative effort induces a bias—that is, decreases the likelihood of reporting a true good state as good—and thus induces an adverse spillover effect that decreases the equityholder’s expected payoff. As such, when the conservative effort bias is small, the favorable spillover effect dominates the adverse spillover effect, and the equityholder prefers the near-privity regime.

  abstract     = {We consider dynamic assortment problems with reusable products, in which each arriving customer chooses a product within an offered assortment, uses the product for a random duration of time, and returns the product back to the firm to be used by other customers. The goal is to find a policy for deciding on the assortment to offer to each customer so that the total expected revenue over a finite selling horizon is maximized. The dynamic-programming formulation of this problem requires a high-dimensional state variable that keeps track of the on-hand product inventories, as well as the products that are currently in use. We present a tractable approach to compute a policy that is guaranteed to obtain at least 50\% of the optimal total expected revenue. This policy is based on constructing linear approximations to the optimal value functions. When the usage duration is infinite or follows a negative binomial distribution, we also show how to efficiently perform rollout on a simple static policy. Performing rollout corresponds to using separable and nonlinear value function approximations. The resulting policy is also guaranteed to obtain at least 50\% of the optimal total expected revenue. The special case of our model with infinite usage durations captures the case where the customers purchase the products outright without returning them at all. Under infinite usage durations, we give a variant of our rollout approach whose total expected revenue differs from the optimal by a factor that approaches 1 with rate cubic-root of C min, where C min is the smallest inventory of a product. We provide computational experiments based on simulated data for dynamic assortment management, as well as real parking transaction data for the city of Seattle. Our computational experiments demonstrate that the practical performance of our policies is substantially better than their performance guarantees and that performing rollout yields noticeable improvements.

The existing body of experimental evidence uses an ultimatum bargaining protocol to test analytical models, but there is no reason to think that bargaining in supply chains is in the form of ultimatum offers. We investigate the effect of bargaining on contract performance by extending the bargaining protocol to allow the manufacturer to make concessions. We test coordinating contract with bargaining in the laboratory by comparing wholesale price and the two-part tariff contracts using two different bargaining protocols. We then develop and estimate a statistical model of behavior with bargaining and find that this model organizes our data well. Our main finding is that the contracts that we study are more efficient when participants are allowed to make concessions. The additional channel efficiency is owing to more efficient offers made by manufacturers. The higher channel efficiency primarily benefits the retailer—the weaker party. Our main contribution is the observation that, when testing analytical models of contracts in the laboratory, the way that the bargaining process is implemented, such as the ability to make concessions, has a critical effect on conclusions.

We find that, although PTR does not affect payments or consumer search, it does cause hospitals to reduce charges by approximately 5\%. The reputational costs of perceived overcharging appear to be one impetus for the reduction in charges, suggesting that certain stakeholders who are able to impose costs on hospitals are unaware that hospitals can decouple charges from payments. The ineffectiveness of PTR policies in reducing payments and the apparent inability of some stakeholders to realize this fact could explain why charge-transparency policies have been widely adopted with little opposition. Overall, our findings provide a cautionary note—transparency regulation focusing on an indicator that can be decoupled from the construct of interest might placate some stakeholders without actually solving the underlying problem.

Using a unique data set of firmwide QC deficiencies identified by the PCAOB during its inspections of audit firms, I find a negative association between QC deficiencies, mainly performance related, and audit quality. Furthermore, audits conducted by larger audit firms with more organization-level deficiencies appear less profitable, evidenced by more hours worked on the engagements, leading to lower fees per hour. These results appear to be partly explained by deficiencies in the tone at the top (a proxy for culture) and the audit methodology. Further evidence suggests that a lack of remediation of QC system deficiencies has a negative influence on audit quality. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.},

  abstract     = {We study a fundamental model of resource allocation in which a finite number of resources must be assigned in an online manner to a heterogeneous stream of customers. The customers arrive randomly over time according to known stochastic processes. Each customer requires a specific amount of capacity and has a specific preference for each of the resources with some resources being feasible for the customer and some not. The system must find a feasible assignment of each customer to a resource or must reject the customer. The aim is to maximize the total expected capacity utilization of the resources over the horizon. This model has application in services, freight transportation, and online advertising. We present online algorithms with bounded competitive ratios relative to an optimal off-line algorithm that knows all stochastic information. Our algorithms perform extremely well compared with common heuristics as demonstrated on a real data set from a large hospital system in New York City.

  abstract     = {This paper studies how the ease of repossessing collateral in bankruptcy affects corporate leasing policy. Using plausibly exogenous variation of the ability to repossess assets generated by state antirecharacterization laws, I find that the antirecharacterization laws, which make collateral repossession easier for secured lending, reduces corporate leasing. Consistent with the argument that only financially constrained firms value additional debt capacity because of the increased ability to repossess assets, I find that the effect concentrates in financially constrained firms. I also find that the effect is much stronger for firms with less specific assets. In addition, I find that the laws also affect leverage, cash holding, and corporate investment.

  abstract     = {Regulating on-demand ride-hailing services (e.g., Uber and DiDi) requires a balance of multiple competing objectives: encouraging innovative business models (e.g., DiDi), sustaining traditional industries (e.g., taxi), creating new jobs, and reducing traffic congestion. This study is motivated by a regulatory policy implemented by the Chinese government in 2017 and a similar policy approved by the New York City Council in 2018 that regulate the “maximum” number of registered Uber/DiDi drivers. We examine the impact of these policies on the welfare of different stakeholders (i.e., consumers, taxi drivers, on-demand ride service company, and independent drivers). By analyzing a two-period dynamic game that involves these stakeholders, we find that, without government intervention, the on-demand ride service platform can drive the traditional taxi industry out of the market under certain conditions. Relative to no regulations and a complete ban policy, a carefully designed regulatory policy can strike a better balance of multiple competing objectives. Finally, if a government can reform the taxi industry by adjusting the taxi fare, then lowering the taxi fare instead of imposing a strict policy toward on-demand ride services can improve the total social welfare.

  abstract     = {We consider a canonical quantity-based network revenue management problem where a firm accepts or rejects incoming customer requests irrevocably in order to maximize expected revenue given limited resources. Because of the curse of dimensionality, the exact solution to this problem by dynamic programming is intractable when the number of resources is large. We study a family of re-solving heuristics that periodically re-optimize an approximation to the original problem known as the deterministic linear program (DLP), where random customer arrivals are replaced by their expectations. We find that, in general, frequently re-solving the DLP produces the same order of revenue loss as one would get without re-solving, which scales as the square root of the time horizon length and resource capacities. By re-solving the DLP at a few selected points in time and applying thresholds to the customer acceptance probabilities, we design a new re-solving heuristic with revenue loss that is uniformly bounded by a constant that is independent of the time horizon and resource capacities.

We show that much of the utility IT workers derive from these systems is from skills acquired on the job. This is principally true for younger workers at employers where skill development is encouraged, and the effects are stronger in thicker markets where workers with newer skills have more outside options. An analysis of the text in online employer reviews supports the notion that IT workers value access to interesting IT systems above most other employer attributes. These findings are important because (1) they provide evidence of how worker preferences can influence corporate IT investment decisions, (2) they shed light on factors influencing IT skill development, and (3) they point to a potentially important explanation for returns from IT investments.

  abstract     = {We consider dynamic selection problems , where a decision maker repeatedly selects a set of items from a larger collection of available items. A classic example is the dynamic assortment problem with demand learning, where a retailer chooses items to offer for sale subject to a display space constraint. The retailer may adjust the assortment over time in response to the observed demand. These dynamic selection problems are naturally formulated as stochastic dynamic programs (DPs) but are difficult to solve because the optimal selection decisions depend on the states of all items. In this paper, we study heuristic policies for dynamic selection problems and provide upper bounds on the performance of an optimal policy that can be used to assess the performance of a heuristic policy. The policies and bounds that we consider are based on a Lagrangian relaxation of the DP that relaxes the constraint limiting the number of items that may be selected. We characterize the performance of the Lagrangian index policy and bound and show that, under mild conditions, these policies and bounds are asymptotically optimal for problems with many items; mixed policies and tiebreaking play an essential role in the analysis of these index policies and can have a surprising impact on performance. We demonstrate these policies and bounds in two large scale examples: a dynamic assortment problem with demand learning and an applicant screening problem.

However, CSP has the typical structure that allows application of the Benders decomposition, which is known to suffer from oscillation and slow convergence, compounded with the fact that the master problem is combinatorial. To overcome this drawback, we present a stabilized Benders decomposition whose master is restricted to a neighborhood of successful candidates by local-branching constraints, which are dynamically adjusted, and even dropped, during the iterations. Our experiments with synthetic and real-world instances with up to 24,000 binary variables, 181 million (M) continuous variables, and 367M constraints show that our approach is competitive with both the current state-of-the-art code for CSP and the Benders implementation in CPLEX 12.7. In some instances, stabilized Benders provided a very good solution in less than 1 minute, whereas the other approaches found no feasible solution in 1 hour.

  abstract     = {With the growing popularity of corporate social responsibility (CSR), critics point out that firms tend to focus on salient CSR activities while slacking off on the unobservable ones, using CSR as a marketing gimmick. Firms’ emphasis on observable aspects and negligence of the unobservable aspects are often labeled as greenwashing . This paper develops a game-theoretic model of CSR investment, in which consumers are socially minded, but they can observe only a subset of CSR initiatives. Two types of firms are considered: those that are driven solely by profit maximization and those that are socially responsible , motivated not only by profit, but also by a genuine concern for the social good. Our analysis examines how information transparency affects a firm’s strategies and the social welfare, and we identify both positive and negative aspects of greenwashing. First, low transparency incentivizes a profit-driven firm to engage in greenwashing through observable investment. Greenwashing prevents consumers from making informed purchase decisions but raises overall CSR spending. Second, sufficiently high transparency eliminates greenwashing and can motivate a socially responsible firm to make extra observable investment under the threat of greenwashing on the part of a profit-driven firm. However, when transparency further increases, this extra investment diminishes. In addition, our paper studies the impacts of firms’ budget constraint and consumers’ bargaining power: Raising the budget and increasing consumers’ bargaining power can both lead to an inferior social outcome.

Consistent with job postings providing new information to the market, investors react positively to changes in the number of job postings.

However, it can also be associated with a range of positive, self-transcendent cognitive responses, such as a greater desire to help others, contribute to society, and make a more meaningful contribution in one’s life and career. In this study, we provide evidence of a link between chief executive officer (CEO) mortality salience—triggered by the death of a director at the same firm—and a subsequent increase in firm-level prosocial behavior or corporate social responsibility (CSR). We further show that this core relationship is amplified in situations where the death of the director is likely to have been especially salient (i.e., the director was appointed within the CEO’s tenure, or the death was sudden/expected). In supplementary analyses, we find suggestive evidence of increased CEO prosociality in other professional domains as well as evidence that prosociality seems to be preferentially directed toward ingroups.

Our auction uses an iterative partial reporting design such that for a given set of prices, not all bidders are required to report their demands, and when they are, they reveal a single preferred item at a time instead of all. Our design can better preserve bidder privacy while maintaining several good properties: sincere bidding is an ex post Nash equilibrium, ending prices are path independent, and efficiency is achieved if the auction starts with the auctioneer’s reservation values. Our measurement of information revelation is based on Shannon’s entropy and can be used to compare a wide variety of auction and nonauction mechanisms. We propose a hybrid quasi–Monte Carlo procedure for computing this measure. Our numerical simulations show that our auction consistently outperforms a full-reporting benchmark with up to 18\% less entropy reduction and scales to problems of over 100,000 variables.

  abstract     = {Rural consumers may face not only the challenge of affordability but also the problem of limited accessibility. Can a government’s subsidy program effectively address these issues? This paper examines the impact of a large-scale subsidy program, “Household electrical appliances going to the countryside,” offered by the Chinese government. The government regulation imposes a price subsidy combined with a price ceiling on products in the program. We consider two effects of the subsidy: the retail price is lowered to make the product more affordable to consumers, and manufacturers are encouraged to expand their distribution coverage to make products more accessible to consumers. We build a dynamic model of oligopoly to study how firms adjust their distribution coverage. Conditional on the model estimates, we evaluate the program’s effects on social welfare, consumer surplus, and firms’ market performance and marketing channel decisions through counterfactual analyses. We find that the subsidy program increases social welfare by CNY 0.209 billion, as a result of a subsidy expense of CNY 0.236 billion. When breaking down the impact, we find it increases consumer surplus by CNY 0.184 billion (50\%), manufacturers’ profits by CNY 0.125 billion (53\%), and manufacturers’ payoffs by CNY 2.5 million (17\%). Specifically, 14\% (13.2\%) of the consumer surplus (firm profit) increases are from changes in distribution coverage, and the rest is from the subsidy (price changes). The program’s return of investment (i.e., social welfare minus subsidy expense), which is negative, however, could be improved by applying a relatively lower subsidy rate.

  abstract     = {We explore conditions under which a multiproduct firm can profitably turn itself into a platform by “hosting rivals,” that is, by inviting rivals to sell products or services on top of its core product. Hosting eliminates the additional shopping costs to consumers of buying a specialist rival’s competing version of the multiproduct firm’s noncore product. On the one hand, this makes it easier for the rival to compete on the noncore product. On the other hand, hosting turns the rival from a pure competitor into a complementor: the value added by its product now helps raise consumer demand for the multiproduct firm’s core product. As a result, hosting can be both unilaterally profitable for the multiproduct firm and jointly profitable for both firms. This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.},

  abstract     = {We model an expert review system where two producers competing for market share each are evaluated by two raters. Employing economics experiments, the paper examines how the rater’s incentive to provide objective feedback can be distorted in the presence of social ties and different penalty structures for assigning unobjective ratings. The results reject the self-interested model. We find that raters assign more biased ratings to help the producer they know compete, and this distortion is exacerbated when the reputation cost for rating unobjectively is lowered. Counterintuitively, when both of the raters know the same producer, the likelihood of biased ratings drops significantly. To explain the empirical regularities, we develop a behavioral economics model and show that the rater’s utility function should account not only for social preferences toward the producer, but also the rater’s psychological aversion toward favoring a producer more than the other rater. Our findings demonstrate that it is critical for policymakers to be cognizant of the nonpecuniary factors that can influence behavior in expert review systems.

  abstract     = {Using the staggered and reciprocal passage of interstate bank deregulation as an exogenous variation in the degree of bank integration, we investigate how and why bank integration influences the market for corporate control for nonfinancial firms. We posit that bank integration affects acquisitions either through reducing the information asymmetry between acquirers and targets or through increasing credit supply. Our evidence is more consistent with the former channel. Specifically, we document that (1) cross-state acquisitions are more likely to occur between reciprocally deregulated states, and (2) firms are more likely taken over by out-of-state acquirers after deregulation; this effect is stronger for a target who borrows from an out-of-state bank, whose local bank is acquired by an out-of-state bank, and who is informationally more opaque. Announcement returns for acquirers of out-of-state (particularly private) targets increase after deregulation, consistent with better identification of higher-valued targets by acquirers after deregulation.

  abstract     = {We study a setting in which dynamically arriving items are assigned to waiting agents, who have heterogeneous values for distinct items and heterogeneous outside options. An ideal match would both target items to agents with the worst outside options and match them to items for which they have high value. Our first finding is that two common approaches—using independent lotteries for each item and using a waitlist in which agents lose priority when they reject an offer—lead to identical outcomes in equilibrium. Both approaches encourage agents to accept items that are marginal fits. We show that the quality of the match can be improved by using a common lottery for all items. If participation costs are negligible, a common lottery is equivalent to several other mechanisms, such as limiting participants to a single lottery, using a waitlist in which offers can be rejected without punishment, or using artificial currency. However, when there are many agents with low need, there is an unavoidable trade-off between matching and targeting. In this case, utilitarian welfare may be maximized by focusing on good matching (if the outside option distribution is light tailed) or good targeting (if it is heavy tailed). Using a common lottery achieves near-optimal matching, whereas introducing participation costs achieves near-optimal targeting. This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management.},

  abstract     = {Can television be used to teach and foster entrepreneurship among youth in developing countries? We report from a randomized control field experiment of an edutainment show on entrepreneurship broadcasted over almost three months on national television in Tanzania. The field experiment involved more than 2,000 secondary school students, where the treatment group was incentivized to watch the edutainment show. We find some suggestive evidence of the edutainment show making the viewers more interested in entrepreneurship and business, particularly among females. However, our main finding is a negative effect: the edutainment show discouraged investment in schooling without convincingly replacing it with some other valuable activity. Administrative data show a strong negative treatment effect on school performance, and long-term survey data show that fewer treated students continue schooling, but we do not find much evidence of the edutainment show causing an increase in business ownership. The fact that an edutainment show for entrepreneurship caused the students to invest less in education carries a general lesson to the field experimental literature by showing the importance of taking a broad view of possible implications of a field intervention.

Concerns have been raised, however, as to whether postdischarge mortality rates are reasonable measures of hospital quality as they consider the frequency of an event that occurs after a patient is discharged and is no longer under the watch and care of hospital staff. Estimating the causal effect of length of stay (LOS) on postdischarge mortality from retrospective data introduces a number of econometric challenges. We describe three potential sources of (endogeneity and censoring) biases and propose an approach that provides conservative estimates of the true treatment effect. Using a large data set comprising all hospital encounters of every Medicare fee-for-service patient with acute myocardial infarction from 2000 to 2011, we find evidence that an increase in LOS is associated with a decrease in 30-day mortality rates. An additional day in the hospital could decrease 30-day mortality rates by over 6\%. Moreover, we find that, from a social planner’s perspective, the gains achieved in reducing mortality rates likely exceed the cost of keeping the patients in the hospital for an additional day.

In particular, I examine whether hedge fund activists orchestrate “wolf packs”—that is, groups of investors willing to acquire shares in the target firm before the activist’s campaign is publicly disclosed via a 13D filing—as a way to support the campaign and strengthen the activist’s bargaining position. Using a novel hand-collected data set, I develop a method to identify the formation of wolf packs before the 13D filing. I investigate two competing hypotheses: the Coordinated Effort Hypothesis (wolf packs are orchestrated by lead activists to circumvent securities regulations about “groups” of investors) and the Spontaneous Formation Hypothesis (wolf packs spontaneously arise because investors independently monitor and target the same firms at about the same time). A number of tests rule out the Spontaneous Formation Hypothesis and provide support for the Coordinated Effort Hypothesis . Finally, the presence of a wolf pack is associated with various measures of the campaign’s success. This paper was accepted by Brian Bushee, accounting.},

  abstract     = {Accuracy and consistency are critical for inspections to be an effective, fair, and useful tool for assessing risks, quality, and suppliers—and for making decisions based on those assessments. We examine how inspector schedules could introduce bias that erodes inspection quality by altering inspector stringency. Our analysis of thousands of food-safety inspections reveals that inspectors are affected by the inspection outcomes at their prior-inspected establishment ( outcome effects ), citing more violations after they inspect establishments that exhibited worse compliance levels or trends. Moreover, consistent with negativity bias, the effect is stronger after observing compliance deterioration than improvement. Inspection results are also affected by when the inspection occurs within an inspector’s day ( daily schedule effects ): Inspectors cite fewer violations after spending more time conducting inspections throughout the day and when inspections risk prolonging their typical workday. Overall, our findings suggest that currently unreported violations would be cited if the outcome effects—which increase scrutiny—were triggered more often and if the daily schedule effects—which erode scrutiny—were reduced. For example, our estimates indicate that if outcome effects were doubled and daily schedule effects were fully mitigated, 11\% more violations would be detected, enabling remedial actions that could substantially reduce foodborne illnesses and hospitalizations. Understanding and addressing these inspection biases can help managers and policymakers improve not only food safety but also process quality, environmental practices, occupational safety, and working conditions.

We consider a game-theoretic model in which two platforms offer different standalone utilities to users. We find that incentives to establish one-way compatibility—the platform owner with smaller standalone value grants access to its proprietary content application to users of the competing platform—can arise from the difference in their profit foci. As the difference in the standalone utilities increases, royalties from content sales become less important to the platform owner with greater standalone value, but more important to the other platform owner. One-way compatibility can thus increase asymmetry between the platform owners’ profit foci and, given a sufficiently large difference in the standalone utilities, yields greater profits for both platform owners. We further show that social welfare is greater under one-way compatibility than under incompatibility. We also investigate how factors such as exclusive content and hardware-only adopters affect compatibility incentives. This paper was accepted by Chris Forman, information systems.},

  abstract     = {We investigate how firms can use the results of field experiments to optimize the targeting of promotions when prospecting for new customers. We evaluate seven widely used machine-learning methods using a series of two large-scale field experiments. The first field experiment generates a common pool of training data for each of the seven methods. We then validate the seven optimized policies provided by each method together with uniform benchmark policies in a second field experiment. The findings not only compare the performance of the targeting methods, but also demonstrate how well the methods address common data challenges. Our results reveal that when the training data are ideal, model-driven methods perform better than distance-driven methods and classification methods. However, the performance advantage vanishes in the presence of challenges that affect the quality of the training data, including the extent to which the training data captures details of the implementation setting. The challenges we study are covariate shift, concept shift, information loss through aggregation, and imbalanced data. Intuitively, the model-driven methods make better use of the information available in the training data, but the performance of these methods is more sensitive to deterioration in the quality of this information. The classification methods we tested performed relatively poorly. We explain the poor performance of the classification methods in our setting and describe how the performance of these methods could be improved. This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new method to disentangle individual from team productivity, CoScore . CoScore uses the varying membership and levels of success of all teams to simultaneously infer an individual’s productivity and her credit for each of her teams’ successes. Crucially, the productivities of all individuals are determined endogenously via the solution of a fixed point problem. We show that CoScore is well defined, and we provide axiomatic foundations for the inferred credit allocation. We illustrate CoScore in scientific research and sports.

  abstract     = {This paper studies heuristic thinking and cognitive bias using a natural experiment from the field. The setting for the study is a set of acute care hospitals, where we examine the care process and discharge decisions for individual patients. Determining a patient’s suitability for discharge is cognitively taxing, calling for the decision maker to draw on up-to-date clinical expertise and detailed information. We postulate that bounded rationality in decision making can lead the care provider to substitute clinical readiness for discharge, a more cognitively complex attribute, with the observed days spent in the hospital, a more easily accessible heuristic. Identifying the use of the heuristic is challenging, as patient readiness for discharge is often correlated with the time spent in the hospital. Our identification strategy, motivated by regression discontinuity design, exploits a discontinuity associated with the admission process at midnight. On the basis of more than 177,000 patient discharges spanning eight years, we find support for the use of the heuristic: 19.2\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) [14.6\%, 23.8\%]) of patients incur an increased length of stay by a day on average as a result of the heuristic. We also find that the reliance on the heuristic is associated with overtreatment; postmidnight patients on average cost $512 (95\% CI [$100, $923]) more but without any corresponding improvement in healthcare outcomes. A counterfactual analysis shows that eliminating the heuristic lowers the bed capacity needed to maintain the same patient throughput. For example, for a hospital unit in our study with a bed capacity of 106, eliminating the heuristic would allow the hospital to maintain the same throughput with 1.61 fewer beds on average. These findings have a number of implications for policy formulation and managerial decision making. This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.},

  abstract     = {We construct an event-based outcome measure of firm-level environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact for public and private firms globally from 2007 to 2015 using data from RepRisk. Then we measure the societal impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagements using participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) as a proxy. We demonstrate a robust and striking difference between public and private firms: whereas private firms significantly reduce their negative ESG incident levels after UNGC engagements, public firms fail to do so and are more likely to engage in decoupled CSR actions—actions with no subsequent real impact. We then conduct a series of in-depth analyses to examine possible economic mechanisms. Our results are most consistent with shareholder–stakeholder conflicts of interest being the main moderator of decoupling. The intensity of this conflict is further moderated by three factors: ownership type, proximity to final consumers on the value chain, and specific ESG incident types. Other possible mechanisms, such as selective entry into UNGC and heterogeneities in media exposure, country representation, and entry timing, do not survive our analysis. Our results suggest that existing CSR engagements and one-size-fits-all CSR policy mandates might not necessarily lead to better societal outcomes, and a multi-tiered policy targeting different ownership and industry types might be more efficient at maximizing ex post ESG benefits.

  abstract     = {Dynamic pricing through price promotions has been widely used by online retailers. We study how a promotion strategy, one that offers customers a discount for products in their shopping cart, affects customer behavior in the short and long term on a retailing platform. We conduct a randomized field experiment involving more than 100 million customers and 11,000 retailers with Alibaba Group, one of the world’s largest retailing platform. We randomly assign eligible customers to either receive promotions for products in their shopping cart (treatment group) or not receive promotions (control group). In the short term, our promotion program doubles the sales of promoted products on the day of promotion. In the long term, we causally document unintended consequences of this promotion program during the month after our treatment period. On the positive side, it boosts customer engagement, increasing the daily number of products that customers view and their purchase incidence on the platform. On the negative side, it intensifies strategic customer behavior in the posttreatment period in two ways: (1) by increasing the proportion of products that customers add to their shopping cart conditional on viewing them, possibly because of their intention to get more shopping cart promotions, and (2) by decreasing the price that customers subsequently pay for a product, possibly because of their strategic search for lower prices. Importantly, these long-term effects of price promotions on consumer engagement and strategic behavior spill over to sellers who did not previously offer promotions to customers. Finally, we examine heterogeneous treatment effects across promotion, seller, and consumer characteristics. These findings have important implications for platforms and retailers.

  abstract     = {We consider the use and value of social-network information in selectively selling goods and services whose value derives from exclusive ownership among network connections or friends. Our model accommodates customers who are heterogeneous in their number of friends (degree) and their proclivity for social comparisons (conspicuity). Firms with information on either (or both) of these characteristics can use it to make the product selectively available and to personalize prices. We find that firms’ preferred customers are low degree and high conspicuity , with the conspicuity threshold nondecreasing in degree. Interestingly, although both degree and conspicuity levels are relevant to curating the desired customer base, we find that firms do not need conspicuity information to do so; its absence can be substituted by incentivizing customers to self-select. There is no such recourse for the absence of degree information. As a result, degree information is typically more valuable than conspicuity information. Our analysis suggests that there are two canonical categories of social information—less valuable “consonant” information on characteristics where firm and customer preferences are aligned and more valuable “competing” information where preferences are misaligned. Customers can be incentivized to act in a way that their actions are a perfect substitute for consonant information, making it less valuable.

  abstract     = {This paper studies an inventory management problem faced by an upstream supplier that is in a collaborative agreement, such as vendor-managed inventory (VMI), with a retailer. A VMI partnership provides the supplier an opportunity to manage inventory for the supply chain in exchange for point-of-sales (POS)- and inventory-level information from the retailer. However, retailers typically possess superior local market information and as has been the case in recent years, are able to capture and analyze customer purchasing behavior beyond the traditional POS data. Such analyses provide the retailer access to market signals that are otherwise hard to capture using POS information. We show and quantify the implication of the financial obligations of each party in VMI that renders communication of such important market signals as noncredible. To help institute a sound VMI collaboration, we propose learn and screen —a dynamic inventory mechanism—for the supplier to effectively manage inventory and information in the supply chain. The proposed mechanism combines the ability of the supplier to learn about market conditions from POS data (over multiple selling periods) and dynamically determine when to screen the retailer and acquire his private demand information. Inventory decisions in the proposed mechanism serve a strategic purpose in addition to their classic role of satisfying customer demand. We show that our proposed dynamic mechanism significantly improves the supplier’s expected profit and increases the efficiency of the overall supply chain operations under a VMI agreement. In addition, we determine the market conditions in which a strategic approach to VMI results in significant profit improvements for both firms, particularly when the retailer has high market power (i.e., when the supplier highly depends on the retailer) and when the supplier has relatively less knowledge about the end customer/market compared with the retailer.

  abstract     = {Platforms create value by matching participants on alternate sides of the marketplace. Although many platforms practice one-to-one matching (e.g., Uber), others can conduct and monetize one-to-many simultaneous matches (e.g., lead-marketing platforms). Both formats involve one dimension of private information, a participant’s valuation for exclusive or shared allocation, respectively. This paper studies the problem of designing an auction format for platforms that mix the modes rather than limit to one and, therefore, involve both dimensions of information. We focus on incentive-compatible auctions (i.e., where truthful bidding is optimal) because of ease of participation and implementation. We formulate the problem to find the revenue-maximizing incentive-compatible auction as a mathematical program. Although hard to solve, the mathematical program leads to heuristic auction designs that are simple to implement, provide good revenue, and have speedy performance, all critical in practice. It also enables creation of upper bounds on the (unknown) optimal auction revenue, which are useful benchmarks for our proposed auction designs. By demonstrating a tight gap for our proposed two-dimensional reserve-price-based mechanism, we prove that it has excellent revenue performance and places low information and computational burden on the platform and participants.

Nevertheless, restricting the agent’s pricing authority such that he cannot sell to low-valuation customers is typically optimal to prevent collusion.

Using a detailed panel of consumer data from a rental-by-mail firm, we estimate consumer utility for current consumption, obtaining heterogeneous preferences for bunching and smoothing consumption. Using counterfactual analysis, we evaluate the impact of improving service time. We find that the firm with improved service time might create more value for all consumers, but its profits and even revenues could diminish because value extraction becomes more difficult. We find a novel mechanism that causes this effect, which is driven by increased consumer heterogeneity in the valuation for each product and reduced differentiation across products. This result persists even when the firm can reoptimize its price levels based on the service time. We find that a change in the pricing strategy might be required for the firm to obtain higher revenue with improved service time. This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.},

We establish that match quality is a statistically significant and economically meaningful driver of firm performance. Higher-quality managers tend to be matched together across levels and achieve higher match quality during their joint employment. Match quality does not improve over the length of a joint employment spell, but lower match quality is found in pairs with more divergent educational attainment and prior strategic approaches. Hence, match quality is partly innate, and manager pairings may have difficulty improving their cooperation through learning. When we control for match quality, we find significantly lower estimates of heterogeneity in manager ability compared with commonly used estimators of managerial impact.

  abstract     = {We are the first to document and study the use of Rule 10b5-1 preset repurchase plans. Though the rule’s original intent was to clarify conditions for enforcing insider trading laws, generally thought to apply to individuals classified as firm insiders, we find strong use of the rule at the firm level to repurchase company stock. We exploit this new and widespread form of payout to examine an issue at the core of payout decisions—the trade-off between commitment and financial flexibility. Relative to open market repurchases, preset plans provide an expanded repurchase window and increased legal cover, albeit at the cost of reducing repurchase flexibility and the option to time repurchases. These costs and benefits are significantly associated with Rule 10b5-1 adoption: Firms with alternative sources of financial flexibility are more likely to precommit to a repurchase plan, as are firms with a history of poor repurchase timing and firms constrained by blackout windows. Consistent with preset plans signaling commitment, Rule 10b5-1 repurchase announcements are associated with greater and faster completion rates, with more positive market reactions, and with more dividend substitution than open market repurchases. Lastly, we find that preset repurchase plans represent a unique payout tool whose introduction encouraged a different set of firms to buy back stock and significantly altered the payout landscape.

The important economic implication is that in the long run, an all-equity portfolio dominates bond (or mixed) portfolios, which have lower geometric means. This comment shows that Levy’s result holds only if the marginal utility is also bounded from below . This seemingly technical correction has profound economic implications, because many commonly accepted preferences do not satisfy the lower bound condition. Indeed, for some standard preferences, the optimal stock–bond mix shifts toward bonds, not stocks, as the horizon increases, exactly opposite to Levy’s conclusion.

By assuming that the terminal wealth follows a log-normal distribution and that the marginal utility is bounded, he offers the necessary and sufficient distributional condition for AFSD.

Management Sci. 62(5):1415–1430.], there is indeed a technical error. Yet, adding one condition to the theorem (which can be added in two alternate ways) is sufficient to ensure the dominance of stocks over bonds in the very long run. For the commonly employed preferences, the empirical evidence conforms with the claim given in my original theorem 1, asserting that the portfolio with the higher geometric mean (stocks) dominates the other portfolio under consideration (bonds) as the investment horizon increases indefinitely. Thus, as advocated in my paper, stocks dominate bonds for investors with typical preferences who save for retirement. This paper was accepted by Karl Deither, finance.},

Learning from the crowdfunding sample creates a valuable real option because firms invest only if updated expectations about total demand are sufficiently high. This is particularly valuable for firms facing a high degree of uncertainty about consumer preferences, such as developers of innovative consumer products. Learning also enables firms to overcome moral hazard. The higher the funds raised, the lower the firms’ incentives to divert them, provided third-party platforms limit the sample size by restricting campaign length. Although the probability of campaign success decreases with sample size, the expected funds raised are maximized at an intermediate sample size.

  abstract     = {Just as employers face uncertainty when hiring workers, workers also face uncertainty when accepting employment, and bad employers may opportunistically depart from expectations, norms, and laws. However, prior research in economics and information sciences has focused sharply on the employer’s problem of identifying good workers rather than vice versa. This issue is especially pronounced in markets for gig work, including online labor markets, in which platforms are developing strategies to help workers identify good employers. We build a theoretical model for the value of such reputation systems and test its predictions on Amazon Mechanical Turk, on which employers may decline to pay workers while keeping their work product and workers protect themselves using third-party reputation systems, such as Turkopticon. We find that (1) in an experiment on worker arrival, a good reputation allows employers to operate more quickly and on a larger scale without loss to quality; (2) in an experimental audit of employers, working for good-reputation employers pays 40\% higher effective wages because of faster completion times and lower likelihoods of rejection; and (3) exploiting reputation system crashes, the reputation system is particularly important to small, good-reputation employers, which rely on the reputation system to compete for workers against more established employers. This is the first clean field evidence of the effects of employer reputation in any labor market and is suggestive of the special role that reputation-diffusing technologies can play in promoting gig work, in which conventional labor and contract laws are weak.

  abstract     = {In the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social-media platforms are facing increasing pressure to combat the propagation of “fake news” (i.e., articles whose content is fabricated). Motivated by recent attempts in this direction, we consider the problem faced by a social-media platform that is observing the sharing actions of a sequence of rational agents and is dynamically choosing whether to conduct an inspection (i.e., a “fact-check”) of an article whose validity is ex ante unknown. We first characterize the agents’ inspection and sharing actions and establish that, in the absence of any platform intervention, the agents’ news-sharing process is prone to the proliferation of fabricated content, even when the agents are intent on sharing only truthful news. We then study the platform’s inspection problem. We find that because the optimal policy is adapted to crowdsource inspection from the agents, it exhibits features that may appear a priori nonobvious; most notably, we show that the optimal inspection policy is nonmonotone in the ex ante probability that the article being shared is fake. We also investigate the effectiveness of the platform’s policy in mitigating the detrimental impact of fake news on the agents’ learning environment. We demonstrate that in environments characterized by a low (high) prevalence of fake news, the platform’s policy is more effective when the rewards it collects from content sharing are low relative to the penalties it incurs from the sharing of fake news (when the rewards it collects from content sharing are high in absolute terms).

We empirically examine this question on a crowd-based corporate earnings forecast platform (Estimize.com). By tracking user activities, we monitor the amount of public information a user views before making an earnings forecast. We find that the more public information users view, the less weight they put on their own private information. Although this improves the accuracy of individual forecasts, it reduces the accuracy of the group consensus forecast because useful private information is prevented from entering the consensus. To address endogeneity concerns related to a user’s information acquisition choice, we collaborate with Estimize.com to run experiments that restrict the information available to randomly selected stocks and users. The experiments confirm that “independent” forecasts result in a more accurate consensus. Estimize.com was convinced to switch to a “blind” platform from November 2015 on. The findings suggest that the wisdom of crowds can be better harnessed by encouraging independent voices from among group members and that more public information disclosure may not always improve group decision making.

The exhibitor has discretion about whether and when to show a movie, and the parties frequently renegotiate formal contracts after a movie has finished its run. We document that such ex post renegotiation is consistent with the distributor rewarding the exhibitor for adaptation decisions that improve their joint payoffs.

We explore this issue using a large field experiment that incentivized employees of a Fortune 500 company to use their workplace gym. We compare the effectiveness of a treatment with constant incentives over 8 weeks to two treatments that varied incentives over time. One variable treatment featured front-loaded incentives, which could, in theory, help procrastinators overcome startup costs to joining an incentive program. We find, however, that the front-loaded incentive did not increase participation on the extensive margin relative to the constant incentive and was less effective in sustaining exercise over time. The second variable incentive was designed to leverage short-term habit formation by turning incentives on and off over a longer period of time. This novel sporadic incentive showed slightly stronger effects than the constant incentive. We discuss how the nature of habit-formation processes affects the relative benefits of consistent versus periodic incentives. This paper was accepted by Uri Gneezy, behavioral economics.},

Search frictions generate an average of $333 per car in dealer markups.

In contrast to the classical inventory literature, we assume the firm does not know the demand distribution a priori and makes an adaptive inventory-ordering decision in each period based only on the past sales (censored demand) data. The standard performance measure is regret, which is the cost difference between a learning algorithm and the clairvoyant (full-information) benchmark. When the benchmark is chosen to be the (full-information) optimal base-stock policy, Huh et al. [Huh WT, Janakiraman G, Muckstadt JA, Rusmevichientong P (2009a) An adaptive algorithm for finding the optimal base-stock policy in lost sales inventory systems with censored demand. Math. Oper. Res. 34(2):397–416.] developed a nonparametric learning algorithm with a cubic-root convergence rate on regret. An important open question is whether there exists a nonparametric learning algorithm whose regret rate matches the theoretical lower bound of any learning algorithms. In this work, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. More precisely, we propose a new nonparametric algorithm termed the simulated cycle-update policy and establish a square-root convergence rate on regret, which is proven to be the lower bound of any learning algorithm. Our algorithm uses a random cycle-updating rule based on an auxiliary simulated system running in parallel and also involves two new concepts, namely the withheld on-hand inventory and the double-phase cycle gradient estimation . The techniques developed are effective for learning a stochastic system with complex system dynamics and lasting impact of decisions. This paper was accepted by Yinyu Ye, optimization.},

Specifically, we study the clearing problem : given a network of banks interconnected by financial contracts, determine which banks are in default and what percentage of their liabilities they can pay. Prior work has shown that when banks can only enter into debt contracts with each other, this problem always has a unique maximal solution. We first prove that when banks can also enter into credit default swaps (CDSs), the clearing problem may have no solution or multiple conflicting solutions, thus leading to default ambiguity. We then derive sufficient conditions on the network structure to eliminate these issues. Finally, we discuss policy implications for the CDS market.

We experimentally investigate continue/abandon decisions in a multistage project under two conditions: when the project is reviewed at every stage and when review opportunities are limited. Our results confirm findings in the literature that project abandonment tends to be delayed; yet, we also observe premature termination. Decisions are highly path dependent; in particular, subjects are more likely to abandon after observing reduced project value, and abandonment rate is higher near the middle—rather than near the beginning or end—of a project. Interestingly, when reviews are limited, subjects are less likely to continue a project that should be abandoned. At the same time, subjects are more inclined to review again after receiving negative (rather than positive) news. Our data are explained well by a model that incorporates three behavioral concepts—gains or losses from comparing the project value with an internal adaptive reference point, sunk cost bias, and status quo bias. Our work suggests that more frequent reviews need not lead to better project performance, and it also identifies contexts in which outside intervention is most valuable in project decision making.

We then use patent data to further analyze new technology development for a broader sample of more than 2,000 publicly traded firms. We find that data analytics capabilities are more likely to be present and are more valuable in firms that are oriented around process improvement and that create new technologies by combining a diverse set of existing technologies than they are in firms that are focused on generating entirely new technologies. These results are consistent with the theory that data analytics are complementary to certain types of innovation because they enable firms to expand the search space of existing knowledge to combine into new technologies, as well as the theoretical arguments that data analytics support incremental process improvements. Data analytics appears less effective for developing entirely new technologies or creating combinations involving a few areas of knowledge, innovative approaches where there is either limited data or limited value in integrating diverse knowledge. Overall, our results suggest that firms that have historically focused on specific types of innovation—process innovation and innovation by diverse recombination—may receive the most benefits from using data analytics.

  abstract     = {The United States is in the midst of a drug overdose epidemic. Although the online availability of drugs has been a growing concern with considerable speculation that digital platforms are contributing to this epidemic, empirical assessments have been lacking. To quantify this impact, we rely on the phased rollout of Craigslist, a major online platform, as an experimental setup. Applying a difference-in-differences approach on a national panel data set for all counties in the United States from 1997 to 2008, we find a 14.9\% increase in drug abuse treatment admissions, a 5.7\% increase in drug abuse violations, and a 6.0\% increase in drug overdose deaths after Craigslist’s entry. The impacts of Craigslist’s entry are larger among women, whites, Asians, and the more educated. Further, the unintended consequences of Craigslist are more likely to accrue in larger, wealthier areas with initially low levels of drug abuse. These findings raise the possibility that the marked growth in U.S. drug abuse may have partially stemmed from the wider availability of illicit drugs online at the very beginning of its evolution.

  abstract     = {Prior work has established that the financing environment can impact firm strategy. We argue that this influence can shape the earliest strategic choices of a new venture by creating a potential trade-off between two objectives: rapid growth and reaping the benefits of a positive reputation (glory). We leverage a simple reputation-building strategic choice—naming the firm after the founder (eponymy)—that is associated with superior profitability. Next, we argue via a formal model that the availability of/dependence on external financing can explain why high-growth firms are rarely eponymous. We find empirical support for the model’s predictions using a large data set of 1 million European firms. Eponymous firms grow considerably more slowly than similarly profitable firms. Moreover, eponymy varies in accordance with the firm’s financing environment in a pattern consistent with our model. We discuss implications for the literature on new-venture strategy.

Building on prior research, we propose a method for identifying the predicted level of special items, attributing any excess to opportunism, and demonstrate the importance of this partitioning for financial-statement users. In particular, we provide evidence that the opportunistic portion of special items is associated with lower future earnings, cash flows, and returns. We conclude that this portion of special items is more likely to contain opportunistically misclassified recurring expenses that should have been recognized as such in prior, current, or future periods.

The technology providers’ prevalent royalty-driven business model has gotten complicated in this multilateral supply chain, prompting formal research attention. Moreover, providers also consider forward integration into manufacturing to monetize their intellectual property. We characterize the appropriateness of different business model decisions for markets, which may have varying levels of consumer diversity and competitive intensity at intermediate layers. For the technology provider, our key results show that a subsystem base royalty approach is the optimal business model when dealing with monopolistic intermediaries or having a low degree of consumer diversity. However, a full-system base royalty business model becomes increasingly optimal when the intermediate supply chains face competition and consumer diversity increases. We present conditions under which the technology provider may want to forward integrate. Our formulation and results are relevant to technology providers, policy makers, and industry groups engaged in the prevailing heated global discussion on royalty base.

  abstract     = {Anecdotal evidence suggests that counterfeiting/piracy can help create online word of mouth (WOM) and through this boost demand, but how powerful is such WOM? To answer this question, we conduct a descriptive study with some attempts to establish near causality. We estimate the impact of piracy on WOM and ultimately revenue by applying a panel data method to all movies widely released in the United States from 2015 to 2017. In identifying the effects of piracy we make inventive use of Russian piracy data to construct instrument variables for piracy in the United States. This is possible because the key piracy site, The Pirate Bay, has been blocked in Russia since 2015. We find movies with prerelease piracy are associated with lower revenues despite the WOM effect. Critically, however, we show a positive correlation between postrelease piracy and WOM volume, and we extend the field by finding that the presence of postrelease piracy is associated with an approximately 3.0\% increase in box office revenue. We also note the impact of a raid by the Swedish Police that temporarily took down The Pirate Bay website in December 2014. The period when the site was down experienced a decline in WOM volume and revenues, consistent with the effect of lower postrelease piracy predicted by our models. Our findings suggest approaches to target scarce antipiracy resources, such as focusing on tackling damaging prerelease piracy. This paper was accepted by Juanjuan Zhang, marketing.},

We measure congestion by the number of bits of information that agents must (i) learn about their own preferences, and (ii) communicate with others before obtaining their final match. Previous results suggest that a high level of congestion is inevitable under arbitrary preferences before the market can clear with a stable matching. We show that when the unobservable component of agent preferences satisfies certain natural assumptions, it is possible to recommend potential matches and encourage informative signals such that the market reaches a stable matching with a low level of congestion. Moreover, under our proposed approach, agents have negligible incentive to leave the marketplace or to look beyond the set of recommended partners. The intuitive idea is to only recommend partners with whom there is a nonnegligible chance that the agent will both like them and be liked by them. The recommendations are based on both the observable component of preferences and signals sent by agents on the other side that indicate interest.

The same data can lead to positive or negative assessments when presented as stocks versus flows and can engender optimistic or pessimistic forecasts for the future. For example, when employment data from 2007 to 2013 are shown as flows (jobs created or lost), President Obama’s impact on the economy during his first year in office is viewed positively, whereas when the same data are shown as stocks (total jobs), his impact is viewed negatively.

  abstract     = {Inventory-based pricing under lost sales is an important yet notoriously challenging problem in the operations management literature. The vast existing literature on this problem focuses on identifying optimality conditions for a simple management policy while restricting to special classes of demand functions and to the special case of single-period or long-term stationary settings. In view of the existing developments, it seems unlikely to find general, easy-to-verify conditions for a tractable optimal policy in a possibly nonstationary environment. Instead, we take a different approach to tackle this problem. Specifically, we refine our analysis to a class of intuitively appealing policies, under which the price is decreasing in the postorder inventory level. Using properties of stochastic functions, we show that, under very general conditions on the stochastic demand function, the objective function is concave along such price paths, leading to a simple base stock list price policy. We identify the upper and lower boundaries for a candidate set of decreasing price paths and show that any decreasing path outside of this set is always dominated by some inside the set in terms of profit performance. The boundary policies can be computed efficiently through a single-dimensional search. An extensive numerical analysis suggests that choosing boundary policies yields close-to-optimal profit—in most instances, one of the boundary policies indeed generates the optimal profit; even when they are not, the profit loss is very marginal.

However, when specialties were ranked in the top echelons (i.e., top 10) or had high categorical prestige, they were less likely to involve other specialties (i.e., ego effect) and had a higher chance of performing procedures on patients admitted in other specialties (i.e., halo effect). These effects were mostly confined to minor (i.e., less invasive) procedures, implying that the impact of external rankings on patient outcomes is relatively benign.

The seller faces a partially uninformed population of consumers, interconnected through a directed social network. In the network, the seller offers rewards to informed consumers (influencers) conditional on inducing purchases by uninformed consumers (influenced). Rewards are needed to bear a communication cost and to induce word of mouth (WOM) either privately (cost per contact) or publicly (fixed cost to inform all friends). From the seller’s viewpoint, eliciting Private WOM is more costly than eliciting Public WOM. We investigate (1) the incentives for the seller to move to a denser network, inducing either Private or Public WOM, and (2) the optimal mix between the two types of communication. A denser network is found to be always better not only for information diffusion but also for seller’s profits, as long as Private WOM is concerned. Differently, under Public WOM, the seller may prefer an environment with less competition between informed consumers, and the presence of highly connected influencers (hubs) is the main driver to make network density beneficial to profits. When the seller is able to discriminate between Private and Public WOM, the optimal strategy is to cheaply incentivize the more connected people to pass on the information publicly and then offer a high bonus for Private WOM.

While considerable research has been devoted to the effect of practice on performance, little is known about optimal practice strategies. In this paper, we model the practice process for both skill acquisition and retention, and optimize its profile to maximize performance on a predefined date. For skill acquisition, we find that the optimal process involves multiple phases of practice increase and decrease, yielding U-shaped effort consistent with the principle of distributing practice, and that the transitions between phases are smoother for skills that are easily forgotten (e.g., cognitive skills) than for those that are easily retained (e.g., continuous motor skills). In particular for the latter, an extended period of rest should precede an ultimate high-intensity stress. For skill retention, the optimal practice strategy consists of cycles of either constant effort (for skills that are easily forgotten) or pulsed effort (for skills that are easily retained) consistent with the principle of alternating stress and rest. Our parametric model thus indicates when commonly used high-performance practice strategies are indeed optimal. This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.},

Exploration by current buyers helps future buyers better value these products and sellers. This externality across buyers raises the possibility that there may be too little exploration from the platform’s perspective. On the other hand, when sellers have market power and so price strategically, and platforms extract a share of seller revenue (i.e., charge commissions), the direction of any such bias is not obvious. We provide a theory that predicts when the platform will prefer more, less, or the same level of exploration as that induced by sellers in equilibrium. Our theory can explain why platforms will sometimes have no incentive to steer buyers one way or another, or may actually want to steer buyers toward established products and sellers.

  abstract     = {Approximate linear programs (ALPs) are well-known models for computing value function approximations (VFAs) of intractable Markov decision processes (MDPs). VFAs from ALPs have desirable theoretical properties, define an operating policy, and provide a lower bound on the optimal policy cost. However, solving ALPs near-optimally remains challenging, for example, when approximating MDPs with nonlinear cost functions and transition dynamics or when rich basis functions are required to obtain a good VFA. We address this tension between theory and solvability by proposing a convex saddle-point reformulation of an ALP that includes as primal and dual variables, respectively, a vector of basis function weights and a constraint violation density function over the state-action space. To solve this reformulation, we develop a proximal stochastic mirror descent (PSMD) method that learns regions of high ALP constraint violation via its dual update. We establish that PSMD returns a near-optimal ALP solution and a lower bound on the optimal policy cost in a finite number of iterations with high probability. We numerically compare PSMD with several benchmarks on inventory control and energy storage applications. We find that the PSMD lower bound is tighter than a perfect information bound. In contrast, the constraint-sampling approach to solve ALPs may not provide a lower bound, and applying row generation to tackle ALPs is not computationally viable. PSMD policies outperform problem-specific heuristics and are comparable or better than the policies obtained using constraint sampling. Overall, our ALP reformulation and solution approach broadens the applicability of approximate linear programming. This paper was accepted by Yinyu Ye, optimization.},

Using changes in U.S. Senate committee chairmanships as a source of exogenous variation in state-level federal government expenditures, I find that firms headquartered in states with increases in government spending significantly reduce their innovation output, as measured by their number of patents and the citations to these patents. These reductions are mostly concentrated in labor-intensive industries, in firms headquartered in states with lower unemployment rates, and in government-dependent industries. My findings suggest that resource diversion induced by increased government spending is a channel through which government spending may affect corporate innovation.

The standard information-aggregation techniques exacerbate p-hacking by increasing the probability of the type I error. We propose an aggregation technique that is a simple modification of three-pass regression filter/partial least squares regression with an opposite property: the predictability tests applied to the combined predictor become more conservative in the presence of p-hacking. Using simulations, we quantify the advantages of our approach relative to the standard information-aggregation techniques. We also apply our aggregation technique to three sets of return predictors proposed in the literature and find that the forecasting ability of combined predictors in two cases cannot be explained by p-hacking.

  abstract     = {We study a rebate program in the credit card industry where the firm automatically processed the rebate earned by consumers with flexible and effortless redemption opportunities in future transactions. Contrary to what the normative economic theory would predict, we document that consumers frequently failed to redeem their rebate. Given this observation, we examine what may have been the primary driving force behind this pattern and the implications for the firm. We provide evidence that the phenomenon that we observe in our study is a result of cardholders being influenced by the way their outcomes were framed. We find that redemption incidences coincide with episodes where rebates are a larger portion of the amount spent. On the basis of the empirical regularities, we formulate a model of cardholder behavior where the cardholder experiences increasing psychological utility when rebate redemption yields a deeper discount. The model estimates indicate that, although delayed redemption left customers monetarily worse off in each transaction (cardholders passed up on average $0.76 of card-level benefits to experience greater psychological utility), once the psychological utility is taken into account, customers were shown to fare better overall. For the firm, in addition to the card benefits that were passed up, the psychological utility generated an additional average benefit of $1.21 per redemption. Finally, through counterfactuals we show that carefully designing a rebate program that takes into account consumers’ psychological redemption utility can further benefit both consumers and firms.

I first examine the properties of the network using descriptive and regression analysis; then I develop a model of network formation for counterfactual analysis. It is found that most movies imitate and evolve around a “core” of the more successful movies. In addition, imitation is both conventional and atypical: a new movie usually follows a stream of similar movies yet simultaneously combines atypical elements from movies outside this stream. This atypicality, if well balanced, has a positive effect on the individual movie’s box office. However, I find that, in the long run, atypical combination may lead to a worse collective box-office performance because of the way it changes the market structure.

  abstract     = {We examine whether the recognition versus disclosure of identical accounting information affects the credit rating process and ultimately corporate credit ratings. The primary input into corporate credit ratings is adjusted financial statements, which the rating agencies create by modifying reported financial statements to reflect credit-relevant items not recognized under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The rating agencies have claimed that this process means that accounting changes that move previously disclosed information onto firms’ financial statements have virtually no effect on firms’ adjusted financial statements or their credit ratings. We show that this claim is incorrect using the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 158 (SFAS158). This standard did not prescribe any new financial information. Rather, it simply required the balance sheet recognition of a previously disclosed item. We find that firms recognizing an additional pension liability due to SFAS158 had lower leverage on the rating agency adjusted financial statements and received higher corporate credit ratings. This counterintuitive result occurs because the rating agency adjustments made before SFAS158 were punitive relative to the combination of the SFAS158 changes and the rating agency adjustments made after SFAS158. The difference in rating agency adjustments before and after SFAS158 was primarily due to rating agency adjustments in the pre-SFAS158 period that did not account for minimum liability adjustments, an aspect of pension accounting eliminated by SFAS158. Overall, our results indicate that SFAS158 generated real changes in rating agency adjustments and that these changes had real consequences for firms’ credit ratings.

Using a sample of private firms from 125 countries between 2006 and 2015, we show that firms that have their financial statements audited have more exports than firms that do not have their financial statements audited. To infer causality, we employ a regression discontinuity design (RDD). Using the discontinuity around the mandatory financial audit threshold, we find that firms slightly above the threshold have more exports than do firms that are slightly below the threshold. We also exploit the countries with exogenous regulation shocks to the mandatory audits. Using the difference-in-differences (DiD) design, we find that firms that are exempted from mandatory audits have less exports subsequent to the regulation change. Further analyses reveal that the effect of auditing is more pronounced in countries with higher audit quality and for firms with limited alternative information. Our findings suggest that the auditing function promotes exports—an important economic consequence for the global economic development. This paper was accepted by Shivaram Rajgopal, accounting.},

We identify one channel through which management can affect voting outcomes: increasing the turnout of (typically management-friendly) retail shareholders. Our study focuses on an observable managerial choice of how to deliver proxy materials to maximize retail turnout. Management can opt to send a full set of proxy materials to all shareholders, which increases retail turnout but also increases printing and mailing costs, or they can send a notice directing shareholders to proxy materials available online, which reduces costs but also decreases retail turnout. We find that managers are more likely to choose to deliver a full set of proxy materials when there are contentious items on the ballot for which they need additional voting support; and, indeed, the resulting support increases the likelihood that voting outcomes will align with management recommendations.

At the national level, we find no significant difference in the callback rates for a Muslim versus a Christian candidate, or for a gay versus a straight candidate. However, employers in Republican areas exhibit significant bias against the Muslim candidate relative to the Christian candidate. This bias is significantly larger than the bias in Democratic areas. The results on callback bias are robust to using state- and county-level data, to controlling for firm, job, and geographical characteristics, to including additional interaction effects in the empirical specification, and to several estimation strategies.

  abstract     = {We combine ideas from machine learning (ML) and operations research and management science (OR/MS) in developing a framework, along with specific methods, for using data to prescribe optimal decisions in OR/MS problems. In a departure from other work on data-driven optimization, we consider data consisting, not only of observations of quantities with direct effect on costs/revenues, such as demand or returns, but also predominantly of observations of associated auxiliary quantities. The main problem of interest is a conditional stochastic optimization problem, given imperfect observations, where the joint probability distributions that specify the problem are unknown. We demonstrate how our proposed methods are generally applicable to a wide range of decision problems and prove that they are computationally tractable and asymptotically optimal under mild conditions, even when data are not independent and identically distributed and for censored observations. We extend these to the case in which some decision variables, such as price, may affect uncertainty and their causal effects are unknown. We develop the coefficient of prescriptiveness P to measure the prescriptive content of data and the efficacy of a policy from an operations perspective. We demonstrate our approach in an inventory management problem faced by the distribution arm of a large media company, shipping 1 billion units yearly. We leverage both internal data and public data harvested from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Google to prescribe operational decisions that outperform baseline measures. Specifically, the data we collect, leveraged by our methods, account for an 88\% improvement as measured by our coefficient of prescriptiveness. This paper was accepted by Noah Gans, optimization.},

  abstract     = {Firms typically use query-based search to help consumers find information/products on their websites. We consider the problem of optimally ranking a set of results shown in response to a query. We propose a personalized ranking mechanism based on a user’s search and click history. Our machine-learning framework consists of three modules: (a) feature generation, (b) normalized discounted cumulative gain–based LambdaMART algorithm, and (c) feature selection wrapper. We deploy our framework on large-scale data from a leading search engine using Amazon EC2 servers and present results from a series of counterfactual analyses. We find that personalization improves clicks to the top position by 3.5\% and reduces the average error in rank of a click by 9.43\% over the baseline. Personalization based on short-term history or within-session behavior is shown to be less valuable than long-term or across-session personalization. We find that there is significant heterogeneity in returns to personalization as a function of user history and query type. The quality of personalized results increases monotonically with the length of a user’s history. Queries can be classified based on user intent as transactional, informational, or navigational, and the former two benefit more from personalization. We also find that returns to personalization are negatively correlated with a query’s past average performance. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our framework and derive the set of optimal features that maximizes accuracy while minimizing computing time.

  abstract     = {Recent research has found widespread discrimination by hosts against guests of certain races in online marketplaces. In this paper, we explore ways to reduce such discrimination using online reputation systems. We conducted four randomized field experiments among 1,801 hosts on Airbnb by creating fictitious guest accounts and sending accommodation requests to them. We find that requests from guests with African American–sounding names are 19.2 percentage points less likely to be accepted than those with white-sounding names. However, a positive review posted on a guest’s page significantly reduces discrimination: when guest accounts receive a positive review, the acceptance rates of guest accounts with white- and African American–sounding names are statistically indistinguishable. We further show that a nonpositive review and a blank review without any content can also help attenuate discrimination, but self-claimed information on tidiness and friendliness cannot reduce discrimination, which indicates the importance of encouraging credible peer-generated reviews. Our results offer direct and clear guidance for sharing-economy platforms to reduce discrimination. This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.},

  abstract     = {We propose a structural model of correlated learning with indirect inference to explain late-mover advantages. Our model focuses on a class of products with the following two features: (i) products that build on a common fundamental technology (e.g., computer processor, car, smartphone, etc.) and (ii) that consumers can observe some product attributes of a product (e.g., CPU clock speed, horsepower of a car engine, screen size of a smartphone, etc.), but when making their purchase decisions, consumers are not sure how efficiently the product can translate its observed attributes to performing tasks that they care about. For products that base on a similar technology, it is plausible that consumers use the information signals of one product’s technological efficiency to help them update their belief about another product’s technological efficiency within the same product category. As a result, a late entrant could benefit from the information spillover generated by an early entrant. We apply our framework to the statin market in Canada, where drugs rely on a similar mechanism to reduce the cholesterol level. In our model, patients/doctors can observe a statin’s efficacy in reducing the cholesterol level, but they are uncertain about how effectively it can convert its cholesterol-reducing ability to reducing heart disease risks. Our estimation results show that the combination of correlated learning and informative and persuasive detailing explain the success of the two late entrants in the statin market: Lipitor and Crestor.

  abstract     = {Building on incomplete contract theory, I investigate whether the likelihood of renegotiating financial covenants is affected by the debt-contracting value of borrowers’ accounting numbers. The debt-contracting value captures the inherent ability of accounting numbers to predict credit quality. Using a large sample of private credit agreements, I hypothesize and find that a higher debt-contracting value gives rise to smaller ex post measurement errors in accounting numbers used in covenants, and thus borrowers and lenders are less likely to renegotiate financial covenants. This effect is stronger when the financial covenant intensity is higher. Consistent with the notion that renegotiation improves contracting efficiency by eliminating errors in financial covenants, I show that the distance of the covenant variable to its new contractual threshold better predicts a borrower’s creditworthiness than does the distance to the original threshold absent the renegotiation.

The prior literature assumes that purchase decisions are independent from the waiting time. By contrast, we find that when people spend a longer time waiting in a line, they tend to consume more. We identify mental accounting for sunk costs as the underlying mechanism that drives this behavior; a larger purchase allows customers to offset the long wait suffered. Finally, we explore the effect of managerial practices commonly employed by firms to improve customers’ waiting experience. We find that although these practices indeed result in improved customer experience, they can actually result in lower consumption at the individual level.

Innovative business models—for example, fast fashion (e.g., Zara), e-tailing (e.g., Amazon), and ride-sharing (e.g., Uber)—are capable of offering new products and services that generate considerable consumer utility and transform industries. This paper develops a research framework for understanding business models and how business models have evolved over time. Links are made to the existing literature (primarily in pricing and operations), and simple models are developed to unify and clarify existing research findings. Through this framework, it is possible (i) to identify the few design decisions that explain the success of these diverse firms with otherwise seemingly disparate models, and (ii) to speculate on potential future business-model innovations.

  abstract     = {The underrepresentation of minorities in cultural industries is a widely publicized problem with far-reaching economic and social significance. It is also one of many industries in which employers suggest that the locus of bias is not within the organization but with the consumer. The empirical challenge of relating consumer behavior to employee composition has constrained prior efforts to test their claim and to test the theory of consumer discrimination more broadly. As a result, employers have gradually expanded the scope of the customer discrimination theory from one rooted in direct interaction to include an aversion to simply seeing employees of a different ethnicity. We explore how consumers respond to employee composition by evaluating the performance of films released in the United States as a function of the racial diversity of their cast. We find that films with a single black actor do not differ from those with zero black actors, and that films with multiple black actors in the principal cast actually achieve significantly higher domestic box-office revenues than either. To distinguish between competing explanations for this result, we conduct a vignette-based experiment that allows us to identify a positive influence of diversity on consumers’ assessments of quality, controlling for differences in film or actor appeal. Collectively, these results help discredit one rationale for unequal hiring in cultural industries and also suggest an important qualification to the theory of consumer discrimination: in settings where employee race is visible but the consumer is physically distant, diversity is more profitable than costly.

  abstract     = {We examine whether family firms invest more in employee relations than nonfamily firms. Using the variation in state-level changes in inheritance, gift, and estate taxes as an exogenous shock to family control, we find that family firms, particularly those in which a founder serves as chief executive officer or those in which a family member serves as a director on the board, treat their employees better than nonfamily firms. More importantly, family firms focus on investing in employee relations that help alleviate labor-related conflicts and controversies, possibly to avoid a negative family reputation among stakeholders. Family firms’ better treatment of their employees is also evident when we use a difference-in-difference test to exploit changes in family firm status due to (sudden) deaths of family members and firms’ inclusion in Fortune ’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list to identify employee-friendly treatment. We further find that family firms in the early stage of their life cycle invest more in employee relations when they operate in labor-intensive industries in which the benefits from family owners’ monitoring of employees are expected to be large. Moreover, we find that although nonfamily firms’ investment in employee relations is impeded by several constraints, such as short-term investor pressure, managerial myopia, and managerial agency problems, family firms do not suffer from such constraints. These findings help explain why underinvestment in employee relations is prevalent in public firms despite potential long-term benefits from such intangible investment.

The 187 participants in the experiment, which ran for four weeks and yielded 748 person-week observations, revealed a preference for about two remote working days per week. I observed no significant differences in the uptake of remote working days between men, women, parents, nonparents, fathers, and mothers. Mothers reported meaningfully reduced family–work conflict during remote working weeks, but fathers did not. Remote working generally increased job performance, but the effect was greatest for mothers.

In many real-world searches, however, distributions are not entirely unknown and can be learned through experience. To investigate learning in such settings, we conduct a large-scale behavioral experiment in which people search repeatedly from fixed distributions in a “repeated secretary problem.” In contrast to prior investigations that find no evidence for learning in the classical scenario, in the repeated setting we observe substantial learning resulting in near-optimal stopping behavior. We conduct a Bayesian comparison of multiple behavioral models, which shows that participants’ behavior is best described by a class of threshold-based models that contains the theoretically optimal strategy. Fitting such a threshold-based model to data reveals players’ estimated thresholds to be close to the optimal thresholds after only a small number of games.

We validate theoretical results that collaborative group structures may search more effectively in problems of low complexity but are outperformed by nominal structures at higher complexity levels. We call into question the dominance of the nominal group technique. Further close examination of search strategies reveals important insights: the number of generated solutions, a typical proxy for good problem-solving performance, does not consistently drive performance benefits across different levels of problem complexity. The average distance of search steps and the problem space coverage also play critical roles. Moreover, their effect is contingent on complexity: a wider variety of solutions is helpful only in complex problems.

Our method can be used to obtain a low-variance unbiased estimator for the expectation of a function of the state of a Markov chain at a given time step. We study applications to volatility forecasting and time-varying queues. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm dramatically improves on the standard Monte Carlo method for large values of d and is highly resilient to discontinuities.

  abstract     = {This paper examines how sentiment affects homebuyers’ housing transaction decisions with a focus on auction sales. Utilizing housing transaction data in Sydney from 2000 to 2014, we find that transaction prices are significantly higher for auction sales compared with private sales, consistent with the notion of a “winner’s curse.” Four sentiment proxies, including three weather-based sentiment proxies and a survey-based sentiment index, are used to derive novel measures of sentiment, revealing that higher sentiment is associated with higher transaction prices, particularly for auction sales. Moreover, sentiment boosts sale prices particularly when the housing market is in boom; however, investors are not more prone to sentiment bias than are owner-occupiers. Sentiment exhibits an asymmetric effect in that low sentiment dampens price to a greater extent compared with the price-boosting effect of high sentiment. Our result is robust to using national sport events as sentiment shocks, selection bias, and participation constraints. Potential mechanisms include present-biased preferences and sentiment-related projection bias. Overall, our evidence sheds light on the role of sentiment in housing market decisions.

  abstract     = {Celebrity endorsers can cause negative publicity that can spill over to the endorsed brand. However, little is known about the economic effects of firm reactions to these events. This study fills this gap and estimates how announcements of firms’ reactions (yes versus no), timing (slow versus fast), and type (maintain/suspend versus no reaction) affect daily abnormal stock returns (ARs) following negative publicity. Using 128 events of negative endorser publicity between 1988 and 2016 affecting firms in 230 cases, this study offers new and economically relevant insights. The most surprising finding is that firms can gain value depending on their response. Announcements of firms’ reactions positively affect ARs, especially if they occur quickly after negative publicity surfaces. The analyses reveal that fast (slow) announcements of firms’ reactions increase (decrease) firm value by 2.10\% (−1.88\%) over the next four trading weeks. Results also show that issuing statements suspending or maintaining the endorser both yield more positive ARs than not reacting at all. Further analyses identify conditions under which the stock market rewards maintaining or suspending an endorser. Firms have more positive ARs when they (1) suspend higher-blame endorsers, (2) suspend endorsers whose negative publicity is related to their occupation, (3) maintain endorsers with a high product fit, and (4) do not suspend apologetic endorsers. This study discusses implications for theory and practice and provides a strong empirical foundation for understanding the consequences of firm reaction announcements to negative celebrity endorser publicity.

  abstract     = {Many of the activities performed in firms are done by teams, where a common output is observed, but outsiders cannot observe the individual contributions of each team member. This leads to the possibility of some of the members of the team free-riding on the contributions of others. Repeated interactions of a team can then potentially lead to cooperation among the members of the team under the credible threat of returning to a free-riding equilibrium. However, repeated interaction under cooperation of a team may lead to decreasing overall output over time because the benefits of the team working together may exogenously decrease over time. This then leads to the optimal duration of a team being finite but stochastic, creating inefficiency, but being sufficiently long so that the elements of the team have an incentive to cooperate. This provides a theory of successive team formation and termination in a firm. The possibility for a too long duration for full team cooperation may then lead the firm to reduce the extent of team cooperation, to be able to reduce the expected duration of a team, and have fewer losses of the team lasting for too long.

However, imperfect knowledge about their preferences may (discontinuously) lead individuals to select into incentive-incompatible commitments, which reduce their welfare. I conducted a field experiment in which low-income individuals were randomly offered a new installment-savings commitment account. Individuals chose a personalized savings plan and a default penalty themselves. A majority appears to choose a harmful contract: While the average effect on bank savings is large, 55\% of clients default and incur monetary losses. A possible explanation is that the chosen penalties were too low (the commitment was too weak) to overcome clients’ self-control problems. Measures of sophisticated hyperbolic discounting correlate negatively with take-up and default, and positively with penalty choices. This finding is consistent with theoretical predictions that partial sophisticates adopt weak commitments and then default, whereas full sophisticates are more cautious about committing, but better able to choose incentive-compatible contracts.

Critically, however, accelerators also provide informative signals to founders about the probability of success. Founders use this information to decide whether to continue or shut down. To better understand these issues, I provide a model of accelerator participation and performance and then test empirical predictions from the model using a novel data set of approximately 900 accelerator companies across 13 accelerators and 900 matched nonaccelerator companies. I find that, through accelerator feedback effects, accelerator companies close down earlier and more often, raise less money conditional on closing, and appear to be more efficient investments compared with non-accelerator companies. Additional analysis using a separate sample of rejected accelerator applicants further supports these findings. These results suggest that accelerators help resolve uncertainty around company quality sooner, allowing founders to make funding and exit decisions accordingly.

This paper develops a framework for exploring the implications of a more scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision making. The panel sample of our randomized control trial includes 116 Italian startups and 16 data points over a period of about one year. Both the treatment and control groups receive 10 sessions of general training on how to obtain feedback from the market and gauge the feasibility of their idea. We teach the treated startups to develop frameworks for predicting the performance of their idea and conduct rigorous tests of their hypotheses, very much as scientists do in their research. We let the firms in the control group instead follow their intuitions about how to assess their idea, which has typically produced fairly standard search heuristics. We find that entrepreneurs who behave like scientists perform better, are more likely to pivot to a different idea, and are not more likely to drop out than the control group in the early stages of the startup. These results are consistent with the main prediction of our theory: a scientific approach improves precision—it reduces the odds of pursuing projects with false positive returns and increases the odds of pursuing projects with false negative returns.

We investigate how activities that can enhance a user’s reputation vary before and after the user finds a new job. We contrast this reputation-generating activity with activities that do not improve a user’s reputation. After finding a new job, users contribute 23.7\% less in reputation-generating activity; by contrast, they reduce their non–reputation-generating activity by only 7.4\%. These findings suggest that users contribute to Stack Overflow in part because they perceive such contributions as a way to improve future employment prospects.

  abstract     = {The ongoing shortage of organs for transplantation has generated an expanding literature on efficient and equitable allocation of the donated cadaveric organs. By contrast, organ donation has been little explored. In this paper, we develop a parsimonious model of organ donation to analyze the welfare consequences of introducing the donor-priority rule, which grants registered organ donors priority in receiving organs should they need transplants in the future. We model an individual’s decision to join the donor registry, which entails a trade-off between abundance of supply, exclusivity of priority, and cost of donating (e.g., psychological burden). Assuming heterogeneity in the cost of donating only, we find the introduction of the donor-priority rule leads to improved social welfare. By incorporating heterogeneity in the likelihood of requiring an organ transplant and in organ quality, we show that, in contrast to the literature, introducing the donor-priority rule can lower social welfare because of unbalanced incentives across different types of individuals. In view of the potentially undesirable social-welfare consequences, we consider a freeze-period remedy, under which an individual is not entitled to a higher queueing priority until after having been on the organ-donor registry for a specified period of time. We show this additional market friction helps rebalance the incentive structure, and in conjunction with the donor-priority rule, can guarantee an increase in social welfare by boosting organ supply without compromising organ quality or inducing excessively high costs of donating.

We study the long-chain design in an online stochastic environment in which the requests are drawn repeatedly and independently from a nonstationary probability distribution over the different demand classes. Also, the decision on how to address each request must be made immediately upon its arrival. We show the effectiveness of the long-chain design in mitigating supply–demand mismatch under a simple myopic online allocation policy.

In this paper, we take a data-analytics approach and develop an optimization model to determine the optimal appointment schedule in the presence of potential walk-ins. Our model is the first known approach that can jointly handle general walk-in processes and heterogeneous, time-dependent no-show behaviors. We demonstrate that, with walk-ins, the optimal schedules are fundamentally different from those without. Our numerical study reveals that walk-ins introduce a new source of uncertainties to the system and cannot be viewed as a simple solution to compensate for patient no-shows. Scheduling, however, is an effective way to counter some of the negative impact from uncertain patient behaviors. Using data from practice, we predict a significant cost reduction (42\%–73\% on average) if the providers were to switch from current practice (which tends to overlook walk-ins in planning) to our proposed schedules.

  abstract     = {Assortment optimization is an important problem that arises in many practical applications such as retailing and online advertising. The fundamental goal is to select a subset of items to offer from a universe of substitutable items to maximize expected revenue when customers exhibit a random substitution behavior captured by a choice model. We study assortment optimization under the Markov chain choice model in the presence of capacity constraints that arise naturally in many applications. The Markov chain choice model considers item substitutions as transitions in a Markov chain and provides a good approximation for a large class of random utility models, thereby addressing the challenging problem of model selection in choice modeling. In this paper, we present constant factor approximation algorithms for the cardinality- and capacity-constrained assortment-optimization problem under the Markov chain model. We show that this problem is APX-hard even when all item prices are uniform, meaning that, unless P = NP, it is not possible to obtain an approximation better than a particular constant. Our algorithmic approach is based on a new externality adjustment paradigm that exactly captures the externality of adding an item to a given assortment on the remaining set of items, thereby allowing us to linearize a nonlinear, nonsubmodular, and nonmonotone revenue function and to design an iterative algorithm that iteratively builds up a provably good assortment.

  abstract     = {We provide the first field evidence pointing at the role of pure self-image, independent of social image, in charitable giving. In an online fundraising campaign for a social youth project run on an opera ticket booking platform, we document how individuals seem to engage in self-deception to preserve their self-image. In addition, we provide evidence on stark adverse long-run effects of the fundraising campaign for ticket sales. “Avoiding the ask,” opera customers who faced more insistent online fundraising buy fewer tickets in the following season. Our results suggest that fundraising management should not decide in isolation about their campaigns, even if very successful. Rather, broader operational concerns have to be considered.

  abstract     = {We address the problem of designing appointment scheduling strategies in a stochastic environment accounting for patient no-shows, nonpunctuality, general stochastic service times, and unscheduled emergency walk-ins. A good appointment schedule seeks to help outpatient clinics to utilize their resources efficiently while containing patients’ waiting times. The task of identifying an optimal schedule is modeled as a nonlinear integer program, where the objective function is the outcome of stochastic analysis in transient state. We maintain the discrete nature of the appointment scheduling problem by considering arrival epochs with discrete supports. By looking at discrete-time snapshots of the random evolution of a single-server queueing model, we characterize probabilistically the system’s workload over time as a function of an appointment schedule, and we derive recursive expressions for the performance measures of interest. Subsequently, we unfold discrete convexity properties of the optimization problem. We prove that under general conditions the objective function is supermodular and componentwise convex. Under assumptions on patient punctuality, we prove that the optimal scheduling strategy minimizes a multimodular function, a property which guarantees that a locally optimal schedule is also globally optimal. The size of the local neighborhood, however, grows exponentially with the dimension of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to develop and implement an algorithm for minimizing locally a multimodular function over nonnegative integer vectors via submodular set-function minimization over ring families, a task that can be performed in polynomial time.

We find that buyers pay less for homes with unlucky addresses and more for homes with lucky addresses. There were fewer housing transactions on inauspicious days of the lunar calendar when people are advised to avoid making major economic decisions. This suggests that superstitious belief still affects economic activities. The demand for lucky addresses is also weaker on these inauspicious days, suggesting that superstitious belief indeed affects the demand for lucky addresses. Moreover, the price premium for a lucky address is significantly higher for apartments of larger size or on top floors. Because these two housing features can signal wealth and are highly visible, the larger price premium suggests that conspicuous spending motives also play a significant role in the Singapore housing market. We also find that informed buyers, even with less superstitious or conspicuous spending motives, might still pay price premiums for lucky addresses. In contrast, uninformed buyers are unlikely to pay a premium for these addresses. This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.},

  abstract     = {Gender quotas are frequently proposed to address persistent gender imbalances in managerial roles. However, it is unclear how quotas for female managers affect organizations and whether quotas improve or damage relationships between managers and their subordinates. We conduct a representative survey to study opinions on quotas for female managers and, based upon the survey, design a novel set of experiments to investigate how quotas influence wage setting and effort provision. Our findings reveal that both opinions about gender quotas and workplace behavior crucially depend on the workplace environment. In our survey, we observe that approval for gender quotas is low if women are not disadvantaged in the manager-selection process, regardless of whether there are gender differences in performance. Complementing this evidence, we observe in our experiments that quotas lead to lower effort levels and lower wages in such environments. By contrast, in environments in which women are disadvantaged in the selection process, we observe a higher approval of quotas as well as higher effort levels and higher wages. These findings are consistent with the concept of meritocracy and suggest that it is important to evaluate the perception of gender disadvantages in the workplace environment before implementing quotas.

We characterize various features of the optimal trading strategy, and demonstrate that the optimal strategy helps mitigate the tension between market- and tax-timing.

  abstract     = {We demonstrate that lottery markets can exhibit the “hot-hand” phenomenon, in which past winning numbers tend to have a greater share of the betting proportion in future draws even though past and future events are independent. This is surprising as previous works have instead documented the presence of an opposite effect, the “gambler’s fallacy” in the U.S. lottery market. The current literature also suggests that the gambler’s fallacy prevails when random numbers are generated by mechanical devices, such as in lottery games. We use two sets of naturally occurring data to show that both the gambler’s fallacy and the hot-hand fallacy can exist in different types of lottery games. We then run online experimental studies that mimic lottery games with one, two, or three winning numbers. Our experimental results show that the number of winning prizes impacts behavior. In particular, whereas a single-prize game leads to a strong presence of the gambler’s fallacy, we observe a significant increase in hot-hand behavior in multiple-prize games with two or three winning numbers.

Because investor limit orders also provide price improvement with execution risk, dark pools offer a natural substitute. In a model of informed trading in a market with a displayed limit order book and a dark pool that offers price improvement, higher valuation investors sort into order types with lower execution risk, generating an “immediacy hierarchy.” Dark pool price improvement predicts the order in the hierarchy: a price improvement closer to (farther from) the midquote positions dark orders below (above) limit orders, which improves (worsens) market quality and welfare. A dark pool that is operated by the limit order book is welfare improving, and welfare reduces with an independently operated pool. Because active and passive order flow migrate to the dark pool where price impact occurs only post-trade, price efficiency worsens with any positive level of dark trading.

  abstract     = {This paper examines how customer sentiment expressed through social media influences institutional investors’ investment decisions and firm value. We use psychology theory to classify the emotional content of social media-based word of mouth, which we refer to as ESWOM. We examine whether ESWOM influences institutional investors’ stockholdings differentially based on investor type and if institutional investors’ stockholdings mediate the relation between ESWOM and firm value. We identify eight types of ESWOM by linguistically interpreting web scrapings of millions of social media posts on 38 corporate brands for the 2007–2015 period. We find differential effects of ESWOM on stockholdings of institutional investors. Dedicated and quasi-index institutional investors increase their stockholdings in response to increases in positive ESWOM such as joy and trust. Transient investors decrease their stockholdings in response to increases in negative ESWOM such as anger, disgust, and fear. Competitive intensity and intangible asset intensity influence these results. Path analysis indicates that ESWOM influences firm abnormal stock returns and idiosyncratic risk both directly and indirectly through its effects on institutional investors’ stockholdings. These findings support our hypothesis that investors’ responses to customer sentiment vary based on whether they follow long-term or short-term investment strategies. Our research highlights the importance of understanding the heterogeneous preferences of institutional investors and their use of social media information for decision making.

In principle, such plans could motivate employees to perform both at a high level, based on objective criteria, and in accordance with company values, considered via managerial discretion. However, such plans could be counterproductive if enough participants (especially those who do not win) perceive that subjectivity (introduced via discretion) adds unfairness. We show that, on average, the tournament incentive plan was associated with improved store sales. We also find that such plans can be more beneficial for geographically distant participants, where the potential for improving alignment is greater.

The theory of information uncertainty (IU) suggests that the anomaly is amplified with IU; that is, with ambiguity in information about firm value. We theorize that a firm’s IT in general—and enterprise systems (ES) in particular—can mitigate IU, thus reducing the IU-induced underreaction anomaly. Based on a difference-in-differences analysis of a sample of 572 ES implementations, our main finding is that ES implementation does reduce IU-induced underreaction anomaly. This is achieved through a reduction in the firm’s fundamentals volatility and an improvement in information quality. We also find that firms with greater IT capability are better positioned to realize the anomaly-reducing benefits of ES implementation and that ES’s anomaly-reducing effect is most pronounced when high levels of both functional and operational ES modules are implemented. We obtain remarkably consistent results when using alternate empirical design, samples, and measures of news.

Firms can attenuate this reduction by substituting borrowing across banks, but only to a limited extent. The resulting reduction in borrowing capacity affects significantly both investment and employment: for firms whose effective capital requirements increase by 1 percentage point, fixed assets are reduced by 1.1\%, capital expenditures by 2.7\%, and employment by 0.8\%.

  abstract     = {This paper exploits an administrative regulation in Singapore that allows individuals to withdraw between 10\% and 30\% of their pension savings at age 55. We find a large and highly significant increase in individuals’ bank account balances within the first month of turning 55, which declines by about a third by the end of 12 months. Consumers use the increase in disposable income to pay down credit card debt. Liquidity constrained individuals are significantly more likely to increase their spending upon turning 55 than unconstrained individuals—nonetheless, the spending response of constrained individuals is concentrated on nondurable and nonvisible goods rather than visible goods. We also provide evidence that withdrawal behavior is responsive to the prices of durable goods such as cars. Consumers appear willing to forego much higher interest rates in their retirement accounts by leaving a sizeable portion of their withdrawn savings in a low-interest accruing bank account for at least a year after withdrawal. We show that, for some consumers, part of this behavior may be due to the desire to invest in the property market when housing returns are high. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.},

We randomly assign subjects to three treatments: starting and continuing at a high stake, starting at a low stake but jumping to a high stake after a few periods, and starting at a low stake while gradually increasing the stakes over time (the Gradualism treatment). We find that relative to the other two treatments, groups coordinate most successfully at high stakes in the Gradualism treatment. We also find evidence that supports the belief-based learning model.

  abstract     = {We study a mechanism design problem in which an indivisible good is auctioned to multiple bidders for each of whom it has a private value that is unknown to the seller and the other bidders. The agents perceive the ensemble of all bidder values as a random vector governed by an ambiguous probability distribution, which belongs to a commonly known ambiguity set. The seller aims to design a revenue-maximizing mechanism that is not only immunized against the ambiguity of the bidder values, but also against the uncertainty about the bidders’ attitude toward ambiguity. We argue that the seller achieves this goal by maximizing the worst-case expected revenue across all value distributions in the ambiguity set and by positing that the bidders have Knightian preferences. For ambiguity sets containing all distributions supported on a hypercube, we show that the Vickrey auction is the unique mechanism that is optimal, efficient, and Pareto robustly optimal. If the bidders’ values are additionally known to be independent, then the revenue of the (unknown) optimal mechanism does not exceed that of a second-price auction with only one additional bidder. For ambiguity sets under which the bidders’ values are dependent and characterized through moment bounds, on the other hand, we provide a new class of randomized mechanisms, the highest-bidder lotteries, whose revenues cannot be matched by any second-price auction with a constant number of additional bidders. Moreover, we show that the optimal highest-bidder lottery is a 2-approximation of the (unknown) optimal mechanism, whereas the best second-price auction fails to provide any constant-factor approximation guarantee.

In practice, there may be multiple plausible distributions that can fit the input data reasonably well, especially when the data volume is not large. In this paper, we consider the problem of selecting the best from a finite set of simulated alternatives, in the presence of such input uncertainty. We model such uncertainty by an ambiguity set consisting of a finite number of plausible input distributions and aim to select the alternative with the best worst-case mean performance over the ambiguity set. We refer to this problem as robust selection of the best (RSB). To solve the RSB problem, we develop a two-stage selection procedure and a sequential selection procedure; we then prove that both procedures can achieve at least a user-specified probability of correct selection under mild conditions. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the computational efficiency of the two procedures. Finally, we apply the RSB approach to study a queueing system’s staffing problem using synthetic data and an appointment-scheduling problem using real data from a large hospital in China. We find that the RSB approach can generate decisions significantly better than other widely used approaches. This paper was accepted by Noah Gans, stochastic models and simulation.},

  abstract     = {Economically motivated adulteration (EMA) is a serious threat to public health. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework to examine farms’ strategic adulteration behavior and the resulting EMA risk in farming supply chains. We study both “preemptive EMA,” in which farms engage in adulteration to decrease the likelihood of producing low-quality output, and “reactive EMA,” in which adulteration is done to increase the perceived quality of the output. We fully characterize the farms’ equilibrium adulteration behavior in both types of EMA and analyze how quality uncertainty, supply chain dispersion, traceability, and testing sensitivity (in detecting adulteration) jointly impact the equilibrium adulteration behavior. We determine when greater supply chain dispersion leads to a higher EMA risk and how this result depends on traceability and testing sensitivity. Furthermore, we caution that investing in quality without also enhancing testing capabilities may inadvertently increase EMA risk. Our results highlight the limitations of only relying on end-product inspection to deter EMA. We leverage our analyses to offer tangible insights that can help companies and regulators to more proactively address EMA risk in food products.

  abstract     = {This paper studies an emerging business model of line-sitting in which customers seeking service can hire others (line-sitters) to wait in line on behalf of them. We develop a queueing-game-theoretic model that captures the interaction among customers, the line-sitting firm, and the service provider to examine the impact of line-sitting on the service provider’s revenue and customer welfare. We also contrast line-sitting with the well-known priority purchasing scheme, as both allow customers to pay extra to skip the wait. Our main results are as follows. First, we find that both accommodating line-sitting and selling priority can bring in extra revenue for the service provider, although by different means—selling priority increases revenue mainly by allowing the service provider to practice price discrimination that extracts more customer surplus, whereas line-sitting does so through demand expansion, attracting customers who would not otherwise join. Second, the priority purchasing scheme tends to make the customer population worse off, whereas line-sitting can be a win–win proposition for both the service provider and the customers. Nevertheless, having the additional option of hiring line-sitters does not always benefit customers as a whole because the demand expansion effect also induces negative congestion externalities. Finally, despite the fact that the service provider collects the priority payment as revenue but not the line-sitting payment, which accrues to the third-party line-sitting firm, we demonstrate that, somewhat surprisingly, accommodating line-sitting can raise more revenue for the service provider than directly selling priority.

Specifically, we consider appointment scheduling and sequencing under a time-varying number of servers, in a data-rich environment where service durations and punctuality are uncertain. Our data-driven approach, based on infinite-server queues, yields tractable and scalable solutions that accommodate hundreds of jobs and servers. We successfully test our approach against near-optimal algorithms (which exist for merely single-servers). This entails the development of a data-driven robust optimization approach with novel uncertainty sets. To test for practical performance, we leverage a unique data set from a cancer center that combines real-time locations, electronic health records, and appointments log. Focusing on one of the center’s infusion units (roughly 90 daily appointments, 25+ infusion chairs), we reduce cost (waiting plus overtime) on the order of 15\%–40\% consistently, under a wide range of experimental setups.

  abstract     = {Market thickness is a key parameter that can make or break a platform’s business model. Thicker markets can offer more opportunities for participants to meet and higher chances that a potential match exists. However, they can also be vulnerable to potential search frictions. In this paper, using data from an online peer-to-peer holiday property rental platform, we aim to identify and measure the causal impact of market thickness on matching rates. In particular, we exploit an exogenous shock to market size caused by a one-time migration of listings from other platforms, which gives rise to a quasiexperimental design. We find that increased market thickness actually leads to lower matching rates. Keeping search technology and other factors constant, doubling market size leads to a 15.4\% reduction in traveler confirmation rate and a 15.9\% reduction in host occupancy rate. As a result, the platform lost 5.6\% of potential matches because of the increased market size. We attribute the effect to increased search friction: travelers’ search intensity increases by 18.3\% when market size doubles. This effect is especially prominent when the matching needs to take place within a limited time. Our results offer insights for future empirical and theoretical research on matching markets. They also highlight that is important for platform owners to watch out for increased search frictions as markets grow and invest in search technologies to facilitate more efficient search.

Short-run price variation could efficiently allocate resources at these critical times but only if consumers exhibit short-run demand elasticity. The question for firms in these markets has always been how to enable this response. Randomized control trials are increasingly used to test dynamic pricing and technologies that can assist in response by providing information and/or automated response. However, the trials typically do not randomize short-run prices. This paper illustrates how demand from a randomly assigned control group can be used to test the effectiveness of different technologies in increasing short-term price elasticity. To do so, we use a nonparametric control function approach that eliminates the bias inherent in estimating short-term price response using only household random assignment. We find that only automation technology leads to the short-term price elasticity needed to justify real-time pricing. This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.},

  abstract     = {We examine whether managerial overconfidence impacts the use of performance-pricing provisions in loan contracts (performance-sensitive debt [PSD]). Managers with biased views may issue PSD because they consider this form of debt to be mispriced. Our evidence shows that overconfident managers are more likely to issue rate-increasing PSD than regular debt. They choose PSD with steeper performance-pricing schedules than those chosen by rational managers. We reject the possibility that overconfident managers have (persistent) positive private information and use PSD for signaling. Finally, firms seem to benefit less from using PSD ex post if they are managed by overconfident rather than rational managers. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.},

  abstract     = {We examine the role of political ideology in portfolio formation by studying a unique set of investors whose ideology can be precisely captured by a well-defined, continuous measure and whose personal asset allocation decisions are mandatorily disclosed, namely, the members of the U.S. Congress. As such, we overcome important methodological issues facing previous work in this area. We find that politicians with similar beliefs hold similar portfolios and that more liberal members engage in more socially responsible investing (SRI), even within political parties. Politicians disproportionately favor the SRI categories that reflect their favorite issues, while salience plays an important role in activating their ideologically based preferences for SRI. In addition, more ideological investors are less likely to engage in quid pro quo behavior. We conclude that ideology is a pervasive psychological factor that governs decisions across the domains of politics, investing, and, even, ethics. This paper was accepted by Lauren Cohen, finance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we theoretically and empirically study the intrahorizon value at risk (iVaR) in a general jump-diffusion setting. We propose a new class of models of asset returns, the displaced mixed exponential model, which can arbitrarily closely approximate finite and infinite activity Lévy processes. We then derive analytical results for the iVaR and disentangle, in a theoretically consistent way, the jump and diffusion contributions to the intrahorizon risk. We estimate historical and option-implied value at risk and iVaR for several popular jump models using the Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) 100 Index and American options. Empirically disentangling the contribution of the jumps from the contribution of the diffusion, we conclude that jumps account for about 90\% of the iVaR on average. Our back-testing results indicate that the option-implied estimates are much more responsive to market changes than their historical counterparts, which perform poorly.

  abstract     = {We examine the association between managers’ expertise and their discretionary bonus decisions in a hospital setting. We hypothesize that high-expertise managers make decisions that encourage cooperation among their subordinates. However, low-expertise managers cannot do so because their lower levels of knowledge, experience, and domain expertise prevent them from having sufficient personal influence to persuade other professionals to cooperate. We find that high-expertise managers make two types of bonus decisions: (1) keep a smaller share of the bonus pool than what they are entitled to retain and (2) allocate the remainder to subordinates more evenly after adjusting for the underlying heterogeneity in their productivity. We also find evidence that high-expertise managers whose bonus decisions reflect their support for cooperation have higher department performance than all other managers.

  abstract     = {The economics and management literature provides theoretical support for both leader and laggard firms to earn higher future operating returns. However, prior empirical research lacks a generalizable proxy to capture leader versus laggard behavior, thus limiting prior findings to specific contexts. This study utilizes a combination of firm-specific and industry life cycle identification to categorize leaders and laggards and validates the designation against constructs established in prior literature. Additionally, we examine each strategy’s effect on future performance, finding that, in general, laggards earn greater operating returns. Laggards gain their advantage through product differentiation—specifically, through marketing/advertising expenditures. Leaders are, on average, unable to convert their first movers’ advantage into sustainable future profitability once we control for other determinants of profitability. The leader/laggard classification using financial statement information has useful applications in analysis, forecasting, and valuation. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.},

  abstract     = {Entrepreneurs increasingly use reward-based crowdfunding to finance innovation projects through a large number of customer investments. The existing academic literature has predominantly studied factors that drive crowd investments and whether crowdfunding predicts market success. However, we argue that the involvement of customers goes beyond the provision of capital. As investors, customers enter into a principal–agent relationship with entrepreneurs. Thus, entrepreneurs are often faced with a crowd of customer investors who try to influence product development. We show that entrepreneurs can benefit from this influence, because customer investors provide some of the support usually received from institutional investors. Greater involvement from customer investors thus increases funding success. This holds when we control for creator ability and project quality. The effect is driven by customers’ influence on product development and the reduction in agency costs for prospective customers. We also link the involvement of customer investors during crowdfunding to the crowdsourcing literature and show that its positive effect is augmented by the elicitation of external information through distant search.

  abstract     = {Previous empirical studies find that lottery-like stocks significantly underperform their non-lottery-like counterparts. Using five different measures of the lottery features in the literature, we document that the anomalies associated with these measures are state dependent: the evidence supporting these anomalies is strong and robust among stocks where investors have lost money, whereas among stocks where investors have gained profits, the evidence is either weak or even reversed. Several potential explanations for such empirical findings are examined, and we document support for the explanation based on reference-dependent preferences. Our results provide a unified framework to understand the lottery-related anomalies in the literature. This paper was accepted by Tyler Shumway, finance.},
