  abstract     = {Autonomy and adaptability are essential components of ambient intelligence. For example, in smart homes, proactive acting and occupants advising, adapted to current and future contexts of living, are essential to go beyond limitations of previous domotic services. To reach such autonomy and adaptability, ambient systems need to automatically grasp their users’ ambient context. In particular, users’ activities and availabilities for communication are valuable pieces of contextual information that can help such systems to adapt to user needs and behaviours. While significant research work exists on activity recognition in homes, less attention has been given to prediction of future activities, as well as to availability recognition and prediction in general. In this article, we investigate several Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) architectures for activity and availability prediction of occupants in homes, including our novel model, called Past SItuations to predict the NExt Situation (PSINES). This predictive architecture utilizes context information, sensor event aggregations, and latent user cognitive states to accurately predict future home situations based on previous situations. We experimentally evaluate PSINES, as well as intermediate DBN architectures, on multiple state-of-the-art datasets, with prediction accuracies of up to 89.52\% for activity and 82.08\% for availability on the Orange4Home dataset.},

  abstract     = {Coalition formation has been a fundamental form of resource cooperation for achieving joint goals in multiagent systems. Most existing studies still focus on the traditional assumption that an agent has to contribute its resources to all the goals, even if the agent is not interested in the goal at all. In this article, a natural extension of the traditional coalitional resource games (CRGs) is studied from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, in which each agent has uncompromising, personalized preferences over goals. Specifically, a new CRGs model with agents’ strict preferences for goals is presented, in which an agent is willing to contribute its resources only to the goals that are in its own interest set. The computational complexity of the basic decision problems surrounding the successful coalition is reinvestigated. The results suggest that these problems in such a strict preference way are complex and intractable. To find the largest successful coalition for possible computation reduction or potential parallel processing, a flow-network–based exhaust algorithm, called FNetEA, is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. Then, to solve the problem more efficiently, a hybrid algorithm, named 2D-HA, is developed to find the approximately optimal solution on the basis of genetic algorithm, two-dimensional (2D) solution representation, and a heuristic for solution repairs. Through extensive experiments, the 2D-HA algorithm exhibits the prominent ability to provide reassurances that the optimal solution could be found within a reasonable period of time, even in a super-large-scale space.},

  abstract     = {Teaching by demonstrations and teaching by assigning rewards are two popular methods of knowledge transfer in humans. However, showing the right behaviour (by demonstration) may appear more natural to a human teacher than assessing the learner’s performance and assigning a reward or punishment to it. In the context of robot learning, the preference between these two approaches has not been studied extensively. In this article, we propose a method that replaces the traditional method of reward assignment with action assignment (which is similar to providing a demonstration) in interactive reinforcement learning. The main purpose of the suggested action is to compute a reward by seeing if the suggested action was followed by the self-acting agent or not. We compared action assignment with reward assignment via a user study conducted over the web using a two-dimensional maze game. The logs of interactions showed that action assignment significantly improved users’ ability to teach the right behaviour. The survey results showed that both action and reward assignment seemed highly natural and usable, reward assignment required more mental effort, repeatedly assigning rewards and seeing the agent disobey commands caused frustration in users, and many users desired to control the agent’s behaviour directly.},

  abstract     = {For the rising hazard of pirate attacks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm monitoring is a promising countermeasure. Previous monitoring methods have deficiencies in either adaptivity to dynamic events or simple but effective path coordination mechanisms, and they are inapplicable to the large-area, low-target-density, and long-duration persistent counter-piracy monitoring. This article proposes a self-organized UAV swarm counter-piracy monitoring method. Based on the pheromone map, this method is characterized by (1) a reservation mechanism for anticipatory path coordination and (2) a ship-adaptive mechanism for adapting to merchant ship distributions. A heuristic depth-first branch and bound search algorithm is designed for solving individual path planning. Simulation experiments are conducted to study the optimal number of plan steps and adaptivity scaling factor for different numbers of UAVs. Results show that merely decreasing revisit intervals cannot effectively reduce pirate attacks. Without the ship-adaptive mechanism, the proposed method reduces up to 87.2\%, 43.2\%, and 5.5\% of revisit intervals compared to the Lèvy Walk method, the sweep method, and the baseline self-organized method, respectively, but cannot reduce pirate attacks; while with the ship-adaptive mechanism, the proposed method can reduce pirate attacks by up to 6.7\% compared to the best of the baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Self-adaptation can be realized in various ways. Rule-based approaches prescribe the adaptation to be executed if the system or environment satisfies certain conditions. They result in scalable solutions but often with merely satisfying adaptation decisions. In contrast, utility-driven approaches determine optimal decisions by using an often costly optimization, which typically does not scale for large problems. We propose a rule-based and utility-driven adaptation scheme that achieves the benefits of both directions such that the adaptation decisions are optimal, whereas the computation scales by avoiding an expensive optimization. We use this adaptation scheme for architecture-based self-healing of large software systems. For this purpose, we define the utility for large dynamic architectures of such systems based on patterns that define issues the self-healing must address. Moreover, we use pattern-based adaptation rules to resolve these issues. Using a pattern-based scheme to define the utility and adaptation rules allows us to compute the impact of each rule application on the overall utility and to realize an incremental and efficient utility-driven self-healing. In addition to formally analyzing the computational effort and optimality of the proposed scheme, we thoroughly demonstrate its scalability and optimality in terms of reward in comparative experiments with a static rule-based approach as a baseline and a utility-driven approach using a constraint solver. These experiments are based on different failure profiles derived from real-world failure logs. We also investigate the impact of different failure profile characteristics on the scalability and reward to evaluate the robustness of the different approaches.},

  abstract     = {Bike-sharing systems have become an established reality in cities all across the world and are a key component of the Smart City paradigm. However, the unbalanced traffic patterns during rush hours can completely empty some stations, while filling others, and the service becomes unavailable for further users. The traditional approach to solve this problem is to use rebalancing trucks, which take bikes from full stations and deposit them at empty ones, reducing the likelihood of system outages. Another paradigm that is gaining steam is gamification, i.e., incentivizing users to fix the system by influencing their behavior with rewards and prizes. In this work, we combine the two efforts and show that a joint optimization considering both rebalancing and incentives results in a higher service quality for a lower cost than using simple rebalancing. We use simulations based on the New York CitiBike usage data to validate our model and analyze several schemes to optimize the bike-sharing system.},

  abstract     = {Data management using Device-to-Device (D2D) communications and opportunistic networks (ONs) is one of the main focuses of human-centric pervasive Internet services. In the recently proposed “Internet of People” paradigm, accessing relevant data dynamically generated in the environment nearby is one of the key services. Moreover, personal mobile devices become proxies of their human users while exchanging data in the cyber world and, thus, largely use ONs and D2D communications for exchanging data directly. Recently, researchers have successfully demonstrated the viability of embedding human cognitive schemes in data dissemination algorithms for ONs. In this article, we consider one such scheme based on the recognition heuristic, a human decision-making scheme used to efficiently assess the relevance of data. While initial evidence about its effectiveness is available, the evaluation of its behaviour in large-scale settings is still unsatisfactory. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a novel hybrid modeling methodology that combines an analytical model of data dissemination within small-scale communities of mobile users, with detailed simulations of interactions between different communities. This methodology allows us to evaluate the algorithm in large-scale city- and countrywide scenarios. Results confirm the effectiveness of cognitive data dissemination schemes, even when content popularity is very heterogenous.},

  abstract     = {In a normative environment, an agent’s actions are directed not only by its goals but also by the norms activated by its actions and those of other actors. The potential for conflict between agent goals and norms makes decision making challenging, in that it requires looking ahead to consider the longer-term consequences of which goal to satisfy or which norm to comply with in face of conflict. We therefore seek to determine the actions an agent should select at each point in time, taking account of its temporal goals, norms, and their conflicts. We propose a solution in which a normative planning problem is the basis for practical reasoning based on argumentation. Various types of conflict within goals, within norms, and between goals and norms are identified based on temporal properties of these entities. The properties of the best plan(s) with respect to goal achievement and norm compliance are mapped to arguments, followed by mapping their conflicts to attack between arguments, all of which are used to identify why a plan is justified.},
