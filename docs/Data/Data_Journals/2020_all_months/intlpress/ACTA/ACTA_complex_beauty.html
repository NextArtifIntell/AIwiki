  abstract     = {In his seminal 1976 paper, Bill Thurston observed that a closed leaf $S$ of a codimension‑$1$ foliation on a compact $3$‑manifold has Euler characteristic equal, up to sign, to the Euler class of the foliation evaluated on $[S]$, the homology class represented by $S$. The main result of this paper is a converse for taut foliations: if the Euler class of a taut foliation $\mathcal{F}$ evaluated on $[S]$ equals up to sign the Euler characteristic of $S$ and the underlying manifold is hyperbolic, then there exists another taut foliation $\mathcal{F}^\prime$ such that $S$ is homologous to a union of leaves and such that the plane field of $\mathcal{F}^\prime$ is homotopic to that of $\mathcal{F}$. In particular, $\mathcal{F}$ and $F^\prime$ have the same Euler class. In the same paper Thurston proved that taut foliations on closed hyperbolic 3‑manifolds have Euler class of norm at most one, and conjectured that, conversely, any integral cohomology class with norm equal to one is the Euler class of a taut foliation. This is the second of two papers that together give a negative answer to Thurston’s conjecture. In the first paper, counterexamples were constructed assuming the main result of this paper.},

  abstract     = {The main results of this paper involve general algebraic differentials $\omega$ on a general pencil of algebraic curves. We show how to determine whether $\omega$ is integrable in elementary terms for infinitely many members of the pencil. In particular, this corrects an assertion of James Davenport from 1981 and provides the first proof, even in rather strengthened form. We also indicate analogies with work of Andre and Hrushovski and with the Grothendieck–Katz Conjecture. To reach this goal, we first provide proofs of independent results which extend conclusions of relative Manin–Mumford type allied to the Zilber–Pink conjectures: we characterise torsion points lying on a general curve in a general abelian scheme of arbitrary relative dimension at least $2$. In turn, we present yet another application of the latter results to a rather general pencil of Pell equations $A^2 - DB^2 = 1$ over a polynomial ring. We determine whether the Pell equation (with squarefree $D$) is solvable for infinitely many members of the pencil.},

  abstract     = {An irreducible integrable connection $(E,\nabla)$ on a smooth projective complex variety $X$ is called rigid if it gives rise to an isolated point of the corresponding moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{\rm dR}(X)$. According to Simpson’s motivicity conjecture, irreducible rigid flat connections are of geometric origin, that is, arise as subquotients of a Gauss–Manin connection of a family of smooth projective varieties defined on an open dense subvariety of $X$. In this article we study mod-$p$ reductions of irreducible rigid connections and establish results which confirm Simpson’s prediction. In particular, for large $p$, we prove that $p$-curvatures of mod-$p$ reductions of irreducible rigid flat connections are nilpotent, and building on this result, we construct an $F$-isocrystalline realization for irreducible rigid flat connections. More precisely, we prove that there exist smooth models $X_R$ and $(E_R,\nabla_R)$ of $X$ and $(E,\nabla)$, over a finite-type ring $R$, such that for every Witt ring $W(k)$ of a finite field $k$ and every homomorphism $R \to W(k)$, the $p$-adic completion of the base change $(\widehat{E}_{W(k)},\widehat{\nabla}_{W(k)})$ on $\widehat{X}_{W(k)}$ represents an $F$-isocrystal. Subsequently, we show that irreducible rigid flat connections with vanishing $p$-curvatures are unitary. This allows us to prove new cases of the Grothendieck–Katz $p$-curvature conjecture. We also prove the existence of a complete companion correspondence for $F$-isocrystals stemming from irreducible cohomologically rigid connections.},

This result, that was only known to be true for $n \leqslant 4$, is optimal: $\log (1 / {\lvert x \rvert}^2)$ is a $W^{1,2}$ singular stable solution for $n \geqslant 10$. The proof of this conjecture is a consequence of a new universal estimate: we prove that, in dimension $n \leqslant 9$, stable solutions are bounded in terms only of their $L^1$ norm, independently of the non-linearity. In addition, in every dimension we establish a higher integrability result for the gradient and optimal integrability results for the solution in Morrey spaces. As one can see by a series of classical examples, all our results are sharp. Furthermore, as a corollary, we obtain that extremal solutions of Gelfand problems are $W^{1,2}$ in every dimension and they are smooth in dimension $n \leqslant 9$. This answers to two famous open problems posed by Brezis and Brezis–Vázquez.},
