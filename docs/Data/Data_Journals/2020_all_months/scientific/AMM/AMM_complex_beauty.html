  abstract  = {Cam mechanisms are used as the control system in several industrial fields such as filling and canning, textiles, automotive. This paper introduces the development of a software for designing planar cam mechanism adapting the dynamic and kinematic requirements. The designed cam profile is then changed into numerical data used to generate the machine codes served for CNC-based fabrication. Traditional cam design is very complicated and has accumulated errors. The envelope theory and inverse method are utilized to perform constraint in pressure angle and motion. The smallest cam radius is then determined in a non-linear optimization adapting the constraints. The paper also presents the design of a CNC machine for cam profile fabrication. The design includes the control system and the circuit board. The CNC control program is built to receive numerical data from cam design section, to simulate the cam profile fabrication and then to fabricate. The optimal design and fabrication are applied to the cam mechanisms with knife-edge/roller reciprocating/oscilating followers. The verification shows that the designed and fabricated cam adapts the requirement of accuracy.},

However, this method is also useful to propose solutions to redesign logistics systems such as warehouses and transport systems. This paper will apply system engineering in analyzing the late order problem at a pesticide company, thereby surveying stakeholders needs for warehouse re-designing. The functional analysis in the warehouse will be carried out in the concept analysis section to propose warehouse’s layout redesign alternatives that based on the demand of storage capacity and throughput. The authors also used the AHP method to select the final design layout. The detailed design section builds the operation process for the warehouse as well as the codification for commodity storage slots along with these tables forms that support for warehouse management. These solutions increase warehouse performance as well as the utilization in warehouses when applied in practice. Therefore, the system engineering method should be used in warehouse’s redesign},

An method to predict the temperature distribution in orthogonal cutting is based on the constituent model of various material and the mechanics of their cutting process. In this method, the average temperature at the primary shear zone (PSZ) and the secondary shear zone (SSZ) were determined for various materials, based on a constitutive model and a chip-formation model using measurements of cutting force and chip thicknes. The J-C model constants were taken from Hopkinson pressure bar tests. Cutting conditions, cutting forces and chip thickness were used to predict shear stress. Experimental cutting heat results with the same cutting parameters using the minimum lubrication method (MQL) were recorded through the Testo-871 thermal camera. The thermal distribution results between the two methods has a difference in value, as well as distribution. From the difference, we have analyzed some of the causes, finding the effect of the minimum quantity lubrication parameters on the difference.},

  abstract  = {Newly developed lead-free solder alloys, which contain doping some elements such as Ni, Bi, Sb, Al,..., have improved properties with respect to the conventional solder alloys, particularly in terms of resistance to creep. Their high performances are specifically desired in applications of power electronics where they are used for the electrical interconnections between the components. Studies on their resistance to rupture remain relatively limited. Yet the comprehension of fracture behavior is essential for the correct design of the electronic packages which must be robust against fatigue and vibrations loads. In this study, rupture of notched specimens fabricated from the InnoLot lead-free solder alloy is investigated. The tests are performed with the help of a micro-tensile testing machine equipped with an optical system for full-field measurements with Digital Image Correlation. The images are taken at successive steps of deformation and the displacement field is measured in a region of interest which is the singularity dominated zone surrounding the plastic zone at the crack tip. The procedure consists then in comparing the measured field with the theoretical field given by the Williams’ solution. The stress intensity factor is calculated by fitting the analytical fields to the experimental data. The effects of the size and shape of the zone of data collection, as well as that of the number of terms considered in the Williams’s expansion series, are examined in the study. A method is also proposed for the automatic crack tip detection.},

The Rules are given by one of maritime registers in the world that are the members of IACS, such as Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RMR), DNV, ABS, at el. The TV calculation (TVC) on the MPP usually is certainly a monumental calculation task and is conducted with special software for TVC. Nowadays, in accordance with the Rules, almost modern software products for TVC have the abilities to calculate the TVs at normal working regimes and at misfire regimes (called by Normal or Misfire regimes relatively) with only one of cylinders of marine diesel engine (MDE) while engine speed range covers from the minimum to maximum values of the operation speeds. The paper presents improved algorithms and software for automatic calculating the TVs (SATVC) at the Normal and the Misfire regimes, in which the misfiring processes appear not only in one cylinder, but also in two of the MDE cylinders together. The SATVC was based on the made mathematical models, algorithms and coded in LabView by authors. The SATVC consists of modules for automatic calculation of freedom TVs (FTVs), excited torsional moments (ETM), excited TVs (ETVs), permitted torsional pressures (PTP), and common management (CTVC). TVC at every working regime of MDE was automatically conducted in the following procedure: Configuration of the MPP for TVC; Calculation of FTVs; Calculation of ETM; Calculation of ETVs); Calculation of ETVs, and solution of the TVC in considered working regime. The working regime of MDE was modeled by a vector of firing coefficients (VFC) of every MDE cylinder.},

Different ratios of tap water and Hoagland’s solution were used as culture solution. The cathode and anode were used as electrode in this system. Bioelectric potentials and currents of each treatment are detected at fifteen day of the generating system. The results showed that plant system under solution containing a high Hoagland’s nutrient generated current density and power density higher than those of the system containing a low Hoagland’s nutrient. However, plant system under solution containing a low Hoagland’s nutrient showed higher voltage than those of the system containing a high Hoagland’s nutrient. Metal oxide nanoparticles, known as photo-catalyst in fuel cell, were added in the solution of culture system and analyzed for electric power density.

Aspect ratio (L/D) and the surface texture of OPF were investigated by using an optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. The result suggested that the most suitable condition for surface treatment of OPF was NaOH concentration of 10 %wt. at immersion time of 20 min. Aspect ratio and surface roughness of OPF increased after alkali treatment. For the effect of alkali treatment on the mechanical properties of the composite, it was evaluated by tensile and impact testings and SEM technique.

This work was focused on the residual heavy metal in an incinerator bottom ash from the municipal waste power plant placed in Nongkham district, Bangkok. Four bottom ash samples were obtained in 2017. After drying and grounding, the bottom ash samples were prepared to clear solution with the microwave digestion technique using nitric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid under the heating program. The total residual heavy metals in the incinerator bottom ashes, such as lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium were determined by using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (FAAS) with deuterium background correction. The total concentration of lead, copper, zinc and cadmium were found in the range of 280.40-354.22mg kg-1, 365.35-524.45 mg kg-1, 1,527.25-2,074.34 mg kg-1, and 0.48-1.02 mg kg-1, respectively. The recovery of all metals was found in the range of 89.4-101.2% and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was to be 2.15-3.55 % (n=7). The concentration of zinc, copper, and lead was found high levels, while cadmium was low concentration. Heavy metals in solid waste material occur in different chemical forms and phases. The sample preparation based on the microwave digestion was successfully developed for the waste samples with a good reliability.},

Unfortunately, the shelf life of fresh produces is short after harvesting. As a result, a dehydration process by converting freshly harvested parts into powders can be an alternative to extend the storage period. The powder delivers not only nutrients, flavor, color, and texture, but the dehydrated form is also easy for storage, transportation, and is used as an ingredient in healthy products. However, the loss of essential nutrients can besides occur during the dehydration process. In order to develop superfoods, choosing the type of fruits and vegetables which can maintain the highest both favor and nutritional is the most crucial consideration to gain the highest phytonutrients after the preservative process. This study was designed to explore and evaluate the potential of tropical Thai’s fruit and vegetable powders on antioxidant activity based on total phenolic compound (TPC) compared with the commercial superfoods outside the country. The TPC was assessed based on the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (FCR), correlating with antioxidant capacities. Gallic acid equivalents (GAE) in milligrams per gram dry of the sample was expressed. The highest GAE of the imported product (from a total of nine samples) was found to be 11.32+0.09 mg whereas the highest level of the total polyphenols was found in Thai’s veggies (Teaw) and fruit (Emblica) at 152.16+11.10 and 134.82+2.27, respectively. These GAE values are higher than the GAE values of selected imported fruits and veggies, which are well known as superfood constituents.},

The objective of MLR works execution is to extend the life span, sustain the train performance and achieve system reliability. Typically, the refurbishment scope consists of overhaul, upgrading and rectification works. The biggest challenge is to determine) the scope of refurbishment works and to create equilibrium between the feasibility and viability of the project. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to discuss the current practice of performing MLR maintenance through the utilization of Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and to transform the existing FMEA used by the automotive industry to fulfil the needs of Rolling Stock. The use of FMEA is critical in determining) the scope of train refurbishment work. It was carried out at the initial stages of the process in order to determine Risk Priority Number (RPN) to prioritize the type of refurbishment plans and scope. The design of the FMEA Worksheets, De-sign of FMEA severity Evaluation Criteria, Design of Occurrence Evaluation Criteria and Design of FMEA Prevention/Detection Criteria were adopted and adapted from the generic format so that it is coherent with Railway Industries. The results based on the transformation framework, the plan and scope of overhaul, upgrading and rectification were defined using the FMEA. Out of the 80 elements of MLR works that were analyzed using the FMEA approach, it was found that 46 elements needed overhaul, 23 elements needed upgrading and 11 elements needed rectification works. Finally, the application of the FMEA helped determine the MLR scope of work from 13 systems. The case study was taken from the Malaysia LRT Project, and currently the fleet has been in operation for more than 20 years (operated since year 1998).},

A study was carried out to define the gaps that are currently being faced in this industry. A comparison and contrast for an audit process flow chart was plotted and showed that there are processes have similar audit objectives, same auditees and involved with the same documents to be audited. Meanwhile, 5M (Man, Machine, Method, Material, Measurement and) 1 E (Environment) methodology were used to study audit requirements for both IATF 16949 and TPS and showed that both systems share the same audit items. Rasch model was used to measure the level of satisfaction, difficulties, and challenges faced by the people in the industry. By reducing the few steps in implementing the internal audit, it is expected to minimize the “wastes” that occurred during the execution of both audit systems. This case study has proposed that the integration of audit system of the IATF 16949 and TPS will harmonize the systems and reduce the hassle faced by the people in the industry.},

  abstract  = {A type of porous resin was proposed to replace the existing plaster mould for Ceramic Slip Rotary Moulding (CSRM) system. The proposed resin is often used in high pressure casting of ceramic sanitary ware and table ware. The effect of resin mould in terms of mechanical strength (flexural properties), porosity percentage and percentage of water absorption as well as moulding process were recorded and compared with previous studies of plaster mould. Five (5) samples of porous resin were prepared according to ASTM 790 for flexural test and ASTM D570 for water absorption test. To determine the porosity percentage, mercury porosimeter test was conducted. The result shows that higher the water plaster ratio resultant in higher porosity percentage and water absorption. The result showed that, the proposed porous resin has great potential in replacing plaster mould as mould material for CSRM system. The mould has a uniform open pore to enable the filtration process to take place within the mould and the slip and has a great mechanical strength. However, porous resin is still a semi-permanent mould with definite service life.},

Resistance spot welding (RSW) is commonly used in joining metal sheets due to its key capabilities, which is time and cost effective as well as high adaptability for automation. However, strength and reliability of a spot welded joint especially in an auto vehicle can be unpredictable. Premature failure of a spot welded joint can be difficult to be predicted but common factors that had been discussed in many research is related with fatigue and residual stress. Process parameter is recognized as one of critical factors affecting the reliability and quality of a spot welded joint. Different type of material and thickness may require different set of parameter to achieve an optimum result. Experimental procedure alone to demonstrate and investigate the effect could be too costly and time inefficient. Therefore, design of experiment and non-linear FEM simulation analysis were used to analyze and validate the result. This study shows the significance of process parameters such as weld current and electrode pressure to the strength of a spot welded joint and accurate setting is needed prior to the welding process to achieve an optimum result.},

Ti-6Al-4V has wide range of application in alloys due to its superior mechanical properties such as corrosion resistance, high tensile strength and toughness. Based on its great hardness value, conventional machining leads to high rates of tool wear, thus, WEDM is an alternative to manufacture Ti-6Al-4V, in which better surface characteristics can be produced. This work explores the surface integrity of Ti-6Al-4V alloy after WEDM in different input parameter. From the experimental work, good surface integrity can be achieved with low peak current. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis depicted the appearance of craters, crack, recast layer and globule of debris on the machined surface. Within the chemical composition on the machined surface, titanium seizes the highest percentage as there is no alternation of the metallurgical structure of the parent material. The microhardness value gradually increases from the machined surface to the parent material of Ti-6Al-4V due to over-aging of the machined surface and the work hardening during the process.},

These specimens were joined using gas metal arc welding (GMAW) with ER80S-N1 filler metal of 1.0 mm in diameter and mixed gases of 80% Ar + 20% CO2 as the consumables. Upon the welding completion, some of the fatigue specimens are treated using high-frequency mechanical impact device called pneumatic impact treatment (HFMI/PIT). The treatment procedure uses 90Hz of frequency, 6 bars of pneumatic pressure and 2 mm pin radius with aims to enhance the lifespan of the specimen. These fatigue specimens are classified in as-welded and HFMI/PIT. The fatigue test was conducted to all fatigue specimens until failure using a 250KN Instron fatigue machine with a constant amplitude loading, a stress ratio of 0.1 and stress loading from 55% to 75% of the yield strength of the base material. The fatigue data were evaluated based on the International Institute of Welding (IIW) evaluation procedures. Further, the fatigue life comparison between the as-welded and HFMI/PIT of both fatigue specimens also with the FAT class recommendation of the IIW for transverse fillet weld is plotted in the S-N curve diagram. Based on the assessment, it is found that the HFMI/PIT fatigue specimens attained higher fatigue life than the as-welded of both fatigue specimens. The most significant of fatigue life improvement after the HFMI/PIT is the HFMI/PIT transverse fillet weld. These treated welds obtained 256 MPa of FAT class which is 79 % higher than FAT class recommended by the IIW for the transverse fillet weld. Besides, the multi-pass welds on the groove weld of the transverse fillet weld on welds are found to contribute to a lower fatigue life of this specimen due to the existing weld defects on the fractured surface of the groove weld.},

BSA is a plasma lead concentrations or heparin plasma which is separated from blood sample and it is not associated with significant changes in iron or hemoglobin concentrations. In general, the gelatin is widely used as the best material for skin substitution since it exhibits the characteristic of human skin. However, the lab made skin layer was made of non-halal type gelatin (Type B). The methodology process started by adding the BSA and using the type A gelatin to carry out the mechanical properties and hy-per elastic behavior of halal lab made skin layer. A uniaxial tensile test standard that being used in this study is ASTM D412. The raw data (Load-Extension) from computational was plotted on graph stress-strain. The numerical approach such as Mooney-Rivlin model and Yeoh’s model were selected to analyze a stress-stretch of composition gelatin and BSA. From the results Mooney-Rivlin model, the con-stant, C1 is in the range of (0.0187-0.0658) MPa and C2 is in the range of (0.0628-0.0737) MPa. Meanwhile the constant, CP for Yeoh model is in the range of (0.0748-0.0861) MPa. As a conclusion, the composition of gelatin and Bovine Serum Albumin is a best combina-tion as it increases the strength of the lab made skin layer. Therefore, the most suitable composition is 10 wt.% of gelatin and Bovine Serum Albumin.},

The request by the students is collected by a CPU, before it is transmitted to the robot. The robot moves by following line on floor and read RFID tag for localization purpose. The robot has the ability to stop or avoid obstacle along the path received from the information obtained by the ultrasonic sensors. After the integration process, the performance of the developed system had been tested. The test had been carried out by moving EHAR through 3 points (RFID tags), where EHAR is required to turn on certain angle and direction after each tags read. The test was then repeated for another 10 times to obtained correct average results. The percentages of the average successful turns made by the EHAR are 83.3%. Therefore, it is hoped that this system will be implemented in exam halls and serves its purposes.},

  abstract  = {Polypropylene bags are widely used in many industries especially in agriculture and food industry. However, industries especially in food or fertilizer industries, need to use the polypropylene bags that can withstand a high level of humidity. To overcome this problem, a two-layers bag is required. This two-layers bag consists of outer layer woven bag and inner layer polypropylene bag. Currently they are produced by using conventional method where they are assembled manually by the workers. This manual method causes longer production time process, a high number of workers, and higher cost for mass production. To enhance the operation performance, automated polypropylene bags assembly system is proposed. By using an automated system, it can improve quality and consistency of processes, and reduced direct human labor costs and expenses where the worker is unneeded for assembling the polypropylene bag. To overcome this problem, this project is dedicated to design and develop a new Automated Polypropylene Bag Assembly Machine (APBAM) to operate the process automatically. This machine will execute three main processes - Grasping, Handling and Feeding. This paper will focus on the design of pneumatic actuator for grasping polypropylene bags in upward and downward motion. The design will be calibrated, analyzed and evaluated. The design of automated polypropylene bags assembly system will help to solve some of the problems that have been identified.},

In this study, a bio-inspiration meth-od was used to design a flapping wing for a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) that is inspired by bat wings. The objective of this study is to study the aerodynamic performance of a flapping wing based on bat wings at different angles of attack. This is done using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation where the aerodynamic performance a wing derived from a natural bat wing shape was studied. The wing was generated by tracing the wing shape of a bat wing and the shape was generalized to produce the wing shape. In the simulation, a 2-way Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) method was used where a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) solver was coupled with a CFD solver to simulate the wing during flapping flight. The flight condition was set at 1 m/s flight speed at a flapping frequency of 2.5Hz. From the results, it was shown that the wing has a zero-lift angle at 0o and a stall angle at 16o. It is also shown that the wing has a minimum drag angle at 3o and a maximum aerodynamic efficiency at angle of attack 12o.},

This consequently will affect the coefficient of discharge and the spray angle. This study conducted for the investigation of the relation between dimensionless numbers on the air core diameter. Dimensionless numbers are helpful aid for the quantification of independent parameters involving atomizer design and operating conditions simultaneously. Reynolds number, Re and orifice-to-swirl chamber diameter ratio, N are the dimensionless numbers selected for this study. Despite of the availability of study on the effect of dimensionless numbers on air core diameter, more study requires especially for smaller N. An experimental test-rig was constructed to conduct the performance test of the atomizer. Acquired images were analyzed using image-processing software. It was found that N has more significant effect on the change of air core diameter compared to Re. However, it is observed that at Re = 40000, N = 0.07 produces almost similar air core diameter with N = 0.25 at Re &amp;lt; 20000. In contrast, with N = 0.5, air core diameter produces are larger even at Re &amp;lt; 20000. Hence, it can be concluded that both Re and N are important parameters in characterizing the air core diameter in pressure-swirl atomizer.},

Solar energy comes directly from the sun and harnessing this energy is crucial for a sustainable future. In this research, a parabolic solar dish collector was utilized to harness the solar energy. The parabolic dish was hybridized with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) to produce both heat and electricity simultaneously. Since TEG has no moving parts, it requires almost no maintenance, thus making it reliable and robust. This paper presents the experimental investigation performed on the concentrator to convert heat energy from the concentrated solar power using TEGs. The goal of the project was to efficiently generate electricity by using the concentrating dish to concentrate the solar radiation onto the TEG. The TEG was installed on the focal point of the concentrating dish to convert the thermal energy into electricity directly. Air-cooled, fan-cooled and water-cooled cooling method were introduced to cool the generators. At the end of the experiment, it was found out that water-cooled cooling method induced the highest voltage among the other cooling methods.},

Furthermore, the situation is identified as the company has an inefficient distribution system of the rubber compound. Therefore, there is an abundant solid waste of rubber compound in the outsole pressing process. This research aims to reduce the waste of rubber compounds by regulating the rubber compound distribution using Material Requirement Planning (MRP) with a fixed order quantity lot-sizing technique. The using of MRP will lead to the consumption of the rubber compound can be controlled properly. Moreover, by reducing the utilization of rubber material, the company can minimize solid waste. The result shows that the company can reduce 38.75 kg/day rubber material for production line 1, while 3.69 kg/day for production line 2. Therefore, in one year the company can cut the consumption of the rubber material about 23.57 tons. By reducing the utilization of rubber material, the result indicates that the method can reduce the loss of production worth Rp. 5,240,000/day.

  abstract  = {Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia has around 1,056.87 tons of unmanaged waste per day, with 74.22% of its composition is food waste. This phenomenon can be reduced by using an efficient composting method using modified aerobic reactors. The purpose of this research is to identify the quality and quantity of compost as well as larvae (maggots) produced. The research was done for 30 days using two reactors that have different feedstock composition, i.e., the comparison of food waste: vegetable waste of 1:3 (first reactor) and 3:1 (second reactor). The initial mass of each feedstock was 8 kg. The result of composting showed that the compost weight was shrinking by 92.5% in reactor one and 89% in reactor two. The results of the analysis also showed that the second compost reactor had better qualities than reactor one, but the maggot protein content of the first reactor is better than the second reactor. The moisture content in the first reactor did not meet the standards (Indonesian National Standard/SNI of compost), whereas in the second reactor, the standards were achieved with the moisture content being 20.63%; P 1.55%; K 1.45% and C/N 14.03%. The content of NPK in liquid compost produced from the first reactor was 0.18% N; 0.05% P and 0.76% K, while the liquid compost in the second reactor contained 0.30% N; 0.04% P and 0.58% K.},

The composites were prepared by adding 1.5 g of activated carbon into chitosan solution 1.5% (w/v). The gels of chitosan activated carbon were then dropped into a 2.8% NaOH solution mixture to produce composite beads. The beads were neutralized using aquadest and dried in an oven at 50oC for 2 hours. The dried bead was used as adsorbent. The adsorption process was carried out with erlenmeyer in shaker bath with 0.5 g, 1 g, and 1.5 g at 25oC, 35oC and 45oC in 50 mL solution of Fe2+ metal ion having concentration of 10 ppm. Sample were taken in 5, 10, 20, 40 60, 80 and 120 min. Adsorbent were characterized by SEM and EDX. The composite beads adsorbent was analyzed by SEM and EDX. SEM results show that chitosan was successfully coated on activated carbon with a porous surface structure.

The development of sustainable procurement in Indonesia is still in its initial phase. Therefore, a framework is needed to establish an outlook to explore the enablers and barriers for promoting sustainable procurement in the construction industry. In the formulation of the framework, the first step is to identify the important elements. The approach was explorative-descriptive. Based on ISO 20400, as the guidelines for sustainable procurement, and literature on sustainable procurement for construction works, a list of elements was gathered. In-depth interviews were conducted to identify the most significant elements for the Indonesian construction public procurement context. Respondents included procurement experts from the government agency, (i.e., the National Public Procurement Agency and the Ministry of Public Works and Housing), academics, and procurement specialists who are the members of the Indonesian Procurement Professionals Association. Results suggest that all elements contained in ISO 20400 are relevant with the kinds of literature on construction works; also, Indonesian respondents agreed with all the identified elements ranging from “important” to “very important.” This finding will be subsequently used to further understand the complex cause-effect relationships among the important elements in developing the framework for sustainable construction public procurement.},

Its interactions between the building along the floodplain and the river dynamics can be simulated with Ansys Fluent as a simulation tool. This tool simulates the impact of floods could damage the buildings structure that built in flood zones but are still within the limits of habitable zone permits. Ansys Fluent modelling is using CFD parameters, by creating geometric scenarios that have been physically tested. The geometric behavior observed through the effect of large window openings (Experiment x), namely model 1 with one window and model 2 with 2 windows, then it is analysed by rotating 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90° of the building (Experiment y). The outputs that will be analyse from flood induced the building are (i) flood impact force, (ii) total force of building, and (iii) reduction of flow velocity in building. From the simulation result, it is found that building geometry with larger openings is better at resisting the impact strength of floods and reducing the velocity of flood flows. Furthermore, the graph of flood impact force and the total force of orientation in model 1 and model 2 have a tedency to increase while rotation angle increasing. We conclude that based on building type (Experiment x), the model with one window is most vulnerable model and based on building orientation (Experiment y), the model with orientation 90° is the most vulnerable model, but when viewed based on facade that is exposed to the main stream there is an opening, the orientation of 60° is the most vulnerable model.},

  abstract  = {. Elastics, a source of continuous orthodontic force, are divided into two types, latex and non-latex, which are made from natural rubber and synthetic rubber, respectively. The major advantage of natural latex elastics is its resiliency to intraoral tractive forces. However, as the incidence of allergic reactions to natural latex has become more widely recognized, non-latex orthodontic elastics have been developed as an alternative. The aim of this study is to investigate the in vitro mechanical properties of Thai non-latex orthodontic elastics as compared to commercially available products. 30 samples of each two Thai non-latex elastics (MTEC1, MTEC2) and two commercial elastics (AO, GAC) with a specified diameter of ¼ inches were used. Width, cross-sectional thickness (CT), and internal diameter (ID) of all samples were measured. Mechanical tests were then carried out to determine the initial extension force (F0), 24-hour residual force (F24), and percentage of force decay. The data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Statistically significant differences in elastic width among all four groups except between the Thai non-latex groups (MTEC1 and MTEC2) were found. AO elastics showed the greatest CT followed by GAC, MTEC2 and MTEC1. ID was significantly highest in GAC elastics and lowest in MTEC1 elastics. Although MTEC1 elastics had the lowest F0, the force still falls within the acceptable range for tooth movement (100-250g or 0.981–1.471N). MTEC2 elastics had the greatest F24 and also the lowest percentage of force decay followed by MTEC1, GAC, and AO elastics, which displayed the highest force decay, though no significant differences were found between the two commercial elastics. Thai non-latex elastics are suitable for orthodontic tooth movement due to its lower percentage of force decay after 24 hours.},

In the first two methods, digital models were designed with two types of markers, one with fully mocked up bracket (container method), and another with only marked bracket margins (marker method), then the models were printed out by a three-dimensional (3D) printer using pink resin and bracket transfer trays were vacuum formed on these models with polyvinylsiloxane. In the third methods, digital software was used to design full arch transfer trays, and printed by a stereolithographic 3D printer using elastic resin. With the transfer trays, the brackets were bonded onto dental stone casts, and a 3D model scanner was used to capture the final bracket positions on the casts. Superimpositions between the planned and actual bracket positions were done. Nonparametric statistical analyses were used to determine whether there were significant differences between planned and actual bracket positions and between the three methods. All significant differences in bracket position were less than 0.31 mm and most (95%) were less than 0.08 mm. Significant differences between all three methods were found. Indirect bonding methods using digital software combined with 3D printing show good accuracy with clinically insignificant positional discrepancies of less than 0.5mm.},

The water depth was maintained at 17 cm through a constant discharge of 35 lps in a re-circulating flume. Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) was used to store the velocity fluctuation of velocity components and further used as a pictorial frame to understand the turbulence and the turbulent kinetic energy around the cylinder, plate and in between the cylinder - vertical plate. From the pictorial contour diagrams drawn, the velocity vector represents the flow feature over the cylinder and it is found that a horseshoe vortex, developed upstream of the plate, does effect on turbulent kinetic energy formed in between cylinder and vertical plate.

Pipes are important and most cost bearing entity in a water pipeline distribution network. Hence proper selection of pipe is most challenging job to pipeline designers. This study shows about various processes involved in order to get an optimum design in respect to the selection of pipes using WaterGEMS software. A 60 MLD Subarnarekha Water Supply Scheme (WSS) is been considered where two numbers 30 MLD pumps with 40 m rated head have been proposed on the basis of two working and two standby modes to fulfill the demand of drinking water. Mainly cost variation is compared due to change in pipe diameter in relation with energy cost against this WSS. As per the data received, the inputs were incorporated and accordingly the results are interpreted. The whole considered network consists 37 pipes and 10 junctions. Various system outputs are been reflected for steady state simulations. An extended period simulation has also been carried out to compute filling time of all tanks according to their water demands. The pumping energy cost comparison is also reflected when a 1200 mm diameter of pipeline is been replaced with 1000 mm pipeline that runs for 4.173 km. This study is an effort to open up the process of cost optimization in pressure pipeline network for implementation in various water supply schemes.},

The analysis is used by multiple regression analysis and some performance indicators such as Coefficient of Determination (R2), Index of Agreement (IA), Prediction Accuracy (PA), Normalized Absolute Error (NAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The result identified the proposed model by Skempton’s, Sidharan, Nagaraj’s and Hough’s are suitable for the compression index (Cc) equation model.

For samples after sintering without space holder and binder addition, there were three deformation regions on the curves that were linear elasticity, plateau and densification. The mechanical behavior of materials was modeled, and the main parameters in the model were identified from the strain - stress curve. For sample after sintering with space holder and binder, materials were brittle. The mechanical properties of those samples were also determined.

As a material for monitoring was chosen fine-grained cementitious composites in the laboratory environment. For this purpose, a measuring device working on the principle of mechanical waves passing through the material was designed, assembled and verified. The experiment was conducted on cement pastes prepared from CEM I 42.5 R Portland cement with two different water coefficients (w/c = 0.40 and w/c = 0.33). The differences in the wave propagation in cement pastes were investigated. Simultaneously with this experiment, the monitoring and the saving records of the internal temperature was conducted. The results show the time of „critical changes&quot; in the internal structure of the material can be determined. These changes are probably related to the quality of the particle’s bonds in the inner material structure, which is reflected in the propagation of mechanical waves. Overall, it is shown these experiments could be used to expand the understanding of the various processes occurring during early hydration of cement, and the application of these results to field situations (in the future) could lead to the other development of, non-destructive (and nonintrusive) monitoring techniques.},

  abstract  = {. A primary current focus in concrete shear design is how to ensure the shear resistance of the concrete structures to withstand the possible adverse creep effects during the service life. All shear-carrying actions are supposed to depreciate due to the enhanced critical shear cracks under sustained loads. However, only a few studies that evaluated the performance of concrete structures failing in shear due to long-term loading. As the longitudinal tensile reinforcement strain influences the shear strength of RC beam, the shear resistance of the beam under sustained load may also be affected by the amount of longitudinal reinforcement. The present study aims at investigating the influence of flexural reinforcement ratio on the shear creep failures of reinforced concrete (RC) beams without stirrups by non-linear finite element analysis. In this study, the numerical model of RC beams with reinforcement ratios varying from 0.4% to 3.2% was evaluated under different loading rates. A loading rate of 1000 and 10000 times slower than the static loading rate were adopted to reveal the creep effects of RC beams.},

The surface elasticity and couple stress theories are utilized to form a mathematical model. The Green’s function method together with the equilibrium condition of the indentor is employed to formulate the key equations governing the contact pressure. A collocation technique and a set of available fundamental solutions of a half plane under the surface loading are adopted to determine the unknown contact pressure. Results from a numerical study reveal that the presence of both surface and couple stresses significantly alters the distribution of the contact pressure from that predicted by the classical linear elasticity, and the size-dependent characteristics of predicted solutions are obviously observed when the contact width is comparable to the internal length scales of the surface and bulk materials.},

Six groups of specimens were prepared with 2.5% volumetric contents of different combinations of fibers. For this purpose, micro-steel fibers with 6 and 15 mm length in addition to polypropylene fibers were used. Each group includes 12 identical specimens. The impact tests were conducted using the repeated drop-weight impact test of ACI 544-2R. However, higher drop-height (700 mm) and drop-weight (10 kg) were adopted to accelerate the failure and reduce the effort required to crack the specimens. The test results showed that the use of only 15 mm micro-steel fiber led to much higher impact resistance than other micro-steel fiber combinations. The recorded number of blows for the group with SF15 was 247, while those of SF6 and combined SF6 and SF15 were 127 and 112, respectively. The replacement of 0.5% of micro-steel fiber by 0.5% of PP fiber was found to reduce the impact resistance regardless of the type or combination of the used micro-steel fiber.},

Abrasion and compressive strength specimens were cast from six RPC mixtures using different single and hybrid distributions of 6 mm-length and 15 mm-length micros-steel fibers and 18 mm-length polypropylene fiber. Fixed mix proportions were used for the six RPC mixtures and with fixed total volumetric fiber content of 2.5%. In addition to the RPC mixtures, a normal concrete mixture was prepared for comparison purposes. All specimens were cured in the same conditions and tested at an age of 28 days. The test results showed that abrasion weight losses increase with time at rates that are independent of fiber type and fiber distribution. The results also showed that all RPC mixtures exhibited significantly lower abrasion losses than normal concrete. The lowest percentage abrasion weight losses were recorded for the mixture with pure 15 mm micro-steel, where after 12 testing hours, it was 0.41% of the total weight before testing. On the other hand, the mixture with pure 6 mm micro-steel fiber exhibited the highest percentage abrasion weight loss (0.98%) among the six RPC mixtures. Another conclusion is that the inclusion of polypropylene fiber to compose hybrid fiber distribution with micro-steel fiber led mostly to lower abrasion losses.},

NiTi closed coil springs (50.8% Ni-49.2%Ti) were manually fabricated around a 0.9mm diameter mandrel and heat treated at temperatures of 400°C, 450°C, and 500°C for 20 minutes. The outer diameter of each specimen was measured to determine the effect of heat treatment temperature on spring geometry. Tensile tests were carried out to measure the force levels at 3, 6, 9, and 12 mm of spring extension. Non-parametric statistical analyses were done to assess and compare the effects of different temperatures of heat treatment on the custom-made orthodontic closed coil springs. Heat treatment at lower temperatures produced larger outer coil diameters than at higher temperatures. Raising the temperature of heat treatment produced significant increases in force levels by 13-18 g especially between 400°C and 500°C at spring extensions of 3, 6 and 9 mm. The highest superelastic ratio of 5.44 was found in the NiTi coil springs that were heat treatment at 500°C for 20 minutes which signifies superelastic tendencies. The mechanical properties of NiTi closed coil springs are influenced by the temperature of heat treatment. The NiTi closed coil springs that were heat treated at 500°C for 20 minutes produce appropriate force levels to display a superelastic tendency for orthodontic use.},

This is because of the increased advantages in countries wherein durability, and operational or environmental constraints limit the efficiency of the conventional process. The construction industry everywhere faces problems and significant challenges including manpower, quality of productivity, preservation of the environment, mass transportation, water management, raw materials, durability and design life of construction products, chemical resistance, etc. The increased expense on the raw materials for construction is the primary focus of the study. The study aims to search for suitable alternatives that would allow sustainable development. The study emphasizes on the rising costs of construction materials and the necessity to work towards sustainability, alternative construction techniques and materials. Indigenous production of interlocks with mineral admixtures raises the potential applicability of the interlock pavers. To enhance the strength property and keeping sustainability in point of view, fly ash is used as a mineral admixture and partially replaced with cement in various proportions like 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% and 35%. Fourty eight interlock concrete paver blocks were cast and compressive strength for all specimens was calculated and later compared. A notable rise in the strength of the interlock pavers was observed at 15% and 20% replacement levels with fly ash. The optimum level for replacement was determined as 20% of the fly ash.},

This approach allows an accurate description of the interaction between trains and bridges. At the same time, it allows the formation of corrosion marks on each structural member of the bridge in a numerical model precisely based on actual measured data. In order to describe accurately the remaining load of the bridge under the moving load of the train, a dynamic testing and finite element modeling of a steel bridge are conducted and compared. At the same time, the results are also compared with the simulation results of the bridge model before being corroded. In addition, the paper also tests the reliability of the numerical model for assessments of similar bridges without actual measurement results that are costly and time-consuming.},

Vibrations are generated either by the moves of the tectonic plates, or by the volcanic activity, or by the collapse of the geological layers. The foundation conveys the maintained oscillatory movement and executes free cushioned oscillations. Due to the seismic action, an energy balance is created that contains: the energy induced into the structure, the energy absorbed by the structure and the energy returned to the ground. All these forms of energy constitute the capable energy of the structure. This energy reflects the possibilities of elastic structure deformation but also the elastoplastic deformation capacity. The seismic insulation systems are intended to reduce the impact of earthquakes on buildings by means of special devices. One uses two types of seismic systems: active and passive. The insulation of the propping base of the structure aims at inserting a smaller amount of energy into the superstructure. The protection of the structures exposed to the risk of earthquake is based on the three fundamental operational modes: insulation, connection, dissipation of energy. Connectors. Insulators and seismic dampers. The centrically braced metallic frames provide resilience, rigidity and ductility, being thus ideal for the bracing of the seismic systems.},

  abstract  = {Pure titanium and its alloys are widely used in automotive industry, due to their high specific strength (strength/density) and excellent corrosion resistance, despite of their high cost. From point of view of machining, turning experiments of the pure titanium involve few input parameters (cutting speed, feed rate or depth of cut) and investigation of their influence on the response parameters of the cutting process (temperature in this case). Objectives of this study are to find the optimal combination of the input parameters, so that the temperature in turning of pure titanium to be minimum. In order to use a small number of experiments, two major tools, signal-to-noise (one of the three characteristic: nominal is the best, smaller the better or larger is better) and orthogonal array as statistical method can be used. For this study, a L9 (34) orthogonal array was considered adequate, so nine experiments was conducted using each factor (speed, feed and depth of cut) at three different levels.},

Titanium alloyed with certain elements, such as tin or graphite, can lead to alloys with improved wear properties, with the specification that graphite does not exceed 1%. The technology of manufacturing titanium-based alloys is specific to powder metallurgy, but it also has some originality by choosing special sintering cycles.

  abstract  = {Lung cancer is the most common cancer globally with over 2 million new cases diagnosed every year. Fortunately, if caught early, the likelihood of survival is greatly improved. If diagnosed in Stage I, survival rates are &amp;gt;75% over 5 years, vs. just 1% if diagnosed in Stage IV. Early diagnosis requires finding and sampling (biopsy) small, peripheral nodules that are located in the parenchima of the lung and predominately outside small airways. Currently, for early diagnosis a bronchoscope is inserted into the lung airway but due to large size it cannot reach the small airways. Therefore, the doctor has to advance a sharp biopsy needle blindly from the tip of the bronchoscope and into the lung tissue in the approximate direction of the nodule. This blind procedure has low accuracy and carries a high risk of misdiagnosis. Currently, to improve the accuracy, real time x-ray (fluoroscopy) is use which causes exposure of the patient and physician to harmful radiation. Computer and image assisted surgery and medical robotics present viable solutions but are not optimal at present. The scope of our research was to develop a robotic solution for increased precision and accuracy of early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, to increase procedure success rate, decrease patient radiation and stress exposure, and reduce the procedure cost. For this purpose, we developed an advanced prototype of a robotic system which is small in size, easy to use and effective. To demonstrate its effectiveness in navigating to peripheral small size lung cancer lesions, we performed laboratory tests or a realistic lung airway model. The preliminary tests of a novel medical robot using a complex lung airway model proved that our catheter driving robotic system is working as designed and allows navigation, through a complex 3D channels structure like the bronchial tree, in both manipulator and robotic modes without fluoroscopy scanning. The robotic system is more precise and stable, and can avoid patient injury and instrument damage due to accidental impact with the airway wall. Because it could be controlled from a different room via the software platform, using this robotic system can drastically reduce radiation exposure of the patient and totally avoid the exposure of the doctor. Another benefit of the proposed robotic system is that it uses currently available catheters in which a reusable electromagnetic guide wire is temporarily inserted to guide the tip of the catheter towards hard to reach targets. After the target is confirmed, the sensor can be retracted and the catheter can be used for its routine function such as biopsy collection. Future development will include placement of a force sensor at the tip of the catheter to “feel” the wall and adapt the speed of insertion in order to avoid wall damage and an improved algorithm to increase the speed in the automatic mode.},

  abstract  = {Retinal microsurgery is one of the most technically demanding surgeries, during which the surgical tool needs to be inserted into the eyeball and is constantly constrained by the sclerotomy port. During the surgery, any unexpected manipulation could cause extreme tool-sclera contact force leading to sclera damage. Although, a robot assistant could reduce hand tremor and improve the tool positioning accuracy, it cannot prevent or alarm the surgeon about the upcoming danger caused by surgeon’s misoperations, i.e., applying excessive force on the sclera. In this paper, we present a new method based on a Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural network for predicting the user behavior, i.e., the contact force between the tool and sclera (sclera force) and the insertion depth of the tool from sclera contact point (insertion depth) in real time (40Hz). The predicted force information is provided to the user through auditory feedback to alarm any unexpected sclera force. The user behavior data is collected in a mock retinal surgical operation on a dry eye phantom with Steady Hand Eye Robot and a novel multi-function sensing tool. The Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural network is trained on the collected time series of sclera force and insertion depth. The network can predict the sclera force and insertion depth 100 milliseconds in the future with 95.29% and 96.57% accuracy, respectively, and can help reduce the fraction of unsafe sclera forces from 40.19% to 15.43%.},

After analytical calculation of the disk spring a numerical structural analysis was performed in order to validate the 3D model of the disk spring. A design optimization with 4 design variables was done for the disk spring and, based on the optimized design, the 3D model of the diaphragm spring was built. A 6 design variables model of the diaphragm spring was proposed for design optimization analysis having as design objective the minimization of the maximum equivalent stress during disengaging the clutch.},

  abstract  = {The current high-geared developments within the automotive sector have triggered a series of performance, comfort, safety and design-related issues. Hence, oftentimes manufacturers are challenged to combine various elements so as to achieve an attractive design, without diminishing the vehicle’s dynamic performance. Under the circumstances, the shape of the vehicle body becomes the key element that connects the design component with the performance requirement, since it directly influences the value of the resistance forces, and, respectively the air resistance. Aerodynamics is the branch of mechanical engineering that deals with the movement of gases (especially the air) and their effects on fluids. As far as the automotive sector is concerned, aerodynamics focuses mainly on the flow of the air currents over the vehicle body. When designing vehicle, the positive or negative displacement of the airflow is studied in aerodynamic tunnels. It is preferable for the negative displacement to push the vehicle as close to the ground as possible. In what follows we set out to study the influence of the drag coefficient and, implicitly, of the air resistance on vehicle performance. Hence, we will carry out comparative analysis of two vehicles with similar technical characteristics, but with different bodies, i.e. a hatchback and a sedan. The results obtained are then compared both by means of the analytical determination of the air resistance and via a simulation performed within the Virtual Crash software platform. The results recorded show that of the two vehicles, with the considered aerodynamic coefficients, hatchback type vehicle displays lower values in terms of air resistance.},

Thus, safety is a matter of great interest at national level and, perhaps internationally. Road safety on public roads in Romania is low compared to international standards. The mortality rate is more than twice the EU average. Given that road traffic and victim maintenance costs are a real economic problem, a European harmonization of the recording and assessment of events involving the bodily injuries of those involved in road events is necessary. Road events are one of the main causes of mortality in modern society. For this reason, the safety of motor vehicles has become the most important issue in their development. Road traffic injuries are a problem that can be controlled by proper attention to traffic avoidance strategies. Side impact is the second major cause of mortality and injury after frontal impact in road traffic analysis.},

  abstract  = {The analysis of the dynamic behavior of parts from the structure of the cationing mechanism of an internal combustion engine in 4 steps is followed. Thus, kinetic and dynamic models were developed for the motor mechanism considered as an assembly consisting of crankshaft, connecting rods, bearings and pistons. Dynamic models were built mainly in the Ansys program, based on the finite element method. The following problems were addressed, namely the dynamic analysis, with the determination of the response in time for displacements, stresses and deformations and also the vibration analysis in order to analyze the frequency response for the kinematic parameters of the whole system, but also of the component elements. Dynamic models for the numerical processing of the two types of analyzes were designed in a parameterized system with multiple possibilities of working on different time, frequency or different types of loadings and connection conditions. The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamic response of the main elements of the mechanism, for different types of materials. Given the wide field of applicability in automobiles, the technology for obtaining parts from sintered powders, the studies were realized for the cases when the connecting rod and the bearings are made of metallic powders, respectively of steel, to be extended for more complex cases, when we consider the influence of lubricant and temperature distribution in areas of practical interest.},

The effect of increasing the size of the machines, and in particular the size of the blades, led to the appearance of vibrational phenomena and the instability of aeroelastic origin (vibrations, noises). Basically, this work highlights the dynamic effects on a blade during its rotation taking into account, on the one hand, the mechanical forces (the centrifugal effect, the inertial effect) and, on the other hand, the aerodynamic effects. The blade, which is in motion, is subjected to three types of deformations: longitudinal, transverse and twisting.

Starting from the virtual skull model, the virtual models of the two upper premolars on the left hemisphere were generated, then the finite element method evaluated the stresses, displacements and strains generated by the resistance forces from the dental tissues of the two premolars during mandibular movements with occlusal contact. It is found that the value of these results increases as dental wear increases. This phenomenon is more visible in the teeth where the value almost doubles. Two explanations could be given for this situation: mechanically, these stresses are inversely proportional to the volume of the dental structures and, as they reduce, through dental wear, increase the stress, also, the sharp edges resulting from dental wear are mechanical stress concentrators.},
