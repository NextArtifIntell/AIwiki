  abstract     = {The emergence of multi-beam directional antennas (MBDAs) has paved the way for fast and high-throughput data communications by providing concurrent multi-directional transmissions. However, the existing routing protocols are not capable of utilizing the advantages of MBDAs. In this paper, we have developed a new routing scheme, called volcano routing, which can exploit the concurrent packet dispatching capability of MBDAs for high-throughput data delivery. Its topology resembles the flow of volcano lava and several routing “pipes” are used, which can detour around the network “holes” or blocked areas. The routing process consists of two phases: 1) Main path search phase: There is a main path at the core of each pipe. Multiple optimal main paths are formed that have a high potential of adding side nodes to enable multi-beam communications. A hierarchical scoring system and the performance metrics are used to evaluate the quality of the main paths. 2) Volcano establishment phase: The top-quality main paths are selected, and side paths are formed around each main path to establish the volcano pipes. A multi-beam traffic scheduling and dispatching policy is also proposed to achieve better performance. Our results show that the volcano routing scheme can exploit the advantages of MBDAs for achieving high data rates.},

  abstract     = {Recent diversification of mobile computing devices allows a mobile user to own multiple types of devices for different application scenarios, but also results in various restrictions on the performance and usability of these devices. A viable solution to such restriction is to incorporate and interconnect mobile devices towards a personal mobile cloud where these devices can complement each other via cooperative resource sharing, but is challenging due to the heterogeneity of mobile devices in both hardware and software aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel design of resource sharing framework to address these challenges and generically interconnect heterogeneous mobile devices. Our basic idea is to mask the hardware and software heterogeneity in mobile systems by exploiting the existing mobile OS services as the interface of resource sharing, and further develop the resource sharing framework as a middleware in the mobile OS. We have implemented our design over various mobile platforms with diverse characteristics and resource limits, and demonstrated that our design can efficiently support generic resource sharing among heterogeneous mobile devices without incurring significant system overhead or requiring individual system modification.},

Each of the two billion (as of 2017) Android devices relies on the system services of Android Framework to manage applications and system resources. Given its critical role, a vulnerability in the framework can be exploited to launch large-scale cyber attacks and cause severe harms to user security and privacy. Recently, many vulnerabilities in Android Framework were exposed, showing that it is indeed vulnerable and exploitable. While there is a large body of studies on Android application analysis, research on Android Framework analysis is very limited. In particular, to our knowledge, there is no prior work that investigates how to enable symbolic execution of the framework, an approach that has proven to be very powerful for vulnerability discovery and exploit generation. We design and build the first system, Centaur , that enables symbolic execution of Android Framework. Due to the middleware nature and technical peculiarities of the framework that impinge on the analysis, many unique challenges arise and are addressed in Centaur . The system has been applied to discovering new vulnerability instances, which can be exploited by recently uncovered attacks against the framework, and to generating PoC exploits.},

In this paper, we leverage the power of the crowdsourced user reviews to understand why an app requests a permission. We propose a framework, called SmartPI, that automatically identifies functionality-relevant user reviews and infers the permission implication of them, bridging the gap between the functionalities and the actual behaviors of an app. In particular, we extract features from the platform documents to identify functionality-relevant user reviews from noisy crowdsourced user reviews with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The topic model is further adopted to infer the permission implications of apps from the functionality-relevant user reviews. More than 20,000 apps, 2,653,159 users, and 4,247,769 user reviews are crawled from Google Play as a real-world dataset to evaluate the performance of SmartPI.

However, Frequency-Division Duplex (FDD) systems are vulnerable to eavesdropping, since the explicit CSI feedback can be manipulated. In this paper, we show that Time-Division Duplex (TDD) systems are insecure as well. In particular, we show that it is possible to eavesdrop on other users&#39; downloads by tuning training sequences. In order to defend MU-MIMO against such threats, we propose a secure CSI estimation scheme, which can provide correct estimates of CSI when adversarial users are in presence. We prove that our scheme is secure against training sequence based eavesdropping attack. We have implemented our scheme for TDD MU-MIMO systems and performed a series of experiments. Results demonstrate that our secure CSI estimation scheme is highly effective in protecting TDD MIMO networks against eavesdropping attack. Furthermore, we extend our scheme to support massive MU-MIMO networks, with a carefully redesigned uplink protocol and optimized power allocation to achieve higher spectral efficiency. To be more practical, we also take mismatch channel issue into our consideration. An enhancement scheme is proposed and we show that our scheme with enhancement is secure and correct under mismatch channel.},

For the offline case when the arrival statistics are known to the BS, we develop a structural MDP scheduling algorithm and an index scheduling algorithm , leveraging Markov decision process (MDP) techniques and the Whittle&#39;s methodology for restless bandits. By exploring optimal structural results, we not only reduce the computational complexity of the MDP-based algorithm, but also simplify deriving a closed form of the Whittle index. Moreover, for the online case, we develop an MDP-based online scheduling algorithm and an index-based online scheduling algorithm . Both the structural MDP scheduling algorithm and the MDP-based online scheduling algorithm asymptotically minimize the average age, while the index scheduling algorithm minimizes the average age when the information arrival rates for all users are the same. Finally, the algorithms are validated via extensive numerical studies.},

Specifically, we consider a distorted channel state information (CSI) model by taking into consideration various CSI errors such as packet detection delay (PDD) and CFO. We propose a multiscale sparse recovery algorithm to get rid of the effect of PDD and extract the carrier frequency component out of CSI. Then, we formulate the residual CFO estimation as a spectrum estimation problem and utilize the MUSIC algorithm to estimate the residual CFO. Real experiments and numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results and simulation results show that the residual CFO is time-varying, and compared with existing methods, the proposed method can better estimate and compensate the residual CFO, and thus achieve better results.},

  abstract     = {Spectrum sharing has been gaining its popular adoption as a potential solution to improve spectrum utilization in future wireless systems. Both Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) support dynamic spectrum access (DSA) as an enabling technology for spectrum sharing. To effectively realize DSA in practice, users (from both defense and commercial sectors) are required to share their (radio) operational information, which risks exposing their security, privacy, and business plan to unintended agents. Protecting users&#39; operating information is hence the key to DSA&#39;s success. In this paper, taking the FCC&#39;s spectrum access system (SAS) as a study case, we investigate the operational privacy issue of Incumbent Users (IUs) and honest/dishonest Secondary Users (SUs). For the case of IUs and honest SUs, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme for DSA by leveraging encryption and obfuscation methods (PSEO). To implement PSEO, we introduce an interference calculation scheme that allows users to calculate an interference budget without revealing operational information (e.g., antenna height, transmit power, location...), referred to as the blind interference calculation scheme (BICS). BICS also reduces the computing overhead of PSEO, compared with FCC&#39;s SAS by moving interference budgeting tasks to local users and calculating it in an offline manner. To further save the overhead in calculating the interference map, we introduce a quantization method and optimize the grid sizes of the terrestrial area of interest. Additionally, for the case of IUs and dishonest SUs, we propose a “punishment and forgiveness” (PF) mechanism, which draws support from SUs&#39; reputation scores (RSs) and reputation histories (RHs), to encourage SUs to provide truthful information. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations show that our proposed PSEO and PF-PSEO schemes can better protect all users&#39; operational privacy under various privacy attacks, yielding higher spectrum utilization with less online overhead, compared with state of the art approaches.},

The S-ALOHA protocol has been widely adopted even for multi-channel systems such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), as it is more practically implementable. However, the throughput of each channel in multi-channel S-ALOHA is limited to 0.368. In order to overcome this limit and some implementational drawbacks of the existing splitting algorithms, this paper proposes a novel splitting algorithm for multi-channel slotted systems which can also adapt to dynamic system situations through estimating the number of users who have packet to transmit. We analyze the throughput of our proposed algorithm and show that the proposed algorithm is more practical than the first-come first-serve (FCFS) algorithm and shows smaller access delay than the FCFS algorithm even for a single channel system. For M -channel systems, the proposed algorithm yields the maximum throughput of 0.487 M . Extensive simulations validate our analytical results.},

Technically, to address Seed Assignment Problem (SAP) arising during building CIV, we develop an approximation algorithm (AA) with a competitive ratio 0.632 by globally searching for the seed contributing to the most useful slot.

  abstract     = {Cooperative offloading in mobile edge computing enables resource-constrained edge clouds to help each other with computation-intensive tasks. However, the power of such offloading could not be fully unleashed, unless trust risks in collaboration are properly managed. As tasks are outsourced and processed at the network edge, completion latency usually presents high variability that can harm the offered service levels. By jointly considering these two challenges, we propose OLCD, an Online Learning-aided Cooperative offloaDing mechanism under the scenario where computation offloading is organized based on accumulated social trust. Under co-provisioning of computation, transmission, and trust services, trust propagation is performed along the multi-hop offloading path such that tasks are allowed to be fulfilled by powerful edge clouds. We harness Lyapunov optimization to exploit the spatial-temporal optimality of long-term system cost minimization problem. By gap-preserving transformation, we decouple the series of bidirectional offloading problems so that it suffices to solve a separate decision problem for each edge cloud. The optimal offloading control can not materialize without complete latency knowledge. To adapt to latency variability, we resort to the delayed online learning technique to facilitate completion latency prediction under long-duration processing, which is fed as input to queued-based offloading control policy. Such predictive control is specially designed to minimize the loss due to prediction errors over time. We theoretically prove that OLCD guarantees close-to-optimal system performance even with inaccurate prediction, but its robustness is achieved at the expense of decreased stability. Trace-driven simulations demonstrate the efficiency of OLCD as well as its superiorities over prior related work.},

  abstract     = {In interfering WLANs, clients are usually non-uniformly distributed. Therefore, their throughput can be improved by association control. WLANs adopt DCF (Distributed Coordinating Function) for media access control. The transmit probability of an AP is governed by its CW (Contention Window). Random Access control is to determine the CW size and hence the transmit probability of each AP. Client association control and random access control are coupled. APs associated with more clients require higher channel access opportunities. On the other hand, APs with higher transmit probability should serve more clients. We study the novel problem of maximizing the proportional fairness of client throughput by joint association control and random access control. As the joint problem is non-convex, we first consider that client association is given and propose an optimal policy for random access control. Given the CWs of APs, we propose a factor-2 approximation algorithm, Greedy-Asso to address the client association problem. Inspired by the optimal access control policy and Greedy-Asso, we further propose a distributed algorithm, termed CARA to tackle the joint optimization problem. Extensive simulation and experimental studies show that it outperforms comparison schemes by a wide margin in terms of throughput and fairness.},

  abstract     = {Accurate forecast of citywide crowd flows on flexible region partition benefits urban planning, traffic management, and public safety. Previous research either fails to capture the complex spatiotemporal dependencies of crowd flows or is restricted on grid region partition that loses semantic context. In this paper, we propose DeepFlowFlex, a graph-based model to jointly predict inflows and outflows for each region of arbitrary shape and size in a city. Analysis on cellular datasets covering 2.4 million users in China reveals dependencies and distinctive patterns of crowd flows in not only the conventional space and time domains, but also the speed domain, due to the diverse transportation modes in the mobility data. DeepFlowFlex explicitly groups crowd flows with respect to speed and time, and combines graph convolutional long short-term memory networks and graph convolutional neural networks to extract complex spatiotemporal dependencies, especially long-term and long-distance inter-region dependencies. Evaluations on two big cellular datasets and public GPS trace datasets show that DeepFlowFlex outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning and big-data-based methods on both grid and non-grid city map partition.},

Unlike passwords, biometrics cannot be forgotten. However, existing biometric systems are with controversy: once divulged, they are compromised forever. To this end, this paper explores a truly cancelable brain-based biometric system for the first time. Specifically, we present a new psychophysiological protocol via non-volitional brain response for trustworthy user authentication, with an application example of smart headwear. More specifically, we address the following research challenges in a theoretical and experimental combined manner: (1) how to generate reliable brain responses with sophisticated visual stimuli; (2) how to acquire effective brain response and analyze unique features in them for authentication; and (3) how to reset and change brain biometrics when the current biometric credential is divulged. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we conducted a pilot study and achieved an f-score accuracy of 95.46 percent and equal error rate (EER) of 2.503 percent, thereby demonstrating the potential feasibility of neurofeedback based biometrics for smart headwear applications. Further, the cancelability study proves the effectiveness of the reset brain password. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first in-depth research study on truly cancelable brain biometrics.},

We first formulate a stochastic optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the generalized alpha-fair function of the network. In order to solve it distributively, we then define and use the framework of noisy-potential games. In this context, we propose a Binary Log-linear Learning Algorithm (BLLA), which is distributed across cells and converges to a Nash equilibrium of the resource allocation game. This equilibrium is also an optimal for the resource allocation optimization problem. A key enabler for the analysis of the convergence are the proposed rules for computation of resistance of trees of perturbed Markov chains. The convergence of BLLA is proved for bounded and unbounded noise, with fixed and decreasing temperature parameter. A sufficient number of estimation samples is also provided that guarantees the convergence to an optimal state in a single cell scenario and close to an optimal state in a multi-cell scenario. We assess the performance of BLLA by extensive simulations by considering both bounded and unbounded noise cases and show that BLLA achieves higher sum data rate compared to the state-of-the-art.},

Unlike previous work, we treat the low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites as secure data storage mediums. We focus on data acquisition from a LEO satellite based data storage system (also referred to as the LEO based datacenters), which has been considered as a promising and secure paradigm on data storage. Under the LEO based datacenter architecture, one fundamental challenge is to deal with energy-efficient downloading from space to ground while maintaining the system stability. In this paper, we aim to maximize the amount of data admitted while minimizing the energy consumption, when downloading files from LEO based datacenters to meet user demands. To this end, we first formulate a novel optimization problem and develop an online scheduling framework. We then devise a novel coflow-like “Join the first K-shortest Queues (JKQ)” based job-dispatch strategy, which can significantly lower backlogs of queues residing in LEO satellites, thereby improving the system stability. We also analyze the optimality of the proposed approach and system stability. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through conducting emulator based simulations, based on real-world LEO constellation and user demand traces. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can dramatically lower the queue backlogs and achieve high energy efficiency.},

We develop in this paper a novel queue management policy by using a transient model to capture the interactions of IoT (short TCP) flows over traditional traffic in WiFi networks. Based on the Markov regenerative processes coupled with fluid model, we discover that the adaptive admission control (AAC) mechanism at the WiFi access point (AP) improves the response time and fairness of IoT traffic over the lossy WiFi links. To this end, under the proposed AAC, packets are admitted into the AP in such a way that the fractions of packets in the AP buffer belonging to the different IoT devices are balanced resulting in a comparable level of service. We furthermore prove the stability of the system dynamics under AAC which provides important practical insights in designing home WiFi IoT system.},

We observe that eye movements typically follow the keystrokes typing on the number-only soft keyboard during password input. By exploiting eye movement patterns, we are able to infer the passwords being entered. We propose a novel algorithm to extract sensitive eye images from video streams, and classify these images with Support Vector Classification. We also propose a novel classification enhancement algorithm to further improve classification accuracy. Compared with prior keystroke detection approaches, GazeRevealer does not require any external auxiliary devices, and it only relies on smartphone front camera. We evaluate the performance of GazeRevealer on several smartphones under different real-life usage scenarios. The results show that GazeRevealer achieves an inference rate of 77.89 percent for single key number and an inference rate of 84.38 percent for 6-digit password in the ideal case.},

  abstract     = {Along with Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is becoming a new computing paradigm that enables accommodating innovative applications and services with stringent response delay and resource requirements, including autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. Provisioning reliable network services for users is the top priority of most network service providers, as unreliable services or severe service failures can result in tremendous losses of users, particularly for their mission-critical applications. In this paper, we study reliability-aware VNF instances provisioning in an MEC, where different users request different network services with different reliability requirements through paying their requested services with the aim to maximize the network throughput. To this end, we first formulate a novel reliability-aware VNF instance placement problem by provisioning primary and secondary VNF instances at different cloudlets in MEC for each user while meeting the specified reliability requirement of the user request. We then show that the problem is NP-hard and formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we instead devise an approximation algorithm with a logarithmic approximation ratio for the problem. Moreover, we also consider two special cases of the problem. For one special case where each request only requests one primary and one secondary VNF instances, the problem is still NP-hard, and we devise a constant approximation algorithm for it. For another special case where different VNFs have the same amounts of computing resource demands, we show that it is polynomial-time solvable by developing a dynamic programming solution for it. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are promising, and the empirical results of the algorithms outperform their analytical counterparts as theoretical estimations usually are very conservative.},

It places a tremendous burden on the traditional logistics industry, which relies on dedicated couriers and is labor-intensive. Leveraging the ridesharing systems is a promising alternative, yet existing solutions are limited to one-hop ridesharing or need consignment warehouses as relays. In this paper, we propose a new package delivery scheme which takes advantage of multi-hop ridesharing and is entirely consignment free. Specifically, a package is assigned to a taxi which is guided to deliver the package all along to its destination while transporting successive passengers. We tackle it with a two-phase solution, named PPtaxi. In the first phase, we use the Multivariate Gaussian distribution and Bayesian inference to predict the passenger orders. In the second phase, both the computation efficiency and solution effectiveness are considered to plan package delivery routes. We evaluate PPtaxi with a real-world dataset from an online taxi-taking platform and compare it with multiple benchmarks. The results show that the successful delivery rate of packages with our solution can reach 95 percent on average during the daytime, and is at most 46.9 percent higher than those of the benchmarks.},

However, currently available individual app usage data is very limited, which does not cover a large user base. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to make personalized app usage estimation by learning user&#39;s app preference from the social media, i.e., public accessible tweets, which can also reflect user&#39;s interest and make up for the sparsity of app usage data. By proposing a novel generative model named IMCF+ to transfer user interest from rich tweet information to sparse app usage, we achieve personalized app recommendations via learning the interest&#39;s correlation between apps and tweets. Based on a real-world app usage and tweet dataset over a large population, we evaluate the performance of IMCF+ with a variety of scenarios and parameters. With only 10 percent training data, our IMCF+ approach achieves 82.5 percent hitrate in predicting the top ten apps. Moreover, IMCF+ outperforms the other six state-of-the-art algorithms by 4.7 percent and 10 percent in high sparsity case and user cold-start scenario, indicating the effectiveness of our method. All these results demonstrate that our technique can reliably learn user&#39;s interest from tweets to help solve the personalized app recommendation problem. Our study is the first step forward for transferring user&#39;s interest learned from social media to app preference, which paves the way for providing higher-quality personalized app recommendation and services for mobile users.},

  abstract     = {Smartwatches have gained significant popularity in recent years. One major use of smartwatches is notification checking as an extended display. Smartwatch use provides an opportunity for energy saving because it affords a reduction in the frequency of smartphone use. However, sometimes user input is limited in smartwatches due to its small screen size and users are forced to use their smartphones to fully read notifications. In such cases, the advantage of an extended display in the smartwatch diminishes because users need to access their smartphones, which causes extra smartphone battery consumption. We define phone-preferable notification that requires a user to take further actions, such as checking detailed content and replying to a message. Given that phone-preferable notifications are likely to be handled on smartphones, it is possible to defer notification delivery to smartwatches. In this paper, we develop a novel notification manager, called PASS that automatically defers phone-preferable notifications and piggybacks them on watch-preferable notifications. For model building and evaluation, we collect 15,659 notifications in-the-wild from 11 users for approximately 31 days. In addition, for approximately two months we gather self-reported data from five users regarding which devices were used to respond to notifications. The results show that PASS can save daily battery for smartwatches and daily battery for smartphones up to 43.5 and 0.9 percent without introducing any noticeable negative results on user experiences.},

  abstract     = {Efficient utilization of licensed spectrum in the cognitive radio network is challenging due to lack of coordination among the Secondary Users (SUs). Distributed algorithms proposed in the literature aim to maximize the network throughput by ensuring orthogonal channel allocation for the SUs. However, these algorithms work under the assumption that all the SUs faithfully follow the algorithms which may not always hold due to the decentralized nature of the network. In this paper, we study distributed algorithms that are robust against malicious behavior (jamming attack). We consider both the cases of jammers launching coordinated and uncoordinated attacks. In the coordinated attack, the jammers select non-overlapping channels to attack in each time slot and can significantly increase the number of collisions for SUs. We setup the problem in each scenario as a multi-player bandit and develop algorithms. The analysis shows that when the SUs faithfully implement proposed algorithms, the regret is constant with high probability. We validate our claims through exhaustive synthetic experiments and also through a realistic USRP based experiment.},

  abstract     = {In wireless sensor networks, routing protocols with immutable network policies lacking the flexibility are generally incapable of maintaining effective performance due to the complicated and rapidly changing environment situations and application requirements. The proposed “Flexible Routing Computing Approach (FRCA)” is a novel distributed and probabilistic computing approach capable of modifying or upgrading routing policies on the fly with low cost, which effectively enhances the routing flexibility. FRCA models the routing metric as a forwarding probability distribution for routing decisions. This model depends on three elements, the physical quantities collected at sensor nodes, the built-in base math functions, and the routing parameters. These elements are all user-oriented and can be specified to implement multifarious complicated network policies meeting different performance requirements. More significantly, through distributing routing parameters from the sink to end nodes, operators are allowed to adjust network policies on the fly without interrupting the network services. Through extensive performance evaluation studies and simulations, the results demonstrate that routing protocols designed based on FRCA could achieve better performance compared to its state-of-the-art counterparts regarding network lifetime, energy consumption, and duplicate packets as well as ensure high flexibility during network policies modification or upgrade.},

One of the crucial factors in the success of fog computing is on how to incentivize the individual users&#39; edge resources and provide them to end users such that fog computing is economically beneficial to all involved economic players. In this paper, we model and analyze a market of fog computing, from which we aim at drawing practical implications to uncover how the fog computing market should operate. To this end, we conduct an economic analysis of such user-oriented fog computing by modeling a market consisting of Infrastructure and Service Provider (ISP), end Service Users (SUs), and Edge Resource Owners (EROs) as a non-cooperative game. In this market, ISP, which provides a platform for fog computing, behaves as a mediator or a broker which leases EROs&#39; edge resources and provides various services to SUs. In our model, a two-stage dynamic game is used where in each stage, there exists a dynamic game, one for between ISP and EROs and another for between ISP and SUs, to model the market more practically. Despite this complex game structure, we provide a closed-form equilibrium analysis which gives an insight on how much economic benefit is obtained by ISP, SUs, and EROs from user-oriented fog computing under what conditions, and we figure out the economic factors that have a significant impact on the success of fog computing.},

Developing a scalable system for the orchestration of end-to-end (E2E) mobile network slices requires careful planning and very reliable algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel E2E Network Slicing Orchestration System (NSOS) and a Dynamic Auto-Scaling Algorithm (DASA) for it. Our NSOS relies strongly on the foundation of a hierarchical architecture that incorporates dedicated entities per domain to manage every segment of the mobile network from the access, to the transport and core network part for a scalable orchestration of federated network slices. The DASA enables the NSOS to autonomously adapt its resources to changes in the demand for slice orchestration requests (SORs) while enforcing a given mean overall time taken by the NSOS to process any SOR. The proposed DASA includes both proactive and reactive resource provisioning techniques. The proposed resource dimensioning heuristic algorithm of the DASA is based on a queuing model for the NSOS, which consists of an open network of G/G/m queues. Finally, we validate the proper operation and evaluate the performance of our DASA solution for the NSOS by means of system-level simulations.},

  abstract     = {Wireless powered mobile-edge computing (MEC) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance the data processing capability of low-power networks, such as wireless sensor networks and internet of things (IoT). In this paper, we consider a wireless powered MEC network that adopts a binary offloading policy, so that each computation task of wireless devices (WDs) is either executed locally or fully offloaded to an MEC server. Our goal is to acquire an online algorithm that optimally adapts task offloading decisions and wireless resource allocations to the time-varying wireless channel conditions. This requires quickly solving hard combinatorial optimization problems within the channel coherence time, which is hardly achievable with conventional numerical optimization methods. To tackle this problem, we propose a Deep Reinforcement learning-based Online Offloading (DROO) framework that implements a deep neural network as a scalable solution that learns the binary offloading decisions from the experience. It eliminates the need of solving combinatorial optimization problems, and thus greatly reduces the computational complexity especially in large-size networks. To further reduce the complexity, we propose an adaptive procedure that automatically adjusts the parameters of the DROO algorithm on the fly. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance while significantly decreasing the computation time by more than an order of magnitude compared with existing optimization methods. For example, the CPU execution latency of DROO is less than 0.1 second in a 30-user network, making real-time and optimal offloading truly viable even in a fast fading environment.},

This paper addresses fair scheduling in directional antenna based mmWave wireless personal and local area networks with non-uniform traffic demand. Due to their small wavelength, mmWave signals are susceptible to blockage. The proposed fair schedulers handle the link blockage problem through relaying, and are capable of providing end-to-end fair bandwidth allocation to relay flows. To achieve differentiated and fair service allocation to various regions of the network while using only limited flow related information, a service tag based scheduler is proposed in this paper. Then, the performance bounds on the minimum throughput and unfairness of this scheduler are obtained. To approximate the performance of the service tag based scheduler while minimizing the control overhead, a heuristic fair scheduler is also proposed. Results from extensive simulations conducted in a mmWave WPAN deployed to support high data rate applications show the performance advantages of the proposed schedulers, compared to existing fair schedulers, in terms of throughput and fairness.},

  abstract     = {The 802.11ac is a significant landmark in wireless communications, as it pushes towards new rate limits by utilizing downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming to transmit data to various locations simultaneously. However, successful beamforming relies on intelligent user selection which requires, in turn, extensive overhead of channel calibration between the AP and each of the candidate users. The large overhead involved in the user selection procedure overwhelms the multiuser gain and hinders the utilization of multiuser MIMO. The phenomenon is even more acute when APs handle large groups of mobile users, which frequently associate and disconnect, making the process of acquiring channel state from all users and selecting the appropriate group even harder. Thus, the subtle relation between the achievable rate of a scheduling algorithm and the overhead it requires is significant for the 802.11ac performance analysis. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of distributed algorithms that schedule a group of users for the downlink. In particular, we accommodate common scheduling methods for the 802.11ac protocol and analyze both their achievable rate and their calibration process overhead. Both analysis and extensive simulations depict the superiority of simple threshold-based methods in terms of the throughput.},

For example, a model describing the relationship between running speed, heart rate, height, and weight of runner can be constructed using MCS data collected from wristbands. Unique features of MCS data bring regression new challenges. First, observations are error-prone and private, making it of great difficulty to derive an accurate model without acquiring raw data. Second, observations are nonstationary and opportunistically, calling for an adaptive model updating mechanism. Last, mobile devices are resource-constrained, posing an urgent demand for lightweight regression. We propose an adaptive and blind regression scheme. The core idea is first to select an optimal `safe&#39; subset of observations locally stored over all participants, such that the inconsistency between the subset and the corresponding regression model is minimized, and as many observations as possible are included. Then, based on the resulted regression model, more observations are checked and selected to refine the model. With observations constantly coming, newly selected `safe&#39; observations are used to make the model updated adaptively. To preserve data privacy, one-time pad masking and blocking scheme are integrated.},

However, due to the limited size of the touch screens, smart wristbands typically have poor interactive experience. There are a few works appropriating the human body as a surface to type on. Yet, by using multiple sensors at high sampling rates, they are not portable and are energy-consuming in practice. To break this stalemate, we proposed a portable, cost efficient text-entry system, termed ViType, which first leverages a single small form factor sensor to achieve a practical user input with much lower sampling rates. To enhance the input accuracy with less vibration information introduced by lower sampling rates, ViType designs a set of novel mechanisms, including a fine-grained feature extraction to process the vibration signals, and a runtime calibration and adaptation scheme to recover from the error due to temporal instability. Extensive experiments have been conducted on 30 human subjects. The results demonstrate that ViType is robust against various confounding factors. The average recognition accuracy is 95 percent with an initial training sample size of 20 for each key. The accuracy is 1.54 times higher than the state-of-the-art on-body typing system. Furthermore, when turning on the runtime calibration and adaptation system to update and enlarge the training sample size, the accuracy can reach around 98 percent on average during one month.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) has become the de facto technique for video streaming over the Internet. Despite a flurry of techniques, achieving high quality ABR streaming over cellular networks remains a tremendous challenge. ABR streaming can be naturally modeled as a control problem. There has been some initial work on using PID, a widely used feedback control technique, for ABR streaming. Existing studies, however, either use PID control directly without fully considering the special requirements of ABR streaming, leading to suboptimal results, or conclude that PID is not a suitable approach. In this paper, we take a fresh look at PID-based control for ABR streaming. We design a framework called PIA (PID-control based ABR streaming) that strategically leverages PID control concepts and incorporates several novel strategies to account for the various requirements of ABR streaming. We evaluate PIA using simulation based on real LTE network traces, as well as using real DASH implementation. The results demonstrate that PIA outperforms state-of-the-art schemes in providing high average bitrate with significantly lower bitrate changes (reduction up to 40 percent) and stalls (reduction up to 85 percent), while incurring very small runtime overhead. We further design PIA-E (PIA Enhanced), which improves the performance of PIA in the important initial playback phase.},

Specifically, for a given content, the number of interested users in different groups is different, and users always ask the most trustworthy user in proximity for D2D transmissions. An analytical expression of the D2D success probability is first derived, which represents the probability that the received signal to interference ratio is no less than a given threshold. As the formulated problem is nonconvex, the optimal caching strategy for the special unbiased case is derived in a closed form, and a numerical searching algorithm is proposed to obtain the globally optimal solution for the general case. To reduce the computational complexity, an iterative algorithm based on the asymptotic approximation of the D2D success probability is proposed to obtain the solution that satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the analytical results and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing schemes in terms of offloading gain.},

Compared with traditional piggybacking schemes, CoS is more reliable to transmit control messages from one node to many nodes. In CoS, silent subcarriers are inserted into data packets and the intervals between adjacent silent subcarriers are utilized to encode information. Since the wasted SNR gap results in under-utilization of the channel code, the data bit errors induced by silent subcarriers are corrected by the correcting capability of the existing channel code as long as we carefully design the total number of inserted silent subcarriers. Based on CoS, we design CoS-MAC to validate the effectiveness of CoS. We measure the throughput of free control messages achieved by CoS under various channel conditions and conduct simulations to show the throughput gain achieved by CoS-MAC over the existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {In Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), fast and reliable dissemination of safety messages is a key step toward improving the overall road safety. In a highly dynamic VANET environment, safety message dissemination in a multi-hop manner is a challenging and complex problem that has gained significant attention recently. Many protocols and schemes have been proposed to efficiently share safety messages among vehicles. However, most existing techniques do not perform well under real-world traffic conditions, or perform adequately only under very limited scenarios and traffic conditions. This research proposes a highly efficient and reliable multi-hop broadcasting protocol, Intelligent Forwarding Protocol (IFP), that exploits handshake-less communication, ACK Decoupling, and an efficient collision resolution mechanism. In this research, IFP has been extensively studied and evaluated to establish its robustness and superiority over existing schemes. A key contribution of this paper is to present an in-depth analysis and optimization of IFP using theoretical modeling, thorough simulations, and extensive real-world experimentation. With IFP, the message propagation delay is significantly reduced and packet delivery ratio is drastically improved.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel framework for 5G and beyond (5G+) heterogeneous wireless networks consisting of macro aerial base stations (MABSs), small aerial base stations (SABSs), and ground base stations (GBSs) with two types of access technologies: power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). We aim to maximize the total network profit under some practical network constraints, e.g., NOMA and OFDMA limitations, transmit power (TP) maximum limits, and isolation of the virtualized wireless network. We formulate the resource allocation problem encompassing joint TP allocation, ABS altitude determination, user association, and sub-carrier allocation parameters. Our optimization problem is mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) with high computational complexity. To propose a practical approach with reduced computational complexity, we use an alternate method where the main optimization is broken down into three sub-problems with lower computational complexity. We do this by adopting successive convex approximation (SCA), geometric programming (GP), and mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) to solve each of the resulting problems, and find power allocation, altitudes of ABSs, and assignment parameters, respectively. Simulation results reveal that our proposed scenario can improve the overall network profit by up to 47 percent compared to the case where the TPs and ABS altitudes are fixed. Besides, finding the ABS altitude with fixed TPs can improve the network profit by 20 percent compared to the power allocation case with fixed ABS altitudes. Our proposed heterogeneous approach improves the network profit by up to 18, 16, 15, and 10 percent in suburban, urban, dense urban, and high-rise urban environments, respectively, compared to the cases with homogeneous ABSs.},

Our approach not only enables speed estimation in the region where WiFi links are, but also in the adjacent possibly WiFi-free regions. More specifically, we use a pair of WiFi links in one region, whose RSSI measurements are then used to estimate the crowd speed, not only in this region, but also in adjacent WiFi-free regions. We first prove how the cross-correlation and the probability of crossing the two links implicitly carry key information about the pedestrian speeds and develop a mathematical model to relate them to pedestrian speeds. We then validate our approach with 108 experiments, in both indoor and outdoor, where up to 10 people walk in two adjacent areas, with a variety of speeds per region, showing that our framework can accurately estimate these speeds with only a pair of WiFi links in one region. For instance, the NMSE over all experiments is 0.18. We also evaluate our framework in a museum-type setting and estimate the popularity of different exhibits. We finally run experiments in an aisle in Costco, estimating key attributes of buyers&#39; behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication not only provides ultra-high speed radio access but is also ideally suited for efficient and flexible wireless backhauling. Specifically for dense deployments, a mmWave macro base station (MBS) that serves a large number of mmWave micro base stations (μBSs) is much more cost effective than legacy cellular architectures which connect μBSs to the core network through fibers. In addition, μBSs can cooperate with each other by acting as relay nodes. The directional nature of mmWave communication allows for spatial reuse, even in the presence of interference, which can be exploited to optimize mmWave wireless backhaul performance. The optimization opportunistically prioritizes the use of good connections at the MBS and further leverages compact and concurrent transmissions between μBS. Relays and directional antennas speed up communication, but increase the complexity of the scheduling problem. In this work, we study the mmWave backhaul scheduling problem and derive an MILP formulation for it as well as upper and lower bounds. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and can be approximated, but only if interference is negligible. By means of numerical simulations, we compare theoretical results with heuristics in small system sizes. Results validate the analysis and demonstrate the high performance of our heuristics in realistic cellular settings.},

LoSeRO forwards messages—in a multi-casting way—to all users who have a mobility profile that intersects the packet&#39;s destination zone. LoSeRO presented a relative good performance value, however, to improve its performances, in this paper our contribution is to propose an upgraded version of our earlier proposed protocol, termed as LoSeRO v2 . In particular, it upgrades the traditional working fashion of LoSeRO by extending the knowledge of the most frequented locations to those users not only directly met, i.e., two-hops away. With this purpose, through simulations, we compare the performance of LoSeRO v2, with LoSeRO and other existing routing geo-casting protocols, and we illustrate how LoSeRO v2 achieves enhanced performances comparing precision, coverage and additional metrics.},

A decision and control problem arises, where the mode of operation (i.e., search or track) as well as the mobility control action for each agent, at each time instance, must be determined so that the collective goal of searching and tracking is achieved. We build our approach upon the theory of random finite sets (RFS) and we use Bayesian multi-object stochastic filtering to simultaneously estimate the time-varying number of targets and their states from a sequence of noisy measurements. We formulate the above problem as a non-linear binary program (NLBP) and show that it can be approximated by a genetic algorithm. Finally, to study the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach we have conducted extensive simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid spread of mobile devices, many traditional online social network services, like academic applications, start to develop mobile apps and improve their service quality through mobile sensing. A rich friendship among users can provide support for such applications, e.g., help to delegate sensing tasks in mobile crowd sensing. Therefore, studying friend recommendation that offers users&#39; suggestions on who to connect to, so as to enrich the user&#39;s friendship, is necessary to Mobile Social Networks (MSNs). Most existing strategies utilize user&#39;s relationship, or similarity, to make the recommendation, which overlooks the existence of multi-type connections among users, e.g., common paper based and common topic based connections among authors in academic networks. To overcome such limitation, we characterize each type of connections by a corresponding network layer and then propose a novel algorithm for joint recommendations in multilayer MSNs. Particularly, two types of results are presented in the paper. (i) Our proposed algorithm, named as Cross-layer 2-hop Path (C2P) algorithm, implements the joint recommendation by suggesting a user establish connections to his cross-layer two-hop neighbors, i.e., those who link to the user by two-hop paths with the two hops belonging to two different layers, respectively. In doing so, each produced recommendation item is a combination of user relationships in both two layers and therefore can better meet user demands. (ii) By analytical derivations, along with further empirical validation on real datasets, we give the performance evaluation on our proposed algorithm. First, we prove that the algorithm is efficiently implementable with a constant complexity of each recommendation in most cases. Then, we evaluate its recommendation performance by two metrics, i.e., accuracy and diversity, where the former metric measures recommendation accuracy and the latter one measures an algorithm&#39;s capability to provide diverse recommendation items. Our results show that C2P algorithm is optimal in terms of accuracy and for diversity, its performance is no less than the algorithm that is applied in single layers. And finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated on both synthetic and large-scale real datasets, where it outperforms the baseline algorithms with an up to 32 percent accuracy gain and obtains an approximately 0.5 ratio of the algorithm&#39;s diversity to the theoretical upperbound.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the practically important problem of data collection for sensor-augmented RFID systems. However, existing RFID data collection protocols suffer from two common limitations: execution time is naturally in proportion to the number of tags, thus they cannot satisfy time-stringent application scenarios; none of them is complaint with the C1G2 standard, thus they cannot be implemented using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID tags. To overcome these two limitations, this paper proposes the Geographical correlation-based RF-data Collection (GRC) protocol. GRC is fast because it is able to approximately capture the sensing data of all tags by only actually gathering data from a small set of sampled tags. This is based on the observation from the real-world data set that sensing data has a strong geographical correlation, i.e., data gathered from nearby RFID tags has similar values. In GRC, we use a greedy approach to find the minimum sampling tag set to cover the whole monitoring region such that each un-sampled tag has at least one sampled tag nearby. Then, RFID reader runs the Framed Slotted Aloha (FSA) protocol specified in C1G2 standard to collect sensing data from the sampled tags. For each un-sampled tag, we approximate its sensing data by calculating weight-average of the data collected from its nearby sampled tags, where a faraway sampled tag should be given a small weight, and vice versa. Compared with existing RFID data collection schemes, the advantages of GRC are two-fold: (1) Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the time cost of our GRC scheme is only 1/28~1/3 of the state-of-the-art data collection scheme; (2) GRC is totally complaint with C1G2 standard, thus it can be easily deployed on the COTS RFID tags.},

  abstract     = {In cognitive radio (CR), the problem of spectrum hole detection has been extensively studied in single dimension, such as frequency domain, spatial domain, and so on. Recently, a class of two dimension spectrum hole detection methods, named as joint angle-frequency estimation (JAFE), has attracted much attention. Nevertheless, most of the existing approaches are only suitable for the scenario with matching frequency-angle pairs, rather than the non-matching scenario between the two parameters, like space division multiple access (SDMA) or frequency division multiplexing access (FDMA) communication mode which allows the same frequency band (or angle) to be reused in different angles (or frequencies). For the above two cases, including matching and non-matching scenarios, this paper develops an effective frequency-angle spectrum hole detection algorithm with Taylor expansion based focusing transformation (TFT-FASHD), on the basis of signal sparse representation by extending the array manifold from angle domain to frequency-angle domain. In the proposed method, for Fourier transform representation of the sparse model, a focusing transformation based on Taylor expansion is first performed to focus the signal subspaces at different frequencies to a single frequency, so as to carry out dimension reduction of dictionary in angular domain. TFT is derived by decomposing the array manifold with Taylor expansion, and further the optimum focusing frequency of focusing transform is discussed theoretically. Second, atoms with high representative performance are chosen by the presented TFT and compressed sensing (CS). Third, according to the low dimension dictionary, the TFT-FASHD is implemented by CS under multiple measurement vector (MMV) circumstances. The accuracy of the algorithm in non-matching scenario is verified by simulation results. For the matching scenario, compared with the related JAFE methods, the proposed algorithm has a lower computational complexity, smaller detection error, and higher energy efficiency, which are validated through simulation.},

Until now, various MCS applications have been designed, where the task initiators (TIs) recruit mobile users (MUs) to complete the required sensing tasks. In this paper, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based techniques are investigated to address the problem of assigning satisfactory but profitable amount of incentives to multiple TIs and MUs as a MCS game. Specifically, we first formulate the problem as a multi-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game, where TIs are the leaders and MUs are the followers. Then, the existence of the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) is proved. Considering the challenge to compute the SE, a DRL based Dynamic Incentive Mechanism (DDIM) is proposed. It enables the TIs to learn the optimal pricing strategies directly from game experiences without knowing the private information of MUs. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism compared with both state-of-the-art and baseline approaches.},

However, existing wireless multicast mechanisms have several limitations, such as low spectral efficiency, high feedback overhead, and lack of consideration of the frame aggregation feature of current WLANs. In this paper, we propose FlexVi, a flexible wireless multicast solution for efficient video streaming over WLANs. Considering the frame aggregation of the current WLANs, FlexVi allows an access point to dynamically adjust the data rate on the basis of three factors: available wireless bandwidth, heterogeneity of the channel qualities among the clients, and the priorities among the video frames in terms of video quality. In addition, by harnessing the orthogonality of the subcarriers in the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, FlexVi enables multiple clients to deliver their feedback to an access point simultaneously without collision, which results in very low feedback overhead. We verified the feasibility of FlexVi through experiments on a software defined radio platform. We also conducted an extensive simulation study and found that FlexVi outperforms the latest wireless multicast mechanisms.},

We show how to maximize network coverage by means of an extremal-optimization algorithm. The design of our algorithm is based on a mixed-integer non-convex program formulation for a coverage problem that is NP-Complete, as we prove in the paper. We not only optimize drone positions in a 3–D space in polynomial time, but also assign flight routes solving an assignment problem and using a strong geometrical tool, namely Bézier curves , which are extremely useful for non-uniform and realistic topologies. Specifically, we propose to fly drones following Bézier curves to seek the chance of approaching to clusters of ground users. This enhances coverage over time while users and drones move.

  abstract     = {Existing physical layer security schemes are inapplicable to legacy devices operating on long coherence-time channels, since they demand changes in the physical layer. To this end, a new physical-layer security scheme is developed to secure legacy clients. In this scheme, secret keys are generated by a client and transmitted to the access point (AP). To protect these keys, a separated device called secrecy protector (SP) transmits jamming signals to prevent eavesdroppers from overhearing the keys. The SP is equipped with multiple antennas, each of which transmits an independent jamming stream with a pseudo-preamble. Since the SP can share jamming signals with the AP secretly, the AP can use a certain analog network coding scheme to remove jamming signals and decode the keys. In contrast, eavesdroppers have no knowledge of jamming signals to decode the keys. However, the long coherence-time channels are vulnerable to eavesdroppers, as they can guess the channel coefficients in a brute force way and then remove the jamming signals. Thus, frequency diversity is exploited to enhance the security of the system. Moreover, the design of jamming mechanisms resists collusion among eavesdroppers. Therefore, secret keys can be secretly shared between the AP and a client. The developed scheme is implemented on a software-defined radio platform. Performance results demonstrate that it can effectively deliver secure communications without any changes to the physical layer of legacy clients.},

We propose adaptive encoding scheme that exploits high redundancy between successive video frames to reduce transmission cost while effectively handling occlusion effects and, at the same time, maintains the simple and energy conserving encoder design. The proposed methodology adapts the compression ratio for different blocks of the non-key frame depending on temporal correlation. We also propose compressed domain motion and measurements estimation techniques to exploit the high correlation between successive frames at the decoder. The proposed motion estimation technique makes use of restricted isometry property of the sensing matrix to seek the best matching measurement vector for motion estimation as opposed to block matching in conventional video coding. In the proposed measurement estimation technique, efficient utilization of bandwidth is achieved by skipping some measurements at the transmitter side. The skipped measurements are estimated at the receiver by exploiting the correlation between CS measurements of the non-key frame and corresponding motion predicted frame using multiple regression model. Extensive simulation results on a set of diverse video sequences are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed video coding technique.},

First, we compute the threshold for the proposed target detection scheme, based on the decision fusion of different sensors and without requiring a priori probability. We also derive the bound on the threshold and subsequently the lower and upper bounds on the detection and false-alarm probabilities. Next, the location of the detected target is estimated using iterative mini-batch Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) methods in the presence of sensor location uncertainty. We highlight that the method for localization has low computational complexity which is suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The effectiveness of the compartmental model is demonstrated using both simulation study and real experiments.

Correlated channel behavior is induced by macro objects, such as buildings, as well as by micro objects, including humans around the mmWave receivers. The 3GPP&#39;s three-dimensional (3D) spatially consistent channel model designed to capture these phenomena assumes a-priori knowledge of the correlation distance between the receivers. In this paper, we propose a novel spatially-consistent human body blockage state generation procedure , which extends the standardized 3D channel model by 3GPP to capture the correlation between the line-of-sight (LoS) links and the reflected cluster states affected by human body blockage. The proposed model is based on analytical expressions for the conditional link state probability , thus permitting the parametrization of the spatial field of receivers. It also does not require any a-priori information on the correlation distance as the latter is identified explicitly based on the environmental parameters. We compare the results for the proposed model with those obtained with the uncorrelated blockage model and conclude that in many special cases correlation manifests itself in quantitatively different propagation conditions experienced at the nearby receivers.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the rapidly-growing business of ride-on-demand (RoD) services such as Uber, Lyft and Didi. Unlike taxi services, these emerging transportation services use dynamic pricing to manipulate the supply and demand, and to improve service responsiveness and quality. Despite this, on the drivers&#39; side, dynamic pricing creates a new problem: how to seek for passengers in order to earn more under the new pricing scheme. Seeking strategies have been studied extensively in traditional taxi service, but in RoD service such studies are still rare and require the consideration of more factors such as dynamic prices, the status of other transportation services, etc. In this paper, we develop ROD-Revenue, aiming to mine the relationship between driver revenue and factors relevant to seeking strategies, and to predict driver revenue given features extracted from multi-source urban data. We extract basic features from multiple datasets, including RoD service, taxi service, POI information, and the availability of public transportation services, and then construct composite features from basic features in a product-form. The desired relationship is learned from a linear regression model with basic features and high-dimensional composite features. The linear model is chosen for its interpretability-to quantitatively explain the desired relationship. Finally, we evaluate our model by predicting drivers&#39; revenue. We hope that ROD-Revenue not only serves as an initial analysis of seeking strategies in RoD service, but also helps increasing drivers&#39; revenue by offering useful guidance.},

In this paper, we propose a new access control scheme to reduce the access delay and the energy consumption by mining hidden random access resources. The proposed scheme consists of the random access procedure and the resource allocation algorithm. The proposed random access procedure utilizes the multiple access class barring (ACB) procedure to mine and utilize the hidden random access opportunities (RAOs) in order to increase the number of successfully admitted devices. The proposed algorithm optimizes the resource allocation parameters according to the estimated number of devices. We provide an analytical model for the proposed scheme by using an embedded Markov chain. The proposed scheme is shown to reduce the random access delay and the energy consumption for green communications by achieving 53 percent maximum efficiency compared to 37 percent in the conventional schemes with the ACB and random access procedure.},

However, these solutions are expensive to install and maintain. Instead, using vehicles acting as mobile caches might represent an interesting alternative. In our work, we assume that users can query nearby vehicles for some time, and be redirected to the cellular infrastructure when the deadline expires. Beyond reducing costs, in such an architecture, through vehicle mobility, a user sees a much larger variety of locally accessible content within only few minutes. Unlike most of the related works on delay tolerant access, we consider the impact on the user experience by assigning different retrieval deadlines per content. In our paper, we provide the following contributions: (i) we model analytically such a scenario; (ii) we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the traffic offloaded while ensuring user experience guarantees; (iii) we propose two variable deadline policies; (iv) we perform realistic trace-based simulations, and we show that, even with low technology penetration rate, more than 60 percent of the total traffic can be offloaded which is around 20 percent larger compared to existing allocation policies.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers mobile computation offloading where task completion times are subject to hard deadline constraints. Hard deadlines are difficult to meet in conventional computation offloading due to the stochastic nature of the wireless channels involved. Rather than using binary offload decisions, we permit concurrent remote and local job execution when it is needed to ensure task completion deadlines. The paper addresses this problem for homogeneous Markovian wireless channel models. An online energy-optimal computation offloading algorithm, OnOpt, is proposed. Its energy optimality is shown by constructing a time-dilated absorbing Markov process and applying dynamic programming. Closed form results are derived for general Markovian processes, and the Gilbert-Elliott channel model is used to show how the particular structure of the Markov chain can be exploited in computing optimal offload initiation times more efficiently. It is shown that job completion time probabilities can be computed recursively, which leads to a significant reduction in the computational complexity of OnOpt. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to three others, namely, Immediate Offloading, Channel Threshold, and Local Execution. Performance results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve mobile device energy consumption compared to the other approaches while guaranteeing hard task execution deadlines.},

In this paper, we study the MNO&#39;s optimal multi-cap data plans with time flexibility in a realistic asymmetric information scenario. Specifically, users are associated with multi-dimensional private information, and the MNO designs a contract (with different data caps and subscription fees) to induce users to truthfully reveal their private information. This problem is quite challenging due to the multi-dimensional private information. We address the challenge in two aspects. First, we find that a feasible contract (satisfying incentive compatibility and individual rationality) should allocate the data caps according to users’ willingness-to-pay (captured by the slopes of users’ indifference curves). Second, for the non-convex data cap allocation problem, we propose a Dynamic Quota Allocation Algorithm, which has a low complexity and guarantees the global optimality. Numerical results show that the time-flexible data mechanisms increase both the MNO&#39;s profit (25 percent on average) and users’ payoffs (8.2 percent on average) under price discrimination.},

However, due to the limited coverage of static edge servers, the traditional MEC technology performs badly in a nowadays environment. To adapt the diverse demands, in this paper, we propose a novel mobile edge mechanism with a vehicle-mounted edge (V-edge) deployed. Aiming at maximizing completed tasks of V-edge with sensitive deadline, the problem of joint path planning and resource allocation is formulated into a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). By utilizing the piecewise linear approximation and linear relaxation, we transform the MINLP into a mixed integer linear program (MILP). To obtain the nearoptimal solution, we further develop a gap-adjusted branch &amp; bound algorithm, also called GA-B&amp;B algorithm. Moreover, we propose a low-complexity L-step lookahead branch scheme (referred to as L-step scheme) for efficient scheduling in large-scale scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared with the traditional static edge mechanism. Furthermore, the proposed L-step scheme achieves close performance to the near-optimal solution, and significantly improves the task completion percentage of state-of-the-art schemes by over 10 percent.},

This paper focuses on a specific problem in developing countries: the stopping behaviour of buses in the vicinity of bus stops. For instance, buses could arrive at a bus stop but continue rolling forward instead of coming to a complete halt, or could stop some distance away from the bus stop, possibly even in the middle of a busy road. Such behaviors put at risk the passengers boarding or alighting the bus, and also the people waiting at a bus stop. We present FullStop, a smartphone-based system that detects safety risks emanating from stopping behavior like the ones listed above. We show that the GPS and inertial sensors are unable to perform the fine-grained detection needed. Therefore, our approach in FullStop is based on the view obtained from looking out to the front of the vehicle using the camera of a smartphone that is mounted on the front windshield. Using optical flow vectors, with several refinements, FullStop running on a smartphone is able to effectively detect various unsafe bus stopping behaviours.},

Despite the plethora of existing approaches, no method can achieve high accuracy without major, expensive changes to existing systems. For example, to achieve good accuracy, fingerprinting methods require many APs within range of a client, time-of-arrival methods require tight synchronization, client hardware changes and line-of-sight, and direction-of-arrival methods require expensive antenna front ends and line-of-sight. In this paper, we take advantage of inexpensive, off-the-shelf switched-beam antennas (SBAs) to increase the diversity of measurements used for fingerprint-based localization. We show using experiments that a single AP equipped with n SBAs may infer equally rich localization information as nAPs equipped with n omnidirectional antennas each, as long as the SBAs are properly configured. We then establish via extensive experiments that a single packet reception from a commodity client at a single AP equipped with a handful of SBAs (e.g., eight SBAs costing a couple of dollars more than omni antennas) achieves localization accuracy in the order of half a meter with or without line-of-sight, in any indoor environment, with zero airtime overhead and zero client support.},

  abstract     = {In today&#39;s growing data market, wireless service providers (WSPs) compete severely to attract users by announcing innovative data plans. Two of the most popular innovative data plans are rollover and shared data plans, where the former plan allows a user to roll his unused data quota to next month and the latter plan allows users in a family to share unused data. As a pioneer to provide such data plans, a WSP faces immediate revenue loss from existing users who pay less overage charges due to less data over-usage, but his market share increases gradually by attracting new users and those under the other WSPs. In some countries, WSPs have asymmetric timing for providing such innovative data plans, while some other markets’ WSPs have symmetric timing or no planning. This raises the question of why and when the competitive WSPs should offer the new data plans. This paper provides game theoretic modelling and analysis of the WSPs’ timing of offering innovative data plans, by considering new user arrival and dynamic user churn between WSPs. Our equilibrium analysis shows that the WSP with small market share prefers to announce the innovative data plan first to attract more users, while the WSP with large market share prefers to announce later to avoid the immediate revenue loss. In a market with many new users, WSPs with similar market shares will offer the data plans simultaneously, but these WSPs facing few new users may not offer any new plan. Perhaps surprisingly, WSPs’ profits can decrease with new user number and they may not benefit from the option of innovative data plans. Finally, unlike rollover data plan, we show that the timing of shared data plan further depends on the composition of users.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous Network (HetNet), where Small cell Base Stations (SBSs) are densely deployed to offload traffic from macro Base Stations (BSs), is identified as a key solution to meet the unprecedented mobile traffic demand. The high density of SBSs are designed for peak traffic hours and consume an unnecessarily large amount of energy during off-peak time. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement-Learning (DRL) based SBS activation strategy that activates the optimal subset of SBSs to significantly lower the energy consumption without compromising the quality of service. In particular, we formulate the SBS on/off switching problem into a Markov Decision Process that can be solved by Actor Critic (AC) reinforcement learning methods. To avoid prohibitively high computational and storage costs of conventional tabular-based approaches, we propose to use deep neural networks to approximate the policy and value functions in the AC approach. Moreover, to expedite the training process, we adopt a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) approach together with a novel action refinement scheme. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that the proposed scheme greatly outperforms the existing methods in terms of both energy efficiency and computational efficiency. We also show that the proposed scheme can scale to large system with polynomial complexities in both storage and computation.},

  abstract     = {Computation offloading over fog computing has the potential to improve reliability and reduce latency in future networks. This paper considers a scenario where roadside units (RSUs) are installed for offloading tasks to the computation nodes including nearby fog nodes and a cloud center. To guarantee the reliable communication, we formulate the first subproblem of power allocation, and leverage the conditional value-at-risk approach to analyze the successful transmission probability in the worse-case channel condition. To complete computation tasks with low latency, we formulate the second subproblem of task allocation into a multi-period generalized assignment problem (MPGAP), which aims at minimizing the total delay by offloading tasks to the `right&#39; fog nodes at `right&#39; period. Then, we propose a modified branch-and-bound algorithm to derive the optimal solution and a heuristic greedy algorithm to obtain approximate performance. In addition, the master problem is proposed as a non-convex optimization problem, which considers both the reliability-guaranteed and delay-sensitive requirements. We design the Lagreedy algorithm by combining the subgradient algorithm and the heuristic algorithm. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the Lagreedy is able to obtain the shortest delay with a high power consumption, while the branch-and-bound algorithm can achieve both shorter delay and lower power consumption with reliability guarantees.},

  abstract     = {The performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing heterogenous cellular networks are often analyzed using a single-exponent path-loss model. Thus, the effect of the expected line-of-sight (LOS) propagation in densified settings is unaccounted for, leading to inaccurate performance evaluation and/or inefficient system design. This is due to the complexity of LOS/non-LOS models in the context of MIMO communications. We address this issue by developing an analytical framework based on stochastic geometry to evaluate the coverage performance. We focus on the zero-forcing beamforming where the maximum signal-to-interference ratio is used for cell association. We analytically derive the coverage. We then investigate the cross-stream interference correlation, and develop two approximations of the coverage: Alzer Approximation (A-A) and Gamma Approximation (G-A). The former is often used in the single antenna and single-stream MIMO. We extend A-A to a MIMO multiplexing system and evaluate its utility. We show that the inverse interference is well-fitted by a Gamma random variable, where its parameters are directly related to the system parameters. The accuracy and robustness of G-A is higher than that of A-A. We observe that depending on the multiplexing gain, it is possible to attain the best coverage probability by proper densification.},

Traditional approaches to detecting and localizing drones such as radar and computer vision incur high costs and hence are not desirable for large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective crowdsensing system named CEDAR to achieve such a goal. Specifically, we introduce a novel way of detecting drones by smartphones, exploiting the fact that most drones adopt Wi-Fi for communications with ground control stations. We design an efficient detection algorithm that takes advantage of historical Wi-Fi beacon information and MAC address encoding mechanisms used by drone manufacturers. Using received signal strength, we can also localize the detected drones. Further, to encourage participants&#39; involvement, we design an incentive mechanism based on online auction that guarantees truthfulness and consumer sovereignty. CEDAR can be directly applied to multiple drone scenarios. We implement the system based on Android for the client and Spring, Spring MVC, and Mybatis (SSM) for the centralized platform that supports scalability and hierarchical structure, and enables the coordination between clients and the platform. We perform extensive experiments to validate our analysis. Particularly, the detection rate in the experiments reaches 86.7 percent even without any prior information about drones.},

Our design is tailored to a 5G mobile network context, building on its inherent programmability, management flexibility, and the availability of cloud resources at the mobile edge level, thus close to end users. We exploit Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) technologies, proposing a system which is aligned with the recent NFV and MEC standards. To deliver a Quality-of-Experience (QoE) optimized video service, we derive empirical models of video QoE as a function of service workload, which, coupled with multi-level service monitoring, drive our slice resource allocation and elastic management mechanisms. These management schemes feature autonomic compute resource scaling, and on-the-fly transcoding to adapt video bit-rate to the current network conditions. Their effectiveness is demonstrated via testbed experiments.},

Exchanging safety critical information, with low latency and high throughput, in such systems is of paramount importance. We study the broadcast capacity and minimum delay scaling laws for such highly mobile wireless networks, in which each node has to disseminate packets to all other nodes in the network. In particular, we consider a cell partitioned network under an IID mobility model, in which each node chooses a new position at random, every time slot. We derive scaling laws for broadcast capacity and minimum delay as a function of the network size. We propose a simple first-come-first-serve flooding scheme, which nearly achieve both capacity and minimum delay scaling. Thus, in contrast to what has been speculated in the literature, we show that there is nearly no tradeoff between capacity and delay. Our results also show that high mobility does not improve broadcast capacity. Our analysis makes use of the theory of Markov Evolving Graphs (MEGs), and develops two new bounds on flooding time in MEGs by relaxing the previously required expander property assumption. Simulation results verify our analysis, and throw up interesting open problems.},

For a given performance target, we derive the optimal ACB factors by considering not only the conventional preamble collision detection technique but also the early preamble collision detection technique, respectively. In addition, the proposed AC mechanism considers overall radio resources to optimize the ACB factor, which includes the number of preambles, random access response (RAR) messages, and physical-layer uplink shared channels (PUSCHs), while most conventional ACB schemes consider only the number of preambles. In particular, the proposed AC mechanism is illustrated with two representative performance metrics: latency and energy efficiency. Through extensive computer simulations, it is shown that the proposed versatile AC mechanism outperforms the conventional ACB schemes in terms of various performance metrics under diverse resource constraints.},

  abstract     = {Visible Light Communication (VLC) based on LEDs has been a hot topic investigated for over a decade. However, most of the research efforts assume the intensity of LED light is constant. This hypothesis is not true when Smart Lighting is introduced to VLC, which requires LEDs to adapt their brightness based on the intensity of natural ambient light. Smart lighting saves power consumption and improves user comfort. However, intensity adaptation severely affects the throughput performance of data communication. In this paper, we propose SmartVLC, a system that can maximize the throughput (benefit communication) while still maintaining the LEDs&#39; illumination function (benefit smart lighting). A novel Adaptive Multiple Pulse Position Modulation (AMPPM) scheme is proposed to support fine-grained dimming levels to avoid flickering while maximizing the throughput under each dimming level. SmartVLC is implemented on off-the-shelf commodity hardware. Several real-life challenges in both hardware and software are addressed to make it a robust real-time system. Comprehensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the system performance under multifaceted scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartVLC supports a communication distance up to 3.6m, and improves the throughput achieved with two state-of-the-art approaches by 40 and 12 percent on average, respectively, without bringing any flickering to users.},

  abstract     = {Recently, sponsored data started to gain wide-spread use in wireless networks. Existing approaches for regular data services when applying to video transmission in sponsored data faces tremendous challenges. In two-sided markets, internal and external competitions among service providers (SPs), content provider (CPs), and end-users (EUs) become more complex, because larger video-bandwidth significantly increases the cost. When the three parties benefit from sponsored data, pricing and transmission design become much more complicated and difficult in parameterized systems by profit decomposing models, because maximizing the total profits among the three parties is a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we address the problem of maximizing the total profits for sponsored video data. We propose a submodular-based optimization framework for wireless video transmission systems. First, we formulate the sponsored data models in wireless video transmission respective to SP, CPs and EUs sides. The proposed profit models are used in wireless broadcasting networks with a specific attention to sponsored video data. Second, we construct a layered video transmission model in two-sided market through incorporating submodularity. We approximate the NP-hard layered-video broadcasting problem by applying submodular theory. Third, we present a profit maximization framework that optimizes the number of sponsored users, pricing and bandwidth provision. The profit of SP is maximized as well as the profit of CPs is improved and the cost-effective QoE of EUs is guaranteed. To verify the efficiency, we perform the experiments for different pricing schemes. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches because the proposed method can achieve maximum profits of both SP and CPs in a wide range of transmission rates.},

After presenting our practical directional charging model, we first propose to use a piecewise constant function to approximate the nonlinear charging power, and divide the whole area into multi-feasible geometric areas in which a certain type of chargers have constant approximated charging power. Next, we propose the Practical Dominating Coverage Set extraction algorithm to reduce the unlimited solution space to a limited one by exacting a finite set of candidate strategies for all multi-feasible geometric areas. Finally, we prove the problem falls in the realm of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a partition matroid constraint, which allows a greedy algorithm to solve with approximation ratio of 1/2 - ε. We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance. Results show that our algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithms by at least 33.49 percent on average.},

  abstract     = {Managing trust in mobile networks necessitates dealing with uncertainty, resulting from incomplete, duplicate or conflicting evidence. In this work, possibility theory is used to deal with uncertainty, and a trust model is developed that includes the network nodes&#39; integrity, their competency and that of the connections among them. Evidence obtained by direct observation (`passive&#39;) is integrated with that solicited from other nodes (`active&#39;) to generate possibility distributions, or trust profiles, that can be combined, updated and discounted. Simulations of mobile ad hoc networks show that the inclusion of these trust profiles in routing decisions conserves network resources and limits data exposure by directing packets over reliable links through uncompromised nodes. Possibility theory enables the information gain provided by different forms of evidence to be evaluated, and this is used to explore the benefits of different sources of active trust evidence. It is seen that passive evidence is not sufficient to maintain trust profiles with low uncertainty, and that active trust evidence obtained by authentication requests provides higher informational value than that received using reputation solicitation.},

  abstract     = {5G mobile networks are expected to provide pervasive high speed wireless connectivity and support increasingly resource intensive user applications. Network hyper-densification therefore becomes necessary, though connecting to the Internet tens of thousands of base stations is non-trivial, especially in urban scenarios where optical fibre is difficult and costly to deploy. The millimetre wave (mm-wave) spectrum is a promising candidate for inexpensive multi-Gbps wireless backhauling, but exploiting this band for effective multi-hop data communications is challenging. In particular, resource allocation and scheduling of very narrow transmission/ reception beams require to overcome terminal deafness and link blockage problems, while managing fairness issues that arise when flows encounter dissimilar competition and traverse different numbers of links with heterogeneous quality. In this paper, we propose WiHaul, an airtime allocation and scheduling mechanism that overcomes these challenges specific to multi-hop mm-wave networks, guarantees max-min fairness among traffic flows, and ensures the overall available backhaul resources are fully utilised. We evaluate the proposed WiHaul scheme over a broad range of practical network conditions, and demonstrate up to 5× individual throughput gains and a five-fold improvement in terms of measurable fairness, over recent mm-wave scheduling solutions.},

  abstract     = {Mobility management in 5G networks is a very challenging issue. It requires novel ideas and improved management so that signaling is kept minimized and far from congesting the network. Mobile networks have become massive generators of data and in the forthcoming years this data is expected to increase drastically. The use of intelligence and analytics based on big data is a good ally for operators to enhance operational efficiency and provide individualized services. This work proposes to exploit User Equipment (UE) patterns and hidden relationships from geo-spatial time series to minimize signaling due to idle mode mobility. We propose a holistic methodology to generate optimized Tracking Area Lists (TALs) in a per UE manner, considering its learned individual behavior. The k-means algorithm is proposed to find the allocation of cells into tracking areas. This is used as a basis for the TALs optimization itself, which follows a combined multi-objective and single-objective approach depending on the UE behavior. The last stage identifies UE profiles and performs the allocation of the TAL by using a neural network. The goodness of each technique has been evaluated individually and jointly under very realistic conditions and different situations. Results demonstrate important signaling reductions and good sensitivity to changing conditions.},

  abstract     = {Tag inventory is one of the most fundamental tasks for RFID systems. However, the Framed Slotted Aloha (FSA) protocol specified in the C1G2 standard is of low time-efficiency, because it needs to collect all tags in the system. To improve time-efficiency, research communities proposed a batch of sampling-based approaches, in which the reader only needs to collect a small set of sampled tags instead of all. Although time-efficiency has been improved, existing sampling-based approaches still have two common limitations. First, all tags in the system are assumed to have the same sampling probability. It is unfair that tags attached to differential items (e.g., different values) have the same chance to be sampled and collected. Second, all existing sampling-based approaches stay in theory level and cannot be deployed on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID devices, because the C1G2 standard does not support the sampling function at all. To deal with the above two limitations, this paper studies the new problem of differential tag sampling-letting each RFID tag be identified with a given sampling probability. In this paper, we use the COTS RFID devices including Impinj Speedway R420 reader and Monza 4QT tags to implement the Differential Tag Sampling (DTS) operation. Then, we apply probabilistic analytics on the collected tag data to address some practically important problems such as Multi-category Tag Cardinality Estimation (MTCE), and Value-based Missing Tag Detection (VMTD). Although the analytics results are not 100 percent accurate, the deviation in the results can be controlled below a small threshold and DTS can significantly improve the time-efficiency. DTS can be easily deployed on the COTS RFID systems, because it is totally compliant with the C1G2 standard. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS is able to let each tag take the given sampling probability to be sampled and identified. Moreover, the proposed DTS protocol can significantly reduce the execution time of MTCE and VMTD by nearly 70 percent than the FSA protocol.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular crowd sensing systems are designed to achieve large spatio-temporal sensing coverage with low-cost in deployment and maintenance. For example, taxi platforms can be utilized for sensing city-wide air quality. However, the goals of vehicle agents are often inconsistent with the goal of the crowdsourcer. Vehicle agents like taxis prioritize searching for passenger ride requests (defined as task requests), which leads them to gather in busy regions. In contrast, sensing systems often need to sample data over the entire city with a desired distribution (e.g., Uniform distribution, Gaussian Mixture distribution, etc.) to ensure sufficient spatio-temporal information for further analysis. This inconsistency decreases the sensing coverage quality and thus impairs the quality of the collected information. A simple approach to reduce the inconsistency is to greedily incentivize the vehicle agents to different regions. However, incentivization brings challenges, including the heterogeneity of desired target distributions, limited budget to incentivize more vehicle agents, and the high computational complexity of optimizing incentivizing strategies. To this end, we present a vehicular crowd sensing system to efficiently incentivize the vehicle agents to match the sensing distribution of the sampled data to the desired target distribution with a limited budget. To make the system flexible to various desired target distributions, we formulate the incentivizing problem as a new type of non-linear multiple-choice knapsack problem, with the dissimilarity between the collected data distribution and the desired distribution as the objective function. To utilize the budget efficiently, we design a customized incentive by combining monetary incentives and potential task (ride) requests at the destination. Meanwhile, an efficient optimization algorithm, iLOCuS , is presented to plan the incentivizing policy for vehicle agents to decompose the sensing distribution into two distinct levels: time-location level and vehicle level, to approximate the optimal solution iteratively and reduce the dissimilarity objective. Our experimental results based on real-world data show that our system can reduce up to 26.99 percent of the dissimilarity between the sensed and target distributions compared to benchmark methods.},

To evaluate the real-world performance of FamilyLog, we perform extensive experiments that consist of 77 days of sensor data from 37 subjects in 8 families with children.

To that end, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive study to discover how social learning affects taxi drivers&#39; driving behaviors. To be specific, by leveraging the classic social influence theory, we develop a two-stage framework for quantitatively measuring the latent propagation of driving patterns within taxi drivers. Validations on a real-word data set collected from New York City clearly verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework with better explanation of future taxi driving pattern evolution, which prove the hypothesis that social factors indeed improve the predictability of taxi driving behaviors, and further reveal some interesting rules on social learning mechanism.},

The proposed framework takes into account the congestion effect resulting from incorporating free services in the bundles. The game models are general and capable of analyzing different setting of bundles. Extensive performance evaluations show that the inclusion of free services can improve the profit of the mobile network operators when (i) the users’ interest for the free services is above a certain value, (ii) the free services add small cost to the bundle, and (iii) the users’ demand of free services is less dependent on that of metered services in the bundle.},

Nevertheless, due to high engineering complexity and expensive infrastructure and labor cost, scalable indoor navigation is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we present SWiN, a Self-evolving WiFi-based Indoor Navigation system. SWiN provides plug-and-play and light-weight indoor navigation in a sharing manner. To alleviate the impact of the environmental change and device diversity, SWiN extracts both the static and dynamic properties of WiFi signals including scanned AP list, variations of signal strength, and AP&#39;s relative strength order. SWiN exploits the leader-follower structure, navigating following users by tracking their motion patterns to provide real-time navigation guidance. In specific, during navigation, SWiN utilizes a light-weight synchronization algorithm to synchronize multi-dimensional WiFi measurements between leader and follower traces. Furthermore, a trace updating mechanism is developed to guarantee the long-term utility of SWiN by extracting useful information in followers&#39; traces. Consolidating these techniques, we implement SWiN on commodity smartphones, and evaluate its performance in a five-story office building and a newly opened two-story shopping mall with test areas over 8000 m 2 and 6000 m 2 , respectively. Our experimental results show that 95 percent of the tracking offsets during navigation are less than 2 m and 3.2 m in these two environments.},

  abstract     = {Network densification with Small Cells (SCs) has emerged as a key technique to increase the 5G network capacity. However, in a densified network, fast mobile nodes will experience frequent handovers with a high signaling load, handover latency, and packet loss, due to the short cell radius. Indeed, Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) protocols aim to solve the shortcomings of centralized mobility management solutions such as poor scalability and non-optimal routing. However, when the cell residence time is short, DMM protocols might suffer from increased costs and limited performance. This paper proposes a localized mobility management protocol in 5G dense SCs, based on the locator identifier separation protocol, local mobility anchoring, and fast handovers concepts. The proposed scheme divides a local domain into several location service areas, each controlled by a local anchor. We provide the analytical models of several handover metrics, namely the average total signaling cost, the data delivery cost, the handover latency, and the packet loss. Numerical and simulation results show significant cost savings, up to 30 percent in signaling overhead, up to 53 percent of packet loss, and up to 90 percent of processing load reduction at the core of the network compared to the existing lisp mobile node protocol.},

In order to maximize the harvesting and transmission opportunities offered by varying traffic sources of the H2H network, we adopt a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) learning algorithm to classify traffic applications (patterns) for secondary transmitters (STs). We then analyze the performance of STs using the stochastic geometric approach, based on a criterion for optimal traffic selection. Because of the mathematical intractability of the optimal criterion, we have attained a suboptimal traffic selection criterion which provides more tractable analysis. Results are presented to validate the performance of the proposed BNP classification algorithm and the criterion, as well as the impact of traffic sources and popularity.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the growth in popularity of mobile video streaming services is unbroken. There are tremendous demands for video streaming over wireless networks. Currently, most video streaming is over HTTP. Up to now, HTTP-based adaptive video streaming is standardized as DASH, where a client-side video player can dynamically pick the bitrate level according to the perceived network conditions. Actually, not only the available bandwidth drastically varies due to wireless network properties, but also the chunk sizes in the same bitrate level significantly fluctuate, which also influences the bitrate adaptation. However, existing bitrate adaptation algorithms mostly focus on available bandwidth but do not involve chunk size variation, leading to performance losses. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the influence of chunk size variation on bitrate adaptation performance in wireless networks. Based on DASH system features, we build a general model describing playback buffer evolution. Applying stochastic theories, we respectively analyze the influence of the chunk size variation on rebuffering probability, average bitrate, and bitrate switching interval. Furthermore, based on theoretical insights, we provide several suggestions for algorithm designing and rate encoding, and also design a simple bitrate adaptation algorithm. Extensive simulations verify our insights, suggestions, and designed algorithm effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The dramatic growth of mobile application usage has posed great pressure on application developers to better manage their backend capacity. Rule-based or schedule-based auto-scaling mechanisms have been proposed, but it is difficult or expensive to frequently adjust the backend capacity to track the burstiness of mobile traffic. In this paper, we explore a fundamentally different approach. Instead of scaling the backend in line with the mobile traffic, we smooth out traffic profiles to reduce the required backend capacity and increase its utilization. Our proposed solution, called Razor, is inspired by two key insights on mobile traffic. First, mobile traffic exhibits high short-term fluctuations but steady long-term trend, so that we may temporarily delay user requests and periodically adapt backend capacity based on the predicted traffic volume. Second, user requests have different priorities: while some requests are urgent (e.g., sending a message), some are delay-tolerant (e.g., changing the profile photo) and can be postponed without much influence on the user experience. Based on these observations, our design features a two-tier architecture: on a long timescale, Razor predicts future traffic using machine learning algorithms and plans the optimal backend capacity to minimize the budget with performance guarantee; on a short timescale, Razor schedules which requests to delay and by how much time to delay according to their delay tolerance. We implement a fully-functional prototype of Razor, and evaluate its performance with both real and synthetic traces. Extensive experimental results show that Razor can effectively help mobile application developers reduce their backend cost while guaranteeing the user experience.},

First, we develop an analytical model to quantify network performances in terms of the packet queueing delay and packet error probability for sensors in a 3D UASN. The model considers the retransmission delay due to packet transmission errors and packet collisions when calculating the packet queueing delay. The packet queueing delay depends on the choice of medium access control (MAC) protocol. We consider two different MAC protocols: slotted ALOHA and Request-to-Send and Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS)-based MAC, which are the representative random access-based and handshake-based MAC protocols for UASNs, respectively. Based on the model, we further determine the smallest data sink density required to meet the desired packet error probability requirement for underwater sensor density, which can help network operators to design and build UASNs in a cost-effective way. To do this, we formulate a simple optimization problem that aims to minimize the data sink density while guaranteeing an upper bound for packet error probability. Using extensive numerical evaluations, network operation strategies are then presented to achieve the desired performance requirements in 3D UASNs.},

This type of network is approximated by a Matérn hard-core point process of type II with Nakagami fading. We derive and analyze expressions for the variance, covariance, and correlation of the interference power at an arbitrary location. Results show that even though the commonly used Poisson approximation to CSMA may have the same average interference as the Matérn model, the interference dynamics behaves significantly different.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of eavesdropping on handwriting via nearby mobile devices based on audio signal processing and machine learning. By presenting a proof-of-concept system, WritingHacker, we show the usage of mobile devices to collect the sound of victims&#39; handwriting, and to extract handwriting-specific features for machine learning based analysis. WritingHacker focuses on the situation where the victim&#39;s handwriting follows certain print style. An attacker can keep a mobile device, such as a common smartphone, touching the desk used by the victim to record the audio signals of handwriting. Then, the system can provide a word-level estimate for the content of the handwriting. To reduce the impacts of various writing habits and writing locations, the system utilizes the methods of letter clustering, dictionary filtering and letter time length based offsetting. Moreover, if the relative position between the device and the handwriting is known, a hand motion tracking method can be further applied to enhance the system&#39;s performance. Our prototype system&#39;s experimental results show that the accuracy of word recognition reaches around 70 - 80 percent under certain conditions, which reveals the danger of privacy leakage through the sound of handwriting.},

To eliminate wireless network congestion caused by large amounts of concurrent network traffic and minimize such transmission delay, traditional schemes adopt various flow control and QoS-aware traffic scheduling techniques, but fail when the amount of network traffic further increases. In this paper, we present a novel design of high-throughput wireless side channel, which operates concurrently with the existing wireless network channel over the same spectrum but dedicates to real-time traffic. Our key idea of realizing such a side channel is to exploit the excessive SNR margin in the wireless network to encode data as patterned interference. We design such patterned interference in the form of energy erasure over specific subcarriers in an OFDM-based wireless network, and achieve a data rate of 1.25 Mbps in the side channel without affecting the existing wireless network links. Experimental results over both software-defined radios and custom wireless hardware demonstrate the effectiveness of our side channel design in reducing the latency of real-time wireless traffic, while providing a sufficient data throughput for such traffic.},

In this paper, we design truthful incentive mechanisms to minimize the social cost such that each of the cooperative tasks can be completed by a group of compatible users. We study two bid models and formulate the Social Optimization Compatible User Selection (SOCUS) problem for each model. We also define three compatibility models and use real-life relationships from social networks to model the compatibility relationships. We design two incentive mechanisms, MCT - M and MCT - S, for the compatibility cases. Both of MCT - M and MCT - S consist of two steps: compatible user grouping and reverse auction. We further present a user grouping method through neural network model and clustering algorithm. Through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms achieve computational efficiency, individual rationality, and truthfulness. Moreover, MCT - M can output the optimal solution. By using neural network and clustering algorithm for user grouping, the proposed incentive mechanisms can reduce the social cost and overpayment ratio further with less grouping time.},

It can support a variety of novel applications such as augmented reality through mobile devices, navigation using smart signs, fine-grained location specific advertisement, etc. However, the achievable data rate in current LED-to-camera communication techniques remains very low to support any practical application. In this paper, we present ColorBars, an LED-to-camera communication system that utilizes Color Shift Keying (CSK) to modulate data using different colors transmitted by the LED. It exploits the increasing popularity of Tri-LEDs (RGB) that can emit a wide range of colors. We show that commodity cameras can efficiently and accurately demodulate the color symbols. ColorBars ensures flicker-free and reliable communication even in the presence of inter-frame loss and diversity of rolling shutter cameras. We implement ColorBars on embedded platform and evaluate it with Android and iOS smartphones as receivers. Our evaluation shows that ColorBars can achieve a data rate of 7.7 Kbps on Nexus 5, 3.7 Kbps on iPhone 5S, and 2.9 Kbps on Samsung Note8. It is also shown that lower CSK modulations (e.g., four and eight CSK) provide extremely low symbol error rates (&lt;; 10 -3 ), making them a desirable choice for reliable LED-to-camera communication.},

  abstract     = {Despite the growing market penetration, today&#39;s high-end virtual reality (VR) systems remain tethered, which not only limits users&#39; VR experience but also creates a safety hazard. In this paper, we perform a systematic design study of the “elephant in the room” facing the VR industry - is it feasible to enable high-quality VR apps on untethered mobile devices such as smartphones? Our quantitative, performance-driven design study makes two contributions. First, we show that the QoE achievable for high-quality VR applications on today&#39;s mobile hardware and wireless networks via local rendering or offloading is about 10X away from the acceptable QoE, yet waiting for future mobile hardware or next-generation wireless networks (e.g., 5G) is unlikely to help, because of power limitation and the higher CPU utilization needed for processing packets under higher data rate. Second, we present Furion, a VR framework that enables high-quality, immersive mobile VR on today&#39;s mobile devices and wireless networks. Furion exploits a key insight about the VR workload that foreground interactions and background environment have contrasting predictability and rendering workload, and employs a split renderer architecture running on both the phone and the server. Supplemented with video compression, use of panoramic frames, parallel decoding on multiple cores on the phone, and view-based bitrate adaptation we demonstrate Furion can support high-quality VR apps on today&#39;s smartphones over WiFi, with under 14 ms latency and 60 FPS (the phone display refresh rate).},

In VSNs, vehicles are classified based on their social degree, a vehicle considered to be a “social” one if it accesses the vehicular social network and posts messages with a frequency higher than a given threshold. Therefore, to speed up the data dissemination process within a vehicular social network, a packet should be forwarded to those vehicles showing high social activity. In a previous paper, we introduced a new probabilistic-based broadcasting scheme called SCARF (SoCial-Aware Reliable Forwarding Technique for Vehicular Communications), and we analytically demonstrated its effectiveness in packet transmission reduction while guaranteeing network dissemination. In this paper, we assess SCARF in more realistic scenarios with real traffic traces, and we compare it with other similar techniques. We show that SCARF outperforms other approaches in terms of delivery ratio, while guaranteeing acceptable time delay values and average number of forwardings.},

  abstract     = {Barrier coverage problem is one of hot research topics in directional sensor networks (DSNs). Directional sensors could zoom their sensing ranges, within which the event detection probability decreases with the increase of the distance between the location of event and the sensor. Although the probability that an event is detected by a single sensor may be below the required criteria, the detection probability achieved jointly by two sensors can be above the required criteria. In this work, we study the barrier coverage problem of DSNs, taking into account the directional nodes&#39; ability of adjusting their working directions and sensing ranges. We mainly propose a barrier construction scheme, which schedules the nodes to form multiple barriers by jointly determining which nodes jointly forming a barrier, and their respective working directions and sensing ranges. Comparing to existing works, the proposed scheme is able to form more barriers, leading to the increase of service lifetime.},

  abstract     = {RFID-based stocktaking uses RFID technology to verify the presence of objects in a region e.g., a warehouse or a library, compared with an inventory list. The existing approaches for this purpose assume that the number of missing tags is small. This is not true in some cases. For example, for a handheld RFID reader, only the objects in a larger region (e.g., the warehouse) rather than in its interrogation region can be known as the inventory list, and hence many tags in the list are regarded as missing. The missing objects significantly increase the time required for stocktaking. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called CLS (Coarse-grained inventory list based stocktaking) to solve this problem. CLS enables multiple missing objects to hash to a single time slot and thus verifies them together. CLS also improves the existing approaches by utilizing more kinds of RFID collisions and reducing approximately one-fourth of the amount of data sent by the reader. Moreover, we observe that the missing rate constantly changes during the identification because some of tags are verified present or absent, which affects time efficiency; accordingly, we propose a hybrid stocktaking algorithm called DLS (Dynamic inventory list based stocktaking) to adapt to such changes for the first time. According to the results of extensive simulations, when the inventory list is 20 times that of actually present tags, the execution time of our approach is 36.3 percent that of the best existing algorithm.},

To compensate the significantly higher path loss due to the higher frequency, the mmWave band usually uses the beamforming technology. However, this makes the network topology control a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for network topology control in mmWave networks, termed Beamforming Oriented tOpology coNtrol (BOON). The objective is to reduce total transmit power of base stations and interference between beams. BOON smartly groups nearby user equipment into clusters, constructs sets from user equipment clusters, and associates user equipment to base stations and beams. We compare BOON with three existing topology control schemes in terms of transmit power, network sum rate, signal to interference and noise ratio, and computation complexity. The results indicate that overall BOON significantly outperforms them. In particular, on average BOON uses only 10, 32, and 25 percent transmit power of other three schemes, respectively, to achieve the same network sum rate.},

OS modules known as governors implement algorithms that dynamically adjust operating frequency for their respective hardware components to balance performance and power. However, the stock governors do not consider application characteristics, manager power instead of energy, and operate independently of each other, thus leading to energy inefficiency. In this paper, we present an application-specific approach to energy optimization targeting Android mobile devices. In this two-step approach, we first perform offline profiling of the target app to obtain its performance and power measurements under different DVFS settings. The profiling data are then used by a feedback loop based online controller to dynamically select energy-optimal DVFS settings for the app while trying to meet a performance target. In contrast with the default governors, our approach is application-specific, manages energy, and controls both CPU and memory in unison. Tested on a few mainstream applications, our solution achieves considerable energy savings with minimal performance loss. This paper describes the design and evaluation of the system in detail with a particular focus on problems related to the robustness of the approach.},

  abstract     = {Widespread adoption of indoor positioning systems based on WiFi fingerprinting is at present hindered by the large efforts required for measurements collection during the offline phase. Two approaches were recently proposed to address such an issue: crowdsourcing and RSS radiomap prediction, based on either interpolation or propagation channel model fitting from a small set of measurements. RSS prediction promises better positioning accuracy when compared to crowdsourcing, but no systematic analysis of the impact of system parameters on positioning accuracy is available. This paper fills this gap by introducing ViFi, an indoor positioning system that relies on RSS prediction based on Multi-Wall Multi-Floor (MWMF) propagation model to generate a discrete RSS radiomap ( virtual fingerprints). Extensive experimental results, obtained in multiple independent testbeds, show that ViFi outperforms virtual fingerprinting systems adopting simpler propagation models in terms of accuracy, and allows a seven-fold reduction in the number of measurements to be collected, while achieving the same accuracy of a traditional fingerprinting system deployed in the same environment. Finally, a set of guidelines for the implementation of ViFi in a generic environment, that saves the effort of collecting additional measurements for system testing and fine tuning, is proposed.},

Existing approaches either depend on the coordination from central controllers, or involve interactive signaling between the nodes. This can potentially compromise privacy. This paper proposes a fully uncoordinated approach to change pseudonyms in distributed networks, where each node uses a pseudonym until its expiration and then changes after a random delay. We develop a new model to analyse the time-varying population of changing pseudonyms. Critical conditions are analytically established, under which individual nodes can independently change their pseudonyms while their identity privacy is preserved. The conditions are validated by illustrative examples. Corroborated by simulations, the accuracy of the analytical model improves, as the number of nodes increases. The analysis confirms that, the k-anonymity can be achieved at a negligible throughput loss in the case of large networks.},

  abstract     = {TrustZone is a hardware security technique in ARM mobile devices. Using TrustZone, software components running within the secure world can be completely isolated from the normal world, which ensures hardware-enforced security access control over the underlying computing resources. In order to support multiple trusted applications, TrustZone runs its own operating system, called the secure OS, within the secure world. Unfortunately, attackers have been exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities in a secure OS, as reported in most of major secure OSes from product vendors including Samsung, Huawei, and Qualcomm. More critically, as all trusted applications are running on the same secure OS instance, compromising the secure OS leads to compromising all trusted applications, rendering the secure OS as a single point of failure endangering the entire TrustZone&#39;s security. This paper presents PrOS, our mechanism to privatize secure OSes through direct virtualization of TrustZone. PrOS allows each trusted application to run with its own secure OS such that the secure OS is no longer a single point of security failure. One particular challenge for PrOS lies in how efficiently to implement software-only virtualization for TrustZone for a practical deployment in real systems despite the condition that the current ARM architectures do not support hardware-assisted virtualization for TrustZone. As opposed to the common belief that software-only virtualization is inefficient and sluggish, we have found several common design features inherent in the secure OS to leverage for optimally tailoring the TrustZone virtualization scheme. We implemented PrOS on a 64-bit ARM development board. According to our evaluation, PrOS incurs 0.02 and 1.18 percent performance overheads on average in the normal and secure worlds, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in the field.},

We study the novel POI-based collaboration between apps and venues (e.g., restaurants). On the one hand, an app charges a venue and tags the venue as a POI. The POI tag motivates users to visit the venue, which potentially increases the venue&#39;s sales. On the other hand, the venue can invest in the app-related infrastructure, which enables more users to use the app and further benefits the app&#39;s business. The apps’ existing POI tariffs cannot fully incentivize the venue&#39;s infrastructure investment, and hence cannot lead to the most effective app-venue collaboration. We design an optimal two-part tariff, which charges the venue for becoming a POI, and subsidizes the venue every time a user interacts with the POI. The subsidy design efficiently incentivizes the venue&#39;s infrastructure investment, and we prove that our tariff achieves the highest app&#39;s revenue among a general class of tariffs. Furthermore, we derive some counter-intuitive guidelines for the POI-based collaboration. For example, a bandwidth-consuming app should collaborate with a low-quality venue (users have low utilities when consuming the venue&#39;s products).},

In addition to differentiating non-congestive loss from congestive loss, our experiments revealed two significant performance bottlenecks during the loss recovery phase: flow control bottleneck and application stall, resulting in degradation in QoS performance. To tackle these two problems, we first develop a novel opportunistic retransmission algorithm to eliminate the flow control bottleneck, which enables TCP sender to transmit new packets even if receiver&#39;s receiving window is exhausted. Second, application stall can be significantly alleviated by carefully monitoring and tuning the TCP sending buffer growth mechanism. We implemented and modularized the proposed algorithms in the Linux kernel thus they can plug-and-play with the existing TCP loss recovery algorithms easily. We evaluated our proposed algorithms over emulated and real experiments and showed that, compared to existing TCP loss recovery algorithms, the proposed optimization algorithms improve the bandwidth efficiency by up to 133 percent and completely mitigate RTT spikes, i.e., over 50 percent RTT reduction, over the loss recovery phase.},

  abstract     = {A careful planning of sleeping activities is essential for guaranteeing long operational time to energy constrained IoT devices, given the extremely low energy consumption required during the sleeping mode. Neighbor discovery instead requires nodes to continuously listen to the radio channel to detect potential and unpredictable messages coming from the arrival of new nodes. These two contrasting needs raise a fundamental question: Should a node be active and listen to the channel or sleep and save energy? Hardware manufacturers introduced dedicated low-power circuitry to allow an energy efficient fast duty cycle (Wake-on Radio) or designed to wake up the main processor when special packets are received (Wake-up Radio). In this work, we propose a novel analytic model optimizing the number of discovered peers for a given energy budget. Our theoretical study demonstrates the existence of an optimum duty cycle in a wide range of operating environments. We designed an adaptive algorithm that dynamically tracks the optimum even in non-stationary conditions, only using local device estimations, therefore allowing nodes to optimize their own duty cycle. Nodes globally converge to a system-wide optimum of a minimal network discovery energy cost.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we address the problem of Named Data Networking (NDN)-based fake content dissemination in Opportunistic Mobile Networks (OMNs), where nodes have intermittent connectivity and typically lack in end-to-end communication paths. It is important to mitigate the dissemination of such fake contents not only because they waste bandwidth for legitimate communication, but also because such files can be harmful for devices. However, the inherent characteristics of OMNs make such mitigation a challenging task. In this context, we consider a group of nodes, Fake Content Providers (FCPs), who, on receiving content requests, respond with fake contents, rather than the real version. In particular, we consider four different behaviors of the FCPs-referred to as threat scenarios-depending on whether or not they always respond to all requests with fake contents. We analyze these distinct threat scenarios, and characterize the relative performance degradation arising because of them. To mitigate the adverse effects of FCPs, we propose two schemes, wherein the identified FCPs are blacklisted permanently or temporarily, and communication with them is restricted. Results of simulation-based experiments using real-life connection traces show that, compared to the normal scenario with no FCP, the percentage of content requests satisfied decreases by 20-40 percent in the presence of 40 percent FCPs in the OMN. Moreover, in the same scenario, the average latency of content satisfaction relatively increases by up to 176 percent with respect to the normal scenario. However, on using the proposed mitigation schemes, the latency can be reduced by about 13-36 percent together with up to 9 percent improvement in the number of interests satisfied.},

  abstract     = {The concept of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has been recently introduced to supplement cloud computing by deploying MEC servers to the network edge so as to reduce the network delay and alleviate the load on cloud data centers. However, compared to the resourceful cloud, MEC server has limited resources. When each MEC server operates independently, it cannot handle all computational and big data demands stemming from users devices. Consequently, the MEC server cannot provide significant gains in overhead reduction of data exchange between users devices and remote cloud. Therefore, joint Computing, Caching, Communication, and Control (4C) at the edge with MEC server collaboration is needed. To address these challenges, in this paper, the problem of joint 4C in big data MEC is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to jointly optimize a linear combination of the bandwidth consumption and network latency. However, the formulated problem is shown to be non-convex. As a result, a proximal upper bound problem of the original formulated problem is proposed. To solve the proximal upper bound problem, the block successive upper bound minimization method is applied. Simulation results show that the proposed approach satisfies computation deadlines and minimizes bandwidth consumption and network latency.},

Our investigations revealed that while existing algorithms can perform well in their intended operating environments, their performance can degrade substantially in other environments. This work tackles this challenge by developing a novel Ensemble Adaptive Streaming (EAS) paradigm to mobile video streaming. As opposed to designing a single streaming algorithm for all network conditions, we argue that different network conditions require different algorithms . We introduce the notion of network differentiators to segregate network conditions into different classes where each class has its own adaptation algorithm designed and optimized specifically for it. An EAS mobile streaming client then selects at runtime the matching adaptation algorithm using the same network differentiators on a per session basis for streaming. We show how EAS can be applied to existing machine-learning approaches to improve their performances. Moreover, to fully exploit EAS&#39;s potential we developed the first Genetic Programming approach to evolve adaptive streaming algorithms. The resultant EAS-GP algorithms not only outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms substantially, but also exhibited remarkable robustness over time, location, mobile operators, as well as quality-of-experience metrics.},

In order to reduce the sweep cycle and the number of mobile sensors, we propose the Distance-Sensitive-Route-Scheduling (DSRS) problem, which is to consider the effect of sensing range. We prove that DSRS is NP-hard, and consider three different scenarios: the single sensing-point case, the general case, and the extended case. In the single sensing-point case, we propose an approximation algorithm ROSE to schedule the routes of the mobile sensors efficiently. For the general case and the extended case, we present two other approximation algorithms G-ROSE and E-ROSE based on ROSE. We further characterize the non-locality property and design a distributed algorithm D-ROSE, coordinating sensors to meet the sweep requirements with best effort. Our algorithms are scalable to different sweep coverage problems, and according to the simulation results, they greatly outperform other existing algorithms up to 45 percent especially with a large sensing range.},

It can reduce the cost on sensor deployment and improve data quality with human intelligence. To enhance data trustworthiness, it is critical for the service provider to recruit mobile users based on their personal features, e.g., mobility pattern and reputation, but it leads to the privacy leakage of mobile users. Therefore, how to resolve the contradiction between user privacy and task allocation is challenging in mobile crowdsensing. In this paper, we propose SPOON, a strong privacy-preserving mobile crowdsensing scheme supporting accurate task allocation based on geographic information and credit points of mobile users. In SPOON, the service provider enables to recruit mobile users based on their locations, and select proper sensing reports according to their trust levels without invading user privacy. By utilizing proxy re-encryption and BBS+ signature, sensing tasks are protected and reports are anonymized to prevent privacy leakage. In addition, a privacy-preserving credit management mechanism is introduced to achieve decentralized trust management and secure credit proof for mobile users. Finally, we show the security properties of SPOON and demonstrate its efficiency in terms of computation and communication.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Network Operators perceive Spectrum Slicing and Sharing as an efficient and viable option to meet the growing mobile user data demands in the upcoming 5G network deployments. Efficient spectrum sharing requires optimized spectrum partitioning, i.e., slicing of the spectrum for sharing among operators, to improve spectrum utilization, offer services with high quality of experience, and increase their revenues. This paper proposes Spectrum Slicing Coalition Formation (SSCF) protocol, a novel solution to address effective spectrum slicing required to meet the dynamic data demands at every 5G base station. The base stations&#39; cooperation is formulated as a coalition formation game with overlapping coalitions, where a base station&#39;s contribution is not restricted to a single coalition, instead a base station participates intelligently in multiple coalitions. The SSCF protocol enables a base station to dynamically slice and share its allocated spectrum to service its load based spectral requirements, a key requirement for effective radio access network softwarization. The study explores operator base stations&#39; options to determine with whom, when, and how much to slice and share the spectrum and the payoffs. Extensive simulations using real-world operator base station deployments highlight that SSCF solution brings in operational efficiencies, improved users&#39; quality of experience, and revenue maximization.},

The rollover data plan, which allows the unused data of the previous month to be used in the current month, provides the subscribers with the time flexibility. In this paper, we formulate two MNOs’ market competition as a three-stage game, where the MNOs decide their data mechanisms (traditional or rollover) in Stage I and the pricing strategies in Stage II, and then users make their subscription decisions in Stage III. Different from the monopoly market where an MNO always prefers the rollover mechanism over the traditional plan in terms of profit, MNOs may adopt different data mechanisms at an equilibrium. Specifically, the high-QoS MNO would gradually abandon the rollover mechanism as its QoS advantage diminishes. Meanwhile, the low-QoS MNO would progressively upgrade to the rollover mechanism. The numerical results show that the market competition significantly limits MNOs’ profits, but both MNOs obtain higher profits with the possible choice of the rollover data plan.},

In this paper, we investigate the fundamental problems of a cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system (CVIS): how does vehicular communication and networking affect the benefit gained from cooperative computation in the CVIS and what should a reliability-optimal cooperation be? We develop an analytical framework of reliability-oriented cooperative computation optimization, considering the dynamics of vehicular communication and computation. To be specific, we propose stochastic modeling of V2V and V2I communications, incorporating effects of the vehicle mobility, channel contentions, and fading, and theoretically derive the probability of successful data transmission. We also formulate and solve an execution time minimization model to obtain the success probability of application completion with the constrained computation capacity and application requirements. By combining these models, we develop constrained optimizations to maximize the coupled reliability of communication and computation by optimizing the data partitions among different cooperators. Numerical results confirm that vehicular applications with a short deadline and large processing data size can better benefit from the cooperative computation rather than non-cooperative solutions.},

  abstract     = {Logistics monitoring is a fundamental application that utilizes RFID systems to manage numerous tagged-objects. Due to the frequent rearrangement of tagged-objects, a fast RFID-based tracking approach is highly desired for accurate logistics distribution. However, traditional RFID systems usually take tens of seconds to interrogate hundreds of RFID tags, not to mention the time delay involved to locate all the tags, which severely prevents from in-time tracking. To address this issue, we reduce the problem domain by first distinguishing the motion status of the tagged-objects, i.e., “stationary” or “moving”, and then tracking the moving objects with the state-of-the-art localization schemes, which significantly reduces the efforts of tracking all the objects. Toward this end, we propose a moving tag detection mechanism, which achieves the time efficiency by exploiting the useless collision signal in RFID systems. In particular, we extract two kinds of physical-layer features (namely, phase profile and backscatter link frequency) from the collision signal received by the USRP to distinguish tags at different positions. We further develop the Graph Matching (GM) method and Coherent Phase Variance (CPV) method to detect the moving tagged-objects. Experiment results show that our approach can accurately detect the moving objects while reducing 80 percent inventory time compared with the state-of-art solutions.},

Different from ad libraries, the main function of analytics libraries is to collect users’ in-app actions. Hence, by design analytics libraries are more likely to leak users’ private information. In this work, we study what information is collected by the analytics libraries integrated in popular Android apps. We design and implement a framework called “Alde”. Given an app, Alde employs both static analysis and dynamic analysis to detect the users’ in-app actions collected by analytics libraries. We also study what private information can be leaked by the apps that use the same analytics library. Moreover, we analyze apps’ privacy policies to see whether app developers have notified the users that their in-app action data is collected by analytics libraries. Finally, we select eight widely used analytics libraries to study and apply our method to 300 popular apps downloaded from both Chinese app markets and Google play. Our experimental results show that some apps indeed leak users’ personal information through analytics libraries even though their genuine purposes of using analytics services are legal. To mitigate such threats, we have developed an app named “ALManager” that leverages the Xposed framework to manage analytics libraries in other apps.},

  abstract     = {Current interference management solutions for dense IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) rely on locally measuring the cumulative interference at the Acess Point (AP) in charge of adjusting the spectrum resources to its clients. These solutions often result in coarse-grained spectrum allocation that often leaves many wireless users unsatisfied and increases the spectrum congestion problem instead of easing it. In this paper, we present a centralized interference management algorithm that treats the network-wide interference impact of each channel individually and allows the controller to adjust the radio resource of each AP while it is utilised. This coordinated allocation takes into account the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of downlink flows while minimizing its effect on neighbouring APs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach for quantifying the interference impact of each employed channel and jointly addressing the user-side quality requirements and the network-side interference management. The algorithm is tailored for operator-agnostic Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based Radio Resource Management (RRM) in dense Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks and adopts a fine-grained per-flow approach. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms existing solutions in terms of reducing the overall interference, increasing the capacity of the wireless channel, and improving the users’ satisfaction.},

Our novel architecture addresses the complexities and heterogeneities of verticals targeted by 5G systems, whereby each slice consists of a set of SFCs, and each SFC handles specific traffic within the slice. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a MILP optimization model to solve the complexities that arise from this new environment.

We also design a greedy-based heuristic to investigate the possible trade-offs between execution runtime and network slice deployment.

  abstract     = {Next-generation wireless networks promise to provide extremely high data rates, especially exploiting the so-called millimeter-wave frequency range. Gaining information from spectrum usage is becoming important to provide smart adaptation capabilities to future network protocol stacks. Issues such as deafness, misaligned antennas, or blockage may severely impact network performance, and their identification is crucial. Despite the complexity of full analytical models, machine learning techniques are progressively being considered to improve spectrum usage at higher layers. In this paper, we design a signal processing technique that uses narrowband physical layer energy traces, obtained from one or multiple channel sniffers. The proposed technique utilizes a combination of template matching and an Explicit Duration Hidden Markov Model (EDHMM) to correctly classify frames, while coping with the non-stationarity of the traces. This leads to a protocol level monitor that does not need to decode the channel at the physical layer, but just infers the type of packets that are exchanged based on sub-sampled energy traces. The performance of this framework is evaluated using off-the-shelf mm-wave wireless devices, quantifying its detection performance in the presence of one or multiple sniffers, and assessing the impact of physical layer parameters such as noise power and signal levels.},

  abstract     = {Beaconing is a fundamental networking service where each node broadcasts a packet to all its neighbors locally. Unfortunately, the problem Minimum Latency Beaconing Schedule (MLBS) in duty-cycled scenarios is not well studied. Existing works always have rigid assumption that each node is only active once per working cycle. Aiming at making the work more practical and general, MLBS problem in duty-cycled network where each node is allowed to active multiple times in each working cycle (MLBSDCA for short) is investigated in this paper. First, a novel kind of coloring problem, named as label coloring problem, is identified and analyzed. Second, an edge-based scheduling framework is designed and the MLBSDCA under protocol interference model is transformed to such coloring problem. Based on label coloring, a group first-fit scheduling algorithm is designed for MLBSDCA under protocol interference model. After that, a (ρ + 1) 2 |W|-approximation algorithm is proposed to further reduce the beaconing latency, where p denotes the interference radius, and |W| is the maximum number of active time slots per working cycle. When p and |W| is equal to 1, the approximation ratio is only 4, which is better than the one (i.e., 10) in existing works. Furthermore, two approximation algorithms for MLBSDCA under physical interference model are also investigated. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in term of latency.},

Motivated by this fact, this work presents an indoor localization system that leverages both imagery and WLAN data for enabling and supporting a wide variety of envisaged location-aware applications ranging from ambient and assisted living to indoor mobile gaming and retail analytics. The proposed solution integrates two complementary localization approaches, i.e., one based on WLAN and another one based on image location-dependent data, using a fusion engine. Two fusion strategies are developed and investigated to meet different requirements in terms of accuracy, run time, and power consumption. The one is a light-weight threshold-based approach that combines the location outputs of two localization algorithms, namely a WLAN-based algorithm that processes signal strength readings from the surrounding wireless infrastructure using an extended Naive Bayes approach and an image-based algorithm that follows a novel approach based on hierarchical vocabulary tree of SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) descriptors. The second fusion strategy employs a particle filter algorithm that operates directly on the WLAN and image readings and also includes prior position estimation information in the localization process. Extensive experimental results using real-life data from an indoor office environment indicate that the proposed fusion strategies perform well and are competitive against standalone WLAN and imaged-based algorithms, as well as alternative fusion localization solutions.},

However, adopting trajectory semantics for living pattern recognition is an open and challenging research problem due to three major technical challenges: effective feature representation, suitable granularity selection for habit unit, and reliable habit distance measurement. In this paper, we propose a representation learning based system named habit2vec to represent user trajectory semantics in vector space, which preserves the original user living habit information. We evaluated our proposed system on a large-scale real-world dataset provided by a popular social network operator including 123,803 users for 1.5 months in Beijing. The results justify the representation ability of our system in preserving user habit pattern, and demonstrate the effectiveness of clustering users with similar living patterns.},

We first derive a steady-state model to calculate the spectrum share occupied by LTE under the assumption that the Wi-Fi transmissions have stationary distributions. The assumption does not hold when the time between two LTE transmissions is short, where the system is dominated by a dynamic phenomenon. A second model is developed that accounts for the dynamics of the Wi-Fi channel access mechanism. Our models, validated by simulation results, accurately calculate the spectrum share occupied by LTE over a range of FB-LBT frame periods and Wi-Fi traffic loads. We obtain upper bounds on the FB-LBT spectrum share when competing with heavy Wi-Fi traffic, which confirm the weakness of FB-LBT. Moreover, we demonstrate that our models can be used to control the FB-LBT spectrum share within a modest range.},

Network function virtualization (NFV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) are emerging as core technologies to satisfy users&#39; real-time service demands. Adapting NFV technology to MECs allows the ability to assign cloud-computing capabilities near the base stations (BSs) of radio access networks (RANs), resulting in extremely fast service access to user equipment (UE). However, placement of virtualized network functions (VNF) within the edge network need to consider the location and the requirements of the user which change in real-time. There has been almost no consideration in the existing research on VNF resource allocation (VNF-RA) based on these aspects. Therefore, in this paper, a VNF resource allocation scheme based on context-aware grouping (VNF-RACAG) technology is proposed that enables groups (based on the geographic context of users, such as location and velocity) to compute the optimal number of clusters to minimize the end-to-end delay of network services. Then, a graph partitioning algorithm is used to minimize user movement between clusters, optimizing the data rate that users lose due to VNF migration.},

Our PrAP is built of two dedicated wireless routers interconnected physically, and can relay traffic rapidly between a station and a legitimate AP. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the state-of-the-art time-based rogue AP (rAP) detectors cannot detect our PrAP, although perhaps effective against software-based rAP. In demonstrating that, we unveil new insight into fundamentals of time-based detectors for software-based rAPs and their operation: such techniques are only capable of detecting rAPs due to the speed of wireless AP bridging. To address the threat of such PrAPs, we propose a new tool for network administrators, a PrAP-Hunter based on intentional channel interference. Our PrAP-Hunter is highly accurate, even under heavy traffic scenarios. Using a high-performance (desktop) and low-performance (mobile phone) experimental setups of our PrAP-Hunter in various deployment scenarios, we demonstrate close to 100 percent of detection rate, compared to 60 percent detection rate by the state-of-the-art. We show that our PrAP-Hunter is fast (takes 5-10 seconds), does not require any prior knowledge, and can be deployed in the wild by real-world experiments at 10 coffee shops.},

This work addresses the related issue of data allocation, by proposing a novel infrastructure independent method based on the hotspot function of smartphones. In the proposed scheme, smartphones transfer data allowances among mobile users, so that users with excess data allowances act as accessible Wi-Fi hotspots, selling their data allowance to other users who need extra data allowances. To achieve this objective, we propose to use auctions with single and multiple data sellers. Efficient schemes based on auction models are discussed to sell the data allowances over successive days in a month, and over different time slots during a single day. Overall system performance is considered based on the behavior of mobile users, such as changing demands for the sale or purchase of data allowances.

  abstract     = {Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) have been being utilized for various applications, such as surveillance, search/rescue, and monitoring. The information they transmit is critical for decision-making. However, UVs are vulnerable to white-box attacks due to improvements in reverse engineering techniques and the openness of their software. Therefore, attackers with sufficient knowledge of a target UV can steal secret information stored in the UV by exploiting its vulnerabilities. Recently, several white-box cryptography techniques have been introduced to protect secret keys from being extracted by converting them into large look-up tables. However, none of them provide approaches to securely update the look-up tables. Thus, once a remote attacker succeeds in extracting the static look-up table from a UV, he/she can use it to decrypt past/future communications or to send false information to the control station by impersonating the UV. In this paper, we propose a look-up table shuffling mechanism that supports white-box cryptography with dynamics. The mechanism makes it hard for attackers to determine the positions of the table entries, and thus to decrypt/encrypt ciphertexts/plaintexts. To show the practicality of the block cipher with our mechanism, we implemented it on a board equipped with a GPU and show its GPU-accelerated performance.},

Malfunction discovery and repair mechanisms are applied to ensure that the network operates appropriately when an AUV fails to communicate with the nodes while collecting data.

  abstract     = {The exploding volumes of mobile video traffic call for deploying content caches inside mobile operator networks. With in-network caching, users&#39; requests for popular content can be served from a content cache deployed at mobile gateways in vicinity to the end user. This inherently reduces the load on the content servers and the backbone of operator&#39;s network. In light of the increasing trend in virtualization of network functions, we propose a cost-effective caching as a service (CaaS) framework for virtual video caching in 5G mobile networks. In order to evaluate the pros and cons of our CaaS approach, we formulate two virtual caching problems, namely maximum return on investment(MRI) and maximum offloaded traffic (MOT). MRI aims at maximizing return on caching investment by finding the best trade-off between the cost of cache storage and bandwidth savings from caching video contents in the mobile network operator (MNO)&#39;s cloud. Likewise, MOT aims to maximize the traffic offloaded from the MNO&#39;s core and backhaul within given budget constraints. More specifically, taking the popularity and size of video contents into account, MRI and MOT aim to find the optimal caching tables which maximize the ratio of transmission bandwidth cost to storage cost and the offloaded traffic for a given budget, respectively. We reduce the complexity of the proposed problem formulated as a binary-integer programming (BIP) by using canonical duality theory (CDT). Experimental results obtained using the invasive weed optimization (IWO) have shown significant performance enhancement of the proposed system in terms of return on investment, quality, offloaded traffic, and storage efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In camera sensor networks (CSNs), full view coverage, meaning that any direction of any point in the operational region is covered by at least one camera sensor, plays a significant role in object identification. While prior work is dedicated to static CSNs for the sake of critical condition to achieve full view coverage, such performance still remains unknown in mobile CSNs. In this paper, we take the initiative to address this issue, where a centralized parameter, i.e., equivalent sensing radius (ESR), is defined to unravel the critical requirement for asymptotic full view coverage in mobile heterogeneous CSNs in the sense that camera sensors of different sensing capabilities are moving around in target area. Specifically, we derive ESR under three different mobilities, i.e., 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional random walks and random rotating model, and then explore respectively the corresponding critical conditions to achieve almost surely coverage.1 The static network is introduced as a baseline in order to gain a clear understanding of how mobility affects coverage performance differently. Interestingly, we find that both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional random walks exhibit a smaller ESR than static one whereas ESR is even larger in random rotating mobility than that in static CSNs. Moreover, the almost surely coverage is found to be around 1.225 times of the critical condition to achieve coverage with high probability,2 and therefore turns out to be a stronger result compared to the traditional coverage with high probability. We then turn to the impact of various mobility patterns on sensing energy consumption, a metric that is closely related to ESR, and show that it can be decreased by random walks under certain delay tolerance. The relationship between ESR and percentage of full view coverage is also discussed and the results unify those under homogeneous CSNs.},

  abstract     = {Breath monitoring helps assess the general personal health and gives clues to chronic diseases. Yet, current breath monitoring technologies are inconvenient and intrusive. For instance, typical breath monitoring devices need to attach nasal probes or chest bands to users. Wireless sensing technologies have been applied to monitor breathing using radio waves without physical contact. Those wireless sensing technologies however require customized radios which are not readily available. More importantly, due to interference, such technologies do not work well with multiple users. When multiple users are present, the detection accuracy of existing systems decreases dramatically. In this paper, we propose to monitor users&#39; breathing using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID systems. In our system, passive lightweight RFID tags are attached to users&#39; clothes and backscatter radio waves, and commodity RFID readers report low level data (e.g., phase values). We reliably detect the effective human respiration corresponded signal and track periodic body movement due to inhaling and exhaling by analyzing the low level data reported by commodity readers. To enhance the measurement robustness, we synthesize data streams from an array of multiple tags to improve the monitoring accuracy. Our design follows the standard EPC protocol which arbitrates collisions in the presence of multiple tags. We implement a prototype for the breath monitoring system with commodity RFID systems. The experiment results show that the prototype system can simultaneously monitor breathing with high accuracy even with the presence of multiple users.},

The drones can land at pre-planned locations defined by the mobile operator and at the macrocell BS site where they can charge their batteries. The objective of the framework is to jointly determine the optimal trips of the drones and the MBSs that can be safely turned off in order to minimize the total energy consumption of the network. This is done while considering the cells&#39; capacities and the minimum receiving power guaranteeing successful communications. To do so, an integer linear programming problem is formulated and optimally solved for three cases based on the knowledge level about future renewable energy statistics of the drones. A low complex relaxed solution is also developed. Its performances are shown to be close to those of the optimal solutions. However, the gap increases as the network becomes more congested. Numerical results investigate the performance of the proposed drone-based approach and show notable improvements in terms of energy saving and network capacity.},

The results show the variation in the performance indicators with respect to different system parameters, such as beacon period, data transmission rate, traffic loads, channel Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Allocation Intervals (AIs), and Payload Sizes (PSs). Our results indicate the tradeoff between average frame delay and EE with respect to selection of AIs and PSs. Thus, through this analysis we show how a network designer can prepare a look-up table for sensor nodes enabling them to select the optimum and minimum AIs and their associated PSs based on the channel SNR to achieve the maximum EE for a particular average frame delay and reliability constraint.},

Nevertheless, the resource at edge devices is still limited and should be allocated economically efficiently. In this paper, we propose Edge Combinatorial Clock Auction (ECCA) and Combinatorial Clock Auction in Stream (CCAS), two auction frameworks to improve the QoE of live video streaming services in the Edge-enabled cellular system. The edge system is the auctioneer who decides the backhaul capacity and caching space allocation and streamers are the bidders who request for the backhaul capacity and caching space to improve the video quality their audiences can watch. There are two key subproblems: the caching space value evaluations and allocations. We show that both problems can be solved by the proposed dynamic programming algorithms. The truth-telling property is guaranteed in both ECCA and CCAS. The simulation results show that the overall system utility can be significantly improved through the proposed system.},

The basic idea of DeWiCam is to utilize the intrinsic traffic patterns of flows from wireless cameras. Compared with traditional traffic pattern analysis, DeWiCam is more challenging because it cannot access the encrypted information in the data packets. Yet, DeWiCam overcomes the difficulty and can detect nearby wireless cameras reliably. To further identify whether a camera is in an interested room, we propose a human-assisted identification model. Extension functions of DeWiCam further enable the video resolution and audio channel inference to provide extra protection. We implemented DeWiCam on the Android platform and evaluated it with extensive experiments on 20 cameras. The evaluation results show that DeWiCam can detect cameras with an accuracy of 99 percent within 2:7 s.},

Fundamental challenges for RSS DFL methods include having a model of RSS measurements as a function of a person&#39;s location, and maintaining an accurate model as the environment changes overtime. Current methods rely on either labeled empty-area calibration or labeled fingerprints with a person at each location. Both need to be frequently recalibrated or retrained to stay current with changing environments. Other DFL methods only localize people in motion. In this paper, we address these challenges by, first, introducing a new mixture model for link RSS as a function of a person&#39;s location, and second, providing the framework to update model parameters without ever being provided labeled data from either empty-area or known-location classes. We develop two new Bayesian localization methods based on our mixture model and experimentally validate our system at three test sites with seven days of measurements. We demonstrate that our methods localize a person with non-degrading performance in changing environments, and, in addition, reduce localization error by 11 - 51 percent compared to other DFL methods.},

Among all safety services provided for vehicles, tracking the rotation angle of steering wheel in real time can monitor the vehicles&#39; dynamics and drivers&#39; behaviors at the same time. In this paper, we propose a steering tracking system, SteerTrack, which tracks the rotation angle of the steering wheel in real time leveraging audio devices on smartphones. SteerTrack seeks a device-free approach for steering tracking without requiring installation of specialized sensors on the steering wheels nor asking drivers to wear sensors on their wrists. Since the steering wheel is operated by a driver&#39;s hands, the rotation angle of the steering wheel can be tracked based on movements of the driver&#39;s hands. SteerTrack first builds an acoustic signal field inside of a vehicle and then analyzes the echoes reflected from the driver&#39;s hands with relative correlation coefficient (RCC) and reference frame to track the movement trajectory of hands under different steering maneuvers. Given the tracked movement trajectory, SteerTrackfurther develops a geometrical transformation-based method for estimating the rotation angle of the steering wheel in 3D driving environments by projecting the steering wheel to a 2D ellipse. Through extensive experiments in real driving environments with five volunteers for several weeks, SteerTrack can achieve an average steering wheel estimation error of 1.48 degree during driving, and 4.61 degree for turns.},

  abstract     = {Edge devices with sensing, storage, and communication resources (e.g., smartphones, tablets, connected vehicles, and IoT nodes) are increasingly penetrating our daily lives. Many novel applications can be created through sharing data among nearby peer edge devices. In such applications, caching data at some edge devices can greatly improve data availability, retrieval robustness, and delivery latency. In this paper, we study the unique problem of caching fairness in edge computing environments. Due to the heterogeneity of peer edge devices, load balance is a critical issue that affects the fairness in caching. We propose fairness metrics to characterize this issue and formulate the caching fairness problem as an integer linear programming problem, which is shown as the summation of multiple Connected Facility Location (ConFL) problems. We provide an approximation algorithm by leveraging an existing ConFL approximation algorithm, and prove that it preserves a 6.55 approximation ratio. We further develop a distributed algorithm where devices exchange data reachability information and identify popular candidates as caching nodes. Finally, we update the fairness metric and apply it to algorithms for making continuous caching decisions overtime. Our extensive evaluation results show that compared with existing caching algorithms for wireless networks, our proposed algorithms significantly improve the data caching fairness while keeping the contention induced latency comparable to the best existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Visible light communication (VLC)-based indoor localization approaches enjoy many advantages, such as utilizing ubiquitous lighting infrastructure, high location accuracy, and no interruption to RF-based devices. However, existing VLC-based localization methods lack a real-time backward channel from the device to landmarks and necessitate computation at the device, which make them unsuitable for real-time tracking of small IoT devices. In this paper, we propose and prototype RETRO, that establishes an almost zero-delay backward channel by retroreflection. RETRO localizes passive IoT devices without requiring computation and heavy sensing (e.g., camera) at the devices. Multiple photodiodes (i.e., landmarks) are mounted on any single unmodified light source to sense the retroreflected optical signal (i.e., location signature). We derive a closed-form expression, which is validated by experiments and ray tracing simulations, for the reflected optical power relative to the location and the orientation of the retroreflector. The expression is applied to a received signal strength indicator and trilateration based localization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate centimeter-level location accuracy and single-digit angular error. For practicality concern, to mitigate the thickness problem of a single retroreflector, the capabilities of different retroreflector arrays are studied. The range of the localization system is theoretically evaluated for different light emission patterns.},

First, we present an analytical framework based on continuous-time Markov networks (CTMNs) for depicting the behavior of different DCB policies in spatially distributed scenarios, where nodes are not required to be within the carrier sense range of each other. Then, we assess the performance of DCB in high-density IEEE 802.11ac/ax WLANs by means of simulations. We show that there may be critical interrelations among nodes in the spatial domain–even if they are located outside the carrier sense range of each other–in a chain reaction manner. Results also reveal that, while always selecting the widest available channel normally maximizes the individual long-term throughput, it often generates unfair situations where other WLANs starve. Moreover, we show that there are scenarios where DCB with stochastic channel width selection improves the latter approach both in terms of individual throughput and fairness. It follows that there is not a unique optimal DCB policy for every case. Instead, smarter bandwidth adaptation is required in the challenging scenarios of next-generation WLANs.},

In this paper, we present the competition among self-interest-driven vehicular nodes as an evolutionary game and study fundamental properties of the Nash equilibrium and the evolutionary stability. To deal with the inefficiency of the Nash equilibrium, we design a delayed pricing mechanism and propose a discretized replicator dynamics with this pricing mechanism. The strategy adaptation and the channel pricing can be performed in an asynchronous manner, such that vehicular users can obtain the knowledge of the channel prices prior to actually making access decisions. We prove that the Nash equilibrium of the proposed evolutionary dynamics is evolutionary stable and coincides with the social optimum. Besides, performance comparison is also carried out in different environments to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method over the distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning scheme in current literature in terms of the system convergence, stability and adaptability.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new MAC protocol for IoT applications, called Bird-MAC, which is highly energy efficient in the applications where IoT sensors report monitoring status in a quasi-periodic manner, as in structural health monitoring and static environmental monitoring. Two key design ideas of Bird-MAC are: (a) no need of early-wake-up of transmitters and (b) taking the right balance between synchronization and coordination costs. The idea (a) is possible by allowing a node (whether it is a transmitter or receiver) to wake up just with its given wake-up schedule, and letting a late bird (which wakes up later) notify its wake-up status to its corresponding early bird (which wakes up earlier), where the early bird just infrequently waits for the late bird&#39;s wake-up signal. The idea (b) is realized by designing Bird-MAC to be placed in a scheme between purely synchronous and asynchronous schemes. We provide a rigorous mathematical analysis that is used to choose the right protocol parameters of Bird-MAC. We demonstrate the performance of Bird-MAC through extensive simulations, and real experiments. The experiment on our testbed using a 26 node testbed at an underground parking lot of our office building to monitor its structural health shows that energy consumption is reduced by about up to 45 percent over existing sensor MAC protocols. We also confirm the applicability of Bird-MAC in a challenging and realistic scenario through the experiment on Yeongjong Grand Bridge in South Korea.},

In this paper, we present the first architecture of mobile crowd-sensed data market, and conduct an in-depth study of the design problem of online data pricing and reward sharing. To build a practical mobile crowd-sensed data market, we have to consider four major design challenges: data uncertainty, economic-robustness (arbitrage-freeness in particular), profit maximization, and fair reward sharing. By jointly considering the design challenges, we propose an online query-bAsed cRowd-sensEd daTa pricing mEchanism, namely ARETE-PR, to determine the trading price of crowd-sensed data. Our theoretical analysis shows that ARETE-PR guarantees both arbitrage-freeness and a constant competitive ratio in terms of profit maximization. Based on some fairness criterions, we further design a reward sharing scheme, namely ARETE-SH, which is closely coupled with ARETE-PR, to incentivize data providers to contribute data. We have evaluated ARETE on a real-world sensory data set collected by Intel Berkeley lab. Evaluation results show that ARETE-PR outperforms the state-of-the-art pricing mechanisms, and achieves around 90 percent of the optimal revenue. ARETE-SH distributes the reward among data providers in a fair way.},

Previous research efforts already provide efficient mechanisms that enable conditional privacy through pseudonym systems, either based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or Group Signature (GS) schemes. However, previous schemes do not enable users to self-generate an unlimited number of pseudonyms per user to enable users to participate in diverse sensing tasks simultaneously, while preventing the users from participating in the same task under different pseudonyms, which is referred to as sybil attack. This paper addresses this issue by providing a scalable privacy-preserving authentication solution for crowdsensing, based on a novel pseudonym-based signature scheme that enables unlinkable-yet-accountable pseudonymity. The paper provides a detailed description of the proposed scheme, the security analysis, the performance evaluation, and details of how it is implemented and integrated into a real crowdsensing platform.},

  abstract     = {Two critical quality factors for mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) are battery life and user-perceived performance of User Interface (UI) events, e.g., responsiveness of user action events and frame rate of video playback events. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art solutions have at least one of the following three limitations: 1) they cannot efficiently handle concurrent UI events of multiple apps (either foreground or background) and so may lead to performance imbalance and high energy consumption, 2) they try to regulate UI event performance periodically and thus may not efficiently handle the aperiodicity of user action events, which can result in poor responsiveness or high overheads, and 3) they rely mainly on CPU frequency/voltage scaling and so may have limited energy savings. In this paper, we present SURF, Supervisory control of User-perceived peRFormance, which is designed to overcome the three limitations. First, it dynamically allocates resources to concurrent UI events for balanced performance. Second, SURF uses supervisory control theory to handle the aperiodicity of user action events. Third, it optimizes the allocation of UI events to CPU cores for additional energy savings. SURF features a three-level architecture design that performs the three tasks at different time scales, according to their different overheads and timing requirements. We test SURF on several mobile device models with real-world open-source apps and show that, without causing perceivable performance degradation, it can reduce the CPU energy consumption by 28-98 percent compared to state-of-the-art solutions. In particular, by optimizing the allocation of UI events to the CPU cores, SURF achieves, 28-76 percent more CPU energy savings compared to other solutions.},

Existing approaches mainly focus on user verification targeting the unlocking of mobile devices or performing continuous verification based on a user&#39;s behavioral traits. Few studies provide efficient real-time user signature verification. In this work, we propose a critical segment based online signature verification system to secure mobile transactions on multi-touch mobile devices. Our system identifies and exploits the segments which remain invariant within a user&#39;s signature to capture the intrinsic signing behavior embedded in each user&#39;s signature. Our system extracts useful features from a user&#39;s signature that describe both the geometric layout of the signature as well as behavioral and physiological characteristics in the user&#39;s signing process. Given the input signatures for user enrollment, our system further designs a quality score to identify the problematic signature sets to achieve robust user signature profile construction. Moreover, we develop the signature normalization and interpolation methods to achieve robust signature verification in the presence of signature geometric distortions caused by different writing sizes, orientations and locations on touch screens. Our experimental evaluation of 25 subjects over six months time period shows that our system is highly accurate in provide signature verification and robust to signature forging attacks.},

Due to independent and varying duty cycle length, the sender may handle different waking-up orders of the potential forwarders when it tries to forward data packets at different time instants. Conventional opportunistic routing protocols overlook the time-varying property of the waking-up order of the candidate nodes. In this paper, we theoretically analyze how to obtain an optimal candidate set for each node in order to minimize the end-to-end latency. Then, considering the realistic scenarios, we propose an opportunistic routing which jointly considers global and localized optimizations. Based on the relatively stable topology and duty-cycle length information, an original candidate set is constructed. Then, by considering the real-time link and duty cycle information in the local context, a further optimization for the original candidate set can be achieved. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes can significantly improve the end-to-end latency compared with the benchmarks.},

These systems make use of the radio measurements of short-range commodity wireless devices, which vary due to the inhalation and exhalation motion of a person. The success of respiration rate estimation using such measurements depends on the signal-to-noise ratio, which alters with properties of the person and with the measurement system. To date, no model has been presented that allows evaluation of different deployments or system configurations for successful breathing rate estimation. In this paper, a received signal strength model for respiration rate monitoring is introduced. It is shown that measurements in linear and logarithmic scale have the same functional form, and the same estimation techniques can be used in both cases. The model is numerically and empirically evaluated, and its properties are discussed in depth. The most important model implications are validated under varying signal-to-noise ratio conditions using the performances of three estimators: batch frequency estimator, recursive Bayesian estimator, and model-based estimator. The results are in coherence with the findings, and they imply that different estimators are advantageous in different signal-to-noise ratio regimes.},

Our trackers/sensing units (PSUs) are the portable entities comprising of Smartphone/Jetson-TK1/PC which are enough to capture users&#39; devices probe requests and locations. PSUs upload collected traces on the cloud server periodically where cloud server keeps finding the suspicious person(s). To retrieve the updated information, we propose an algorithm (named, LLTR) to select the optimal number of PSUs for finding the latest location(s) of the suspicious person(s). To validate and to show the usability of SmartISS, we develop a real prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively on a real-world dataset of 117,121 traces collected during the technical festival held at IIT Roorkee, India. SmartISS selects PSUs with an average selection accuracy of 95.3 percent.},

  abstract     = {Today&#39;s mobile battery-powered communication devices require that users access chargers via wired and, recently, wireless recharging facilities. For a device departing from a location with a given energy “budget”, a plausible strategy is to seek a charger location once the energy is exhausted. We present a model of mobile nodes that captures the paths followed by the nodes with depleted energy seeking, possibly via a detour, to reach a charger. The derived location-dependent mobile node density distribution is used to express the location-dependent congestion of a wireless network whose capacity is used by the mobile nodes. The boundaries, and the relative placement of the charger, create intriguing discontinuities in the probability density function of the nodes across space. We find that chargers are not always “hotspots” in terms of node density, and that the energy budget of the nodes at the beginning of their trip impacts that density and determines the hotspot. Moreover, upon energy depletion, to detour from one&#39;s path or not, results in a distinctly different relative impact of the charger placement on the ability of nodes to sustain communication, depending, again on the energy budget the nodes have upon departure from a waypoint.},

  abstract     = {The increasing complexity of smartphone applications and services necessitate high battery consumption, but the growth of smartphones&#39; battery capacity is not keeping pace with these increasing power demands. To overcome this problem, researchers gave birth to the Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) research area. In this paper, we advance on previous ideas, proposing and implementing a Near Field Communication (NFC)-based computation offloading framework. This research is motivated by the advantages of NFC&#39;s short distance communication, its better security, and its low battery consumption characteristics. We design a new NFC communication protocol that overcomes the limitations of the default NFC protocol; removing the need for constant user interaction, the one-way communication restraint, and the limit on low data size transfer. Via the implemented framework, parts of mobile applications can be offloaded to other mobile devices or cloudlets equipped with an NFC reader. We present experimental results of the energy consumption and the time duration of computationally and data intensive representative applications: (i) RSA key generation and encryption, (ii) gaming/puzzles, (iii) face detection, (iv) media download from the Internet, and (v) data transferring between the mobile and the cloudlet. We show that when the helper device is more powerful than the device offloading the computations, the execution time of the tasks is reduced. Finally, we show that devices that offload application parts considerably reduce their energy consumption due to the low-power NFC interface and the benefits of offloading.},

  abstract     = {Network densification over space and spectrum is expected to be key to enabling the requirements of next generation mobile systems. The pitfall is that radio resource allocation becomes substantially more complex. In this paper, we propose LaSR, a practical multi-connectivity scheduler for OFDMA-based multi-RAT systems. LaSR makes optimal discrete control actions by solving a sequence of simple optimization problems that do not require prior information of traffic patterns. In marked contrast to previous work, the flexibility of our approach allows us to construct scheduling policies that achieve a good balance between system cost and utility satisfaction, while jointly operate across heterogeneous RATs, accommodate real-system requirements, and guarantee system stability. Examples of system requirements considered in this paper include (but are not limited to): constraints on how scheduling data can be encoded onto signaling protocols (e.g., LTE&#39;s DCI), delays when turning on/off radio units, or on/off cycles when using unlicensed spectrum. We evaluate our scheduler via a thorough simulation campaign in a variety of scenarios with e.g., mobile users, RATs using unlicensed spectrum (using a duty cycle access mechanism), imperfect queue state information, and constrained signaling protocol.},

We track Android / Linux system-level events including semantic syscalls, UI actions, and standard inter-process and intra-process communication interfaces that signal the initiation and propagation of interactivity-related executions. This interactive context enables new optimizations in CPU scheduling and power state management. We recognize that online resource scheduling is susceptible to inaccurate contexts-e.g., misidentifying an interactive execution as background leads to possible priority inversion by schedulers. In particular, low-level OS events such as kernel block / wake-up carry ambiguous semantics that could induce false context propagations. We selectively expose such uncertainties to the schedulers so that executions with uncertain contexts are prioritized behind interactive executions but otherwise run as fast as possible to minimize the priority inversion. We further recognize the importance of prompt propagation of the interactivity context at the earliest possible moment to facilitate immediate prioritization. We utilize the interactivity context to enable differential per-core frequency control and background workload consolidation. Experiments on a quad-core smartphone with a dozen mobile workload scenarios show that we can, on average, save 13 percent energy with only 1 percent degradation on the interactive performance.},

  abstract     = {Task allocation is a major challenge in Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS). While previous task allocation approaches follow either the opportunistic or participatory mode, this paper proposes to integrate these two complementary modes in a two-phased hybrid framework called HyTasker. In the offline phase, a group of workers (called opportunistic workers) are selected, and they complete MCS tasks during their daily routines (i.e., opportunistic mode). In the online phase, we assign another set of workers (called participatory workers) and require them to move specifically to perform tasks that are not completed by the opportunistic workers (i.e., participatory mode). Instead of considering these two phases separately, HyTasker jointly optimizes them with a total incentive budget constraint. In particular, when selecting opportunistic workers in the offline phase of HyTasker, we propose a novel algorithm that simultaneously considers the predicted task assignment for the participatory workers, in which the density and mobility of participatory workers are taken into account. Experiments on two real-world mobility datasets demonstrate that HyTasker outperforms other methods with more completed tasks under the same budget constraint.},

Such challenges hinder providing satisfactory quality of video streaming service to the mobile users. We propose a hardware-assisted, real-time video transcoding solution implemented on a commercial off-the-shelf device, Raspberry Pi. We employ the software and hardware coupled architecture in order to improve the performance/quality of video streaming and enhance the user satisfactions in wireless network. Our video transcoding solution can be applied to both the downlink and uplink streaming: for downlink stream, it can provide agile bitrate adaptation to sudden network dynamics and enhance video quality by running our transcoding solution at the wireless edge. It can be used to uplink stream for broadcasting live streams in real-time. We present the design and implementation of our video transcoding system in both cases with practical scenarios. The evaluation results reveal that our transcoding solution enhances the performance of video streaming compared with other adaptive bitrate streamings and it provides higher video quality without causing rebuffering or video stall. We bridge the gap between the wireless channel capacity and the video quality while providing a better streaming experience to end user.},

We propose an energy and mobility-aware scheduling framework that adapts to real-world dynamics to achieve optimal long-term tracking performance. To forecast energy, the framework uses an exponentially weighted moving average filter to compute a virtual energy budget for the remainder of the forecast period. The virtual energy budget is then used as input for our proposed information-based GPS sampling approach, which estimates the current tracking error through dead-reckoning and schedules a new GPS sample when the error exceeds a given threshold. In order to improve the long-term tracking performance, the threshold is adapted based on the current energy and movement trends to balance the expected information gain from a new GPS sample with its energy cost. We evaluate our approach on empirical traces from wild flying foxes and compare it to strategies that sample GPS using fixed and adaptive duty cycles and by using dead-reckoning with a fixed threshold. Our analysis shows that the proposed information-based GPS sampling strategy reduces the mean tracking error compared to existing methods and approaches the performance of the optimal offline sampling strategy.},

Recently, both US and European governments called a ruling on opening up spectrum that was initially licensed to sensitive military/federal systems. However, this introduces serious concerns on operational privacy (e.g., location, time, and frequency of use) of IUs for national security concerns. Although several works have proposed obfuscation methods to address this problem, these techniques only rely on syntactic privacy models, lacking rigorous privacy guarantee. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to provide real-time differential location privacy for sensitive IUs. We design a utility-optimal differentially private mechanism to reduce the loss in spectrum efficiency while protecting IUs from harmful interference. Furthermore, we strategically combine differential privacy with another privacy notion, expected inference error, to provide double shield protection for IU&#39;s location privacy. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate our design and demonstrate significant improvements in utility and location privacy compared with other existing mechanisms.},

In this paper, we investigate various opportunities of using a high-order modulation to boost the throughput of LED-Camera VLC systems, and we decide that Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK) is the most suitable scheme given the limited operating frequency of such systems. However, directly driving an LED to emit different levels of luminance may suffer heavy distortions caused by the nonlinear behavior of LED. As a result, we innovatively propose to generate ASK using the composition of light emission. In other words, we digitally control the On-Off states of several groups of LED chips, so that their light emissions compose in the air to produce various ASK symbols. We build a prototype of this novel ASK-based VLC system and demonstrate its superior performance over existing systems: it achieves a rate of 2 kbps at a 1 m distance with only a single LED luminaire for static users and more than 1 kbps for mobile users.},

However, in the dynamic environment in which wearables operate, the accuracy of a computational model drops whenever changes in configuration or context of the system occur. In this paper, using transfer learning as an organizing principle, we propose a novel design framework to enable autonomous reconfiguration of wearable systems. More specifically, we focus on the cases where the specifications of sensor(s) or the subject vary compared to what is available in the training data. We develop two new algorithms for data mapping (the mapping is between the training data and the data for the current operating setting). The first data mapping algorithm combines effective methods for finding signal similarity with network-based clustering, while the second algorithm is based on finding signal motifs. The data mapping algorithms constitute the centerpiece of the transfer learning phase in our framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of the data mapping algorithms using two publicly available datasets on human activity recognition. We show that the data mapping algorithms are up to two orders of magnitude faster compared to a brute-force approach. We also show that the proposed framework overall improves activity recognition accuracy by up to 15 percent for the first dataset and by up to 32 percent for the second dataset.},

The ability to provide virtual, logically independent “slices” of the network will also have an impact on the models that will sustain the business ecosystem. Network slicing will open the door to new players: the infrastructure provider, which is the owner of the infrastructure, and the tenants, which may acquire a network slice from the infrastructure provider to deliver a specific service to their customers. In this new context, how to correctly handle resource allocation among tenants and how to maximize the monetization of the infrastructure become fundamental problems that need to be solved. In this paper, we address this issue by designing a network slice admission control algorithm that (i) autonomously learns the best acceptance policy while (ii) it ensures that the service guarantees provided to tenants are always satisfied. The contributions of this paper include: (i) an analytical model for the admissibility region of a network slicing-capable 5G Network, (ii) the analysis of the system (modeled as a Semi-Markov Decision Process) and the optimization of the infrastructure providers revenue, and (iii) the design of a machine learning algorithm that can be deployed in practical settings and achieves close to optimal performance.},

  abstract     = {To fully realize the potential of vehicular networks, several obstacles and challenges need to be addressed. Chief among the obstacles are strict QoS requirements of applications and differentiated service requirements in different situations. Although DSRC and WAVE have been adopted as the de facto standards, they do not address all the problems and there is room for improvements. In this study, we propose a generic prioritization and resource management algorithm that can be used to prioritize processing of received packets in vehicular networks. We formulate the generic severity-based prioritized packet processing problem as Penalized Multiple Knapsack Problem (PMKP) and prove that it is an NP-Hard problem. We thus develop a real-time heuristic that utilizes a relaxed version of the formulation. The relaxed formulation executes in polynomial time and guarantees a minimum delay per severity-level while respecting the processing rate constraint. To measure the performance of the proposed heuristic, real traffic data is used in a small-scale experiment. The proposed heuristic is tested against the PMKP solution and results show a small degradation of up to 4 percent in profit for the heuristic compared to the PMKP solution. Also, the proposed heuristic is tested against a non-prioritized processing algorithm that works using first come first served policy. Results show that the proposed heuristic gains 9 to 67 percent more profit than the non-prioritized processing algorithm in moderate and high congestion scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Recent hardware advances have led to the development and consumerization of mobile devices, which mainly include smartphones and various wearable devices. To protect the privacy of users, various user authentication mechanisms have been proposed. In particular, biometrics has been widely used for multi-factor authentication. However, biometrics-based authentication mechanisms usually require costly sensors deployed on devices, and rely on explicit user input and Internet connection for performing user authentication. In this article, we propose a system, called RISKCOG, which can authenticate the ownership of mobile devices unobtrusively and in a real-time manner by adopting a learning-based approach. Unlike previous studies on user authentication, for cross-platform deployment, maximum user privacy protection, and unobtrusive authentication, RISKCOG only relies on those widely available and privacy-insensitive motion sensors to capture the data related to the users&#39; daily device usage. It requires no users&#39; explicit input and has no requirement on the users&#39; motion state or the device placement. RISKCOG is also usable in the environment without Internet access by performing offline user identity verification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on smartphones and smartwatches, which show that RISKCOG can authenticate device users rapidly and with high accuracy.},

Although smartphones are normally equipped with GPS modules, there are still a large number of users with cell phones only as basic devices, and GPS could be ineffective in urban canyon environments. To this end, the RF fingerprints based positioning mechanism is incorporated into LTE architecture by 3GPP, where the major challenge is to collect geo-tagged RF fingerprints in vast areas. This paper proposes to utilize the subspace identification approach for large-scale RF fingerprints prediction. We formulate the problem into the problem of finding the optimal subspace over Stiefel manifold, and redesign the Stiefel-manifold optimization method with fast convergence rate. Moreover, we propose a sliding window mechanism for the practical large-scale fingerprints prediction scenario, where recorded fingerprints are unevenly distributed in the vast area. Combining the two proposed mechanisms enables an efficient method of large-scale fingerprints prediction in the city level. Further, we validate our theoretical analysis and proposed mechanisms by conducting experiments with real mobile data, which shows that the resulted localization accuracy and reliability with our predicted fingerprints exceed the requirement of E911.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we present WindTalker, a novel and practical keystroke inference framework that can be used to infer the sensitive keystrokes on a mobile device through WiFi-based side-channel information. WindTalker is motivated from an observation that keystrokes on mobile devices will lead to different hand coverage and the finger motions, which will introduce a unique interference to the multi-path signals and can be reflected by the channel state information (CSI). An attacker can exploit the strong correlation between the CSI fluctuation and the keystrokes to infer the user&#39;s password input. Compared with the previous keystroke inference approaches, WindTalker neither deploys external equipment physically close to the target device nor compromises the target device. Instead, it employs a more practical setting by deploying a free public WiFi hotspot and collects the CSI data from the target device as long as the device is connected to the hotspot. In addition, to improve inference accuracy and efficiency, it analyzes the WiFi traffic to selectively collect CSI only for the sensitive period where password entering occurs. WindTalker can be implemented without the requirement of visually seeing the target device, or installing any malware on the device. We tested Windtalker on several mobile phones and performed a detailed case study to evaluate the practicality of the password inference towards Alipay, the largest mobile payment platform in the world. Furthermore, we proposed a novel CSI obfuscation countermeasure to thwart the inference attack. The evaluation results show that the performance of WindTalker can be dramatically reduced by adopting the proposed countermeasures.},

First, a Multi-QoS vector is defined, and to take into account the trustworthiness of QoS, the fidelity of QoS is modeled as one component of the Multi-QoS vector. Then, a fuzzy hierarchy including dual attributes of QoS (objective attribute and subjective evaluation) is established to fully consider the objective and subjective attributes&#39; impact on optimal service recommendation. Furthermore, a FAHP-based weighting mode is developed, in which the resolution ratio of weight can be adjusted dynamically by decision-maker according to user preferences. Finally, the optimal service is obtained through the calculation of ordinal utility function of candidate service. Experimental results and method comparison illuminate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Deploying Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is a necessity to enable a range of civilian/military underwater applications; yet, achieving a reliable coordination among the vehicles is a challenging issue due to the time- and space-varying characteristics of the acoustic communication channel. The design of a Medium Access Control (MAC) based on a probabilistic Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) method for short/medium distances (less than 2 km) is presented. This method considers the inherent vehicle position uncertainty due to the inaccuracies in models and the drift of the vehicles. It minimizes the acoustic interference statistically by considering the angular position of neighboring vehicles via a two-step estimation and by keeping the transmitter antenna&#39;s beamwidth of each vehicle at an optimal value. Such value is chosen considering three contrasting goals, i.e.: (i) spreading the signal beam towards the vehicle to combat position uncertainty using a coarse estimation; (ii) focusing the beam to reduce acoustic energy dispersion through a fine estimation; and (iii) minimizing interference to other vehicles. Simulation results in a sparse underwater network show that this approach mitigates interference, reduces the probability of retransmission, and achieves higher data rates over conventional underwater MAC techniques.},

The architecture is realized adopting a delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN) approach allowing end users to adopt standard devices. A buffer aware contact graph routing algorithm is designed to account for the buffer occupancy of the nSATs and for the connection planning derived from their visibility periods. At the terrestrial uplink, a coded random access is employed to realize a high-capacity interface for the typically irregular traffic of 5G users, while, at the space uplink, the DTN architecture is combined with the contention resolution diversity slotted Aloha protocol to match the recent update of the DVB-RCS2 standard. To achieve a reliable testing of the introduced functionalities, an accurate analysis of the statistic of the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio and of the capture probability at each mmWave link is developed by including interference, shadowing, fading, and noise. The application of the designed architecture to data transfer services in conjunction with possible delay reduction strategies, and an extension to inter-satellite communication, are finally presented by estimating the resulting loss/delay performance through a discrete-time discrete-event platform based on the integration of Matlab with Network Simulator 3.},

The optimal policy is threshold in nature. However, computation of optimal policy requires the knowledge of the statistics of system dynamics, viz., arrival processes of voice and data users, which may be difficult to obtain in reality. Motivated by the Post-Decision State (PDS) framework to learn the optimal policy under unknown statistics of system dynamics, we propose, in this paper, an online Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection algorithm using Relative Value Iteration Algorithm (RVIA). However, the convergence speed of this algorithm can be further improved if the underlying threshold structure of the optimal policy can be exploited. To this end, we propose a novel structure-aware online RAT selection algorithm which reduces the feasible policy space, thereby offering lesser storage and computational complexity and faster convergence. This algorithm provides a novel framework for designing online learning algorithms for other problems and hence is of independent interest. We prove that both the algorithms converge to the optimal policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms converge faster than a traditional scheme. Also, the proposed schemes perform better than other benchmark algorithms under realistic network scenarios.},

Specifically, we study the location-aware and location diversity based dynamic crowdsensing system, where workers move over time and tasks arrive stochastically. We first exploit offline crowdsensing by proposing a combinatorial algorithm, for efficiently distributing tasks to workers. After that, we mainly study the online crowdsensing, and further consider an indispensable aspect of worker&#39;s fair allocation. Apart from the stochastic characteristics and discontinuous coverage, the non-linear expectation is incurred as a new challenge concerning fairness issue. Based on Lyapunov optimization with perturbation parameters, we propose online control policy to overcome those challenges. Hereby, we can maintain system stability and achieve a time average sensing utility arbitrarily close to the optimum. Finally, we propose an optimization framework to aggregate the sensing data which can estimate worker expertise and task truth simultaneously. Performance evaluations on real and synthetic data set validate the proposed algorithm, where 80 percent gain of fairness is achieved at the expense of 12 percent loss of sensing value on average.},

This paper provides a comprehensive investigation on the hidden-node problem that arises in the full-duplex (FD) enabled carrier-sensing multiple-access (CSMA) networks. In particular, we first provide the fundamental conditions that guarantee successful receptions for all the FD transmission cases, and propose an ellipse interference model and an ellipse carrier-sensing model to capture the interference relations and the carrier-sensing mechanism in FD CSMA networks, respectively. We further establish the hidden-node-free design in FD CSMA networks. Specifically, we show the sufficient conditions on the carrier-sensing power threshold that can eliminate hidden-node collisions. We show that compared with half-duplex CSMA networks, the FD CSMA network needs a much smaller carrier-sensing power threshold to prevent hidden-node collisions, which leads to poor network spatial reuse. This motivates us to further propose a new medium access control (MAC) protocol with Full-duplex Enhanced Carrier-Sensing (FECS) mechanism. The FECS-MAC enables the secondary carrier-sensing before starting the secondary transmission. We show that with the secondary carrier-sensing design, the required carrier-sensing powerthreshold can be increased while keeping the network hidden-node free. Therefore, the network spatial reuse and throughput can be significantly improved. Simulation results demonstrate that the FECS-MAC can improve the throughput of dense three-node FD networks by more than 30 percent, compared with relay full-duplex (RFD) MAC protocol proposed in [1].},

Here, we aim to design efficient cache placement and delivery strategies for an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based cache-enabled heterogeneous cellular network (C-HetNet) which operates in two separated phases: caching phase (CP) and delivery phase (DP). Since guaranteeing fairness among mobile users (MUs) is not well investigated in cache-assisted wireless networks, we first propose two delay-based fairness schemes called proportional fairness (PF) and min-max fairness (MMF). The PF scheme deals with minimizing the total weighted latency of MUs while MMF aims at minimizing the maximum latency among them. In the CP, we propose a novel proactive fairness and transmission-aware cache placement strategy (CPS) corresponding to each target fairness scheme by exploiting the flexible wireless access and backhaul transmission opportunities. Specifically, we jointly perform the allocation of physical resources as storage and radio, and user association to improve the flexibility of the CPSs. Moreover, in the DP of each fairness scheme, an efficient delivery policy is proposed based on the arrival requests of MUs, CSI, and caching status. Numerical assessments demonstrate that our proposed CPSs outperform the total latency of MUs up to 27 percent compared to the conventional baseline popular CPSs.},

DeepWear provides various novel techniques such as context-aware offloading, strategic model partition, and pipelining support to efficiently utilize the processing capacity from nearby paired handhelds. Deployed as a user-space library, DeepWear offers developer-friendly APIs that are as simple as those in traditional DL libraries such as TensorFlow. We have implemented DeepWear on the Android OS and evaluated it on COTS smartphones and smartwatches with real DL models.

  abstract     = {Due to the unavailability of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication in current transportation systems, Traffic Light Detection (TLD) is still considered an important module in autonomous vehicles and Driver Assistance Systems (DAS). To overcome low flexibility and accuracy of vision-based heuristic algorithms and high power consumption of deep learning-based methods, we propose a lightweight and real-time traffic light detector for the autonomous vehicle platform. Our model consists of a heuristic candidate region selection module to identify all possible traffic lights, and a lightweight Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classifier to classify the results obtained. Offline simulations on the GPU server with the collected dataset and several public datasets show that our model achieves higher average accuracy and less time consumption. By integrating our detector module on NVidia Jetson TX1/TX2, we conduct on-road tests on two full-scale self-driving vehicle platforms (a car and a bus) in normal traffic conditions. Our model can achieve an average detection accuracy of 99.3 percent (mRttld) and 99.7 percent (Rttld) at 10Hz on TX1 and TX2, respectively. The on-road tests also show that our traffic light detection module can achieve &lt;; + 1:5m errors at stop lines when working with other selfdriving modules.},

  abstract     = {Caching popular videos at mobile edge servers (MESs) has been confirmed as a promising method to improve mobile users (MUs) perceived quality of experience (QoE) and to alleviate the server load. However, with the multiple bitrate encoding techniques prevalently employed in modern streaming services, caching deployment is challenging for the following three facts: (1) cooperative caching should be explored for MUs located at overlapped coverage areas of MESs; (2) there exists tradeoff consideration for caching either high bitrate videos or high diversity videos; and (3) the relationship between MU perceived QoE and MU received bitrate, known as QoE function, varies in different services. Aiming to maximize the MU perceived QoE, we formulate the multiple bitrate video caching problem, and prove this problem is NP-hard for any given positive and strictly increasing QoE function. We then propose a polynomial complexity algorithm based on a general QoE function, which can achieve an approximate ratio arbitrarily close to 1/2. Specifically, for a linear QoE function, we explore useful property of optimal solutions, based on which more efficient algorithms are proposed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions via both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a device-based Fog Radio Access Network (F-RAN), where users&#39; smart devices (denoted by F-UEs) can be exploited to cache popular files so as to communicate them when requested by other F-UEs among them. This architecture restricts the involvement of the central baseband processing unit (BBU) to serving those F-UEs not immediately served by their peers, thus offloading the BBU&#39;s fronthaul spectrum and increasing the overall capacity of the network. This paper aims to further maximize fronthaul offloading in this architecture using network coding (NC). The latter exploits both the cached and previously received files by different F-UEs as side information to serve more requesting F-UEs in each transmission from their peers or the BBU so as to maximize fronthaul offloading. Being half-duplex devices (they can only either send or receive in any given time), the problem of BBU fronthaul offloading in this setting is formulated over two transmission phases on an NC graph. After showing that this problem is NP-hard, the paper proposes two novel heuristic algorithms to solve it in real-time. In addition, a lower-bound on the offloading gain of these algorithms is derived for a special file placement case, their asymptotic optimality is proven, and their complexities are analyzed. Simulation results both show that these proposed algorithms perform closely to the optimal solution and quantify the significant offloading gains achieved by them.},

  abstract     = {Sensors (e.g., light, gyroscope, and accelerometer) and sensing-enabled applications on a smart device make the applications more user-friendly and efficient. However, the current permission-based sensor management systems of smart devices only focus on certain sensors and any App can get access to other sensors by just accessing the generic sensor Application Programming Interface (API). In this way, attackers can exploit these sensors in numerous ways: they can extract or leak users&#39; sensitive information, transfer malware, or record or steal sensitive information from other nearby devices. In this paper, we propose 6thSense, a context-aware intrusion detection system which enhances the security of smart devices by observing changes in sensor data for different tasks of users and creating a contextual model to distinguish benign and malicious behavior of sensors. 6thSense utilizes three different Machine Learning-based detection mechanisms (i.e., Markov Chain, Naive Bayes, and LMT). We implemented 6thSense on several sensor-rich Android-based smart devices (i.e., smart watch and smartphone) and collected data from typical daily activities of 100 real users. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of 6thSense against three sensor-based threats: (1) a malicious App that can be triggered via a sensor, (2) a malicious App that can leak information via a sensor, and (3) a malicious App that can steal data using sensors. Our extensive evaluations show that the 6thSense framework is an effective and practical approach to defeat growing sensor-based threats with an accuracy above 96 percent without compromising the normal functionality of the device. Moreover, our framework reveals minimal overhead.},

  abstract     = {Control of conventional transportation networks aims at bringing the state of the network (e.g., the traffic flows in the network) to the system optimal (SO) state. This optimum is characterized by the minimality of the social cost function, i.e., the total cost of travel (e.g., travel time) of all drivers. On the other hand, drivers are assumed to be rational and selfish, and make their travel decisions (e.g., route choices) to optimize their own travel costs, bringing the state of the network to a user equilibrium (UE). A classic approach to influence users’ route choice is using congestion tolls. In this paper, we study the SO and UE of future connected vehicular transportation networks, where users consider both the travel cost and the utility from data communication, when making their travel decisions. We leverage the data communication aspect of the decision making to influence the user route choices, driving the UE state to the SO state. We assume the cache-enabled vehicles can communicate with other vehicles via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connections. We propose an algorithm for calculating the values of the data communication utility that drive the UE to the SO. This result provides a guideline on how the system operator can adjust the parameters of the communication network (e.g., data pricing and bandwidth) to achieve the optimal social cost. We discuss the insights that the results shed on a secondary optimization that the operator can conduct to maximize its own utility without deviating the transportation network state from the SO. We validate the proposed communication model via Veins simulation. The simulation results also show that the system cost can be lowered even if the bandwidth allocation does not exactly match the optimal allocation policy under 802.11p protocol.},

We design sound signals suitable for heterogeneous microphones on commodity smartphones, and acoustic signal processing techniques to produce accurate distance measurements to nearby objects. We further develop robust probabilistic echo-object association, recursive outlier removal, and probabilistic resampling algorithms to identify the correspondence between distances and objects, thus the geometry of corridors and rooms. We compensate minute hand sway movements to identify small surface recessions, thus detecting doors automatically. Experiments in real buildings show BatMapperachieves 1 - 2 cm distance accuracy in ranges up around 4 m; a 2~3 minute walk generates fine grained corridor shapes, detects doors at 92 percent precision and 1~2 mlocation error at 90-percentile; and tens of seconds of measurement gestures produce room geometry with errors &lt;; 0:3 m at 80-percentile, at 1 - 2 orders of magnitude less data amounts and user efforts.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge in mobile crowdsensing applications is the generation of false (or spam) contributions resulting from selfish and malicious behaviors of users, or wrong perception of an event. Such false contributions induce loss of revenue owing to undue incentivization, and also affect the operational reliability of the applications. To counter these problems, we propose an event-trust and user-reputation model, called &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$QnQ$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , to segregate different user classes such as honest, selfish, or malicious. The resultant user reputation scores, are based on both ‘quality’ (accuracy of contribution) and ‘quantity’ (degree of participation) of their contributions. Specifically, &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$QnQ$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; exploits a rating feedback mechanism for evaluating an event-specific expected truthfulness, which is then transformed into a robust quality of information (QoI) metric to weaken various effects of selfish and malicious user behaviors. Eventually, the QoIs of various events in which a user has participated are aggregated to compute his reputation score, which in turn is used to judiciously disburse user incentives with a goal to reduce the incentive losses of the CS application provider. Subsequently, inspired by cumulative prospect theory (CPT) , we propose a risk tolerance and reputation aware trustworthy decision making scheme to determine whether an event should be published or not, thus improving the operational reliability of the application. To evaluate &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$QnQ$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; experimentally, we consider a vehicular crowdsensing application as a proof-of-concept. We compare QoI performance achieved by our model with Jøsang&#39;s belief model, reputation scoring with Dempster-Shafer based reputation model, and operational (decision) accuracy with expected utility theory. Experimental results demonstrate that &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$QnQ$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is able to better capture subtle differences in user behaviors based on both quality and quantity, reduces incentive losses, and significantly improves operational accuracy in presence of rogue contributions.},

In a typical crowdsensing system, the task owner usually needs to provide incentives to the users (say participants) to encourage their participation. Among existing incentive mechanisms, posted pricing has been widely adopted because it is easy to implement while ensuring truthfulness and fairness. One critical challenge to the task owner is to set the right posted price to recruit a crowd with small total payment and reasonable sensing quality, i.e., posted pricing problem for robust crowdsensing. However, this fundamental problem remains largely open so far. In this paper, we model the robustness requirement over sensing data quality as chance constraints in an elegant manner, and study a series of chance constrained posted pricing problems in crowdsensing systems. Although some chance-constrained optimization techniques have been applied in the literature, they cannot provide any performance guarantees for their solutions. In this work, we propose a binary search based algorithm, and show that using this algorithm allows us to establish theoretical guarantees on its performance. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

Caching can help improve the network capacity, as it shortens the content transmission distance and reduces the communication interference. However, current researches on the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks with caching generally assume that content popularity follows a uniform distribution. They ignore the fact that contents in reality have skewed popularity, which may lead to totally different capacity results. In this paper, we evaluate how the distribution of the content popularity affects the per-node capacity, and derive different capacity scaling laws based on the skewness of the content popularity. Our results suggest that for wireless networks with caching, when contents have skewed popularity, increasing the number of nodes monotonically increases the per-node capacity.},

  abstract     = {Most client hosts are equipped with multiple network interfaces (e.g., WiFi and cellular networks). Simultaneous access of multiple interfaces can significantly improve the users’ quality of experience (QoE) in video streaming. An intuitive approach to achieve it is to use Multi-path TCP (MPTCP). However, the deployment of MPTCP, especially with link preference, requires OS kernel update at both the client and server side, and a vast amount of commercial content providers do not support MPTCP. Thus, in this paper, we realize a multi-path video streaming algorithm in the application layer instead, by considering Scalable Video Coding (SVC), where each layer of every chunk can be fetched from only one of the orthogonal paths. We formulate the quality decisions of video chunks subject to the available bandwidth of the different paths, chunk deadlines, and link preferences as an optimization problem. The objective is to to optimize a QoE metric that maintains a tradeoff between maximizing the playback rate of every chunk and ensuring fairness among chunks. The proposed metric prefers to use bandwidth of the links to optimize a concave utility function of the chunk quality. Even though the formulation is a non-convex discrete optimization, we provide a quadratic complexity algorithm which is shown to be optimal in some special cases. We further propose an online algorithm where several challenges including bandwidth prediction errors, are addressed. Extensive emulated experiments in a real testbed with real traces of public dataset reveal the robustness of our scheme and demonstrate its significant performance improvement compared to other multi-path algorithms.},

However, MPTCP clients in WiFi networks may easily lower the achievable throughput of the network due to excessively created connections over access points (APs), particularly those that own a weak link quality. This is caused by the fact that the maximal achievable throughput of a WiFi AP can be easily affected by the number of connections accessing it and the link qualities of those connections. In this paper, we first verify such effects through extensive experiments and analysis. We then propose a novel scheme, denoted MPWiFi, to solve this issue while keeping the benefits of MPTCP based multipath access in WiFi networks. Our scheme allows a MPTCP client to obtain resources on its best WiFi path freely and suppresses its subflows in additional paths when congestion happens. As a result, the degrading to the WiFi AP&#39;s achievable throughput is greatly prevented with acceptable influences on the benefits of MPTCP clients (i.e., their multipath access is intervened only on congested non-best APs). The fairness to MPTCP clients is also guaranteed through their best WiFi connection. The proposed solution is implemented along with the Linux Kernel MPTCP implementation. Extensive real-world deployment based experiments and NS3 simulation show that the proposed scheme can effectively alleviate the adverse impact of MPTCP based multipath access in WiFi networks while keeping its benefits.},

  abstract     = {With rapid development of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, ever-increasing research effort has been dedicated to devising various RFID-enabled services. The missing tag identification, which is to identify all missing tags, is one of the most important services in many Internet-of-Things applications such as inventory management. Prior work on missing tag detection all rely on hash functions implemented at individual tags. However, in reality hash functions are not supported by commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID tags. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper is devoted to detecting missing tags with COTS Gen2 devices. We first introduce a point-to-multipoint protocol, named P2M that works in an analog frame slotted Aloha paradigm to interrogate tags and collect their electronic product codes (EPCs). A missing tag will be found if its EPC is not present in the collected ones. To reduce time cost of P2M resulted from tag response collisions, we further present a collision-free point-to-point protocol, named P2P that selectively specifies a tag to reply with its EPC in each slot. If the EPC is not received, this tag is regarded to be missing. We develop two bitmask selection methods to enable the selective query while reducing communication overhead. We implement P2M and P2P with COTS RFID devices and evaluate their performance under diverse settings.},

  abstract     = {OFDMA femtocell is a promising technology to improve indoor cellular network coverage cost-effectively. Large-scale deployment of femtocells in the urban area is expected to be realized in the near future. However, inter-femtocell interference significantly limits the achievable throughput of an OFDMA femtocell system, which calls for interference management tailored for femtocell networks. A typical approach to mitigate inter-femtocell interference is known as resource isolation, which aims at assigning non-overlapping resources to interfering femtocells. One of the main challenges for interference mitigation in femtocell networks is that end consumers often install the femtocells. Very limited information about the femtocells is available, making it hard to decipher the inter-femtocell interference. Previous studies either take time to resolve collisions online or adopt a conservative approach to identify interferers. Although the latter approach avoids wasting time on resolving collisions, it may result in resource underutilization. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to identify inter-femtocell interference by analyzing the received patterns observed by mobile stations. We conducted experiments on GNU Radio/USRP to demonstrate that the proposed interference identification method can successfully identify real interferers while excluding non-interfering femtocells from suspect femtocells. Based on the proposed interference identification, we propose a weighted vertex-coloring based resource assignment algorithm to allocate resources with better fairness and higher throughput.},

In this work, a novel contract theoretic incentive mechanism is proposed to study how to manage the resources and provide services to the users in the wireless virtualized networks. We consider that the infrastructure providers (InPs) own the physical networks and the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) has the service information of the users and needs to lease the physical radio resources for providing services. In particular, we utilize the contract theoretic approach to model the resource trading process between the MVNO and multiple InPs. Two scenarios are considered according to whether the information (such as the radio resource they can provide) of the InPs are globally known. Subsequently, the corresponding optimal contracts regarding the user association and transmit power allocation are derived to maximize the payoff of the MVNOs while maintaining the requirements of the InPs in the trading process. To evaluate the proposed scheme, extensive simulation studies are conducted. It can be observed that the proposed contract theoretic approach can effectively stimulate InPs&#39; participation, improve the payoff of the MVNO, and outperform other schemes.},

We point out the need for analyzing data flows across multiple Android apps, a problem referred to as end-to-end flow analysis. In this work, we present a flow analysis for app pairs that computes the risk level associated with their potential communications. Our approach statically analyzes the sensitivity and context of each inter-app flow based on inter-component communication (ICC) between communicating apps, and defines fine-grained security policies for inter-app ICC risk classification. We perform an empirical study on 7,251 apps from the Google Play store to identify the apps that communicate with each other via ICC channels. Our results report four times fewer warnings on our dataset of 197 real app pairs communicating via explicit external ICCs than the state-of-the-art permission-based collusion detection.},

  abstract     = {Passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags have been widely applied in many applications, such as logistics, retailing, and warehousing. In many situations, the order of objects is more important than their absolute locations. However, state-of-art ordering methods need a continuing movement of tags and readers, which limit the application domain and scalability. In this paper, we propose a 2-dimension ordering approach for passive tags that requires no device movement. Instead, our method utilizes signal changes caused by arbitrary movement of human beings around tags, who carry no device for horizontal dimension ordering. Hence, our method is called Human Movement based Ordering (HMO). The basic idea of HMO is that when people pass between the reader antenna and tags, the received signal strength will change. By observing the time-series RSS changes of tags, HMO can obtain the order of tags along with a specific horizontal direction. For vertical dimension, we employ a linear programming method that is tolerant of tiny errors in practice. We implement HMO with commodity off-the-shelf RFID devices. The experimental results show that HMO can achieve up to 88.71 and 90.86 percent average accuracies in the signal-and multi-person cases, respectively.},

Prior work has developed computation offloading systems for mobile devices, but this work has focused exclusively on offloading to single hop neighbors, due in part to the practical challenges of setting up multi-hop networks using existing ad hoc communication protocols. However, limiting the offloading of computation to one-hop neighbors inherently restricts the number of devices that can participate in the distributed computation. By presenting a heuristic, aimed at avoiding partitioning the network, as well as an iterative task assignment algorithm that can optimize the assignment of computational tasks to devices in a multi-hop cooperative network, we are able to evaluate the effect of computational offloading in multi-hop networks. Experimental results, obtained from an implementation on Android devices, are integrated with an analytical model that enables the evaluation of system performance under a variety of conditions. These experimental and analytic results demonstrate the benefit of enabling computation offloading to all devices in a multi-hop cooperative network.},

We design joint charging and scheduling schemes to maximize the Quality of Monitoring (QoM) for stochastic events, which arrive and depart according to known probability distributions of time. Information is considered captured if it is sensed by at least one sensor. We focus on two closely related research issues, i.e., how to choose the sensors for charging and decide the charging time for each of them, and how to schedule the sensors&#39; activation schedules according to their received energy. We formulate our problem as the maximum QoM CHArging and SchEduling problem (CHASE). We first ignore the MC&#39;s travel time and study the resulting relaxed version of the problem, which we call CHASE-R. We show that both CHASE and CHASE-R are NP-hard. For CHASE-R, we prove that it can be formulated as a submodular function maximization problem, which allows two algorithms to achieve 1/6- and 1/(4 + ε)-approximation ratios. Then, for CHASE, we propose approximation algorithms to solve it by extending the CHASE-R results. We conduct simulations to validate our algorithm design.},

In the considered model, computation tasks are generated randomly at mobile users along the time. For each task, the mobile user can choose to either process it locally or offload it via the uplink transmission to the edge for cloud computing. To efficiently manage the system, the network regulator is required to employ a network-wide optimal scheme for computation offloading and transmission scheduling while guaranteeing that all mobile users would like to follow (as they may naturally behave strategically for benefiting themselves). By considering tradeoffs between local and edge computing, wireless features and noncooperative game interactions among mobile users, we formulate a mechanism design problem to jointly determine a computation offloading scheme, a transmission scheduling discipline, and a pricing rule. A queueing model is built to analytically describe the packet-level network dynamics. Based on this, we propose a novel mechanism, which can maximize the network social welfare (i.e., the network-wide performance), while achieving a game equilibrium among strategic mobile users. Theoretical and simulation results examine the performance of our proposed mechanism, and demonstrate its superiority over the counterparts.},

  abstract     = {With the exponentially increasing number of mobile devices, crowdsensing has been a hot topic to use the available resource of neighbor mobile devices to perform sensing tasks cooperatively. However, there still remain three main obstacles to be solved in the practical system. First, since mobile devices are selfish and rational, it is natural to provide cooperation for sensing with a reasonable payment. Meanwhile, due to the arrival and departure of sensing tasks, resource should be allocated and released dynamically when sensing task comes or leaves. To this end, this paper designs a game theoretic approach based incentive mechanism to encourage the “best” neighbor mobile devices to share their own resource for sensing. Next, in order to adjust resource among mobile devices for the better crowdsensing response, an auction based task migration algorithm is proposed, which can guarantee the truthfulness of announced price of auctioneer, individual rationality, profitability, and computational efficiency. Moreover, taking into account the random movement of mobile devices resulting in the stochastic connection, we also use multi-stage stochastic decision to take posterior resource allocation to compensate for inaccurate prediction. The numerical results show the effectiveness and improvement of the proposed multi-stage stochastic programming based distributed game theoretic methodology ( SPG ) for crowdsensing.},

In this vein, our paper proposes a novel and complete solution for planning network slices of the LTE EPC, tailored for the enhanced Mobile BroadBand use case. The solution defines a framework which consists of: i) an abstraction of the LTE workload generation process, ii) a compound traffic model, iii) performance models of the whole LTE network, and iv) an algorithm to jointly perform the resource dimensioning and network embedding. Our results show that the aggregated signaling generation is a Poisson process and the data traffic exhibits self-similarity and long-range-dependence features. The proposed performance models for the LTE network rely on these results. We formulate the joint optimization problem of resources dimensioning and embedding of a virtualized EPC and propose a heuristic to solve it. By using simulation tools, we validate the proper operation of our solution.},
