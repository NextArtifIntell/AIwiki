Basic technologies from the 1970s and 1980s—processor architectures, memory designs, and network systems— expanded across commercial, educational, and social markets, driven by manufacturing processes that reduced the cost and increased the capacities of computing devices. If there is a radical nature to the 1990s, it can be found in the new modes of software engineering. The proponents of these modes suggested the then-current methods of software were insufficient to create software systems that fulfilled customer requirements, were free from errors, were delivered on time, and were completed within budget. With names such as Extreme Programming (or XP),3 Scrum,9 or Agile,1 they suggested that software development needed a disciplined athleticism, more focus, more energy, and more teamwork.},

This special issue seeks to shed light on foundations and key elements to be taken into account for AI adoption by public organizations. Governments are the primary enablers of technology and market stimulators and regulators of general activities in our society. Governments have always sought the common good and, therefore, the advancement of public and collective interests. This is key to understanding, as a first step, why the principles of public-sector organizations do not always match those of the private sector.

In “ReconViguRation: Reconfiguring Physical Keyboards in Virtual Reality,” Daniel Schneider and colleagues1 show that, in VR, physical keyboards can become much more than a device for entering characters. Their article, which also won the best paper award at IEEE ISMAR 2019, proposes that physical keyboards can be adapted for use in a variety of VR applications and interactions capable of taking advantage of their unique affordances (for example, dozens of unique keys, haptic feedback for both touching and depressing the keys, and broad familiarity to users). The key idea is that VR allows designers to magically change both the appearance and function of any physical object, including the keyboard.},

In computational and computer science, research software is a central asset for development activities. For good scientific practice, the resulting research software should be open source. Established open source software licenses provide sufficient options for granting permissions such that it should be the rare exception to keep research software closed. Proper engineering is required for obtaining reusable and sustainable research software. This way, software engineering methods may improve research in other disciplines. However, research in software engineering and computer science itself will also benefit when programs are reused.

But what about people who are not able to report their pain experience or whose expression of pain is hard to interpret? Examples include individuals suffering from dementia, patients developing delirium, and newborns. Techniques that provide a reliable assessment of pain experience are a prerequisite for effective pain therapy. Due to recent advances in the automated detection and analysis of behavioral cues, the question arises of whether these techniques may help assess pain-related states in a reliable manner. Physical pain is closely related to emotional states that may modulate the experience of pain and vice versa. Furthermore, principles and techniques from affective computing provide a solid basis for the automated analysis of pain-related states. Thus, it comes as no surprise that research on pain has increasingly attracted the interest of the affective computing community.},

They would be an obvious topic for a clear and well-organized article, such as the one written by Anil K. Jain, Jianchang Mao, and K.M. Mohiuddin. This article ranks number 30 on on the list of the most influential articles that have been published by Computer. It has 5,128 downloads and 740 citations. Yet, there are several surprises in the article that help us understand both its position in the body of knowledge and the role of Computer in building that body of knowledge. Perhaps the prominent surprise is that the article has never been cited by another article in Computer, the publication that brought it to the field.},

Companies use such components to address their product requirements for nondifferentiating functionalities while focusing their internal development efforts on core differentiating features. By extension, software supply chains consist of multiple supplier tiers that all feed into each other and thus accumulate open source software that eventually gets into companies that sell complex products, such as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).},

  abstract     = {Reports on cyberpandemics which share similarities with biological pandemics, and we all have a role to play in preventing both. Cyberpandemics are a massive disruption of computing service that triggers second- and third-order failures of computing and noncomputing systems worldwide. Consequences could include widespread failure or malfunctioning of critical infrastructure systems and the associated major societal damage. Perpetrators of cyberpandemics could include rogue governments (or elements therein), terrorist groups, corporations and consortia, malicious actors (of varied motivations), individuals, or even an accident (for example, a weaponized malware gone awry). As far as we know, a cyberpandemic has never been successfully perpetrated, but we all know that the weaponization of cyberspace is very real. A full potential of that is yet to occur. The conditions that could lead to a cyberpandemic are similar or analogous to those for a biological pandemic: human complexity, attack multiplicity, and delayed effects. In the cyber world, human complexity is represented by people “packed too tightly in cyberspace” and the resultant complex social interactions online. Attack multiplicity means that the attack involved multiple Cyberpandemics.},

It is ranked as the seventh most influential article published in Computer and presents an idea that is a foundation for software engineering. If this was the only article that Computer had ever published, we could honestly say the magazine had done a good job for our discipline. Yet, Boehm’s article is also classic in the sense that it comes from another world, one that did not have Java, Python, .net, or other development frameworks; no application programming interfaces (APIs); no virtual machines; and no Agile frameworks. It was published in 1988, a year that was closer to the founding conference of software engineering, the 1968 NATO Garmisch conference, than it is to our time. While it is possible to read this article as an elementary description of the spiral model, a key software engineering process, it is best read as an article that asks us to reconsider software engineering methods and think carefully about our current approach to software engineering problems.},

According to Wikipedia, “truth is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or standard.” According to dictionary.com, one definition of trust is “reliance on the integrity, strength, ability, surety, and so on of a person or thing; confidence.” And, fortunately, for this short editorial, “complexity” needs no official definition.

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {It is appropriate to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Alan Sokol&#39;s landmark discourse on the transformative hermeneutics of quantum gravity, but not for the reasons you might expect. Twenty-five years ago, physicist Alan Sokol wrote the article &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity,&quot; which was published in the journal Social Text. Although Sokol refers to the article as a parody, it was bogus, plain and simple. It subsequently became known as the Sokol hoax and has taken a place in history alongside eminently forgettable literary ruses such as Clifford Irving’s phony autobiography of Howard Hughes and a totally fabricated anti-Semitic rant called Protocols of the Elders of Zion that was published in the United States by Henry Ford in the 1920s. However, to equate the Sokol hoax with these others is a mistake of the first order. Sokol&#39;s was cerebral and enlightening for those who cared to invest the time to study and learn from it. While much has been made of the theatrics of the hoax, too little has been made of the majestic way it engendered its nonsense and contributed to the scholarship on intellectual entropy. In my view, this article remains a worthy assignment for college undergraduates of any major and at all levels; it is useful as a measure of student tolerance of nonsense, willingness to admit self-ignorance, understanding the pathology of deception, familiarity with basic logic, and most importantly the ability to appreciate irony. The bottom line is that Sokol&#39;s article can only be fully appreciated in the context of other social–psychological phenomena such as cognitive dissonance, right-wing authoritarianism, and partisan tribalism.},

I am only offering contextual background that places it in the broader academic, cultural, and political perspective required for understanding. It is only the most recent installment of a well-worn narrative: the controlling elite make their own rules and live by them, if they can get away with it. Unfortunately, some of the participants, who are either serving or facing jail time, didn’t know to not go into a gunfight with a sharp stick. Money alone is not enough to avoid prosecution for fraud: you need political clout. The best protection a defendant can have is a prosecutor who fears political reprisal. Compare how the Koch brothers escaped prosecution for stealing millions of oil dollars from Native American tribes1,2 with the fate of actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, who, at the time of this writing, face jail time for paying bribes to get their children into good universities.3,4 In the former case, the federal prosecutor who dared to empanel a grand jury to get at the truth was fired for cause, which put a quick end to the prosecution. In the latter case, the prosecutors pushed for jail terms and public admonishment with the zeal of Oliver Cromwell. There you have it: stealing oil from Native Americans versus trying to bribe your kids into a great university. Where is the greater crime? Admittedly, these actresses and their},
