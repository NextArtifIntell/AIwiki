  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate device-to-device (D2D) communication networks which are one of the key technologies for next-generation mobile communication networks and many other applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and Internet of things (IoT). The overlay D2D communication networks that are considered in our study use dedicated radio resources separate from what cellular networks use and there exists co-channel interference in D2D networks without cross-channel interference between two networks. We propose a new transmission scheme for overlay D2D networks that uses a dueling deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture. The DRL is especially effective in environments where actions do not affect subsequent states as in wireless communication networks. The main contribution of this paper is that the proposed architecture is designed to utilize only information that each D2D devices can easily obtain by measuring channels. The proposed scheme thus enables D2D devices to train their own neural networks and to decide autonomously whether to transmit data without any intervention from infrastructures. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of average sum-rates and is compared to three baseline schemes. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve almost optimal sum-rates with low signal-to-noise (SNR) values without any intervention from infrastructure.},

Without radar waveform constraints, the conventional optimal waveforms can result in large modulus variation and poor range resolution. To tackle these problems, the constant-modulus and/or similarity constraints are added in this work. The proposed constant-modulus waveform constraint is favoured by the cheap and efficient nonlinear power amplifier, and the proposed similarity constraint provides a flexible control on modulus variation, range resolution and transmit power, at the cost of a small extra computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) utilize a variety of onboard sensors to sense their surrounding environment. CAVs can improve their perception capabilities if vehicles exchange information about what they sense using V2X communications. This is known as cooperative or collective perception (or sensing). A frequent transmission of collective perception messages could improve the perception capabilities of CAVs. However, this improvement can be compromised if vehicles generate too many messages and saturate the communications channel. An important aspect is then when vehicles should generate the perception messages. ETSI has proposed the first set of message generation rules for collective perception. These rules define when vehicles should generate collective perception messages and what should be their content. We show that the current rules generate a high number of collective perception messages with information about a small number of detected objects. This results in an inefficient use of the communication channel that reduces the effectiveness of collective perception. We address this challenge and propose an improved algorithm that modifies the generation of collective perception messages. We demonstrate that the proposed solution improves the reliability of V2X communication and the perception of CAVs.},

Hence, we analyse the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the THz networks. The coverage probability is derived as well as the area spectral efficiency (ASE) and a pair of Line-of-sight (LoS)/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) probability models, namely the macrocell LoS/NLoS probability model and picocell LoS/NLoS probability model are adopted. Furthermore, the lower-bound of the network performance are derived via homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP) analysis, as well as the upper-bound. The simulation results match the analytical results well, which show that the coverage probability of the network first increases upon increasing the THz UAV BS density, and then decreases beyond the maximum. Given the severe path loss experienced by THz signals, a higher UAV density is required for a certain coverage probability than at lower carrier frequencies.},

Compared with the traditional centralized machine learning, FL uploads only model parameters rather than raw data during the learning process. Although distributed computing can lower down the information that needs to be uploaded, model updates in FL can still experience performance bottleneck, especially when training deep learning models in distributed networks. In this work, we investigate the performance of FL update at mobile edge devices that are connected to the parameter server (PS) with wireless links. Considering the spectrum limitation on the wireless fading channels, we further exploit non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) together with adaptive gradient quantization and sparsification to facilitate efficient uplink FL updates. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce FL aggregation latency but still achieve a comparable accuracy with benchmark schemes.},

To this end, we first characterize the statistical features of the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over the G2V and G2A links. Then, we define detection outage probability (DOP) and average detection capacity (ADC), and show their approximations.

In order to characterize spectrum-utilization law of the GEO and guide the access of the LEO users, we propose a deep learning based prediction model to generate the spectrum situation, termed as the convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM). Specifically, the historical spectrum occupancy data of the GEO are first preprocessed and then sent into the proposed CNN-BiLSTM model for prediction purposes. Moreover, due to the fact that a user of the GEO always occupies multi-channel, the proposed CNN-BiLSTM model may generate multiple predicted results concurrently. Thus, a fusing network is designed to effectively combine the multiple predicted results. Additionally, the conventional long short-term memory (LSTM), the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), the convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) models are also considered for comparison purposes. Performance evaluations show that the proposed CNN-BiLSTM outperforms the LSTM, the BiLSTM and the CNN-LSTM models in terms of both the accuracy and the mean absolute error of the spectrum prediction.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled NOMA networks with selective incremental relaying and imperfect channel state information (CSI). In particular, an access point transmits a superposed signal based on NOMA principle to an UAV terminal (UT) which can act as a relay to assist the information transmission for a ground terminal (GT). Different from the conventional relaying protocol requiring UT to relay the message all the time no matter how the received signal quality of two terminals are, we propose a novel NOMA-based selective incremental relaying protocol that allows relay to forward messages on the condition of the received signal with satisfied quality at UT and the unsatisfied quality signal at GT. The closed-form solutions of outage probabilities for the two terminals are characterized with the elevation angle-based path loss exponent and small-scale fading. Moreover, the benchmark schemes are provided to exhibit the superiority of the proposed protocol. Finally, simulation and theoretical results validate the correctness of the outage analysis, demonstrate the advantage of the proposed relaying protocol over its counterparts, and show that the stronger impact of channel estimation error on GT than UT in terms of outage probability.},

To this end, we jointly optimize the active transmit beamforming at the transmitters and passive reflective beamforming at the IRSs, subject to the constant modulus constraints of reflective beamforming vectors. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the transmit beamforming via second-order cone program (SOCP) and the reflective beamforming via the semi-definite relaxation (SDR).

However, some of the performance-limiting impairments in VLC include intersymbol interference (ISI), LED&#39;s nonlinearity, and multiplicative fading distortion due to user mobility, which present a significant gap between the promised and the achieved throughput of VLC based systems. To mitigate the aforementioned channel impairments, this paper proposes a random Fourier feature (RFF) based kernel minimum symbol error rate (KMSER) decision feedback equalizer (DFE) based post-distorter for VLC, which supports post distortion under finite memory budget. Furthermore, the feedforward, and feedback filter weights are jointly optimized by using a stronger minimum symbol error rate criterion as opposed to the conventional minimum mean square error criterion. Simulations indicate that the proposed RFF-KMSER-DFE based post-distorter exhibits superior BER performance and lower computational complexity over the existing dictionary based post-distorters. Lastly, an analytical bound for BER is derived for the proposed algorithm, and corroborated through simulations.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate the burden of the tele-traffic imposed by video streaming, Scalable Video Coding (SVC) is invoked for mapping the video clips to multiple layers, which allows us to improve the coverage quality. Although numerous non-orthogonal techniques have been conceived in the literature for maximizing the theoretical capacity relying on the idealized simplifying assumption of perfect channel coding. There is a paucity of practical finite-delay channel-coded solutions capable of mitigating the avalanche-like error proliferation routinely encountered in the face of hostile channels. Against this background, we propose SVC based Superposition Coding (SC) assisted video broadcasting, which curbs the error propagation introduced both by the inter-layer dependency and the Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) required by the superimposed signal. Specifically, we formulate an Objective Function (OF) based on the average video quality across the Base Station&#39;s (BS) coverage area and then determine the optimal power scaling coefficients of each video layer using a bespoke Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). Our solution strikes a compelling compromise between the best possible video service provided for the cell-centre and the cell-edge users. Explicitly, our simulation results show that the optimal-power SC system guarantees a better compromise than its Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and conventional QAM assisted counterparts, despite its reduced receiver complexity.},

To further improve the throughput of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based OFDM-IM (DFT-OFDM-IM), discrete cosine transform (DCT) based OFDM-IM (DCT-OFDM-IM) can be employed with double subcarriers given the same bandwidth. However, one of the main disadvantage of DCT-OFDM-IM is its lack of circular convolutional property over a dispersive channel. To address this issue, an enhanced DCT-OFDM-IM (EDCT-OFDM-IM) system has been proposed by introducing symmetric prefix and suffix at the transmitter and a pre-filter at the receiver leading to better performance than DFT-OFDM-IM in terms of bit error rate (BER). However, due to its special structure, it is difficult to derive the accurate average bit error probability (ABEP) upper bound, which is essential for the performance evaluation. In this paper, a tight ABEP upper bound is derived using the moment-generating-function (MGF). Our theoretical analysis is validated by simulation results and proven to be very accurate. Consequently the advantages of the EDCT-OFDM-IM system over the classic OFDM-IM system are further demonstrated analytically.},

The strong user is allocated the maximum power, whereas the weak user is allocated the minimum power. This power allocation alters the decoding sequence along with the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), at the users. The weak user benefits from receiving multiple copies of the signal whereas the strong user benefits from the higher power allocation. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme has a lower mutual outage probability (MOP) and offers better reliability as compared to the conventional power allocation scheme for CO-NOMA. An exact closed-form expression of MOP is derived for the two-user CO-NOMA system and it is shown that each user achieves full diversity. The proposed allocation is able to achieve approximately 30% higher transmission rate at 15 dB as compared to conventional CO-NOMA in a practical non-power balanced scenario.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have emerged as a promising technology of managing the radio signal propagation by relying on a large number of low-cost passive reflecting elements. In this letter, the optimal pilot power allocation required for accurate channel estimation of IRS-assisted communication systems is investigated. In contrast to conventional channel estimators, where pilot signals are usually designed to be constant-enveloped, we reconsider the pilot design to improve the passive beamforming performance thus resulting in an improved achievable rate. At first sight the result of our analysis appears counter-intuitive, suggesting that at a given total power, more power should be allocated to estimate low-gain channels, since the channel phase impairments are more severe than those of high-gain channels. Our simulation results show that when the number of IRS elements is 4, the rate improvement of our proposed channel estimation scheme over the conventional counterpart may be as high as &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$25\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .},

The pdf of the received signal is then utilized to design two different types of non-coherent detectors. The first detector directly uses the received signal to perform a hypothesis test. The second detector first estimates the channel based on the observed signal and then performs the hypothesis test. Test statistics and the optimal decision threshold of the detectors are derived. The energy detector is shown to be an approximation of the second detector. For cases where the reader is able to avoid or cancel the direct interference from the RF source (e.g., through successive interference cancellation), a third detector is given as a special case of the first detector. Numerical results show that the first detector outperforms the second detector, although the second detector is computationally simpler.},

In this paper, we investigate a drone network using a rotor UAV called a drone that can be hovered and easy to construct a network. On the other hand, it is expected that the distribution of communication terminals on the ground will be uneven because people concentrate in specific places such as evacuation centers in the actual disaster area. Traffic concentrates on specific drones covering the area where terrestrial terminals are dense, then throughput per terminal decreases. In order to solve this problem, we propose a method to control the height of drone according to the traffic and to select the transmission method by link adaptation, well-known in wireless LAN and cellular systems. By computer simulation, the average throughputs per ground terminal for the heights of the drones are shown quantitatively, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is clarified.},

Since the power consumption of a gyroscope is significantly larger than that of an accelerometer, to be energy-efficient, it is more preferable to use two gyro-free IMUs as alternatives. The existing gyro-free trajectory reconstruction approach is an angular velocity (i.e. $\omega$) -based method. The design of an $\omega$-free gyro-free approach remains as a research gap, which motivates this research work. In this paper, an $\omega$-free accelerometer pair (OFAP) method is proposed, which can yield a lower accumulated error, has a lower power consumption, is more scalable, and can deliver the same trajectory reconstruction performance as the existing approach.},

  abstract     = {Automatic transmissions are a core component of modern vehicles, and achieving good shift quality is critical to enhance the driving experience. In companies that manufacture transmissions, expert engineers take great care in calibrating parameters for controlling hydraulic pressure with the goal of achieving targeted shift quality. Because we need human experts to evaluate shift quality, it is hard to shorten the time taken to calibrate the systems controlling hydraulic pressure. In this paper, to reduce such development time, we propose a novel framework of a Classifier of Shift Quality; it applies the standard Supervised Deep Learning techniques (CSQ-SDL) to time-series measurement data. The framework consists of five procedures: measurement data collection, labeling by experts, data augmentation, data standardization, and the training of deep convolutional neural networks. Moreover, we also carry out driving experiments in which CSQ-SDL is used to assess the engagement of the lock-up clutch of a specific transmission model. By using raw time-series data measured by ordinary sensors in advance, and labels written later by an expert engineer looking at the raw data, we build binary classifiers and test their performance. It turns out that the accuracy of predicting expert&#39;s judgment is high; the area under the curve is 0.94. The result indicates that the proposed method is capable shortening product development times and thus meeting the demands of today&#39;s competitive automotive market.},

To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to utilize the intelligent, and feature extraction capability of the deep neural network (DNN) to learn the transmission patterns to demodulate the received signals. In our design, we propose to construct the long short-term memory (LSTM) unit-aided intelligent DNN-based deep learning (DL) demodulator for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-aided differential chaos shift keying (OFDM-DCSK) systems. After learning, and extracting features of information-bearing chaotic transmissions at the training stage, the received signals can be recovered efficiently, and reliably at the deployment stage. Thanks to the recursive LSTM-aided DL design, correlations between information-bearing chaotic modulated signals can be exploited to enhance reliability performances. Simulation results demonstrate with the proposed DL demodulation design, the intelligent OFDM-DCSK system can achieve more reliable performances over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, and fading channels compared with benchmark systems.},

To efficiently recover the communications, drone mounted base stations (DBSs) are deployed to relay data between the mobile users (MUs) in a DSA and working MBSs in the proximity of the DSA. However, a DBS may be deployed far away from a working MBS, thus limiting the backhaul link capacity between the DBS and the MBS. Also, the hovering time of current drones is limited, and thus caps the usage of DBSs. In order to increase the backhaul link capacity and prolong the hovering time of a DBS, we propose to apply free space optics to enable an MBS to simultaneously transmit data streams and energy to a DBS with high efficiency. The problem of jointly optimizing the DBS placement as well as the access link bandwidth allocation is formulated to maximize the hovering time of a DBS and guarantee the data rate requirements of the MUs. The joint bandwidth allocation DBS placement (TWIST) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The performance of TWIST is demonstrated through simulations.},

  abstract     = {The latest developments in terms of self-driving technologies have increased the demand for high quality data transmission in vehicular networks. However, frequent handovers among the Road Side Units (RSUs) cause degradation of data transmission performance, especially in the context of high-speed mobility. In order to address this problem, a novel game-enhanced compensation handover scheme (GCH-MV) for multipath TCP in 6G software defined vehicular networks is proposed. An innovative system architecture which integrates 6G communication solutions, SDN and multipath techniques is presented. GCH-MV redesigns the fluid model of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) to compensate for the declining throughput by using multiple paths. GCH-MV transfers traffic quickly between different paths, adapting the transmission to path quality and maintain high throughput. In addition, an innovative game-based optimal candidate RSU selection algorithm, employed by GCH-MV during the handover process, is also introduced. GCH-MV uses these solutions to achieve its goal to mitigate the negative impact of handover as much as possible and make the handover process smooth and transparent. Experimental results show how GCH-MV outperforms the existing solutions in terms of several quality of service (QoS) metrics, addressing efficiently the data transfer quality problem during handover in highly mobile vehicular networks.},

Some preliminary studies on cross-layer BP/LTP data block size in space vehicle communications have been done. However, the effect of data losses on the block has been ignored. Data loss caused by lossy space channels is one of the key features that characterize space vehicle communications, and therefore its effect cannot be left out. In this article, the cross-layer BP/LTP block size in space vehicle communications is studied with focus on its characterization and performance over lossy space channels. An analytical model is presented for calculating the minimum number of bundles that should be aggregated within an LTP block for transmission over a lossy channel so that the report segment (RS) delay imposed by highly asymmetric channel rates can be resolved. The model is validated by realistic file transfer experiments over an experimental testbed infrastructure and packet-level analysis of the results. The transmission performance of LTP with respect to variations of the aggregated block size, channel date rate and channel loss rate are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Reducing the number of road accidents is a key agenda item for governments across the world. This has led to an increase in the amount of attention given to Vehicular Communication Systems (VCS), which are seen as an important technology that can offer significant improvements in road safety. Using VCS, vehicles can form a dynamic self-configuring network that enables a vehicle to communicate with other vehicles (V2V) and roadside infrastructure (V2I). However, such wireless communication channels are vulnerable to attacks, and therefore an authentication scheme for communications should be designed before the deployment. Prior work has focused on utilising digital signature approaches to achieve the security requirements, but due to the special characteristics of VCS, such approaches are not well suited for safety related applications of VCS, since they incur high communication and computation overheads. To combat this issue, we propose a certificateless and lightweight authentication scheme to provide means of secure communications for VCS. In this work we introduce authentication tokens, which replace digital certificates to reduce the burden of certificate management on a Trusted Authority (TA). In addition, the utilisation of tokens ensures that mutual authentication is achieved for V2I communication. Moreover, we employ TESLA as the underlying broadcast authentication protocol to achieve the required security goals for safety message broadcasting. According to the security analysis and extensive simulation of our scheme, the results show that it can withstands various types of attacks. Also it has better performance in term of verification delay, scalability and communication overhead compared to lightweight authentication schemes that are based on similar techniques. Therefore, the scheme is well suited for VCS},

  abstract     = {To satisfy the increasing demands of cellular traffic, cooperative content caching at the network edge (e.g., User Equipment) has become a promising paradigm in the next-generation cellular networks. Device-to-Device (D2D) communications can improve the content caching and fetching performance without deploying additional infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate the joint optimization of cooperative caching and fetching in dynamic D2D environment for minimizing the overall content fetching delay. We formulate it as a decentralized partially observable Markov game for finding the optimal policies at agents. To address this problem, we propose a Fully Decentralized Soft Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (FDS-MARL) algorithm, which extends the soft actor-critic framework to non-stationary multi-agent environment for fully decentralized learning and it contains the following major design components: Graph Attention Network based self-attention for cooperative inter-agent coordination, a consensus communication mechanism for effectively reducing the information loss and non-stationarity of the environment while keeping gradual global consensus, and an influence based transmission scheduling mechanism for effective credit assignment and also alleviation of potential transmission contentions among agents. Simulation results show that FDS-MARL can improve the content caching and fetching performance significantly compared with the representative work in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The coupling of packet forwarding, Internet gateway (IGW) selection, and vehicle mobility in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) presents challenges for multi-hop routing. Particularly, IGWs and vehicles near IGWs are most likely to be congested, since all the Internet traffic loads converge at IGWs in IoV. To this end, we propose a distance-weighted back-pressure dynamic routing (DBDR), which prioritizes the vehicles that are close to the destination and have a large backlog differential of buffer queues to provide dynamic hop-by-hop forwarding. DBDR is also jointly designed with multi-hop IGW discovery and vehicle mobility management to implement both uplink and downlink forwarding for Internet services. Our analysis using Lyapunov drift theory proves that DBDR achieves the network stability on the buffer queues and the network capacity. Simulations in a practical road scenario using NS-2 and VanetMobiSim show that DBDR outperforms the existing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, and success rate of HTTP requests/responses, as well as average packet delay when the network becomes congested.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular fog computing (VFC) has been expected as a promising scheme that can increase the computational capability of vehicles without relying on servers. Comparing with accessing the remote cloud, VFC is suitable for delay-sensitive tasks because of its low-latency vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) transmission. However, due to the dynamic vehicular environment, how to motivate vehicles to share their idle computing resource while simultaneously evaluating the service availability of vehicles in terms of vehicle mobility and vehicular computational capability in heterogeneous vehicular networks is a main challenge. Meanwhile, tasks with different priorities of a vehicle should be processed with different efficiencies. In this work, we propose a task offloading scheme in the context of VFC, where vehicles are incentivized to share their idle computing resource by dynamic pricing, which comprehensively considers the mobility of vehicles, the task priority, and the service availability of vehicles. Given that the policy of task offloading depends on the state of the dynamic vehicular environment, we formulate the task offloading problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) aiming at maximizing the mean latency-aware utility of tasks in a period. To solve this problem, we develop a soft actor-critic (SAC) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for the sake of maximizing both the expected reward and the entropy of policy. Finally, extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed scheme benchmarked with traditional algorithms.},

Although simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can construct a geometrically surrounding map, the map contains little semantic information. This paper presents a novel stereo visual-inertial system with loop closure detection based on a semantic-topological map framework. In our system, a hybrid 3D point cloud semantic-topological mapping framework is used to realize autonomous navigation simply by providing a map for path planning and meanwhile for storing semantic information under a dynamic environment. A stereo visual-inertial system can obtain more accurate visual-inertial odometry than a monocular system, and a visual-inertial system is capable of real-time map correction when the localization module detects a loop closure. This paper adopts state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN components to obtain 2D semantic information and project it to a semi-dense 3D semantic-topological map built by stereo visual-inertial SLAM. We perform experimental evaluation of our proposed system on the EuRoC MAV datasets and we also compare it with other competitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective than the other competitive methods.},

With the imbalanced distribution and fast moving AVs contending intensely for computing services, how to efficiently exploit cooperations among participants in 5G HetNets to improve the service performance is therefore challenging. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic scheme for collaborative vehicular task offloading to facilitate the computing services in 5G HetNets. Specifically, we propose a two-stage vehicular task offloading mechanism to promote the cooperation among participants with the target of improving the task completion rate and the utilities of the participants, where the mechanism jointly considers the network architecture of the HetNets, the imbalanced distribution of AVs and the reuse of task results. In the first stage, an auction model is designed to help the MCBS select the optimal SCBS to execute the offloaded task based on the requirement of the task and the available computing resources of SCBSs. According to the task execution cost declared by the selected SCBS, the MCBS then bargains with the AV for the agreement of the task offloading service to maximize their utilities in the second stage. Using simulations, we show that the proposed collaborative task offloading scheme can achieve a higher task completion rate for the task offloading service and bring higher utilities to all participants than conventional schemes.},

  abstract     = {User-centric (UC) clustering has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the connectivity of mobile users by grouping an appropriate number of access points (APs), thus paving the way for seamlessly connected vehicular networks. However, for a high-velocity vehicular user, UC clustering may lead to overly frequent handovers (HOs), which increases the risk of throughput-reduction, call dropping and energy wastage. To mitigate this problem, we aim for reducing the HO overhead imposed on the heterogeneous UC (HUC) cluster migration process of vehicular networks. Specifically, we first conceive a novel hybrid HUC cluster migration strategy that adaptively switches between horizontal and vertical HOs for supporting both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Then, a dynamic decision-making problem is formulated for balancing the benefits of HUC cluster migration and the total HO overhead, subject to realistic HUC clustering constraints. In the face of unknown vehicular mobility, we propose a sequential HUC cluster migration solution based on max-bipartite matching theory imposing a low complexity. As a design alternative, we also propose a holistic solution relying on model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Finally, our numerical results reveal the superiority of the proposed cluster migration design in terms of striking a compelling trade-off between the per-user average data rate (PAR) and the number of HOs in different scenarios.},

In addition, GPS-based dissemination protocols encounter many challenges due to high-energy consumption, low accuracy, and the need for up-to-date maps for real-world automatic applications. In this paper, a Route Segmented Broadcast Protocol based on Radio Frequency identification technology (RSBP-RF) is proposed to eliminate GPS-based problems and increase the efficiency of emergency message broadcasting by improving the positioning accuracy. In this protocol, embedded passive RFID tags are used to segment the route and provide a position-aware technique. In RSBP-RF, each vehicle is informed of its position by crossing on the tags and immediately broadcasts a beacon to its neighbors. Moreover, the proposed protocol includes a proactive relay vehicle selection scheme that uses the received beacons to select the farthest neighboring node. The results of the conducted simulations in the NS-3 tool have validated the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in terms of end-to-end delay, delivery ratio, one-hop delay, collision ratio, relay node selection accuracy, and dissemination performance. Moreover, analysis of the time complexity and message complexity proves the lightness of the RSBP-RF protocol.},

Exploiting these benefits, we investigate the joint task offloading and resource allocation problem for MEC in NOMA-based HetNets. To minimize the energyconsumption of all users, we jointly consider task offloading decision, local CPU frequency scheduling, power control, computation resource and subchannel resource allocation. The optimization problem is challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the offloading decision and its strong coupling with the resource allocation. We thus decouple the problem into two sub-problems of offloading decision and resource allocation, and propose an efficient approach to find the joint solution by solving these two sub-problems iteratively. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve a near optimal performance, and outperform other benchmark approaches in terms of saving energy consumption of all users with an acceptable complexity.},

However, the computing capacity of a single vehicle is limited. For the fast velocity and distribution characteristics of vehicles, when a vehicle performs task offloading to a set of neighbor vehicles, longer sensing/accessing time durations are needed. Vehicle platoon driving as an emerging technique is proposed to strengthen vehicle fuel efficiency and the freeway safety and capacity. The distributed computation resources can be centrally controlled in the vehicle platoon. In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation scheme for edge computing-based vehicle platoon on freeway to maximize the utilities of vehicles surrounding the platoon via a contract-optimization approach. Combining with BS, the vehicle platoon performs as an edge node to provide the delay-sensitive computation service for the vehicles on road. First, we design a contract-based incentive mechanism to motivate vehicles to form a vehicle platoon and share their computation resources. Then, based on the proposed vehicle platoon, a joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the utilities of vehicles, the task offloading decision, communication and computation resource allocation schemes in both the platoon and BS are jointly optimized. Numerical results reveal that the designed contracts can incentivize vehicle&#39;s participation, and the proposed resource allocation schemes are effective.},

While existing literature depends on offloading schemes based on centralized systems, DEFT provides near real-time computation offloading in a fog-enabled IoV using a two-level game-theoretic approach. Further, this approach allows the UEs to make their own decisions in a dynamic environment. In the first level, FNs play an Oligopoly game for determining the price of their services based on their computation capability and then broadcast the price to the UEs. Further, based on the price transmitted by the FNs, UEs play a non-cooperative Stackelberg game to map the offloading among the user and fog layer. We also ensure that no UE consumes all of the resources in an FN. Additionally, we prove our objective function&#39;s convexity and show that the proposed game always attains the Nash Equilibrium. Through extensive real-world emulations, we observe that DEFT minimizes the latency and power consumption, and improves throughput compared to the existing schemes. In the presence of 40, 80, and 120 UEs, the overhead for computation in the fog layer is minimized by &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$70-75$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; % compared to the local computation overhead.},

However, the VCG mechanism has high computational complexity, which makes it infeasible for practical implementation. In this work, we propose sealed bid auction mechanisms for spectrum allocation, which are computationally tractable. These can be used for spectrum allocation by performing auctions at shorter intervals to cater to the dynamic load variation in the network. We establish that the proposed algorithm is strategy-proof for the uniform demand scenario. Furthermore, for non-uniform demand, we propose an algorithm that satisfies weak strategy-proofness. Here, we also consider non-linear increase in the marginal valuations with demand. Simulation results are also presented to exhibit the performance comparison of the proposed algorithms with VCG and other existing mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {SDN is a key-enabler to achieve scalability in 5G and Multi-access Edge Computing networks. To balance the load between distributed SDN controllers, the migration of the data plane components has been proposed. Different from most previous works which use reactive mechanisms, we propose to preemptively balance the load in the SDN control plane to support network flows that require low latency communications. First, we forecast the load of SDN controllers to prevent load imbalances and schedule data plane migrations in advance. Second, we optimize the migration operations to achieve better load balancing under delay constraints. Specifically, in the first step, we construct two prediction models based on Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approaches to forecast SDN controllers load. Then, we conduct a comparative study between these two models and calculate their accuracies and forecast errors. The results show that, in long-term predictions, the accuracy of LSTM model outperforms that of ARIMA by 55% in terms of prediction errors. In the second step, to select which data plane components to migrate and where the migration should happen under delay constraints, we formulate the problem as a non-linear binary program, prove its NP-completeness and propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to solve it. The simulations show that the proposed algorithm performs close to optimal and outperforms recent benchmark algorithms from the literature.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring data confidentiality in a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an increasingly important issue. Message confidentiality, user privacy and access control are the most important problems that affect services provided by VANETs. However, access control that addresses data downloads while preserving users&#39; privacy remains an open problem. Based on a set of attributes, the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) algorithm proposes a party data encryption/decryption mechanism for shared data; consequently, the algorithm has become a popular solution for data-sharing access control. However, the current CP-ABE schemes are still infeasible for VANETs because these schemes use a single authority and inefficient encryption/decryption and ignore revocation mechanisms. Here, over CP-ABE with revocation, we introduce an identity-based scheme that achieves secure data sharing in VANETs. To reduce the computation load for in-vehicle on-board units (OBUs), we outsource computationally intensive encryption and decryption operations to cloud compute nodes. Attributes are decentralized and managed by application service providers that provide services to vehicles based on subscriptions. Comprehensive experimental results and security analysis show that our scheme achieves fine-grained access control while preserving user privacy. Through implementation, performance analysis demonstrates that our scheme is suitable for VANETs.},

However, some well-localized agents may not be willing to sacrifice additional power to improve the others&#39; localization accuracy. This paper proposes an incentive mechanism from an economic perspective for cooperative localization, whereby a pricing scheme is designed to lead each agent to the optimal state. A game-theoretic algorithm is proposed where each player (agent) can obtain the optimal budget strategy to minimize its individual utility. To make profits in the game, the relationship between the agent&#39;s network condition and its budget strategy is derived. Furthermore, a fairness-aware price allocation rule (PAR) is developed to distribute the budget among the reference agents proportional to each node&#39;s contribution. Analytical and numerical results show that agents with better network conditions are more likely to join the cooperation under the proposed incentive mechanism, leading to an improved localization performance.},

By exchanging information among vehicles through communication networks, vehicle platooning can significantly improve traffic safety and efficiency. In this paper, we develop a joint systematic design of platoon communication and control to reduce position errors of consecutive vehicles and to improve platoon safety. Through separate information dissemination of the platoon leader and followers, we improve the success probability of the platoon leader&#39;s information dissemination. To extend the communication range of the platoon leader and also the platoon scale, we propose to use relays to forward the platoon leader&#39;s messages. Further, an adaptive distributed model predictive control (DMPC) based controller is presented, which can adjust its control parameters according to platoon state and dynamic information sources. Simulation results not only verify the proposed systematic design in terms of position errors, but also show that our scheme performs well in vehicle failure cases where collisions can be avoided and platoon safety improved.},

  abstract     = {Both Device-to-device (D2D) and full-duplex (FD) have been widely recognized as spectrum efficient techniques in the fifth-generation (5G) networks. By combining them, the FD-D2D aided underlaying networks (FN) has exhibited considerable technical advantages in terms of both spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Considering the fact that the performance of FN may be severely affected by users’ workload, the workload-driven FN (WFN) must be investigated. In this paper, a deep learning based transmit power allocation (TPA) method is proposed for automatically determining the optimal transmit powers of co-spectrum cellular users (CUs) and D2D users (DUs) relying on a deep neural network. Unlike the conventional transmit-power-control schemes, in which complex optimization problems must be addressed in an iterative manner (it usually requires a relative longer computational time), the proposed scheme enables each DU to determine its transmit power with a relatively shorter time. Furthermore, an improved iterative subspace-pursuit algorithm, as the performance benchmark, is formulated for WFN. In addition, to reflect the influence imposed by the workload, the penalty-based statistical sum-date-rate (PSS) can be employed as the performance metric of WFN. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme is capable of achieving a PSS comparable with that of the traditional iterative-based algorithms even under heavy-workload scenarios, but the computational complexity of the former can be significantly reduced.},

There are some critical issues for the consensus of large-scale drone swarms, such as limited-time convergence and high robustness against drone failure due to stringent requirements of mission cycle and hostile environment. Note that traditional consensus cannot guarantee limited-time convergence and a robust consensus against node failure. Existing finite-time consensus faces challenges of strict prerequisites and high complexity. Moreover, leaderless and leader-follower consensus adopts different models respectively. Toward these ends, a unified consensus model for both leaderless and leader-follower modes is proposed. It achieves limited-time convergence by using distributed energy minimization. A dynamic spanning tree algorithm is designed to ensure consensus under dynamic topology. Furthermore, a robust method against node failure is proposed by combining grey prediction, average consensus, and Molly-Reed criterion. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can be adopted in both leaderless and leader-follower situations with advantages of limited-time convergence and high robustness.},

  abstract     = {The localization and tracking of underwater objects have many applications. In a proactive underwater sensor array, some nodes will periodically broadcast linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals, which will hit the targets, get reflected and received by the other nodes. Depending on the target&#39;s position and velocity, the received signals will also be LFM signals of different frequencies and frequency rates. We can use the Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) to analyze the received signal&#39;s spectrum and find the peak. Based on the location of the peak, the target&#39;s distance and radial velocity can be estimated. However, the accuracy is highly dependent on the sampling interval of the spectrum. Smaller sampling interval leads to higher accuracy but also induces considerable complexity. To overcome this issue, we propose a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect the existence of the target, and roughly estimate the peak&#39;s location if targets exist. Then over-sampling can be conducted for a small area around the peak, leading to improved accuracy and reduced complexity. The idea is based on the following observation: if a target exists, we will be able to observe an “X” pattern on the spectrum. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.},

However, high-speed mobile terminals have posed challenges to key management in Vehicle Ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Besides, to maintain the integrity of the shared data, the computation and communication overheads must be increased in the revocation process when a vehicle user is removed from a group. For such, a new shared data auditing scheme is proposed in this paper, which supports user revocation by combining the existing certificateless signcryption method with a fog architecture. This scheme improves the efficiency of auditing and user revocation since it reduces many time-consuming operations, as well as features such as public auditing, mutual authentication, efficient and secure revocation are presented.

The SD uses the chosen WAP as the communication relay between the MEC server and itself. Aimed to minimize the total energy consumption of the system and satisfy the SDs demand on delay, we jointly optimize relay selection and resource allocation in D2D-enabled MEC system. The problem is formulated as an integer-mixed non-convex optimization problem which is a NP-hard problem. We thus propose a two-phase optimization algorithm that jointly optimizes relay selection policy and resource allocation strategy. In first phase, the original problem is converted into a convex optimization problem by using convex optimization techniques, and the optimal relay selection policy can be achieved by solving the relay selection problem. After obtaining the relay selection policy, the original problem is transformed into a resource allocation problem solved by leveraging the Lagrange Method in the second phase. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is a low-complexity algorithm which is associated with the root finding method. The optimal relay selection policy and resource allocation strategy can be found in polynomial time. The extensive simulation results are provided to indicate that the D2D-enabled MEC system achieves remarkable results in energy saving. Compared with other baseline methods, our proposed algorithm can not only achieve the optimal solution with less time cost, but also improve the energy efficiency and network capacity.},

  abstract     = {Air quality, especially particulate matter, has recently attracted a lot of attention from governments, industry, and academia, motivating the use of denser air quality monitoring networks based on low-cost sensing strategies. However, low-cost sensors are frequently sensitive to aging, environmental conditions, and pollutant cross-sensitivities. These issues have been only partially addressed, limiting their usage. In this study, we develop a low-cost particulate matter monitoring system based on special-purpose acquisition boards, deployed for monitoring air quality on both stationary and mobile sensor platforms. We explore the influence of all model variables, the quality of different calibration strategies, the accuracy across different concentration ranges, and the usefulness of redundant sensors placed in each station. The collected sensor data amounts to about 50GB of data, gathered in six months during the winter season. Tests of statically immovable stations include an analysis of accuracy and sensors’ reliability made by comparing our results with more accurate and expensive standard &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\beta$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -radiation sensors. Tests on mobile stations have been designed to analyze the reactivity of our system to unexpected and abrupt events. These experiments embrace traffic analysis, pollution investigation using different means of transport and pollution analysis during peculiar events. With respect to other approaches, our methodology has been proved to be extremely easy to calibrate, to offer a very high sample rate (one sample per second), and to be based on an open-source software architecture. Database and software are available as open source in [1] .},

However, due to the limitations of traditional network architecture, resource scheduling in wireless network environment is still facing great challenges. We focus on the urgent need of users for bandwidth resources in the IoV scenario under virtual network environment. This paper proposes a bandwidth aware multi domain virtual network embedding (BA-VNE) algorithm. The algorithm is mainly aimed at the problem that users need a lot of bandwidth in wireless communication mode, and solves the problem of bandwidth resource allocation from the perspective of virtual network embedding (VNE). In order to improve the performance of the algorithm, we introduce particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the performance of the algorithm. In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, we have carried out simulation experiments from link bandwidth, mapping cost and virtual network request (VNR) acceptance rate. The final results show that the proposed algorithm is better than other representative algorithms in the above indicators.},

  abstract     = {Platooning is a critical technology to realize autonomous driving. Each vehicle in platoons adopts the IEEE 802.11p standard to exchange information through communications to maintain the string stability of platoons. However, one vehicle in platoons inevitably suffers from a disturbance resulting from the leader vehicle acceleration/deceleration, wind gust and uncertainties in a platoon control system, i.e., aerodynamics drag and rolling resistance moment etc. Disturbances acting on one vehicle may inevitably affect the following vehicles and cause that the spacing error is propagated or even amplified downstream along the platoon, i.e., platoon string instability. In this case, the connectivity among vehicles is dynamic, resulting in the performance of 802.11p in terms of packet delay and packet delivery ratio being time-varying. The effect of the string instability would be further deteriorated once the time-varying performance of 802.11p cannot satisfy the basic communication requirement. Unlike the existing works which only analyze the steady performance of 802.11p in vehicular networks, we will focus on the impact of disturbance and construct models to analyze the time-dependent performance of 802.11p-based platooning communications. The effectiveness of the models is validated through simulation results. Moreover, the time-dependent performance of 802.11p is analyzed through numerical results and it is validated that 802.11p is able to satisfy the communication requirement under disturbance.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing has been regarded as a new paradigm to achieve mobile computation offloading (MCO), which enables resource-limited mobile devices (MDs) to offload part or all of computation-intensive applications to more powerful computing entities. In this work we study MCO for data partitioned oriented applications. This type of services are usually delay-elastic, but shorter processing delay helps improve the user experience. We consider energy consumption of MDs and latency fairness of the applications. The latency fairness is achieved by allowing multiple offloading MDs to share one channel and allocating a fraction of the channel time for each application, and minimizing total energy consumption of the MDs is achieved by jointly optimizing the offloading ratio, channel assignments, and channel time allocations. For a special case that assigns at most one MD to each channel, a closed-form offloading ratio is derived and optimal channel assignment is obtained through transforming the problem into a weighted bipartite matching. The general problem is then solved by embedding the branch-and-bound iterations with successive convex approximation that solves a series of geometric programming problems. To reduce the complexity, a two-layer recursive method is then proposed that finds the channel assignments, offloading ratio and channel time allocation for each MD. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve low energy consumption and high latency fairness; and much lower energy consumption can be achieved with a slight decrease in latency fairness.},

  abstract     = {Network slicing (NS) has been widely identified as a key architectural technology for 5G-and-beyond systems by supporting divergent requirements in a sustainable way. In radio access network (RAN) slicing, due to the device-base station (BS)-NS three layer association relationship, device association (including access control and handoff management) becomes an essential yet challenging issue. With the increasing concerns on stringent data security and device privacy, exploiting local resources to solve device association problem while enforcing data security and device privacy becomes attractive. Fortunately, recently emerging federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm with data protection, provides an effective tool to address this type of issues in mobile networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient device association scheme for RAN slicing by exploiting a hybrid FL reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework, with the aim to improve network throughput while reducing handoff cost. In our proposed framework, individual smart devices train a local machine learning model based on local data and then send the model features to the serving BS/encrypted party for aggregation, so as to efficiently reduce bandwidth consumption for learning while enforcing data privacy. Specifically, we use deep reinforcement learning to train the local model on smart devices under a hybrid FL framework, where horizontal FL is employed for parameter aggregation on BS, while vertical FL is employed for NS/BS pair selection aggregation on the encrypted party. Numerical results show that the proposed HDRL scheme can achieve significant performance gain in terms of network throughput and communication efficiency in comparison with some state-of-the-art solutions.},

In this paper, we consider to co-deploy the edge servers and energy storage at micro Base Station (BS) in each edge sub-network. In the considered scenario, we first determine the number of edge servers and energy storage units at different sub-edge networks in a long-term period. Then, we jointly design the offloading and demand response policies for all micro BSs in a centralized manner. Considering the variabilities of renewable energy and computation/energy demands, the system cost is minimized while meeting the energy demand-supply balance and renewable portfolio standards. Furthermore, a distributed optimization problem is formulated to find the optimal offloading parameters, the amount of charging/discharging energy and utilized renewable energy of the micro BS without handing over all operational information. Numerical results show that the proposed deployment and policies can provide effective offloading and energy saving strategies for the proposed mobile edge network.},

  abstract     = {The technical challenges, e.g. the mobility management and the offloading process, hinder the conventional cellular systems to meet the huge data traffic requirements of the next generation mobile communications. The traditional system (e.g dual-connectivity (DC)) has been proposed to improve the mobility management, however, it will inherit the big trade-off in the offloading process between the energy consumption for the small cell (SC) discovery (SCD) process and the efficiency of utilizing the system resources (e.g. frequency and signaling). In this paper, we present a framework to model the potential offloading opportunities as well as the offloading loss when a typical user equipment (UE) performs the inter-frequency (IRF) scan periodically. The proposed framework also studies the impact of the SCD on the energy efficiency. To improve the system performance and reduce the power consumption at the UEs, a new scheme, trio-connectivity (TC), is proposed in this paper to tackle the aforementioned challenges. The TC includes three planes: control-plane (C-plane), user-plane (U-plane) and indication-plane (I-plane). The I-plane works as an indicator to help the UE to identify and discover the SCs in the system prior to offloading. The role of the I-plane is to keep the SCD on one frequency channel regardless of the number of frequency channels in the system. In the proposed offloading mechanism, some of the energy consumption is transferred from the UE to the network. By using the proposed framework, UE energy efficiency and system energy efficiency as well as the total energy consumption are derived as performance metrics to compare between the TC and the DC. The results show that the TC can outperform the DC in dense cellular systems.},

However, the prevalence of the vehicular local advertising has raised increasing transparency and accountability concerns on the spatial keyword query process, such as why a vehicular user receives advertisements from specific spatial entities as well as the timely detection of the advertising misbehavior. In this paper, we develop a transparent and accountable vehicular local advertising system by utilizing the tamper-proof and open nature of the blockchain technology. Considering the large scale of the spatial-keyword database and the expensive computation and storage cost on the blockchain, we introduce two design strategies, digest-and-verify and divide-then-assemble . In specific, a large-scale spatial keyword database is digested and stored on the blockchain. The spatial keyword query is then conducted with modular executions of two off-chain spatial keyword query functions, the results of which are efficiently assembled and verified in an advertising smart contract. By doing so, expensive on-chain computation and storage overheads are significantly reduced at a cost of acceptable off-chain overheads. We define the security requirements of the vehicular local advertising system as Auditing Security and achieve the notion with the security analysis. We also conduct real-world experiments to show the efficiency of the blockchain-based vehicular local advertising system.},

The relay applies a time-switching (TS) policy to switch between data decoding (DD) and energy harvesting (EH) modes. Due to the presence of data queues at the relay, the relay is capable of employing opportunistic network coding (ONC) for transmission of the packets. Based on some realistic assumptions, we derive the stability region of such a network through designing TS and ONC policies. It is proved that the stability region is characterized by the TS policy and zero-wait ONC policy. Moreover, we derive the throughput-optimal and power-optimal policies and show that these policies provide the maximum coding opportunities. Also, we derive the average delay of an applied TS-ONC policy at the relay through modeling the data queues and energy buffer of the relay by two inter-related quasi-birth-death processes. We show that although waiting in ONC does not contribute to throughput-optimal and power-optimal policies, it can reduce the average delay.

Additionally, the I2V communications can be combined with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity owing to the small area covered by road side units (RSUs). However, dozens of vehicles have to compete for limited bandwidth when they request service simultaneously in the covered area. In this paper, we propose a joint scheduling and power control scheme for I2V and V2V links in the RSUs&#39; coverage range. Mapping the I2V and V2V links to tuple-links, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem where frequency scheduler and power controller for those tuple-links are jointly designed. Then, we employ the delayed column generation technique and the transmission pattern definition to decompose the MINLP problem into a transmission pattern scheduling problem, as well as a power control problem. Therein, the transmission pattern scheduling problem is solved by linear programming while a greedy power control algorithm is developed. Simulation results with practical parameter settings show that our proposed scheme outperforms several conventional schemes in terms of service disruption and achieved throughput while maintaining throughput fairness among the requesting vehicles. In particular, a high channel number, a small power level number, and a large buffer size at the requesting vehicles are shown to be helpful for our proposed scheme.},

However, very few results currently exist for the localization of spoofing attackers, which is crucial to counteract GPS attacks. In this paper we propose leveraging vehicle-to-vehicle communications to detect and localize spoofing attacks on vehicular navigation GPS. The key idea is to correlate Doppler shift measurements which are reported by most commercial GPS receivers. The approach does not need additional dedicated devices and is easily deployable on modern vehicles equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication devices. It is capable of localizing both stationary spoofers and mobile spoofers which, for example, could be mounted on a vehicle. Both numerical simulations and experimental tests are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

According to the recommendation system, all users&#39; predictive score for all videos can be calculated, which results that users&#39; most interesting video files rather than popular video files as previous work can be obtained, and cached in advance to improve the hitting probability. Furthermore, an optimal video segmentation scheme, and an optimal video library segmentation scheme are developed to minimize the transmission delay, and maximize the hitting probability respectively. Simulation results show that compared with other traditional caching schemes, the proposed RCC scheme can reach about 70% reduction in outage probability, 40% reduction in system latency, and 10% improvement in hitting probability, all of which can achieve the best performance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new integrated tripolar pad using double-sided LCC compensation is proposed and then based on the circuit characteristic, which is analyzed in detail, the introduced system is simulated and investigated. The tripolar pad utilizes three decoupled coils and shows a promising tolerance against rotational displacements and consequently provides a convenience for the user to park the vehicle. Due to compensator coils, the double-sided method of compensation is more massive than the other methods. Here, the authors offer a scheme to make the wireless power transfer system more compact by integrating the compensation inductors with the main couplers. In order to locate the best place to embed the compensator coils, the flux density between the couplers is analyzed. Additionally, it is shown that since the pad is composed of multiple coils, there are some undesired mutual inductances that should be designed for the least possible values. The behaviors of the proposed pad are analyzed and thoroughly discussed based on four different displacements. In order to validate the theoretical results, a 500 W wireless power transfer is fabricated and tested at 85 kHz for the proposed double-sided LCC compensation. The simulation and experimental results show the performance of the proposed structure.},

On another hand, analog beamforming can not provide enough system coverage in realistic user distribution scenarios. In this paper, we justify the choice of the hybrid multi-beamforming structure for some realistic user distributions. Such a structure guarantees enough coverage with minimal power consumption. For this structure, we propose a new spatial resource allocation intended to minimize handovers and to simplify the calculation of the time user spends inside each satellite beam spot.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a linear complexity iterative rake detector for the recently proposed orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme. The basic idea is to extract and coherently combine the received multipath components of the transmitted symbols in the delay-Doppler grid using maximal ratio combining (MRC) to improve the SNR of the combined signal. We reformulate the OTFS input-output relation in simple vector form by placing guard null symbols or zero padding (ZP) in the delay-Doppler grid and exploiting the resulting circulant property of the blocks of the channel matrix. Using this vector input-output relation we propose a low complexity iterative decision feedback equalizer (DFE) based on MRC. The performance and complexity of the proposed detector favorably compares with the state of the art message passing detector. An alternative time domain MRC based detector is also proposed for even faster detection. We further propose a Gauss-Seidel based over-relaxation parameter in the rake detector to improve the performance and the convergence speed of the iterative detection. We also show how the MRC detector can be combined with outer error-correcting codes to operate as a turbo DFE scheme to further improve the error performance. All results are compared with a baseline orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme employing a single tap minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer.},

However, it is still a challenge to reduce interference and improve energy efficiency (EE) of UAVs. In this paper, we investigate a downlink power control problem to maximize the EE in an ultra-dense UAV network. Firstly, the power control problem is formulated as a discrete mean field game (MFG) to imitate the interactions among a large number of UAVs, and then the MFG framework is transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP) to obtain the equilibrium solution of the MFG due to the dense deployment of UAVs. Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning-based MFG (DRL-MFG) algorithm is proposed to suppress the interference and maximize the EE by using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore the optimal power strategy for UAVs. The numerical results show that the UAVs can effectively interact with the environment to obtain the optimal power control strategy. Compared with the benchmarks algorithms, the DRL-MFG algorithm converges faster to the solution of MFG and improves the EE of UAVs. Moreover, the impact of the transmit power on EE under the different heights of the UAVs is also analyzed.},

The time switching (TS) protocol is used at the relay to harvest the energy of radio-frequency (RF) signals transmitted from the source. To improve both system performance and the amount of harvested energy, multiple antennas are used at source and destination. Transmit antenna selection (TAS) is employed at the source with an assumption that the feedback of channel state information (CSI) is outdated. Meanwhile, both selection combining (SC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) techniques are applied at the destination. The closed-form expressions of the outage probability (OP), optimal throughput, and symbol error probability (SEP) are derived subject to the outdated CSI over Rayleigh fading channels. We also make a comparison between the performance of the proposed MIMO-FD relaying system with SWIPT and that of MIMO half-duplex (HD) relaying systems with and without SWIPT. The validity of derived mathematical expressions is verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. Numerical results show that the TAS/MRC scheme gives better system performance than the TAS/SC scheme. Moreover, higher energy harvesting time is needed to maximize the throughput than to minimize the OP.},

  abstract     = {The surface of a hypersonic vehicle traveling at a speed exceeding Mach 10 is covered by a plasma sheath. The plasma sheath is a complex dynamic random medium that seriously attenuates electromagnetic (EM) waves and generates the so-called blackout phenomenon. However, owing to changes in vehicle flight parameters, such as the angle of attack, speed, and altitude, or the effects of plasma weakening control measures, the attenuation effect of the plasma sheath on EM waves weakens for a short time. At times, the amplitude of the EM waves is higher than the communication threshold, and the EM waves penetrate the plasma sheath in a so-called “communication window”. However, the random temporal variance of the plasma sheath parameters causes the required parameters of the “communication windows” to appear randomly, resulting in the traditional communication methods that needs to keep the communication link open for a long time being no longer applicable. To maximize the use of these “communication windows”, this paper proposes a short-frame fountain code (SFFC), constructs a time-varying plasma sheath channel model, and studies the relationship between the SFFC parameters and the transmission performance of this particular channel. Simulation and experimental results show that the use of SFFC improves the reliability of communication through the plasma sheath. The uninterrupted and correct transmission of information can be achieved even when the plasma equivalent frequency is close to the carrier frequency.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN), called SCGNet, for low-complexity and robust modulation recognition in intelligent communication receivers. Principally, the network combines two types of sparse convolutional layers–depthwise and regular grouped in an architecture to achieve high recognition accuracy while keeping the network more lightweight. The network architecture leverages sparsely connected convolutional layers in three principal modules: speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT), deep feature extraction and processing (DFEP), and generic feature extraction (GFE) data pre-processing module. For a good tradeoff between complexity and accuracy, SAT deploys depthwise convolutional layers to enrich the relevant features outputted by the former GFE module. In addition to SAT, DFEP employs a cascade of regular grouped convolutional layers for mining more discriminative features from SAT via a multilayer transformation module. This cascade structure aims to prevent a loss of essential details of the signal as the network becomes deeper. Additionally, skip connections are deployed between sub-blocks within SAT and DFEP to allow inter-module feature sharing and to handle inter-block features loss. Experimental results on the RadioML2018.01A dataset indicate that SCGNet achieves an overall recognition accuracy of around 94.39% at a signal-to-noise ratio of +20 dB.},

  abstract     = {The universal availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has resulted in many applications where the same make/model can be deployed by multiple parties. Thus, identifying a specific UAV in a given swarm, in a manner that cannot be spoofed by software methods, becomes important. We propose RF fingerprinting for this purpose, where a neural network learns subtle imperfections present in the transmitted waveform. For UAVs, the constant hovering motion raises a key challenge, which remains a fundamental problem in previous works on RF fingerprinting: Since the wireless channel changes constantly, the network trained with a previously collected dataset performs poorly on the test data. The main contribution of this paper is to address this problem by: (i) proposing a multi-classifier scheme with a two-step score-based aggregation method, (ii) using RF data augmentation to increase neural network robustness to hovering-induced variations, and (iii) extending the multi-classifier scheme for detecting a new UAV, not seen earlier during training. Importantly, our approach permits RF fingerprinting on manufacturer-proprietary waveforms that cannot be decoded or altered by the end-user. Results reveal a near two-fold accuracy in UAV classification through our multi-classifier method over the single-classifier case, with an overall accuracy of 95% when tested with data under unseen channel. Our multi-classifier scheme also improves new UAV detection accuracy to a near perfect 99%, up from 68% for a single neural network approach.},

  abstract     = {Filtered orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (f-OFDM) is considered one of the candidates for future mobile communication because of its flexible parameter configuration for different scenarios. However, the interference analysis of f-OFDM is considerably challenging due to its special transceiver structure, especially in the uplink with non-ideal synchronization. The uplink interference of f-OFDM systems under non-ideal synchronization, in which carrier frequency offset (CFO) and timing offset (TO) of multiple user equipment (UE) are considered, is investigated in this study. The interference is classified into several sub-interferences. The closed-form expressions of each sub-interference and its variance are first derived, and then verified via simulations. On the basis of the derived closed-form expressions, first, the influences of non-ideal factors and system parameters, such as CFO, TO, guard band (GB), and subcarrier spacing (SCS), on the uplink interference of f-OFDM systems, are simulated and analyzed. This study is verified by computer simulations, and the theoretical derivation of interference agrees with the simulation result. Second, Hanning window filters are employed by previous f-OFDM systems, resulting in bit error rate (BER) imbalance between sub-bands. Hence, the effect of waveform filter on the interference and BER is also investigated in this research. Results indicate that better interference and BER performances than Hanning window filters can be obtained by employing reasonable filter settings. Furthermore, several filter design rules are concluded. Overall, the analysis and simulations reveal many intrinsic interference characteristics of f-OFDM, which will benefit the future f-OFDM system designs.},

Moreover, the modulating bits are input to multiple M-ary DCSK modulators, and the resultant signals are transmitted by the selected spreading codes and loaded into the active carriers. The benefit of the joint carrier-code index modulation is fully exploited so that the data rate and bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the JCCIM-MDCSK system are enhanced in contrast to its competitors. In order to estimate the carrier and code index bits successfully, an effective joint carrier-code index detection algorithm is proposed for the JCCIM-MDCSK system. In addition, the theoretical BER expressions of the JCCIM-MDCSK system are derived over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Finally, the BER performance of the JCCIM-MDCSK system is compared to other state-of-the-art IM-based noncoherent chaotic communication systems. It is shown that the JCCIM-MDCSK system can achieve better BER performance than its competitors.},

  abstract     = {In next-generation communications, massive machine-type communications (mMTC) induce severe burden on base stations. To address such an issue, automatic modulation classification (AMC) can help to reduce signaling overhead by blindly recognizing the modulation types without handshaking. Thus, it plays an important role in future intelligent modems. The emerging deep learning (DL) technique stores intelligence in the network, resulting in superior performance over traditional approaches. However, DL-based approaches suffer from heavy training overhead, memory overhead, and computational complexity, which severely hinder practical applications for resource-limited scenarios, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided systems. Furthermore, the overhead of online retraining under time-varying fading channels has not been studied in the prior arts. In this work, an accumulated polar feature-based DL with a channel compensation mechanism is proposed to cope with the aforementioned issues. Firstly, the simulation results show that learning features from the polar domain with historical data information can approach near-optimal performance while reducing training overhead by 99.8 times. Secondly, the proposed neural network-based channel estimator (NN-CE) can learn the channel response and compensate for the distorted channel with 13% improvement. Moreover, in applying this lightweight NN-CE in a time-varying fading channel, two efficient mechanisms of online retraining are proposed, which can reduce transmission overhead and retraining overhead by 90% and 76%, respectively. Finally, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated and compared with prior arts on a public dataset to demonstrate its great efficiency and lightness. The lightweight and efficient learning features of the proposed mechanism will be very attractive for future resource-constrained/aware IoT and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we show how the absorption and re-radiation energy from molecules in the air can influence the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) performance in high-frequency bands, e.g., millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz. In more detail, some common atmosphere molecules, such as oxygen and water, can absorb and re-radiate energy in their natural resonance frequencies, such as 60 GHz, 180 GHz and 320 GHz. Hence, when hit by electromagnetic waves, molecules will get excited and absorb energy, which leads to an extra path loss and is known as molecular attenuation. Meanwhile, the absorbed energy will be re-radiated towards a random direction with a random phase. These re-radiated waves also interfere with the signal transmission. Although, the molecular re-radiation was mostly considered as noise in literature, recent works show that it is correlated to the main signal and can be viewed as a composition of multiple delayed or scattered signals. Such a phenomenon can provide non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths in an environment that lacks scatterers, which increases spatial multiplexing and thus greatly enhances the performance of MIMO systems. Therefore in this paper, we explore the scattering model and noise models of molecular re-radiation to characterize the channel transfer function of the NLoS channels created by atmosphere molecules. Our simulation results show that the re-radiation can increase MIMO capacity up to 3 folds in mmWave and 6 folds in terahertz for a set of realistic transmit power, distance, and antenna numbers. We also show that in the high SNR, the re-radiation makes the open-loop precoding viable, which is an alternative to beamforming to avoid beam alignment sensitivity in high mobility applications.},

  abstract     = {The large spectral bandwidth at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies provides a mean to achieve very high data rates in wireless communication systems. A unique characteristic of mmWave is that mmWave links are very sensitive to blockage and have large propagation path loss, which exhibits low line-of-sight (LoS) probability, unstable connectivity and unreliable communication. This paper studies the influence of the blockage in pedestrian scenario, explains in detail how blockage affects the mmWave propagation characteristics. In particular, we study the behavior of the blockage due to human mobility and how it affects the timescale for outage due to blockage using knife-edge diffraction model (KED). One of the existing solutions to overcome the influence of blockage, is to associate the user equipment (UE) with other available base stations (BSs) by handover (HO) if the serving BS is blocked. In this paper, for a pedestrian scenario, we propose two reinforcement learning (RL) based user association algorithms, which accounts for the past experience of the blockage on the position of the UE. One focuses on the reward to increase the sum LoS probability and is named as blockage-aware user association (BAUA). The other focuses on the reward to balance the trade-off between the throughput and the LoS probability and is named as modified BAUA. We compare the proposed algorithm with the conventional user algorithms such as the maximum throughput based algorithm and the maximum SINR based algorithm. Simulation results show that to increase the sum LoS probability BAUA would be suitable, and to increase the average throughput maximum throughput based method would be suitable.},

  abstract     = {High-speed railway (HSR) has demonstrated tremendous growth worldwide, and is currently attaining a maximum velocity of 575 km/h. Such a high speed makes mobile wireless communications extremely challenging for HSR since the handover (HO) rate increases with speed, resulting in a high call dropping probability. By employing a dedicated distributed antenna system (DAS) along with the two-hop network architecture, in this paper, we propose a frequency switch (FSW) scheme to mitigate the persistent HO issue in conventional HSR wireless communication systems. The proposed scheme significantly alleviates interruption time associated with the traditional HO process, providing an effective scheme when the train moves across small cells covered by remote antenna units (RAUs) belonging to the same central unit (CU). In order to further reduce the HO command failure probability, an enhanced fast predictive HO mechanism is proposed by starting the HO process in advance, when the train moves from one RAU to the next one controlled by the adjacent CU. Analytical results show that compared to the traditional HO scheme, the proposed schemes can improve the system performance substantially by delivering ultra-reliable low-latency communications with a reduced HO/FSW rate.},

Hardware impairments and antenna position errors assume special importance in modern wireless system due to their severe impacts on system performance. With the increase of radio frequency (RF) in the modern wireless system and the subsequent usage of a large number of antennas for beamforming and meeting ever-increasing data rates, those errors are much relevant today. We have considered a sparse nested array (NA) and uniform linear array (ULA) for array geometry at the base station (BS). In this work, closed-form expression and bounds on the mean square error (MSE) of the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimate are derived. We have also analyzed the spectral efficiency (SE) of a simplified system with ULA and NA at the BS, given the model with hardware distortion and antenna position error. Two cases for (a) perfect channel side information (CSI) and (b) estimated channel are evaluated and compared in terms of their SEs, while the closed-form expression for SE with ULA at the BS considering perfect CSI is derived and verified.

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication are two promising techniques to increase the system capacity in the fifth-generation (5G) mobile network. The former can achieve high spectral efficiency by modulating the information in power domain and the latter can provide extremely large spectrum resources. Fluctuating two-ray (FTR) channel model has already been proved to accurately agree with the small-scale fading effects in mmWave communications in experiments. In this paper, the performance of NOMA-based communications over FTR channels in mmWave communication systems is investigated in terms of outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC). Specifically, we consider the scenario that one base station (BS) transmits signals to two users simultaneously under NOMA scheme. The BS and users are all equipped with a single antenna. Two power allocation strategies are considered: the first one is a general (fixed) power allocation scheme under which we derive the OP and EC of NOMA users in closed form; the other one is an optimal power allocation scheme that can achieve the maximum sum rate for the whole system. Under the second scheme, not only the closed-form OP and EC but also the upper and lower bounds of EC are derived. Furthermore, we also derive the asymptotic expression for the OP in high average SNR region to investigate the diversity order under these two schemes. Finally, we show the correctness and accuracy of our derived expressions by Monte-Carlo simulation.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we focus on the usage of MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) within Connected Vehicles (CVs). Indeed, in the original version of MQTT protocol, the broker is responsible “only” for sending received data to subscribers; abstracting then the underlying mechanism of data exchange. However, within CVs context, subscribers (i.e., the processing infrastructure) may be overloaded with irrelevant data, in particular when the requirement is real or near real-time processing. To overcome this issue, we propose MQTT-CV; a new variant of MQTT protocol, in which the broker is able to perform local processing in order to reduce the workload at the infrastructure; i.e., filtering data before sending them. In this article, we first validate formally the correctness of MQTT-CV protocol (i.e., the three components of the proposed protocol are correctly interacting), through the use of Promela language and its system verification tool; the model checker SPIN. Secondly, using real-world data provided by our car manufacturer partner, we have conducted real implementation and experiments. The obtained results show the effectiveness of our approach in term of data workload reduction at the processing infrastructure. The mean improvement, besides the fact that it is dependent of the target application, was in general about 10 times less in comparison to native MQTT protocol.},

We approach the precoder design problem to maximize the system energy efficiency by jointly considering power control, interference management, antenna switching and user throughput in a cluster of base stations. This is computationally difficult as it requires solving a sparsity-inducing non-convex optimization problem, which is NP-hard. To alleviate the solution complexity, first a stochastic smooth approximation of zero-norm is applied in the antenna power management to enable fast, gradient-based algorithms. For efficient convergence, we develop a novel optimization algorithm combining augmented multiplier (AM) and quadratic programming (QP), and show how this scheme permits decentralized implementation by offloading parts of the computation to the individual base stations to reduce communication overhead. We provide theoretical proof that the proposed algorithm converges both locally and globally under realistic assumptions. Numerical results confirm that our method achieves higher energy efficiency with a superior convergence rate compared to different types of existing methods, and illustrate the relationship between energy efficiency performance and system design parameters.},

Then, the mathematical platoon model is formulated with heterogenous platoon structure. With the objective of minimizing the deviations of vehicle&#39;s headway and velocity, a linear quadratic optimization problem is formulated. The optimal control strategy is solved in an iterative manner by using a backward recursion which can be divided into two steps. In particular, the optimal control gain is iteratively derived off-line and the control strategy is calculated on-line. In addition, the control gain convergence, the stability analysis, and the effect of the packet losses and state noises are analyzed. Finally, the stability and performance of the proposed control algorithm are verified by numerical simulations to highlight its superiority compared with the existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In the recent years, there has been an explosive growth of smart devices applications with high computational demands and critical latency. The Internet of Things (IoT) multi-access edge computing (MEC) framework offers a lower latency and a higher speed to the users, by offloading the cloud computing capabilities at the nearest edge of the mobile network. In this operating scenario, the proper allocation of limited resources is one of the biggest challenges, and security is becoming vital as the number of devices in an IoT network tends to billions. According to recent studies, even authorized edge devices may be a significant threat for IoT networks (i.e., selfish behavior), as a result of mixed service structures with a wide range of different requirements. Thus, this work proposes a novel two-fold method to allocate resources and then identify attackers (selfish IoT malicious devices) by means of a reputation-based stable matching policy. The devices are categorized in three different states, namely honest, suspicious, and malicious states, according to their reputation indices. Our algorithm allows to move the devices between the three states, in order to exclude malicious devices and to rehabilitate users identified as unintentional attackers (due to bad propagation conditions). Theoretical and simulation results confirm the validity and effectiveness of such approach for identifying malicious IoT devices in MEC networks.},

  abstract     = {Due to the projective nature of a single camera, monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) algorithms suffer from scale drift. Recent studies have addressed the scale drift by estimating the height of the camera from the fitted ground plane. However, the low accuracy of 3D ground point (3DGP) reconstruction and the insufficient number of 3DGPs from the textureless ground region make the fitted plane inaccurate for scale estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel accuracy measure of the fitted plane. From the previous keyframe, we first obtain the 3D points from the intersection of the fitted plane with a ray passing through the camera center and the 2D feature points on the ground region. We then transform the 3D points and 2D feature points to the current keyframe using their respective planar homography. Finally, we project the transformed 3D points onto the image plane of the current keyframe and measure the average Euclidean distance between the projected points and the transformed feature points. The proposed method achieves the average translation error of 1.03% on the KITTI dataset, which outperforms the state-of-the-art monocular vSLAM methods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the beam management problem in mmWave networks from a systematic perspective. Instead of maximizing the network performance in terms of user sum-rate, we improve the beam coverage, which could potentially reduce beam tracking overhead for mobile users. Moreover, to compensate the severe signal attenuation in mmWave bands, we configure the beam to meet the user link budget requirement. To reduce the interference among users, we take the inter-beam interference from both main-lobe and side-lobe into consideration. Overall, we formulate our beam management scheme as a non-linear integer optimization problem. By deliberately transforming it to a geometric optimization problem and designing a rounding method, we develop a suboptimal solution, with low computational complexity. Based on this, we further design a scheduling user set refining method, which can assist user scheduling in the MAC layer, to make the beam configuration request within the antenna capability. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm could manage the beam on-line, while satisfying beam configuration requests for beam coverage, link budget, and inter-beam interference control.},

  abstract     = {Relays have been deployed to provide connectivity to heavily blocked and isolated radio environments, but suffer from severe data rate losses due to the half-duplex nature of relays. This paper exploits non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance the sum-rate of two heavily blocked users to and from a base station (BS) via two-way relays (TWRs). By carefully arranging the NOMA transmissions, only two time slots are needed to complete a round of two-way transmissions between the BS and the two users. Unlike existing works where users associated with the same relay form a NOMA pair, the two users are connected to two different relays in the proposed scheme, due to the blockage. We analyze the sum-rate of the proposed NOMA-based TWR scheme with two popular relaying modes, namely, amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, and derive closed-form expressions for the sum-rate upper bounds of the scheme. We also analyze the asymptotic sum-rate of the NOMA-based TWR schemes in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Simulations verify the analysis, and show that the proposed schemes outperform existing TDMA-based alternatives and a NOMA-based benchmark scheme. It is shown that the sum-rate of the schemes is independent of the transmit power of the BS in the high SNR regions, given the transmit powers of the relays and users.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the asymptotic performance of a full-duplex (FD) millimeter wave (mmWave) two-way relay (TWR) system with a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) structure is analyzed. After applying conjugate array response vector-based precoding to a hybrid analog and digital MIMO structure in the mmWave band, the asymptotic spectral efficiency of the system as the number of antennas approaches infinity is derived. Based on the asymptotic performance and different system configurations, power scaling schemes are investigated. Considering different power scaling strategies at each node, eight power scaling cases are discussed, and the corresponding asymptotic spectral efficiencies are derived. The results show that interference and noise can be fully eliminated by increasing the number of antennas. A high spectral efficiency can be achieved in a system wherein all the nodes are equipped with large antenna arrays. If the numbers of antennas of node A and node B are both limited, then the system can achieve considerable spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. For both configurations, the power of node A and node B can be scaled down without spectral efficiency loss. However, if only one node is equipped with limited antennas, only the node with a massive array can achieve a higher spectral efficiency. Moreover, we analyze the effect of the FD self-interference (SI) levels. We show that the spectral efficiency decreases rapidly as the SI intensity increases, which is related to the capability of SI cancellation. Under ideal conditions, the FD system can achieve twice the spectral efficiency of its conventional half-duplex (HD) counterpart. However, the FD SI and the finite number of antennas degrade the spectral efficiency of the FD system.},

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a rapidly emerging paradigm with the capability to improve the spectral efficiency of data-driven, intelligence inspired, and highly digitized sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In the backdrop of ever-evolving NOMA techniques, this article presents a novel resource optimization framework for maximizing the spectral efficiency (SE) of the Internet-of-things (IoT) networks using power domain NOMA. The proposed framework considers a limited number of frequency blocks in the IoT network and provides an optimal power and frequency block allocation method. Different practical constraints like successive interference cancellation (SIC) complexity, ensuring the minimum gap of received power among different IoT equipment over the same frequency block for successful SIC operation, quality of services requirements, and IoT equipment&#39;s transmit powers have also been taken into account. Accordingly, a non-convex optimization problem has been formulated for resource management where the objective of spectral efficiency is coupled by both frequency block and power allocation. To effectively solve this problem, the resource optimization problem is decoupled into two subproblems for frequency block assignment and power allocation. A suboptimal algorithm has been designed for frequency block assignment and a new optimal sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approach is employed to solve the non-convex power control subproblem. For the sake of fair comparison, a low complexity suboptimal NOMA power allocation scheme, based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme are also provided. The results demonstrate that the proposed optimal resource management scheme significantly improves the system performance compared to other schemes.},

In the proposed RJFS algorithms inter-relay interference cancellation (IC) is taken into account. IC is first performed to improve the transmission rate to legitimate users and then inter-relay IC is applied to amplify the jamming signal to the eavesdroppers and enhance the secrecy rate. With the buffer-aided relays the jamming signal can be stored at the relay nodes and a buffer-aided RJFS (BF-RJFS) algorithm is proposed. Greedy RJFS and BF-RJFS algorithms are then developed for relay selection with reduced complexity.

However, for C-V2X, there have not been many studies on the physical layer security (PLS). Since artificial noise (AN) and secure beamforming are popular PLS techniques for cellular communications, in this paper we investigate the potential of these PLS techniques for enhancing the security of C-V2X networks. In particular, leveraging stochastic geometry, we study the PLS of an AN assisted C-V2X network, where the locations of legitimate vehicular nodes, malicious vehicular nodes and road side units (RSUs) are modeled by Cox processes driven by a common Poisson line process (PLP), and the locations of cellular base stations (BSs) are modeled by a two-dimensional (2D) Poisson point process (PPP). Based on the maximum signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) association scheme, we calculate the coverage probability of the network. We also derive bounds on the secrecy probability, which are validated by simulation results. Moreover, we obtain an analytical result of the effective secrecy throughput for characterizing the reliability and security of wiretap channels. Simulation results are given to validate the analytical result, and provide interesting insights into the impact of network parameters on the achievable secrecy performance. Simulation results show that a larger array antenna can provide a better robustness of the secure transmission strategy, and the optimal power allocation ratio between confidential information and AN remains almost unchanged for different numbers of antennas.},

  abstract     = {With the inherent benefits, such as, better cell coverage and higher area throughput, extra-large scale massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has great potential to be one of the key technologies for the next generation wireless communication systems. However, in practice, when the antenna dimensions grow large, spatial non-stationarities occur and users will only see a portion of the base station antenna array, which we call visibility region (VR). To assess the impact of spatial non-stationarities, in this paper, we investigate the uplink transmission of extra-large scale massive MIMO systems by considering VRs. In particular, we first propose a subarray-based system architecture for extra-large scale massive MIMO systems. Then, tight closed-form uplink spectral efficiency (SE) approximations with linear receivers are derived. With the objective of maximizing the achievable SE, we also propose schemes for the subarray phase coefficient design. In addition, based on the obtained ergodic achievable SE approximations, two statistical channel state information (CSI)-based greedy user scheduling algorithms are developed. Our results indicate that the statistical CSI-based greedy joint user and subarray scheduling algorithm collaborating with the on-off switch-based subarray architecture is a promising practical solution for extra-large scale massive MIMO systems.},

In these networks, by using the harvest-then-transmit (HTT) mode, secondary transmitters (STs) can use the harvested energy to simultaneously transmit data based on power-domain NOMA. However, in this mode, the throughput of the secondary system heavily depends not only on the harvested energy, but also on the stringent interference threshold imposed by the primary users. Furthermore, ambient backscatter communication (ABC) has been introduced as a promising technique which enables STs to transmit information by modulating and reflecting ambient RF signals. Therefore, it has the potentiality to be integrated into the RF-powered underlay CR-NOMA networks to improve the throughput of the secondary system. In these networks, each ST works on either the HTT mode or the ABC mode, but not simultaneously. In order to meet the interference constraint of the primary users, STs control their transmit power by finding the appropriate tradeoff between the HTT mode and the ABC mode. We formulate an optimization problem with the goal of achieving the maximum throughput by finding the optimal time resource allocation between the HTT mode and the ABC mode under the strict transmit power constraint at STs. Then the Lagrangian multiplier iterative algorithm is adopted to solve this optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the performance of the secondary system by comparing it with the other two baseline schemes.},

Assuming the use of minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimates, closed-form expressions for the downlink (DL) achievable spectral efficiency of a cellfree massive MIMO network with short-term power constraints (i.e., a vector normalized conjugate beamformer (NCB)) are derived and benchmarked against that provided by the conventional cell-free massive MIMO network with long-term power constraints (i.e., the conventional conjugate beamforming (CB)). These expressions, encompassing the effects of spatial antenna correlation, Ricean/Rayleigh fading and pilot contamination, are then used to derive both pragmatic and optimal max-min peruser power allocation strategies and to gain theoretical insight on the performance advantage provided by the use of short-term power constraints instead of the conventional long-term power constrained approach.},

In this paper, a multilayer complex network model is introduced to catch the results of resource allocation and slice deployment. This model facilitates real-time resource monitoring and topology information updating for infrastructure network providers. With this model, we investigate the impact of changing resource allocation parameters by modelling the traffic data which are transmitted within the slices. To avoid the traffic congestion caused by the resource competition, the traffic performance of slices is analyzed. The analysis results enable us to propose two cost-effective control strategies which are increasing the capacity of hub nodes and enlarging the scale of the infrastructure network by adding more servers. These strategies aim to suppress the congestion while guaranteeing the traffic performance of slices. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.},

However, there remains a fundamental limitation in the conventional CAM broadcasting since a transmitter (TX) V-UE cannot confirm whether its CAM is successfully received at other V-UEs. Without a feedback process, a significant uncertainty arises in CAM reception, posing a critical threat to user safety. To address this threat, we propose Beyond-Vision, an effective C-V2V on-demand relay system that allows CAMs that are not well received at nearby V-UEs to be better received. Through simulation that reflects realistic vehicle mobility and road environments in urban scenarios, we verify the superiority of Beyond-Vision over the conventional C-V2V, which improves performance by up to 215% in terms of message reception ratio (MRR) within a communication range under Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) channels.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the shared infrastructure of colocation data centers and the growth of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), colocation MEC businesses have thrived to offer an economical and low latency solution for MEC based tenants. In colocation MEC, a colocation service provider leases spaces at the base stations (BSs) to tenants for housing their servers. Although the tenants fully manage their own servers, they still need to purchase bandwidth from the network provider to via bandwidth purchasing market to serve their users. As a result, tenants should consider the trade-off between delay and energy consumption, which are related to bandwidth and server computing speed, respectively. In this paper, an auction framework is used to model the interaction between the network provider and tenants in the bandwidth market. The network provider determines the bandwidth amount and corresponding payment by tenants based on their submitted bids, in which the valuation of the bandwidth amount in each bid is based on the coupling between bandwidth and server computing speed. The networking provider also seeks winners in the social welfare maximization problem, which is NP-hard. To solve this problem, we propose a solution based on the randomized auction mechanism, which is proved to be approximately truthful, individually rational, and computationally efficient. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed randomized auction scheme in bandwidth trading.},

  abstract     = {In licensed shared access (LSA) the radio spectrum is dynamically shared between an incumbent and one or more licensee systems. Protective measures are applied to the licensees&#39; communication activity to protect the normal operation of the incumbent system. Such measures are therefore crucial components of the LSA, and thus fundamentally affect the achievable spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we investigate a vertical LSA including an airport traffic control system, as the incumbent, and a mobile network as the licensee. While some previous works only consider the licensee uplink, we analytically obtain the interference received by the incumbent from the licensee&#39;s transmission both in the uplink and downlink. We then obtain optimal uplink and downlink power allocation in the licensee using an optimisation problem with the objective of maximizing licensee&#39;s spectral efficiency (SE) subject to the incumbent interference threshold. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of the number of users and cell size on the SE. Our results provide quantitative insights for practical system design and deployment of LSA system. We then examine the whole LSA spectrum utilization by characterising the availability of the LSA spectrum using a tandem queue setting. Using this model we obtain an expression for the spectral utilization as a function of the licensee&#39;s achievable spectral efficiency and the statistics of the LSA spectrum availability. Simulation results show more than a seven-fold improvement in the licensee SE using the optimal power allocation. It is also seen that a higher SE gain is achieved with the proposed optimal power allocation in cases where the number of user equipment in the eNodeB coverage area is very small. Furthermore, higher spectrum utilization efficiency is achieved as a result of shorter busy period and higher achievable SE for distant cells.},

In contrast to current studies with ensuring security of information transmitted, we are motivated to protect communication behavior in CR network, which is considered as a higher-level security. To address covert rate and fairness performance, three joint user-jammer scheduling schemes are proposed, namely, rate-oriented secondary user scheduling (R-SUS), link-oriented secondary user scheduling (L-SUS), and fairness oriented secondary user scheduling (F-SUS). Numerical results show that the minimal detection error probability at eavesdropper (Eve) can be effectively impacted by creating channel uncertainty with the jamming signal. Further, it can be seen that under the same covert constraint, the R-SUS scheme achieves the best covert rate performance, full diversity can be obtained by the L-SUS scheme, while the F-SUS scheme exploits an advantage of better fairness.},

We assume that the eavesdropper vehicle takes the advantages of both the relay link and direct link. We consider that vehicle-to-vehicle links are modeled as double-Rayleigh fading, while vehicle-to-fixed infrastructure links are modeled as Rayleigh fading. Such a scenario finds it relevancy in vehicle-to-vehicle communication and/or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication under spectrum sharing heterogeneous cooperative vehicular networks. For such a realistic scenario, in particular, we derive a tight lower bound expression of the secrecy outage probability under mixed Rayleigh and double-Rayleigh fading channels. We also present an effective secrecy diversity order analysis and show that the considered system can achieve a secrecy diversity order of 2 for infinitely large average channel gain values of the main links. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical findings via numerical and simulation results and show the impact of channel conditions, primary interference constraints, and direct links on the secrecy performance of the considered system.},

We also propose a method to estimate the round-trip propagation delay between a user terminal (UT) and the base station (BS) based on the received RA preambles in the DD domain. This estimate (known as the timing advance estimate) is fed back to the respective UTs so that they can advance their uplink timing in order that the signal from all UTs in a cell is received at the BS in a time-synchronized manner. Through analysis and simulations we study the impact of OTFS modulation parameters of the RA preamble on the probability of timing error, which gives valuable insights on how to choose these parameters. Exhaustive numerical simulations of high mobility scenarios suggests that the timing error probability (TEP) performance of the proposed OTFS based RA is much more robust to channel induced multi-path Doppler shift when compared to the RA method in Fourth Generation (4G) systems.},

Nevertheless, communication security between a UAV and its ground station (GS) is critical for completing its task without leaking sensitive information either to the adversaries or to unauthenticated users. UAVs are especially vulnerable to physical capture and node tampering attacks. Further, since UAV devices are generally equipped with small batteries and limited memory storage, lightweight security techniques are best suited for them. Addressing these issues, a lightweight mutual authentication scheme based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for UAV-GS authentication is presented in this paper. The UAV-GS authentication scheme is extended further to support UAV-UAV authentication. We present a formal security analysis as well as old-fashioned cryptanalysis and show that our protocol provides various security features such as mutual authentication, user anonymity, etc, and is resilient against many security attacks such as masquerade, replay, node tampering, and cloning attacks, etc. We also compare the performance of our protocol with state-of-the-art authentication protocols for UAVs, based on computation, communication, and memory storage cost.},

If multiple remote stations simultaneously transmit random access packets using the same sequence, the performance degrades owing to sequence collision. In addition, the performance is degraded because of interference if multiple remote stations simultaneously transmit random access packets using different sequences. Therefore, the performance of CDM-based random access is dependent on both sequence collision and interference. There have been no previous studies on analyzing the performance of CDM-based random access considering both sequence collision and interference. In this paper, the throughput of CDM-based random access is investigated considering both sequence collision and interference based on a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) capture model. Analyses and numerical simulations are performed to compare the throughputs of several random access schemes, including conventional and channel-adaptive random access. The results show that channel-adaptive random access can achieve significantly higher throughput than that achieved by conventional random access. Moreover, the results demonstrate that it is possible to analyze the trade-off between the throughput and implementation complexity with the increased the number of sequences.},

  abstract     = {As electromagnetic environments in battlefields are more and more complex, there are more kinds of suppression jamming noise including both single jamming signals and compound jamming signals. Thus, suppression jamming recognition especially for compound jamming signals is becoming vital and challenging. Whereas conventional methods are prone to owning the low recognition accuracy and the high computational complexity, especially under low jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) conditions. In this paper, a novel jamming recognition network (JRNet) based on robust power-spectrum features is proposed to recognize ten kinds of suppression jamming signals including four single jamming patterns and six compound jamming patterns. The proposed method combines the significant representative power of the JRNet and distinguished power-spectrum features of jamming signals to promote the recognition performance. By integrating residual blocks and asymmetric convolution blocks, the JRNet is capable to address the degradation problem and enhance the recognition ability for subtle features. The simulation results show that the overall recognition accuracy of the proposed method is more than 90% even when the JNR is −18 dB and is close to 100% at −6 dB. Compared with five comparison methods in recent literatures, the proposed JRNet achieves better and stable recognition performance especially under low JNR conditions with relatively less storage source and a bit more FLOPs and inference time.},

  abstract     = {Except for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) providing specialized communication service, there may be many other UAVs executing various missions in the air. These UAVs may be idle in communication and thus are considered to work as opportunistic relays to enhance the ground device-to-device (D2D) network. On account of the dynamic behaviors and uncontrollable trajectories of the opportunistic UAVs, real-time relay assignment and channel allocation are two main factors that determine the network capacity. Thus, real-time relay assignment and channel allocation are optimized in this article, aiming to maximize the long-term average total transmission rate of this dynamic network. In order to implement relay assignment via the decentralized approach and resist the dynamic network characteristic, a mood-driven online learning relay selection approach is proposed for the D2D pairs, which not only utilizes the immediate transmission rate but also the variation tendency of the transmission rate. As a result, the dynamic network always has a tendency to increase its total transmission rate. For the reason that the characteristic of channel selection in the dynamic network is similar to relay selection, a mood-driven approach that similar to the one used for relay selection is proposed for channel selection.

  abstract     = {Integrating millimeter Wave (mmWave) and long-term evolution (LTE) sub-6 GHz bands to provide wireless services for high-speed rails (HSRs) is a promising solution to balance the ever-rising service demand and operational cost. In this paper, we optimize the network interface selection of the mmWave and LTE interfaces for HSR communications, to minimize the operational cost while satisfying the service requests of passengers. The network interface selection problem is formulated as a finite-horizon discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) problem. Based on the file requests and associated deadlines of a passenger and the train schedule, we solve the MDP problem ahead-of-time by using dynamic programming (DP) and achieve optimal interface selection for each waypoint along the railways. Further, by exploiting the subadditivity and superadditivity of the considered problem, we reveal that an optimal switch of interfaces is only triggered at the moment when the remaining undelivered data or the elapsed time reaches their specific thresholds. Based on the thresholds, the optimal interface selection can be directly achieved for every waypoint, hence eliminating the need for DP and substantially reducing the computational complexity. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with practical train schedules. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can substantially reduce the operational cost by 35% in our considered simulation setting, as compared to existing alternatives.},

  abstract     = {A vast array of potential applications is emerging for drones and other devices to collaborate from disaster relief and search and rescue missions to smart agriculture and IoT systems. As drones move across multiple altitudes, they must have the ability to communicate across any direction in a three-dimensional (3D) space. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of the drone body and its interaction with the mounted antennas, different antenna positions on the drone can result in variations in the radiation pattern. While there have been a fair number of airborne communication works, few consider the role that antenna positioning has on the resulting transmission along the azimuth and elevation planes. In this work, we study the effects of the drone body and various antenna placements on the radiation pattern and fading of drone-based channels. Through systematic anechoic chamber and in-field measurements, we show that the drone body alters the radiation pattern of the mounted antennas, rendering the common assumption of a constant azimuth radiation pattern invalid. In addition, the body increases polarization mixing of drone-based channels, resulting in significant degradation of the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD). Hence, we propose using effective radiation pattern and XPD values instead of relying on measurements and/or assumptions that disregard drone-antenna interaction. We then analyze the shadowing and losses associated with the drone body for many antenna setups at various elevation angles and show that when mounted on the opposite side from the ground transmitter, shadowing increases with relatively-higher drone elevations. To account for these body-induced effects, we introduce rotational loss that results in better prediction results of the large-scale fading behavior compared to conventional models that neglect these body effects. Then, we analyze the small-scale fading for various antenna setups and show that the Rician K-factor is strongly dependent on elevation for polarization-matched vertical links, while it is approximately flat for cross-polarized links. To do so, we conduct a set of drone-to-drone (DtD) experiments at high altitudes with no surrounding reflectors and compare results to those obtained by our ground-to-drone (GtD) measurements. We find that, while at low elevations the ground can reduce the K-factor by 10 dB, at higher elevations, small-scale fading is dominated by the antennas, not the ground.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a dual-functional radar and communication (RadCom) system architecture is proposed for application at base-stations (BSs), or access points (APs), for simultaneously communicating with multiple user equipments (UEs) and sensing the environment. Specifically, massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) communication and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based MIMO radar are considered with the objective to jointly utilize channel diversity and interference. The BS consists of a mMIMO antenna array, and radar transmit and receive antennas. Employing OFDM waveforms for the radar allows the BS to perform channel state information (CSI) estimation for the mMIMO and radar antennas simultaneously. The acquired CSI is then exploited to predict the radar signals received by the UEs. While the radar transmits an OFDM waveform for detecting possible targets in range, the communication system beamforms to the UEs by taking into account the predicted radar interference. To further enhance the capacity of the communication system, an optimum radar waveform is designed. Moreover, the network capacity is mathematically analyzed and verified by simulations. The results show that the proposed RadCom can achieve higher capacity than conventional mMIMO systems by utilizing the radar interference while simultaneously detecting targets.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (MmWave) communications is capable of supporting multi-gigabit wireless access thanks to its abundant spectrum resource. However, severe path loss and high directivity make it vulnerable to blockage events, which can be frequent in indoor and dense urban environments. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) as a new technology to provide effective reflected paths to enhance the coverage of mmWave signals. In this framework, we study joint active and passive precoding design for IRS-assisted mmWave systems, where multiple IRSs are deployed to assist the data transmission from a base station (BS) to a single-antenna receiver. Our objective is to maximize the received signal power by jointly optimizing the BS&#39;s transmit precoding vector and IRSs’ phase shift coefficients. Although such an optimization problem is generally non-convex, we show that, by exploiting some important characteristics of mmWave channels, an optimal closed-form solution can be derived for the single IRS case and a near-optimal analytical solution can be obtained for the multi-IRS case. Our analysis reveals that the received signal power increases quadratically with the number of reflecting elements for both the single IRS and multi-IRS cases. Simulation results are included to verify the optimality and near-optimality of our proposed solutions. Results also show that IRSs can help create effective virtual line-of-sight (LOS) paths and thus substantially improve robustness against blockages in mmWave communications.},

Physical layer security, which explores channel characteristics to protect wireless communications, is very attractive due to its low latency. This paper focuses on secrecy capacity maximization in V2V underlay cellular communications, where the secrecy capacity of vehicular user equipments (VUEs) is optimized first, followed by sum proportional fairness function optimization for both VUEs and cellular user equipments (CUEs). The optimization problems can be solved in two sub-problems, e.g., power and subcarrier allocation problems. The power allocation can be done with the first strategy using a one-dimensional searching algorithm, whereas a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to solve the second optimization problem. In addition, as VUEs share uplink resources with CUEs, the co-channel interference exists and the subcarrier allocation sub-problem is a 3D search problem, which is solved by a two-step iterative Hungarian algorithm (IHA). Finally, simulations are performed to validate the performance of the proposed schemes.},

Consequently, the exact calculation of bit error probability (BEP) of rectangular and square QAM in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel results in simple one-dimensional (1-D) error/Q-functions. This is while the symbol decision boundaries involve two dimensions. This paper presents exact and general expressions for the BEP of Gray coded M-ary rectangular and square QAM in the presence of phase noise in the AWGN as well as flat-fading channels. In doing so, we first derive exact expressions for the BEP of MQAM in the presence of a fixed phase error. The expression will be a weighted sum of 1-D complementary error functions for the AWGN channel. For the flat-fading channels, these formulas consist of only single integrals or simple functions. We then integrate the formulas across noise distribution, to derive the average BEP expression of Gray coded MQAM in the presence of random phase error. Moreover, we provide an exact expression for the bit error floor (BEF) of MQAM in the presence of phase noise in the AWGN and fading channels. The exact expressions include numerous terms for higher order MQAM. Considering the most dominant terms of the exact expressions, we also propose simpler expressions. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed exact expressions for arbitrary levels of input SNR. Moreover, the results show very good performance for the approximate expressions.},

Specifically, the passive radar will tap the transmissions from the automotive radars of the vehicles on the road. The spatial covariance of the received radar signals will be estimated and used to establish the communication link. We propose a simplified radar receiver that does not require the transmitted waveform as a reference. To leverage the radar information for beamforming, the radar azimuth power spectrum (APS) and the communication APS should be similar. We outline a radar covariance correction strategy to increase the similarity between the radar and communication APS. We also propose a metric to compare the similarity of the radar and communication APS that has a connection with the achievable rate. We present simulation results based on ray-tracing data. The results show that: (i) covariance correction improves the similarity of radar and communication APS, and (ii) the radar-assisted strategy significantly reduces the training overhead, being particularly useful in non-line-of-sight scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The braking process is a race against time. By controlling the wheel slip around the optimal point, the maximal friction can minimize braking distance, and it can be achieved when the tire and the vehicle reach a state named as the optimal slip ratio. The aim of this paper is to determine the optimal slip ratio online and reach and maintain the state until the end of braking. To achieve this objective, a new control system capable of estimating friction is proposed. The proposed control system consists of two main parts: an online extremum-seeking algorithm and a controller based on reachability. The former will generate the control commands for the controller, and the latter will track the provided commands. The proposed extremum-seeking algorithm is based on the bisection method with high searching efficiency, which can tolerate the measurement inaccuracy and noise to some degree. The maximal error caused by these kinds of inaccuracy has been quantized by a formula. The reachability-based controller can achieve short settling time and be insensitive to the noise; few parameter need to be tuned and each parameter has an explicit physical meaning. The stability and robustness of the control method have been proved. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system is illustrated by numerical simulations. The results show that the proposed method can achieve the shortest braking distance compared with other methods, even under extreme road conditions.},

  abstract     = {Fully variable valve actuation (FVVA) technology can improve engine performance by changing engine valve timing and valve lift in different conditions. To find the optimal valve profile parameters, engine power and emissions have to be taken into account due to the contradiction between them. Therefore, the paper presented a multi-objective decision making (MODM) strategy for valve profile parameters optimization. All profile parameters both intake valves and exhaust valves were optimized synchronously. We carried out the global synchronous MODM strategy with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) response surface method (RSM). First, a FVVA system was introduced. For the FVVA system, all valve profile parameters are variable. Second, based on GT-suite, an engine model was built and its valve sub-models were rebuilt to achieve the FVVA system. Some simulation results were used to train RSM. Third, based on the simulation results, engine valve parameters were analyzed and some response surface methods were compared. The results show that RBF method has a good agreement with simulation results. At the end, global MODM strategy which optimized both intake valves and exhaust valves synchronously for engine valve parameters was implemented at 2400 RPM based on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-Ⅱ) and RBF response surfaces obtained. With the obtained response surfaces, multi-objective virtual optimization which is relied on the obtained response surfaces rather than the GT-suite model was carried out. The virtual optimization results show that engine power can be improved by 1.63%, and the engine NO X emissions can be reduced by 2.75%. To verify the virtual optimization results, we carried out the simulation with the optimized parameters, and the virtual optimization results have a good agreement with results which were obtained from the simulation of the GT-suite model. Besides, the RSM-based virtual multi-objective optimization keeps faster optimization speed.},

It is an intricate system involving numerous variables that are spread over different levels: architecture, component technologies, sizing, and control. There is currently a lack of frameworks or tools that help in exploring the entire design space and in finding the global optimal solution throughout these levels. This article proposes a systematic methodology that tries to answer a part of this need. Starting from a set of chosen components, the methodology automatically generates all the possible graphs of architectures using constraint-programming techniques. A tailored representation is developed to picture the graphs. They are then transformed into other types of representation (tables describing the connections and the powertrain modes). Based on these representations, the architectures are automatically filtered and the most promising ones are selected. They are automatically assessed and optimized using a specifically developed general hybrid model that calculates the performance and fuel consumption of all the generated architectures. This model is inserted inside a bi-level optimization process: a Genetic Algorithm is used on the sizing and components level, while the Dynamic Programming is used on the control level. A case study is performed and the capability of the methodology is proven.},

We attempt drone power management without in-depth knowledge of aerodynamics and control theory. Instead, we introduce a novel power model of drones using physical parameters that can affect power consumption, such as the three-axis velocity and acceleration, drone height, wind velocity, and the weight and volume of payloads. We detail the experimental setup, power modeling, accuracy verification, and optimization for minimum energy paths. We achieved over 90% accuracy in power modeling without depending on aerodynamics. The proposed approach shows the feasibility of energy-aware rotary UAV flight trajectory optimization considering the external forces affecting drones such as wind.

First, a new spacing policy is considered to achieve string stability and improve the road capacity under virtual leader-bidirectional information flow. Then, to facilitate the controller design without the sign limitations of initial tracking errors (ITEs), a new transformed error function (TEF) is designed. Based on this, PPCC is employed for both individual vehicle stability and string stability directly. Subsequently, distributed adaptive low complexity tracking controllers via sliding mode control method are developed, which can guarantee that all the involved closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, an auxiliary system is introduced to tackle the effect of actuator saturation. Finally, numerical simulation examples and results are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed platoon control methods.},

The strategic behavior of the wireless charging aggregators highlights the interdependence between the electricity and transportation infrastructure systems. In each system, the strategic behavior of the entities is determined by formulating a bi-level optimization problem which is further transformed into a mathematical problem with equilibrium constraints. The upper-level problem maximizes the profit of the entities while the lower level problem ensures the balance between the demand and supply in each infrastructure system.

  abstract     = {Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of lithium-ion batteries plays an important role in intelligent battery management systems (BMSs). The current RUL prediction methods are mainly developed based on offline training, which are limited by sufficiency and reliability of available data. To address this problem, this paper presents a method for RUL prediction based on the capacity estimation and the Box-Cox transformation (BCT). Firstly, the effective aging features (AFs) are extracted from electrical and thermal characteristics of lithium-ion batteries and the variation in terms of the cyclic discharging voltage profiles. The random forest regression (RFR) is then employed to achieve dependable capacity estimation based on only one cell&#39;s degradation data for model training. Secondly, the BCT is exploited to transform the estimated capacity data and to construct a linear model between the transformed capacities and cycles. Next, the ridge regression algorithm (RRA) is adopted to identify the parameters of the linear model. Finally, the identified linear model based on the BCT is employed to predict the battery RUL, and the prediction uncertainties are investigated and the probability density function (PDF) is calculated through the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only estimate capacity with errors of less than 2%, but also accurately predict the battery RUL with the maximum error of 127 cycles and the maximum spans of 95% confidence of 37 cycles in the whole cycle life.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle lateral stability control is one of the most critical aspects of vehicle safety control. In this paper, aiming at keeping the vehicle states (lateral velocity and yaw rate) always in the vehicle stability regions, a novel lateral stability control method, which consists of shiftable region-based stability analyses and a corresponding stability controller, is proposed. In the stability analyses, two features of the stability regions are introduced. First, a shifting vector is formulated to explicitly describe the shifting feature of lateral stability regions, so that the shiftable regions are not necessarily re-estimated with respect to a varying steering angle input. Second, dynamic margins of the stability regions are formulated and applied to avoid the penetration of vehicle state trajectory with respect to the stability region boundaries. With these two features, the shiftable stability regions are feasible for an accurate stability analysis, where a projection method is adopted to determine the relative location/distance between the vehicle state point and the closest boundary of the stability region. Based on the analyses, a dynamic sliding mode controller, where the sliding surfaces are selected as the stability region boundaries with the proposed dynamic margins, is designed to keep the vehicle states always in the shiftable stability region. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed control design and analyses, two maneuvers through the co-simulation between Matlab/Simulink and CarSim, namely a high-speed constant cornering and a double lane change maneuvers, are presented and discussed.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel active front steering (AFS) control strategy including the upper controller and the lower controller is proposed to improve the yaw stability and maneuverability for steer-by-wire (SbW) vehicles. The adaptive recursive integral terminal sliding mode (ARITSM) control is adopted in the upper controller for guaranteeing the convergence performance of both the actual sideslip angle and the yaw rate with strong robustness and fast convergence rate. Then, a fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode (FNTSM) control with extreme learning machine (ELM) estimator to estimate its equivalent control is designed in the lower controller to track the desired front wheel steering angle calculated from the upper controller for driving the sideslip angle and the yaw rate to converge ideal value. It is shown that the upper controller takes two controlled variables (vehicle sideslip angle and yaw rate) and only one control input (front steering angle) into consideration, which can obtain a better performance compared with the case of using only one of these values. Since using the ELM technique in the lower controller to estimate the equivalent control of the FNTSM, not only the dependence of SbW system dynamics can be alleviated in the process of designing controller but also the excellent steering control performance can be achieved.

  abstract     = {This work investigates the real-time estimation of the state-of-charge (SoC) of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells for reliable, safe and efficient utilization. A novel attractive ellipsoid based sliding-mode observer (AESMO) algorithm is designed to estimate the SoC in real-time. The algorithm utilizes standard equivalent circuit model (ECM) of a Li-ion cell and provides reliable and efficient SoC estimate in the presence of bounded uncertainties in the battery parameters as well as exogenous disturbances. The theoretical framework of the observer design is not limited to the SoC estimation problem of Li-ion cell but applicable to a wider class of nonlinear systems with both matched and mismatched uncertainties. The main advantage of the proposed observer is to provide a fast and optimal SoC estimate based on minimization over the uncertainty bound. The proposed method is experimentally tested and evaluated for a range of temperatures using the hybrid pulse power characterization test (HPPC), EPA&#39;s Federal Test Procedure (FTP75) and Supplemental Test Procedure (US06) data, which demonstrate its effectiveness and feasibility.},

  abstract     = {In photovoltaic (PV) panels consisting of multiple substrings connected in series, mismatch in substring characteristics due to partial shading causes the significant reduction in energy yield and the occurrence of multiple maximum power points. In solar roofs of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), substring characteristics are always unavoidably mismatched due to the curvature of solar roofs, resulting in the mismatch issues similar to partial shading. Various kinds of differential power processing (DPP) converters have been proposed to preclude mismatch issues in traditional flat PV panels. The key contributions and novelties of this paper are summarized as follows. Firstly, uneven irradiance on the solar roof of Prius PHEVs is investigated. Secondly, existing DPP converter architectures are reviewed to select a proper DPP converter topology for PHEV applications. Thirdly, the selected topology is improved to be better suitable for PHEV applications, followed by the detailed operation analysis. Lastly, the experimental results of the laboratory and field testing using a prototype are presented. Field testing using an actual solar roof of Prius PHEV was performed, and the results demonstrated the daily energy yield enhancement of 4%-5% by the proposed DPP converter.},

A robust model-predictive-based fuzzy control method is employed to design the nonlinear control law.

The strategy is applied to plug-in electric vehicles operating in electric vehicle mode.

Under the new European driving cycle, average difference between the real-time battery temperature under the novel IMPC and its target temperature is 0.26 °C, and maximum temperature difference among modules is 1.03 °C. Moreover, compared with the on-off controller, model predictive control (MPC), and MPC with VSP, state of health under IMPC at the end of the driving cycle is 0.016%, 0.012%, and 0.008% higher, respectively.

Modern locomotives draw a large amount of unbalanced, inductive power from two phases of the grid through the traction transformer and lead to severe problems of voltage unbalance and reactive power existence. These problems are mitigated in the promising co-phase TPSS with the equipment of Railway Power Conditioner (RPC) or Hybrid Power Quality Conditioner (HPQC), in which HPQC can operate with a lower voltage and cost. However, HPQC installation involves the adoption of a bulky and expensive coupling transformer. In this paper, a co-phase TPSS employing asymmetric back-to-back modular multilevel converter (MMC) is proposed and it is named asymmetric three-leg hybrid HPQC (ATHPQC). Through the simulation verifications in this research work, the proposed design can effectively remove the additional and costly step-down coupling transformer, which is required by symmetric HPQC. For comprehensiveness of the ATHPQC design, internal circulating current modeling and analysis are investigated. Control system is implemented, including external compensating current control, internal balancing control and PWM module. ATHPQC is a promising alternative TPSS for next-generation high-speed rail.},

  abstract     = {Energy efficiency is extremely important for electric vehicles to improve their driving range. As the motor output energy directly acts on the tire, the tire slip energy generated by tire excessive slip will reduce the effective utilization of motor output energy, resulting in the reduction of energy efficiency, especially in the case of low friction coefficient, or even vehicle instability in some changes, such as slalom change, etc. Therefore, this paper designs an integrated chassis control and verifies the energy utilization. First, based on model predictive control (MPC), an integrated chassis controller is proposed by explicitly incorporating both motor energy and tire slip energy in the main objective function. Second, the reference control actions of the torque distribution method optimized for the motor energy, which facilitates solution-search process of MPC. Then, a semi-empirical UniTire tire slip energy model is proposed for derivation of the tire dissipation energy. Acceleration and stability tests are conducted by four in-wheel independent motor-drive electric vehicles (4WIMD-EVs) on winter proving ground, respectively. The acceleration change results show that both tire dissipation energy and motor output energy are well suppressed to achieve energy-efficient, and the energy utilization ratio of tire dissipation energy to motor output energy is only 35% to achieve stable acceleration. The slalom change verifies vehicle stability, and the results show that the slip ratio of four wheels only reaches to 0.04, and the motor output energy of four wheels is effectively utilized to generate differential yaw moment.},

  abstract     = {Battery management system (BMS) is one of the key subsystems of electric vehicle, and the battery state-of -charge (SOC) is a crucial input for the calculations of energy and power. Therefore, SOC estimation is a significant task for BMS. In this paper, a new method for online estimating SOC is proposed, which combines a novel adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) and a parameter identification algorithm based on adaptive recursive least squares (RLS). Specifically, according to the first order R-C network equivalent circuit model, the battery model parameters are identified online using the RLS with multiple forgetting factors. Based on the identified parameters, the novel AEKF is used to accurately estimate the battery SOC. The online identification of parameter tracks the varying model. At the same time, due to the novel AEKF algorithm to dynamically adjust the system noise parameter, excellent accuracy of the SOC real-time estimation is obtained. Experiments are set to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed SOC estimation method. The simulation test results indicate that under DST and UDDS conditions, the maximum absolute errors are less than 0.015 after filtering convergence. In addition, the maximum absolute error is less than 0.02 in the simulation of DST with current and voltage measurement noise, so is in DST with current offset sensor error. The tests indicate that the proposed method can accurately estimate battery SOC and has strong robustness.},

Existing perception approaches process the rich 3D LiDAR point clouds for object detection, tracking and recognition. These methods generally require an initial segmentation procedure containing two steps: (1) filter points as ground and non-ground points, and (2) cluster the non-ground points into objects. Leveraging a range image created in Spherical coordinates, this paper proposes a field-tested coarse-to-fine 3D point cloud segmentation framework to achieve both speed and accuracy. Under this framework, a basic version and an advanced version of segmentation algorithms are presented. In the basic version, we demonstrate how a coarse-to-fine scheme is applied in a range image for ground filtering and object clustering. In the advanced version, we move forward to reduce the processing time and correct the motion distortion by directly dealing with the data packets instead of the range image. Tests in the well-known KITTI dataset and field experiments in public roads have shown that the method significantly improves the speed of 3D point cloud segmentation whilst maintains good accuracy.},

However, modularity consists of hardware and software, and the existing powertrains only deal with the hardware side. To benefit from the full potential of modularity, the software side, which is related to the design of a suitable decentralized power allocation strategy (PAS), also needs to be taken into consideration. In the present study, a novel decentralized convex optimization (DCO) framework based on auxiliary problem principle (APP) is suggested to solve a multi-objective PAS problem in a modular fuel cell vehicle (MFCV). The suggested decentralized APP (D-APP) is leveraged for accelerating the computational time of solving the complex problem. Moreover, it enhances the durability and the robustness of the modular powertrain system as it can deal with the malfunction of the power sources. Herein, the operational principle of the suggested D-APP for the PAS problem is elaborated. Moreover, a small-scale test bench based on a light-duty electric vehicle is developed and several simulations and experimental validations are performed to verify the advantages of the proposed strategy compared to the existing centralized ones.},

  abstract     = {In video frame segmentation, many existing deep networks and contemporary approaches give a remarkable performance with the assumption that the only foreground is moving, and the background is stationary. However, in the presence of infrequent motion of foreground objects, sudden illumination changes in the background, bad weather, and dynamic background, the accurate foreground object(s) segmentation is a challenging task. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) based training shows fruitful results in various fields like image-to-image style transfer, image enhancement, semantic segmentation, image super-resolution, etc. The limited results of hand-crafted approaches for moving object segmentation (MOS) and the robustness of adversarial training for a given task inspired us to propose a novel approach for moving object segmentation (MOS). In this context, an end-to-end generative adversarial network (two generators) with recurrent technique is proposed for MOS and is named as RMS-GAN. The proposed RMS-GAN is able to incorporate foreground probability knowledge with residual and weight sharing based recurrent technique for accurate segmentation. The recurrent technique helps us to exhibit the temporal behavior between successive video frames, which is more prominent for any video processing applications. Also, to enhance the spatial coherence of the obtained foreground probability map using the generator-1 network, the cascaded architecture of two generators is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively on three benchmark video datasets for MOS.

  abstract     = {Individuals driving private cars in the urban environments to fulll their travel needs have become one of the major daily activities. In particular, unlike the travel with floating cars such as taxis or ride-hailing vehicles, the travel behaviors of private cars exhibit a certain degree of regularity based on daily travel demands. Understanding such travel behavior facilitates many applications, e.g., intelligent transportation, smart city planning, and location-based services (LBS). In this paper, we focus on extracting the regular travel behavior of private cars based on trajectory data analysis. Specifically, first, we construct a trajectory similarity matrix since the similarity of trajectories reflects regular travel behavior. To achieve this, we introduce the stay time and propose an Improved Edit distance with Real Penalty (IERP) to measure the temporal-spatial distance between trajectories. Then, we employ Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) to reduce the feature dimension of the similarity matrix. Finally, to identify the travel regularity from large set of unlabeled trajectory data, we propose a classification method based on transfer learning to migrate existing knowledge with the purpose of solving learning problems in the target domain with only a small amount of labeled trajectory data or even no data. Extensive experiments using large-scale real-world trajectory data demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively identify the regular travel pattern of private cars and obtain superior accuracy when compared with the existing methods. Our findings on discovering regular travel behaviors of private cars can be directly applied to applications including destination prediction, PoI recommendation and route planning.},

  abstract     = {With increasing vehicle density and the growth of accidents in urban areas, navigation management becomes a serious problem. Even though there is a multitude of navigation systems, ambulances, taxis, or even ordinary vehicles, sometimes find it challenging to reach their destinations on time. There are two main reasons for this difficulty: (i) lack of local knowledge of the area of navigation solutions and (ii) their inflexibility against unforeseeable situations that may occur on the roads. Indeed, the majority of navigation solutions are based only on the distance, the journey time, or even statistics related to the density of vehicles to plan the full paths, while neglecting the dynamic nature of the vehicle traffic. Also, their respective centralized architectures are unable to monitor both the traffic and unexpected events continuously and in real-time without not being overloaded by the flow of message exchanges between the road entities and the central processing entity. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a novel three-tier architecture, called SDN-enabled Approach for Vehicle Path-Planning (SEARCH), to enhance the situation awareness on urban roads, efficiently collect traffic information in real-time, and decide the best navigation strategy. The proposed architecture exploits Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), 5G based cellular systems, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to provide better and faster communication to changing road conditions. Based on these technologies, some parameters related to vehicles and driving environments, such as speed, distance, traffic jams, incidents, and travel flow, are efficiently collected and dynamically exploited to achieve faster paths between any existing pairs of locations. Furthermore, the deployed architecture of SEARCH can provide sufficient bandwidth to support all data traffic needs to update vehicles during their journey efficiently and in real-time. To evaluate the performance of our architecture, we conduct a series of simulations and perform a set of comparisons with relevant route planning algorithms. We found that the proposed architecture works effectively in terms of saving on driving time to reach any target destinations.},

However, the leakage of sensitive data increases the risk of attackers spying on drivers’ privacy. To achieve real-time traffic monitoring without leaking data privacy, we propose a privacy-preserving compressive sensing (PPCS) mechanism to timely achieve the entire road network traffic conditions and design a series of feasible and securecomputation protocols to accelerate the speed of data processing. Specifically, we utilize the cloud to extract the spatial-temporal correlation between different road segments and compute a small number of road segments’ traffic congestion rates. Notably, we adopt compressivesensing (CS) technology to estimate other unknown road segments’ traffic conditions based onseveral known values. Besides, a comprehensive security analysis indicates that the PPCS proposed can protect vehicular data from being disclosed. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the mechanism through simulated experiments of computational costs and communication overhead.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an accurate pedestrian detection scheme with privacy preservation (PPPD) based on pedestrian images. By utilizing the vector homomorphic encryption (VHE), private linear-transforming matrices are ingeniously designed to enable arbitrary permutation operations for the encrypted vectors. In this way, the feature vector extraction of the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) can be efficiently performed over the encrypted pedestrian images. Furthermore, due to the encrypted inner product calculations supported by VHE, an encrypted kernel matrix is constructed to generate multiple encrypted kernels (i.e., linear, polynomial, and Gaussian kernels). The pedestrian detection model based on the supported vector machine (SVM) can be securely trained over the encrypted kernels. With the proposed scheme, the extracted features of pedestrian images are not necessary to be returned to the image owner for decryption, such that the communication costs can be significantly reduced. In addition, the privacy of the whole process in pedestrian detection can also be guaranteed. Extensive experiments are conducted over multiple pedestrian datasets, and it is demonstrated that PPPD can achieve high accuracy of pedestrian detection with lower computation and communication overhead compared with the existing schemes.},

However, mismatch between the vehicle dynamics and its predictions, and improper classification of the agents can lead to undesirable behavior or collision. Robust approaches can handle the uncertainties, however, might result in a conservative behavior of the autonomous vehicle. This paper proposes an adaptive robust decision making strategy for autonomous vehicles to handle model mismatches in the prediction model while utilizing the confidence of the driver behavior to obtain less conservative actions.

The behavior of the tangential forces accounting for the gears interactions is proven to be obtained from the reduced-order model. Furthermore, the kinematic relations of the considered planetary gear set are automatically generated when developing the reduced-order rigid model.

Then, the Stackelberg Game theory is applied to solve the decision-making, which is formulated as a non-cooperative game problem. Besides, potential field is adopted in the motion planning model, which uses different potential functions to describe surrounding vehicles with different behaviors and road constraints. Then, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is utilized to predict the state and trajectory of the autonomous vehicle. Finally, the decision-making and motion planning is then integrated into a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Three testing scenarios considering different social behaviors of surrounding vehicles are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed approach. Testing results show that the integrated approach is able to address different social interactions with other traffic participants, and make proper and safe decisions and planning for autonomous vehicles, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {During the last years, the requirements for a fast and reliable design of electrical machines by applying optimization methods using finite element analysis (FEA), has become a subject of study. Due to their capabilities, permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) have become the preference choice for many applications, including electric vehicles (EVs) propulsion, water-pumping, robotics, or renewable power generation among others. This paper presents a novel methodology for designing and optimizing PMSMs using the torque-speed-efficiency map. The design-optimization algorithm requires as input, the torque-speed-efficiency map of the target motor, to define the required performance for the given application. The objective is to find the motor geometry which better approximates the target torque-speed-efficiency map. The PMSM is evaluated by using magneto-static FEA combined with direct-quadrature (d-q) electrical modeling, thus greatly reducing the computational burden when compared to conventional time-dependent FEA methods. The magneto-static FEA method calculates iron losses taking into account the magnetic flux density harmonic content by applying a time-space conversion approach. The design-optimization process takes into account the control strategy as well as losses separation, which is validated by using the public experimental data of the Toyota Prius and Camry PMSMs.},

The simulation results of the airgap flux density are shown and Fourier Transformation (FFT) analysis results agree well with the theoretically analyses results. Besides, the effects of design parameters of the proposed motor to the performances of the proposed motor are investigated. And it is found that reduced slot open could produce improved efficiency and decreased torque ripple. The efficiency of the proposed motor is relatively high within the operation range. A corresponding prototype is fabricated and the experiment validates the design.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a predictive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (P-ECMS) for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), assuming the availability of two levels of traffic information. The two levels of traffic information include 1) segmented traffic information available from mobile mapping applications, and 2) detailed velocity information, possibly obtained by short-term speed forecasting. Battery state-of-charge (SOC) reference waypoints are obtained by a simplified speed profile constructed from that segmented traffic information. The proposed P-ECMS adjusts its co-state or equivalence factor based on the difference between the future SOC obtained from short-horizon prediction and a future reference SOC. The benefits of the proposed P-ECMS are evaluated through vehicle simulations on a specified trip, compared against an adaptive ECMS (A-ECMS) with the same control parameters minus prediction. Simulation results on the trip demonstrate that the proposed P-ECMS can achieve a 9.7% reduction in the corresponding fuel consumption on average, compared to the A-ECMS across different combinations of initial co-state and control gain. Moreover, its performance is robust to variations in the initial co-state, the co-state update rate, and the prediction horizon, as well as to inaccuracies in the velocity prediction. Compared to the A-ECMS, the standard deviation in fuel consumption with the P-ECMS can be reduced by 96% from 84.1 to 3.4 grams.},

Our algorithm fuse the information from local onboard sensors as well as the observations of other vehicles or existing intelligent transportation system infrastructure such as road side units (RSU) to improve the precision and stability of localization and mobility tracking. Specifically, this framework incorporates the dynamic model of vehicles to achieve better localization and tracking performance.

  abstract     = {In modern transportation systems, the road intersections where multiple roads merge usually become the traffic bottleneck. Existing coordination solutions such as the traffic signs tend to be ineffective. In order to exploit the full potential of the road infrastructure, we try to address the optimal vehicle coordination problem, by which the traffic throughput can be maximized. We first formulate it as a general centralized collision-free traffic scheduling framework. The involved vehicles could cooperate via instructions from the coordination center, by solving the essential non-convex coordination problem. Aiming at the dynamic arrival of vehicles, a corresponding coordination strategy is thus proposed to achieve better quality of service (QoS), including the traffic throughput, and delay. The queue stability on each road can be guaranteed according to the Rate Stability Theorem, and Lyapunov Theorem. We then try to extend the proposed intelligent coordination framework to the multi-collision-set one, by which the traffic throughput can be significantly improved. A spatial domain based solution is given to solve the multi-collision-set coordination problem. Due to the essential non-convex formulation, high accuracy linearization approximate algorithms are also provided. In the numerical results, we show the vehicle maneuvers, and statistical coordination time as the performance evaluation. They validate our analysis, and show the performance advantages achieved by the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {In this work, wideband dual-polarized dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) arrays are designed for 5G mobile handsets and integrated with the sub-6GHz antenna. The dielectric resonators, surrounded by concentric air holes and metal vias, are excited by two orthogonal slots and fed through microstrip lines, providing a wide bandwidth from 25.3 GHz to 29.8 GHz. A high isolation of above 40 dB is obtained between the ports of the orthogonally polarized antennas. Based on the dual-polarized DRA, two 1 × 4 arrays are built and integrated with the longer metal frames of the handset, without occupying extra space on the chassis. The scanning angle for the proposed array is from 47° to 121° for the gain of above 10 dBi, and the overall handset antennas provide a large coverage efficiency of 80% for a threshold gain of 5 dBi. User effect has also been investigated, manifesting that the horizontally polarized antennas are less influenced by the hands in both the one-hand and the two-hand data modes. Furthermore, a sub-6GHz antenna is designed with a wide operating band from 0.7 GHz to 0.94 GHz simply by making use of the shorter frames and the dual-layered DRAs, with a small ground clearance of 2 mm remained. The performances of the arrays are validated by measuring the representative antennas. The proposed antenna is a good candidate for future handsets due to its high integration with the metal frames and with the LTE antenna, its large bandwidth and large coverage in free space and different user scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) system, excessive source compression can cause an error floor. In the original JSCC scheme based on double protograph LDPC (DP-LDPC) codes, only connections exist between check nodes (CNs) of the source protograph and variable nodes (VNs) of the channel protograph, and error floors are observed. In this paper, we investigate the joint protograph that forms the basis of a DP-LDPC code. The joint protograph consists of a source protograph, a channel protograph, and connections between the two protographs. Our main focus is on the complete-source-variable-linking (CSVL) protomatrix of the joint protograph, which determines the error floor of the DP-LDPC code. We propose a generalized source protograph extrinsic information transfer (GSP-EXIT) algorithm for evaluating the source decoding thresholds of the CSVL protomatrix. Based on the proposed algorithm, we analyze CSVL protomatrices with regular or irregular source protographs. We present design criteria for connections between VNs of the source protograph and CNs of the channel protograph. Such design rules will result in a higher source decoding threshold, which implies a lower error floor. We also propose a differential evolution algorithm for optimizing the source protograph. We present/compare analytical results and/with simulation results, and conclude that they are consistent.},

However, such configurations result in increased inter-cell interference. In this paper we model the effects of inter-cell interference on an LTE-Advanced network at two carrier frequencies. We consider two urban environments and four cell ranges. The effects of inter-cell interference are separated into inter-site interference and inter-sector interference. A site-specific 3D ray-tracing tool is used to model the communication channel between the base stations (serving and interfering links) and the user equipment terminals. The inter-site interference is first modelled in terms of its dominant interference proportion and then validated using previously reported field measurements recorded in London (U.K.). Secondly, the inter-site and inter-sector interference components are modelled as a function of user equipment relative position from the serving base stations. Our approach is compatible with the standardized ITU-R model and our proposal can easily be added to these international models. Our model requires no system layout for the interferers and reduces the required channel generation time by a factor of 12 compared with the system layout method.},

However, due to the Doppler effect caused by the mobility of users, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, high-speed trains and autonomous vehicles, the mmWave channel is changing rapidly. Spatial channel covariance, defined by long-term statistic information of channels, is a promising solution to reduce channel estimation frequency and can be used to design hybrid precoders. In this paper, we first proposed a highly mobile hybrid mmWave multi-user (MU) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system based on transition probabilities which can represent moving action of the MU. Secondly, we investigate compressive sensing based spatial channel covariance estimation based on the proposed dynamic system. We then propose a dynamic covariance forward-backward pursuit (DCFBP) algorithm which introduces forward and backward mechanisms to reconstruct the Hermitian sparse covariance matrix. We further explore the constructed MU sensing matrix quality for conventional sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. The updated sparse Bayesian learning (Updated-SBL) algorithm is developed to reduce the total squared coherence of a constructed sensing matrix with updated receive precoder. Numerical analysis demonstrates the proposed DCFBP method outperforms the benchmark methods. The total squared coherence of the proposed Updated-SBL algorithm is dramatically reduced. and the superiority of this algorithm is validated compared with other benchmark methods with comparable computation complexity.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the calibration of the Volcano ray-tracing engine against channel measurements collected in an urban environment with a state-of-the-art 28-GHz directional channel sounder. A discrete set of rays, representing planar wavefronts propagating between the transmitter and receiver, were extracted from the measurements and characterized in path gain, delay, and 3D angle-of-arrival through super-resolution techniques, with average errors of only 1.2 dB, 0.55 ns, and 2.05° respectively. The extracted rays were then tracked over space as the receiver, mounted on a mobile rover equipped with military-grade GPS, traversed 66 m while amassing a total of 488 channel acquisitions. The tracked rays were then mapped to rays predicted from ray-tracing, originating through specular reflection or diffuse scattering from ambient objects. The mapping enabled object-specific calibration, namely calibrating distinct diffuse-scattering models for buildings, vehicles, and foliage. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to calibrate ray-tracing with object-specific diffuse scattering models against rays individually mapped in the path gain, delay, angle, and space domains. Results, in terms of calibrated ray-tracing parameters, fit-error statistics, and lessons learned, are included. Our chief finding was that, while most papers on millimeter-wave ray-tracing do not even consider diffuse scattering, it accounted for 20% of the total received power, whereas diffraction accounted for less than 1%.},

  abstract     = {Global navigation satellite system multipath channel modeling is important for signal simulation and error mitigation in urban scenarios. However, there have not been sufficient studies on channel statistical models for dynamic land vehicles in eastern Asian cities. This paper presents both MULTIPATH and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel models for GPS L1CA and BDS B1I signals. They are based on an extensive field dataset collected in the Shanghai-Lujiazui area. In addition, a method is developed to estimate multipath components and NLOS signal parameters in a dynamic channel environment. It is found that the Gamma function best fits the distribution of MULTIPATH channel delays while the exponential function is better suited for the distribution of NLOS channel delays. Both MULTIPATH and NLOS channel signals follow a linear decline average power-delay trend and a zero-mean Gaussian distribution power scattering model. The Doppler fading frequency distribution for MULTIPATH and NLOS channels can be modeled by the Gaussian function except for the MULTIPATH channel signal at the low velocity range (0∼3 km/h), where an absolute exponential distribution is a better fit. The lifetime distribution for MULTIPATH and NLOS channels is represented by the generalized Pareto distribution function. These findings offer insights into the GNSS signal models in urban propagation channels and are essential to the development of accurate urban navigation systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel atmosphere-informed predictive satellite channel model for beyond the fifth-generation (B5G)/the sixth-generation (6G) satellite-terrestrial wireless communication systems at Q-band to model/predict channel attenuation at any specific time. The proposed channel model is a data-driven model based on either of two deep learning networks, i.e., multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The accuracy of the proposed channel model is measured by cumulative density function (CDF) of absolute error and mean square error (MSE) between modeled/predicted and measured channel attenuation. The complexity of the proposed channel model is assessedby the training time, loading time, and test time of deep learning networks. To further improve the accuracy of the proposed channel model, weather classification is developed at the stage of database construction. Based on our established channel and weather measurement campaign, the performance of the proposed data-driven channel model based on different deep learning networks, e.g., MLP and LSTM, with or without the weather classification is investigated and analyzed comprehensively. Finally, the close agreement is achieved between the channel attenuation modeled/predicted from the proposed atmosphere-informed predictive satellite channel model and the one from real channel measurements, verifying the utility of proposed channel model.},

In addition, we introduce a simplified channel modeling approach based on STV parameters of the AOA distribution and demonstrate that key statistical properties of massive MIMO channels, such as the STV temporal autocorrelation function and Doppler power spectral density, can be derived in closed form. As examples of application, we study multiple array-variant properties of three widely-used geometry-based stochastic models (GBSMs): the Unified Disk, Ellipse, and Gaussian scattering models. Furthermore, we present numerical and simulation results of the statistical properties of these three GBSMs and compare them with those obtained using the conventional spherical wavefront approach.

  abstract     = {Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) provides solutions to relieves overload cloudlet nodes, reduces service latency during peak times, and saves energy for battery-powered cloudlet nodes by offloading user tasks to a vehicle (vehicular node) by exploiting the under-utilized computation resources of nearby vehicular node. However, the wide deployment of VFC still confronts several critical challenges: lack of energy-latency tradeoff and efficient resource allocation mechanisms. In this paper, we address the challenges and provide an Energy-efficient dynamic Computation Offloading and resources allocation Scheme (ECOS) to minimize energy consumption and service latency. We first formulate the ECOS problem as a joint energy and latency cost minimization problem while satisfying vehicular node mobility and end-to-end latency deadline constraints. We then propose an ECOS scheme with three phases. In the first phase, we propose an overload cloudlet node detection policy based on resource utilization. In the second phase, we propose a computational offloading selection policy to select a task from an overloaded cloudlet node for offloading, which minimizes offloading cost and the risk of overload. Next, we propose a heuristic approach to solve the resource allocation problem between the vehicular node and selected user tasks for energy-latency tradeoff. Extensive simulations have been conducted under realistic highway and synthetic scenarios to examine the ECOS scheme&#39;s performance. In comparison, our proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of energy-saving, service latency, and joint energy-latency cost.},

Also, with the ever-increasing complexity of vehicular electronics and with the increasing number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) inside these next-generation vehicles, the need for verification of the firmware and software running on these ECUs using attestation techniques is heightened all the more. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure authentication and attestation scheme for attesting vehicles while they are on the roads. Since this attestation is proposed to be carried out on moving vehicles, there is also a need for authenticating the vehicles with the Road Side Units (RSUs) first before carrying out attestation. Therefore, a combined attestation and authentication scheme for verification of the vehicle ECU firmware is presented here. The ECU firmware running on the vehicles can be attested from the edge servers connected to the RSUs while the vehicles are in-transit and passing through these RSUs. We perform a security analysis of the proposed attestation and authentication protocol and compare it with other similar existing protocols. We also do a performance analysis of the proposed protocol and show the feasibility of its deployment.},

After linear MPC (LMPC) is formulated in time domain, a nonlinear MPC (NMPC) formulation in space domain is proposed in this paper to overcome the drawbacks of LMPC in time domain. To cope with computational complexity of NMPC in space domain, the nonlinear equality constraints are relaxed to inequality constraints to yield a convex optimization problem. Moreover, it is proven that the relaxed optimization problem can be recast as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem, for which the efficient numerical optimizers exist. The performance of NMPC is evaluated in simulation, which is compared with the time domain LMPC and a theoretically optimal receding horizon dynamic programming (RH-DP) solution. Results indicate that the proposed space domain NMPC outperforms LMPC in time domain and the optimal solution of NMPC is very close to the result of RH-DP.},

To maximize the performance of the suggested strategy, an optimal operating condition for the cold start procedure is sought first. In this respect, an experimental parametric study is performed to explore the impact of fan velocity, micro-short circuit, anode pressure, and purge procedure on the PEMFC cold start performance. After laying down the proper conditions, the proposed cold start procedure is implemented on a test bench for experimental validations. The self-heating process is based on an online adaptive algorithm that maximizes the PEMFC&#39;s internal heat depending on its operating parameters’ variation. In fact, this algorithm attempts to keep the current density at high levels, leading to PEMFC&#39;s performance improvement achieved by membrane hydration and temperature increase. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, which presents a fast and cost-effective PEMFC&#39;s cold start.},

The result is then used in a multi-objective Constrained Optimization Problem (COP) to determine the non-dominated (Pareto optimal) solutions according to selected objectives functions. Non-dominated solutions are computed by optimizing weighted-sum scalar functions as well as minimizing different types of distances to a design reference. A case study is explored to design a battery pack for an electric motorcycle.

Railway System Operators (RSOs), also encouraged by market deregulation, are thus examining how to update infrastructures and vehicles and/or apply new operating strategies. Given the intrinsic relation between railway systems and their primary feeding grid, each measure applied to a railway system impacts directly on the power grid which supplies the system. Against this background, this paper aims to ascertain the impact of an energy efficiency strategy applied by the RSO system on its primary grid. The energy-efficient strategy is identified as to preserve timetable stability and service quality in a passenger-oriented perspective. Moreover, a method to model the interaction between the systems in terms of power flow exchanges is proposed. The model is used to verify how an eco-driving technique applied to a metro system affects the state variables of the distribution grid. In particular, the primary grid, the traction power substations and the railway system are modelled according to real data. The case study is the Metro Line 1 operating in the city of Naples (Italy). The numerical simulations are carried out with a two-step procedure: first, the power requirements of the rolling stock as a function of the imposed operating service are calculated by OpenTrack ® software; the state variables of the distribution grid are then evaluated by means of the power flow approach.},

In particular, for a single source-destination pair in which a radio frequency (RF)-powered source sends status updates about some physical process to a destination node, we minimize the long-term average AoI at the destination node. The problem is modeled as an average cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which, the generation times of status updates at the source, the transmissions of status updates from the source to the destination, and the wireless energy transfer (WET) are jointly optimized. After proving the monotonicity property of the value function associated with the MDP, we analytically demonstrate that the AoI-optimal policy has a threshold-based structure w.r.t. the state variables. Our numerical results verify the analytical findings and reveal the impact of state variables on the structure of the AoI-optimal policy.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been recognized as a promising technology to be used in a wide range of civilian, public and military applications. However, given their limited payload and flight time, multiple UAVs may have to be harnessed for accomplishing complex high-level tasks, where a control center can be employed for coordinating their actions. In this article, we consider image classification tasks in UAV-aided exploration scenarios, where the coordination of multiple UAVs is implemented by a ground fusion center (GFC) positioned in a strategic, but inaccessible location, such as a mountain top, where recharging the battery is uneconomical or may even be infeasible. On-board cameras are carried by each UAV and then, federated learning (FL) is invoked for reducing the communication cost between the UAVs and the GFC, and the computational complexity imposed on the GFC. In our proposed FL-aided classification approach, initially local training is performed by each UAV based on the locally collected images to create a local model. Then, each UAV sends its locally acquired model to the GFC via a fading wireless channel, where a global model is generated, which is then fed back to each UAV for the next round of their local training. In order to further minimize the computational complexity imposed on the GFC by the UAVs, weighted zero-forcing (WZF) transmit precoding (TPC) is used at each UAV based on realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI). The system performance attained is evaluated by simulations, showing that the proposed system is capable of attaining a high classification accuracy at relatively low communication cost.},

The proved random channel coding scheme yields to an achievable rate formula which is identical to its counterpart obtained in the non-MRs system as long as a non-manipulable condition is satisfied. No pre-shared secret or secret transmission is needed for the proved scheme. Hence the obtained rate is generally larger than those achieved based on secret transmission schemes. In addition, we further prove that the systems with binary symmetric channels (BSCs) and binary erasure channels (BECs) are readily to satisfy the non-manipulable condition. Simulations based on turbo codes are also presented. The results indicate that our theoretical work is still available to practical channel codes.},

The proposed strategy relies on graphical constraint conditions, and allows the elimination of restrictions corresponding to the objective of throughput maximization. Moreover, the proposed GB-MPA strategy can be combined with the time-switching factor optimization by employing an alternating optimization procedure for performance enhancement.

Specifically, the transmit beamforming and the phases of the low-cost passive elements on the IRS are alternatively optimized until the convergence.

  abstract     = {Device-free respiration wireless monitoring is an emerging vital sign monitoring technique which could estimate respiration rate in a contactless manner by analyzing the cyclical influence of human respiration on surrounding wireless signals. This technique has a wide application prospect in the fields of intelligent vehicles, fatigue driving detection, and smart space. State-of-art methods have achieved excellent performance in monitoring the respiration of a single person. However, when there are multi-person need to be monitored simultaneously, most of existing methods will fail due to the aliasing of multiple respiratory signals. To solve this problem, we explore to separate multiple respiratory signals through a multi-domain analysis method. Specifically, we try to observe the influenced wireless signals from both the Doppler domain and angle of arrival (AoA) domain. We design a super resolution method to build the two-dimensional Doppler AoA map (DAM), and then, estimate the respiration rate of each person by clustering and analyzing the DAM. Experimental results on commodity WiFi hardware show that it can monitor the respiration rate of three persons simultaneously with an accuracy of 97.5%.},

All users harvest ambient energy to power their data uploading.

To be specific, by taking advantage of the directional communication property of mmWave communication, we first propose a generalized space domain index modulation (GSDIM) scheme to improve the system reliability. In the proposed GSDIM scheme, the user equipment (UE) uses different beam direction combinations to carry additional information bits, i.e., using multi-domain modulations to optimize transmission. Then, we derive the symbol error rate (SER) of the proposed GSDIM, and design digital precoding matrices to minimize the SER. It is shown that the SER minimization problem is a non-convex problem, and we propose an iterative method to solve it. Numerical results show that the proposed GSDIM scheme can achieve a lower system SER as compared with the existing counterpart.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the impact of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wobbling on the coherence time of the wireless channel between UAVs and a ground user equipment (UE), using a Rician multi-path channel model. We consider two different scenarios for the number of UAVs: (i) single UAV scenario (SUS), and (ii) multiple UAV scenario (MUS). For each scenario, we model UAV wobbling by two random processes, i.e., the Wiener and sinusoidal processes, and characterize the channel autocorrelation function (ACF) which is then used to derive the coherence time of the channel. For the MUS, we further show that the UAV-UE channels for different UAVs are uncorrelated from each other. A key observation in this paper is that even for small UAV wobbling, the coherence time of the channel may degrade quickly, which may make it difficult to track the channel and establish a reliable communication link.},

  abstract     = {In practical multi-antenna systems, the design of precoding and power control is not straightforward even for multi-input single-output (MISO) systems because of the distortion caused by nonlinear power amplifiers. Through analysis of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), we found that the equal gain transmission scheme can achieve the maximum SINR of a nonlinear MISO system only at the point of local optimal transmit power. Then we derived an approximated optimal transmit power for the nonlinear MISO system. To maximize the SINR in all transmit power region, we propose a precoding and power control algorithm for a MISO system with nonlinear power amplifiers under power constraint. By simulation, we show that the proposed scheme can achieve the local optimum SINR, and outperform other baseline precoding techniques.},

  abstract     = {While the Poisson point process (PPP) has been widely employed to model the user distribution in many network design problems, an existing challenge is that it often reveals inaccuracy in small-cell networks. In this paper, instead of employing PPP, we capture the randomness of user equipment (UE) by collecting many their realizations. Specifically, we focus on the millimeter-wave (mmWave) base station (BS) deployment problem in an urban geometry, based on the application of a scenario sampling approach, previously introduced for large-scale optimization, to quantitatively sample a portion of the UE realizations. Motivated by the scenario sampling, a reduced-scale mmWave BS deployment problem is formulated, whose optimal solution is attained by the proposed low-complexity iterative search algorithm. A required number of samples that guarantee a specified majority of the link quality constraints is analyzed. Simulation results verify the scenario sampling theory and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The direct position determination (DPD) algorithms have been shown to outperform conventional two-step methods in localization accuracy under poor observation conditions (e.g., low signal-to-noise ratios or short signal observation durations). In this paper, we consider the distributed DPD of a static source in large-scale sensor networks. Different from the centralized DPD (CDPD) algorithms where all the raw signal samples are transmitted globally to a fusion center to solve for the source position, in our method the signal samples are only exchanged locally between neighboring sensors, and the source position is estimated using the proposed DPD algorithm distributively. The problem-specific cost function, which is different from the cost function of CDPD, is first derived. To obtain the cost function at each sensor, we propose to transmit the low-dimensional sufficient statistics across the sensor networks instead of the original high-dimensional raw signal samples, and to reconstruct the cost function via simple interpolations. Simplification of cost function evaluation is also developed to further reduce complexity. Finally, source position is estimated at each sensor efficiently via the importance sampling algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over existing adaptive distributed DPD as well as the two-step algorithms under poor observation conditions, and its computational efficiency is significantly improved compared with the CDPD.},

Vehicles ordered according to their distances to their corresponding roadside units (RSUs) are then served by using power domain NOMA. Adopting analytical tools from the stochastic geometry, we then analyse the outage performance of the system.

Unlike typical analog combining architectures with PS numbers equaling the number of receiver antennas, the number of PSs in this study is less than that of receiver antennas; this feature saves on equipment costs and improves power efficiency. We jointly optimize the receiver antenna selection and analog combiner design with low-resolution PSs to maximize the spectral efficiency of the resultant device. Because the formulated joint optimization problem is non-convex, we propose a probabilistic evolutionary optimization algorithm with an explicit expression for learning the tilting parameters of the designed sampling distribution.

To reduce complexity, the tree is truncated by deleting the intermediate paths that are less likely to be the shortest path. By this means, the truncated tree based design reduces exponential time complexity to linear time complexity.

In this article, we characterize the energy efficiency (EE) of wireless transmission over fading channels from individual transmission session perspective. Specifically, we apply a statistical EE metric to analyze and optimize ideal continuous rate adaptation (CRA) and continuous power adaptation (CPA) transmission schemes. The resulting statistical characterization establishes an EE performance limit for data transmissions over fading channels and facilitates a direct tradeoff analysis between maximal achievable EE and instantaneous latency requirement.},

In this paper, a cache and SIC enabled downlink multiple-input-multiple-output NOMA cellular network with randomly distributed users is studied. To theoretically derive its outage performance, the Wishart matrices are introduced to express the achievable rates of users. From the joint probability density function of the unordered eigenvalues of Wishart matrices, we obtain the moment generating function of the achievable rates. The exact outage probabilities are obtained by employing the inverse Laplace transform. Numerical results demonstrate that our theoretically derived outage probabilities match the simulation results.},

Moreover, a pilot-based differential encoding method is presented to mitigate the impact of the feedback error, thereby improving the convergence of turbo equalization. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed equalizer outperforms the linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation-based turbo equalizer for coherent systems in medium-to-high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, while enjoys significantly reduced computational complexity, and its performance is more robust against the change of Doppler frequency.},

Most of the existing works on the combination of the backscatter communications and the “harvest-then-transfer” (HTT) protocol focus on the throughput maximization, yet the study on the energy efficiency (EE) maximization is still lacking. Driven by this observation, this paper studies the EE maximization for an RF-powered backscatter network with the HTT protocol. Multiple hybrid devices (HDs) can either use the backscatter mode by backscattering energy signals from the power beacon (PB) to the reader or use the HTT protocol to first harvest energy from the PB, and then to transmit data to the reader. The proposed scheme aims to optimize multiple parameters including PB&#39;s transmit power and time, HDs&#39; transmit power and time allocation between the backscatter mode and the HTT mode for maximizing the EE of all the HDs. An iterative algorithm is developed to find the optimal solution for the proposed resource allocation scheme. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of EE of all the HDs.},

We derive the diversity-multiplexing tradeoffs (DMTs), and show that NIDF achieves the DMT upper bound whereas SIDF is slightly away from the upper bound at the medium multiplexing gain region. We also show how the DMT optimizing resource allocation factor varies for different multiplexing gains.

We propose to employ the trigonometric interpolation technique to reconstruct the spatial channel profile and to use Nyquist sampling theorem and spherical wave mode theory to determine the ASI. Our analysis demonstrated that the half-power beam width (HPBW) of the antenna is a good approximation for the ASI setting to ensure accurate directional scanning measurements. The reconstructed power-angle-delay profile (PADP), composite power angular spectrum (PAS), delay and angle characteristics match well with those of the target in the measured data when the ASI is set to the antenna HPBW.},

We formulate an IOS phase shift optimization problem to maximize the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) of the MU. The optimal phase shift of the IOS is analysed, and a branch-and-bound based algorithm is proposed to design the IOS phase shift in a finite set.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we are the first to analyse the performance of the carrier sense adaptive transmission (CSAT) scheme in the large-scale coexisting LTE-U and WiFi networks (CLWNets) sharing multiple unlicensed channels (UCs). As the capability of idle channel detection (ICD) has significant effect on the medium access probability (MAP) of WiFi access points (WAP), the closed-from MAP of the WAP and the explicit expressions of downlink successful transmission probabilities (STPs) of LTE-U-base-station (LBS) users and WAP users are derived with/without equipping ICD capability in WAPs, where the positions of LBSs and WAPs are modelled following the Matern hard core process. Based on the derived STPs, the fairness between the LTE-U network and the WiFi network, which is defined as the minimum weighted area spectral efficiency (ASE) of LBS and WAP users, is analysed versus the number of UCs, the fairness weighting factor and the densities of LBSs and WAPs. Furthermore, the optimal off-duty-cycle (DC) ratio to maximize the minimum weighted ASE is obtained based on the derived STPs in the on-DC and off-DC durations. Our results show that the fairness between the LTE-U and WiFi networks can be achieved by adjusting the off-DC ratio under low weighting factors. The increase of UC number leads to a decrease of the optimal off-DC ratio, enhancing the transmission duration of LBSs, and the shrink of UC bandwidth only causes negligible reduction in the CLWNets ASE. In addition, the WAP medium access mechanism mode with ICD capability is preferable as it can provide a maximum of 70% ASE enhancement in the CLWNets.},

Therefore, wireless-gigabit (WiGig) transmission has been developed based on the IEEE 802.11ad and 802.11ay standards of wireless local area networks (WLANs) in the 60-GHz band. To overcome the high path loss of mmWave, beamforming and beam-sector based training protocols are specified in 802.11ad/ay. With the increase in service demand, more WiGig access points (APs) will be deployed, hence the transmission frame structure of beam control should be adjustable for supporting both multiple APs and multiple users. The conventional exhaustive beam search (EBS) scheme has a potentially excessive complexity for high number of beams. Furthermore, assigning fixed training slots for users will lead to high-latency beam training under EBS. Hence, we design an advanced protocol for multiple APs and multiple users. Based on this protocol, we propose coordinated multiple AP multiuser training (CMMBT) including variable length framing and adjustable beam training. Our simulations demonstrate that CMMBT provides flexible training control and achieves the lowest training latency and highest average throughput performance amongst the state-of-the-art solutions in the open literature.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) as a promising application of Internet of Things (IoT) has played a significant role in autonomous driving, by connecting intelligent vehicles. Autonomous driving needs to process the mass environmental sensing data in coordination with surrounding vehicles, and makes an accurate driving judgment accordingly. Since the vehicles always have limited computing resources, processing these data in parallel with efficient task scheduling is one of the most important topics. Most current work focuses on formulating special scenarios and service requirements as optimization problems. However, the complicated and dynamic environment of vehicular computing is hard to model, predict and control, making those previous methods unscalable and unable to reflect the real scenario. In this paper, a Multi-task Deep reinforcement learning approach for scalable parallel Task Scheduling (MDTS) is firstly devised. For avoiding the curse of dimensionality when coping with complex parallel computing environments and jobs with diverse properties, we extend the action selection in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to a multi-task decision, where the output branches of multi- task learning are fine-matched to parallel scheduling tasks. Child tasks of a job are accordingly assigned to distributed nodes without any human knowledge while the resource competition among parallel tasks is leveraged through shared neural network layers. Moreover, we design an appropriate reward function to optimize multiple metrics simultaneously, with emphasis on specific scenarios. Extensive experiments show that the MDTS significantly increases the overall reward compared with least- connection scheduling and particle swarm optimization algorithm from -16.71, -0.67 to 2.93, respectively.},

First, a theoretical analysis is presented to quantitatively reveal the correlation between vehicle mobility and the success ratio of vehicle-assisted data delivery. Based on the findings in analysis, DeepVDD adopts a novel multi-headed neural network to determine the strategies for vehicles to deliver data. Comprehensive evaluations have been executed based on the real taxi mobility data in Tokyo, Japan. The results have validated that, compared with other state-of-art algorithms, DeepVDD not only improves the success ratio of data delivery, but also significantly reduces the communication overhead of vehicular networks.},

  abstract     = {The millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has drawn intensive attention with abundant band resources. In this paper, we consider the popular content distribution (PCD) problem in the mmWave vehicular network. In order to offload the communication burden of base stations (BSs), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is introduced into the PCD problem to transmit contents between on-board units (OBUs), and improve the transmission efficiency. We propose a full-duplex (FD) cooperative scheme based on coalition formation game, and the utility function is provided based on the maximization of the number of received contents. The contribution of each member in the coalition can be transferable to its individual profit. While maximizing the number of received contents in the fixed time, the cooperative scheme also ensures the individual profit of each OBU in the coalition. We evaluate the proposed scheme by extensive simulations in mmWave vehicular networks. Compared with other existing schemes, the proposed scheme has superior performances on the number of possessed contents, and system fairness. Besides, the low complexity of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by the switch operation number, and CPU time.},

However, it is not suitable for special industry areas where privacy is concerned, and it cannot be used in environments where light conditions are not satisfied. In this paper, we propose Tsarray, an RFID-based method that intelligent senses access control events by vertically deploying large-scale passive tags to the attachment plane. By fully studying the correlation between access control events, and the received RF signals, we choose a tag array deployment strategy of 4 rows, and 15 columns to eliminate environmental interference, and extract distinctive time slot tag array maps for direction tracking. Besides, by setting the same direction conversion module, the signal feature differences caused by the direction are eliminated. Moreover, we built a model to extract the spatiotemporal characteristics, and explore the model structure that is most suitable for the access control event. We evaluate the performance of Tsarray in a real environment, and used a reserved unseen test sample as a system test. Results show that our system can achieve the optimal performance in direction tracking, the accuracy of the 10 volunteers&#39; recognition is 97.5%, the accuracy of the height recognition is 95%, and the accuracy of the weight recognition is 92.5%.},

To improve the performance, we propose a novel fine-grained DFL method using the phase response shift (PRS) to localize targets, which can mitigate the effect of multipath, and noise without phase ambiguity. The phases of received multi-frequency signals are linearly fitted as the phase response (PR). The shift of target-induced PR with respect to non-target PR is considered as the PRS. The PRSs at every location of the monitored area are observed with different length communication links, and are summarized as a PRS weight model. The PRS-based radio tomography imaging (PRSRTI) localization model is derived, and utilizes the PRS, and the weight model to localize targets. Experimental results validate that its performance is obviously higher than the received signal strength based radio tomography imaging (RTI).},

  abstract     = {Edge intelligence is an emerging concept referring to processes in which data are collected and analyzed and insights are delivered close to where the data are captured in a network using a selection of advanced intelligent technologies. As a promising solution to solve the problems of insufficient computing capacity and transmission latency, the edge intelligence-empowered Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is being widely investigated in both academia and industry. However, data sharing security in edge intelligent IoV is a challenge that should be solved with priority. Although attribute-based encryption (ABE) is capable of addressing this challenge, many time-consuming modular exponential operations and bilinear pair operations as well as serial computing cause ABE to have a slow decryption speed. Consequently, it cannot address the response time requirement of edge intelligent IoV. Given this problem, an ABE model with parallel outsourced decryption for edge intelligent IoV, called ABEM-POD, is proposed. It includes a generic parallel outsourced decryption method for ABE based on Spark and MapReduce. This method is applicable to all ABE schemes with a tree access structure and can be applied to edge intelligent IoV. Any ABE scheme based on the proposed model not only supports parallel outsourced decryption but also has the same security as the original scheme. In this paper, ABEM-POD has been applied to three representative ABE schemes, and the experiments show that the proposed ABEM-POD is efficient and easy to use. This approach can significantly improve the speed of outsourced decryption to address the response time requirement for edge intelligent IoV.},

  abstract     = {In multi-user downlink small cell networks, cooperative resource allocation (RA) within a small cell cluster is a key technique to enhance network capacity. However, capacity-maximizing RA in frequency-selective fading channels requires global channel state information (CSI) of users within a small cell cluster, which makes it infeasible in practical networks with limited direct link capacity. To circumvent this global CSI assumption, most of the existing studies on RA have been based on several CSI assumptions such as local CSI and local CSI at the transmitters (CSIT). Nevertheless, cost functions with local CSI or local CSIT in the literature rely on heuristic formulations, because the sum-rate cannot be computed if without global CSI. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based RA algorithm to maximize the sum-rate for any given limited information on instantaneous CSI or sum-rate at the previous period. The proposed scheme is not restricted to certain CSI assumptions, but attempts to find the best RA for any given information such as quantized local CSI and quantized local CSIT; thus, it is applicable to any given direct link capacity. The proposed algorithm is self-adaptive in time-varying channels, since it is not divided into training and test phases. We modify the target neural network (TNN) scheme to enhance the sum-rate and the convergence speed. Numerical simulations confirm that: i) the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithms even under the same CSI assumption such as local CSI and local CSIT; ii) a flexible trade-off between the amount of CSI and the sum-rate is realizable in practical systems.},

Specifically, the UAVs employ radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to supply energy towards the sensor nodes, and the communication services are available via wireless information transfer (WIT) systems. To achieve balanced energy consumption among UAVs, we maximize the energy utilization efficiency of UAVs, and minimize the communication delay by optimizing the trajectory jointly with constraints of the energy capacity, and the area of the target region. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer programming problem that is a variation of multiple traveling salesman problem. Thus we present a heuristic algorithm that combines the evolutionary algorithm, and variable neighborhood search to achieve the optimal visited sequence of the sensor nodes. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

To make an accurate analysis on the network performance, and provide guidelines for the practical design of cell association and network deployment strategy, in this work, we consider a drone-assisted heterogeneous network that employs a flexible biased cell association policy and adopts a more general channel model that incorporates line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components for both air-to-ground (ATG) and ground-to-ground (GTG) transmissions. We develop a unifying analytical framework to evaluate the network performance in terms of coverage probability, area spectral efficiency (ASE) and user throughput. Our results show that 1) deploying DSCs to complement traditional TSCs can only deteriorate the network performance within the ultra-dense network region, 2) by optimally setting the bias factor for cell association policy, the network performance can be further enhanced.},

  abstract     = {The multi-UAV network is promising to extend conventional networks by providing broader coverage, and better reliability. Nevertheless, the broadcast nature of wireless signals, and the broader coverage expose multi-UAV communications to the threats of passive eavesdroppers. Recent studies mainly focus on securing a single legitimate link, or communications between a UAV, and multiple ground users in one/two-UAV-aided networks, while the physical layer secrecy analysis for hierarchical multi-UAV networks is underexplored. In this paper, we investigate a general two-tier UAV network consisting of multiple UAV transmitters (UTs), and multiple UAV receivers (URs) in the presence of multiple UAV eavesdroppers (UEs). To protect all legitimate UT-UR links against UEs at the physical layer, we design a two-stage framework consisting of a UT-UR association stage, and a cooperative transmission stage. Specifically, we formulate the secure transmission problem into a many-to-one matching game followed by an overlapping coalition formation (OCF) game, taking into account the limited capabilities, and the throughput requirements of URs, as well as the transmission power constraints of UTs. A matching algorithm, and an OCF algorithm are proposed to solve these two sequential games whose convergences, and stabilities are guaranteed theoretically. Simulation results show the superiority of our algorithms, and the effectiveness of our two-stage game framework in the terms of secrecy performance.},

  abstract     = {In supervised learning, labeled data are provided as inputs and then learning is used to classify new observations. Error tolerance should be guaranteed for classifiers when they are employed in critical applications. A widely used type of classifiers is based on voting among instances (referred to as single voter classifiers) or multiple voters (referred to as ensemble classifiers). When the classifiers are implemented on a processor, Time-Based Modular Redundancy (TBMR) techniques are often used for protection due to the inflexibility of the hardware. In TBMR, any single error can be handled at the cost of additional computing either once for detection or twice for correction after detection; however, this technique increases the computation overhead by at least 100%. The Voting Margin (VM) scheme has recently been proposed to reduce the computation overhead of TBMR, but this scheme has only been utilized for k Nearest Neighbors (kNNs) classifiers with two classes. In this paper, the VM scheme is extended to multiple classes, as well as other voting classifiers by exploiting the intrinsic robustness of the algorithms. kNNs (that is a single voter classifier) and Random Forest (RF) (that is an ensemble classifier) are considered to evaluate the proposed scheme. Using multiple datasets, the results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the computation overhead by more than 70% for kNNs with good classification accuracy and by more than 90% for RF in all cases. However, when extended to multiple classes, the VM scheme for kNNs is not efficient for some datasets. In this paper, a new protection scheme referred to as k + 1 NNs is presented as an alternative option to provide efficient protection in those scenarios. In the new scheme, the computation overhead can be further reduced at the cost of allowing a very low percentage of errors that can modify the classification outcome.},

To achieve fast localization and tracking in the highly dynamic channel environment (e.g., time-varying transmit power and intermittent signal), we formulate a flight decision problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with the main objective of avoiding redundant UAV flight path. Then, we propose an enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate multiple UAVs performing real-time target tracking. The core of the proposed scheme is a feedback control system that takes into account the uncertainty of the channel estimate. We prove that the proposed algorithm can converge to the optimal decision.

  abstract     = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm because of its good performance for computation-intensive and latency-critical applications. However, the enormous computing requests from computation service subscribers (CSSs) still cannot be satisfied by pre-existing edge computation nodes (ECNs). To fully utilize the advantage of the MEC network, a hierarchical computation offloading framework is developed under network virtualization (NV) scenario. Accordingly, a two-step sequential process is designed to stimulate the proposed framework. In the first step, an incentive mechanism is proposed in which more temporary ECNs can be motivated by MEC operator and then join the MEC network. Without perfect ECN information, the optimal contract items (the ECN&#39;s CPU contribution and reward) between the MEC operator and ECNs can be achieved by taking account of individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatible (IC) constraints. After acquiring the ECNs&#39; CPU contributions, the computing resource allocation problem between the ECNs and CSSs is then considered in the second step. Since the CSSs have private information, a Bayesian matching game with externality is leveraged to model the problem. Whereas, the conventional resident-oriented Gale-Shapley (RGS) algorithm cannot ensure the stability. Hence, an iterative matching algorithm that can always converge to stable results is developed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed two-step sequential decision process can significantly improve social welfare considering the practical scenarios, with reasonable computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Smart, and green cities impose stringent requirements on spectral efficiency (SE), and energy efficiency (EE) of vehicular networks. For the current vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), vehicle&#39;s mobility leads to rapid topology changes, and high channel uncertainty. However, clustering schemes for establishing stable clusters, and robust power control (RPC) combating with channel fluctuation are investigated independently. In this paper, joint clustering, and RPC schemes are proposed to optimize the SE, and EE of the involved VANETs. Via the same fixed-length slot, the synchronized interference constraints of cluster heads (CHs) are formed, and offer conditions for RPC. Due to the random channel fluctuations, all CHs&#39; synchronized interference constraints are formulated as probability constraints. Besides, a pricing-based utility which avoids the separate optimization between SE, and EE is introduced, and the price&#39;s impact on the tradeoff between them is involved. Since the probability constraints are intractable, and the unified utility is nonconvex, the Bernstein approximation, and successive convex approximation (SCA) are used to transform the problem into a tractable convex one. Through dual decomposition, two RPC algorithms are proposed to determine the optimal solutions for the fixed price $C$, and the optimal price $C^*$, respectively. Numerical simulations are used to evaluate the algorithmic performances in high-dynamic system, and the results show that the proposed algorithms are effective. The validity of the clustering method, and the proposed RPC scheme is further verified by comparisons.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a civil aircrafts augmented space-air-ground integrated networks (CAA-SAGIN) architecture, where each mobile user can access multiple platforms simultaneously. With the target of ensuring fairness, we put forward the fair optimization strategies including resource allocation and resource auction. In the resource allocation, we formulate a service-oriented fair (SOF) resource allocation problem in order to minimize the difference between the allocated and required data rate. After introducing convex-relaxation and logarithmic approximation, the joint optimal solutions of subchannel and power allocation can be obtained by SOF iteration algorithm. Aiming at managing the terrestrial network overload, we present a user update mechanism. After applying SOF resource allocation for selected original users in sky access platforms, we propose a resource auction scheme so as to maximize the utility for both sides. First, we decompose the original problem into several subproblems and transform them into their lower bound by first-order approximation. Then, we can obtain the joint optimal solution with an alternating descent iterative method. From simulation results, we can find that CAA-SAGIN can bring great benefits to traditional terrestrial networks. In addition, the proposed resource allocation and auction schemes are significant in terms of telecommunication and economic parameters.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a framework to detect hazardous spots on roads by combining mobile sensing on commercial-use vehicles with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) opportunistic networking. The most likely hazardous spots are the locations where sudden braking or change in direction is necessitated. In the proposed system, a vehicle periodically makes a tentative decision regarding the state of the road using its own sensing data by a machine learning (ML)-based technique; however, the final decision is made by applying the Viterbi algorithm. A hidden Markov model (HMM) was introduced in the Viterbi algorithm for numerically representing the spatial relationship between the condition of the road and sequential output of the local hazardous spot detector. Numerical simulation analyses were conducted by using a real acceleration dataset of more than 25 commercial-use vehicles in Kakogawa City, Japan. It was shown that the Viterbi algorithm significantly improved the accuracy of detecting hazardous spots as compared to the tentative decisions made by support vector machines (SVMs). In addition, our study introduced a V2V cooperative data processing technique to achieve higher accuracy in the detection of perilous spots. The vehicles shared their local decisions through an opportunistic networking technology. Trellis pruning was integrated into the Viterbi algorithm based on the shared decisions for emitting the final decisions. It was demonstrated that the proposed V2V cooperative framework had the potential to enhance the accuracy of detecting hazardous spots for all the vehicles in a community.},

To achieve this, a trade-off between the accuracy, latency, and energy consumption of each MD is considered as intertwined costs. Accordingly, we minimize a sum of intertwined costs including the energy consumption, latency and accuracy loss of multiple MDs, while satisfying the maximum latency constraint and the minimum accuracy constraint of each MAR application. With rigorous analysis, we design a theoretical framework for the optimization of MD performance by jointly managing the frame resolution of the image to offload to the MEC server from MDs, and the computation capacity distribution over MDs in the case of the limited computation capacity of the MEC server. Our numerical analysis validates that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the number of service-level agreement violations, such as exceeding the maximum latency constraint, compared with the existed algorithm. Specifically, the proposed work significantly improve costs of service latency, accuracy loss, and energy consumption of MDs for MEC-assisted MAR services compared with baseline schemes.},

However, directly transmitting data for centralized learning will cause long communication latency owing to the limited communication resource and may incur severe privacy issue as well. To address these issues, we consider the federated edge learning (FEEL) system in this paper and develop an importance-aware joint data selection and resource allocation algorithm to maximize the learning efficiency. Aiming at selecting important data for local training, we first analyze the relation between loss decay and gradient norm, which indicates that larger gradient norm generally leads to faster learning speed. Based on this, a learning efficiency maximization problem is formulated by jointly considering the communication resource allocation and data selection. The closed-form results for optimal communication resource allocation and data selection are both developed, where some insights are also highlighted. Furthermore, an optimal algorithm with low computational complexity is developed to obtain the optimal end-to-end latency in one training period. We show that the sample size should be set to its upper limit in order to maximize the learning performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three popular convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the training latency and improve the learning accuracy as compared with some benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation wireless communications are expected to provide reliable high-rate connectivity. The recent concept of fog-enabled architecture comes to rescue by invoking a substantial amount of data storage close to end-user devices for meeting these challenges. Thus, caching popular contents at heterogeneous devices, e.g., fog nodes (FNs) or fog access points (FAPs), constitutes a promising technique of reducing both the traffic and the energy consumption of the backhaul links. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an energy-efficient caching and node association algorithm for cache-aided fog networks. First, we solve the problem of energy-efficient content caching and delivery in the FNs/FAPs in conjunction with a fixed node association strategy, where the FNs communicate either with other FNs by node-to-node (N2N) communications or with the FAPs in their proximity. In both caching scenarios, we investigate the relationship between the caching probability of the file and the energy-efficient content delivery by formulating the associated energy efficiency (EE) optimization problem under caching memory constraints. Then, we derive a joint modulation mode allocation strategy and caching policy for each content caching node and conceive a joint node association and caching algorithm for maximizing the EE. Finally, we quantify both the overall EE and throughput for demonstrating that the proposed caching and transmission strategy achieves significant performance improvements.},

In order to protect query privacy of the vehicle user, the existing state-of-the-art schemes either reduce the accuracy of LBS or insert a trusted third party (TTP) between the vehicle user and the location server hosting the LBS scheme. Cryptographic constructs such as public-key encryption, Oblivious Transfer (OT), Private Information Retrieval (PIR), and homomorphic encryption are used to remove the TTP or increase the accuracy of the previous schemes. The problem with these existing schemes is that some of them are either inefficient or insecure. In order to address the security and privacy issues, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving mechanism for protecting the query privacy of the user, information content of the location server, and location privacy-preserving of the vehicle in the LBS scheme for VANET. In this scheme, the vehicle requests for services from the location server without revealing the query content to the location server. The location server sends all Point of Interests (POIs) to the vehicle, but the vehicle can only obtain the requested query content. The query privacy of the user and content privacy of the location server is preserved in the exchange.

However, its non-orthogonal nature results in intrinsic interference among symbols and subcarriers, which makes channel estimation in OQAM/FBMC significantly more difficult than that in CP-OFDM. In this paper, we propose a novel preamble design method based on intrinsic interference utilization for OQAM/FBMC channel estimation. Specifically, we build a preamble by triplets of subcarriers, each of which is determined by a preamble power optimization problem that minimizes the channel estimation mean square error (MSE) at the central subcarrier. We derive the optimal closed-form solution by exploiting the linearly dependent relationship between preamble symbols and intrinsic interference weights. Moreover, extensions to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setup capable of improving both spectral efficiency and channel estimation performance are investigated. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the superiority of the proposed preamble design method over the conventional methods in terms of channel estimation MSE, bit error ratio (BER) and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).},

The energy-constrained relay node processes the received signals based on a power splitting protocol, and the two terminals employ a selection combining (SC) scheme to exploit the signals from the direct and relaying links. Assuming independent but non-identically distributed Nakagami-m fading channels, we derive the system outage probability in a closed-form, which enables us to identify two crucial ceiling effects on the system outage probability caused by HIs in the high data rate regions, i.e., relay cooperation ceiling (RCC) and overall system ceiling (OSC). Specifically, the RCC prevents the relaying link from participating in cooperative communications, while the OSC leaves the overall system in outage. Furthermore, we derive the achievable diversity gain of the considered network, which shows that the diversity gain equals either the shape parameter of the direct link or zero. Computer simulations are provided to validate the correctness of our analytical results, and study the effects of various system parameters on the system outage performance and the optimal power splitting ratio, as well as the energy efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) has recently aroused substantial concern due to its successful implementations in many fields. Currently, there are few studies on the applications of DL in the automatic modulation classification (AMC), which plays a critical role in non-cooperation communications. Besides, most previous work ignores the feature interaction, and only considers spatial or temporal attributes of signals. Combining the advantages of the convolutional neural network (CNN), and the long short-term memory (LSTM), this paper addresses the AMC using CNN-LSTM based dual-stream structure, which efficiently explores the feature interaction, and the spatial-temporal properties of raw complex temporal signals. Specifically, a preprocessing step is first implemented to convert signals into the temporal in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) format, and the amplitude/phase (A/P) representation, which facilitates the acquirement of more effective features for classification. To extract features from each signal pattern, each stream is composed of CNN, and LSTM (denoted as CNN-LSTM). Most importantly, the features learned from two streams interact in pairs, which increases the diversity of features and thereby further improves the performance. Finally, some comparisons with previous work are performed. The experimental results not only demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, but also reveal the potential of DL-based approaches for AMC.},

  abstract     = {Wireless charging has become increasingly popular for electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years. However, possible device damage may happen because of the sharp variations of inverter output current and the ZVS angle due to the alignment variation between resonant coils especially while charging. To design a protection strategy, the characters of the inverter output current and phase angle are analyzed when the wireless charging EV leaves. The protection strategy is composed of the insufficient angle protection, overcurrent protection, and the excessive angle protection. A detection circuit is designed to measure the variation of inverter output current and phase angle. A wireless charging EV prototype is established to validate the proposed methods. The experimental results show that the designed detection circuit and protection strategy can catch the abnormal working state of the system when the wireless charged EV leaves and take measures immediately to protect the main circuit of the system from device damages.},

  abstract     = {Differential beamformers with small-size microphone arrays are very attractive for audio and speech signal acquisition thanks to their high directivity and frequency-invariant spatial responses. However, such beamformers often suffer from significant white noise amplification at low frequencies, which makes their implementation in real-world systems challenging. One widely used way to circumvent this issue is to increase the number of microphones in the design of a given order differential beamformer, leading to the so-called robust differential beamformer in which the redundancy provided by the additional sensors are used to improve the white noise gain (WNG). But even with this robust solution, white noise amplification at low frequencies still exists. In this article, instead of trying to improve WNG, we adopt a method to render the white noise in such a way that it affects less the perception of the speech signal of interest. Specifically, we propose a binaural differential beamforming method in which a differential beamformer is designed with two sub-beamforming filters that simultaneously generates two outputs, one for the left ear and the other for the right ear. Motivated by psychoacoustic experiments, we design these two filters in such a way that they are orthogonal so that the coherence between the white noise at the binaural outputs is minimized while the coherence between diffuse noise is maximized. With the proposed binaural differential beamformers, the desired signal components and (amplified) white noise at the binaural differential beamformer&#39;s outputs are rendered into different directions or zones. Consequently, the human perception system can better distinguish the desired signal from white noise for improved speech intelligibility. The superiority of the proposed binaural beamforming technique is justified by simulations, experiments, as well as listening tests.},

However, due to the high complexity of circuit wiring in practical applications, it has been greatly restricted. This paper investigates the hybrid (analog/digital) beamforming design of a multiuser mmWave massive MIMO system with sub-connected structure. For this system, we focus on a sum-rate maximization probelm. Considering the joint design of the receiver, and transmitter, a two-stage design method is adopted. In the analog stage, the analog beamformer, and combiner are designed by the proposed piecewise dual joint iterative approximation (PDJIA) method, which not only can obtain closed-form solutions but also has linear property. Based on the criterion of avoiding the loss of information, the problem of digital beamforming is solved by exploiting the baseband piecewise successive approximation (BPSA) method, which can effectively increase the number of users served. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the art MIMO hybrid beamforming design schemes, and more accurately approximates to that of the full-digital system.},

With the considered network, SUs are able to realize their communications over the licensed spectrum while extending relay assistance to the PUs. The overall bidirectional end-to-end transmission takes place in four phases, which include both energy harvesting (EH), and information transfer. A non-linear energy harvester with a hybrid SWIPT scheme is adopted in which both power-splitting, and time-switching EH techniques are used. The SUs aid in relay cooperation by performing an amplify-and-forward operation, whereas selection combining technique is adopted at the PUs to extract the intended signal from multiple received signals broadcasted by the SUs. Accurate outage probability expressions for the primary, and secondary links are derived under the Nakagami-m fading environment. Further, the system behavior is analyzed with respect to achievable system throughput, and energy efficiency. Since the performance of the considered system is strongly affected by the spectrum sharing factor, and hybrid SWIPT parameters, particle swarm optimization is implemented to optimize the system parameters so as to maximize the system throughput, and energy efficiency. Simulation results are provided to corroborate the performance analysis, and give useful insights into the system behavior concerning various system/channel parameters.},

Most notably, the entire traffic matrix is designed to be configured using simple high-level rules, clearly stating who can talk to whom according to the service abstraction adopted by SOME/IP. Three incremental security levels are made available, accounting for different services being associated with different requirements. The core security protocol, encompassing a session establishment phase followed by the transmission of secured SOME/IP messages, has been formally verified, to prove its correctness in terms of authentication and secrecy properties.

This paper investigates the cognitive power allocation scheme to evaluate the reliability and secrecy performance of secondary user in mmWave NOMA networks, where a base station (BS) provides services for primary and secondary users distributed in different regions in the presence of randomly located eavesdroppers. In the proposed cognitive power allocation scheme, under the condition that both the security and quality of service (QoS) of the primary user are first satisfied, the opportunistic service is provided to the secondary user. In addition, a sector eavesdropper-exclusion zone is introduced around BS to ameliorate the secrecy performance of the networks. Considering the path loss and blockage model of mmWave channels, and the secrecy performance of secondary user is comprehensively studied by using the stochastic geometry from three aspects: connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), and secrecy throughput (ST). The performance evaluation results have demonstrated that when the security constraint of the primary user is heightened, the secondary user&#39;s secrecy performance is weakened to varying degrees, but the tradeoff between security and reliability is improved. Moreover, the ST of the mmWave NOMA communication networks with cognitive power allocation outperforms the equivalent networks with mmWave OMA scheme.},

We demonstrate that the proposed scheme avoids the direct inverse operation for large scrambling and descrambling matrices through binary operations. Therefore, without huge complexity loads and feedback overheads being incurred, the scrambling and descrambling matrices at the transmitter and legitimate receiver, respectively, can be simultaneously updated to the new pair through a few binary operations on each side. We also demonstrate that the proposed scheme approaches the perfect scrambling condition for maximizing the decoding error spreading when a sufficiently long independent key with a uniform Bernoulli distribution is provided, where the key length condition in practical applications can be overcome via key accumulation over transmissions. In addition, the proposed scheme also benefits from the descrambling matrix mismatch when the estimation for the key at the eavesdropper is imperfect.

In this paper, we focus on the channel prediction issue in multiple input-multiple output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. First, we introduce the general channel prediction framework based on the temporal and spatial correlations in MIMO-OFDM systems. Then, we combine the broad learning idea and recurrent computation, and further introduce the broad echo state network (BESN) for channel prediction in MIMO-OFDM systems. Third, to estimate the output weight matrix, we offer two versions of the BESN, i.e., the basic BESN (B-BESN) and the group forward variable selection (GFVS)-based BESN (GFVS-BESN). In the latter, we develop the GFVS strategy to further extract useful information from those collected features in the BESN and make the BESN more able to process the CSI samples. Fourth, inspired by deep learning, we import the conjugate gradient descent backpropagation (CGDBP) technique to fine-tune the random weights and biases in the BESN and give the related derivations. Then, we prove the echo state property in the BESN and analyze the computational complexity. In the simulation section, we comprehensively evaluate the prediction performances for the standard Extended Vehicular A model (EVA) and Extended Typical Urban model (ETU) under different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), different antenna configurations, different spatial correlations, different maximum Doppler shifts and different channel prediction methods. The simulation results indicate that the BESN has excellent prediction performance in MIMO-OFDM systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the integration of wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies for a cell-free spatially random network, where the access points (APs) are located randomly and modeled using a Poisson point process, and the users&#39; energy and data transfers are separated in time. For the time-division-duplexing mode of operation, the uplink channel state information is acquired locally at the distributed APs via user pilots, and the APs utilize conjugate beamforming for downlink transmissions by exploiting channel reciprocity. In addition, line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios, which arise from link blockages due to objects are considered along with the corresponding path loss and fading parameters in our performance analysis of the above system set-up. We characterize the harvested energy at a user for both linear and non-linear energy harvesting models, and derive expressions for the average achievable downlink rate for the energy harvesting users. Subsequently, we propose a multi-slot energy storing scheme, and thereby, derive the probability of a user being fully charged at any given time. The throughput and the harvested energy are investigated under different system parameters. We show that a higher mean energy can be harvested by energy users with limited impact on non-energy users through allocating a higher portion of power for the energy users. Furthermore, we reveal that increasing the AP power level has diminishing effect on the probability of being within the fully charged state.},

By exploiting the block circulant channel induced by the UWSC-SM block format, the prefilter can be computed, and carried out efficiently using the fast Fourier transforms. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the conventional M-algorithm, the proposed algorithm achieves essentially the same error-rate performance with a considerably lower overall complexity in systems where the number of receive antennas is no smaller than that of transmit antennas.},

  abstract     = {The ever-increasing and unbalanced traffic load in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks have increased the network congestion and led to user dissatisfaction. To relieve the network congestion and improve the traffic load balance, in this paper, we propose an intelligent software defined C-V2X network framework to enable flexible and low-complexity traffic offloading by decoupling the network data plane from the control plane. In the data plane, the cellular traffic offloading and the vehicle assisted traffic offloading are jointly performed. In the control plane, deep learning is deployed to reduce the software defined network (SDN) control complexity and improve the traffic offloading efficiency. Under the proposed framework, we investigate the traffic offloading problem, which can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Specifically, the first objective maximizes the cellular access point (AP) throughput with consideration of the load balance by associating the users with the APs. The second objective maximizes the vehicle throughput with consideration of the vehicle trajectory by associating the delay-insensitive users with the vehicles. The two objectives are coupled by the association between the cellular APs and the vehicles. A deep learning based online-offline approach is proposed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The online stage decouples the optimization problem into two sub-problems and utilizes the `Pareto optimal&#39; to find the solutions. The offline stage utilizes deep learning to learn from the historical optimization information of the online stage and helps predict the optimal solutions with reduced complexity. Numerical results are provided to validate the advantages of our proposed traffic offloading approach via deep learning in C-V2X networks.},

The proposed scheme allows us to expedite the detection process by coping with the transmit symbols group by group. As compared to vertical-Bell laboratories layered space time (V-BLAST), the major breakthrough of computation reduction lies in the fact that the partial tree search can assist the detection process to avoid the inversion of the detection matrix required in each recursion of the SIC process. Both computational complexity analysis and simulation results show that our proposed algorithm not only significantly reduces computational complexity, but also has better bit error rate (BER) performance.},

  abstract     = {We consider the recently proposed extra-large scale massive multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, with some hundreds of antennas serving a smaller number of users. Since the array length is of the same order as the distance to the users, the long-term fading coefficients of a given user vary with the different antennas at the base station (BS). Thus, the signal transmitted by some antennas might reach the user with much more power than that transmitted by some others. From a green perspective, it is not effective to simultaneously activate hundreds or even thousands of antennas, since the power-hungry radio frequency (RF) chains of the active antennas increase significantly the total energy consumption. Besides, a larger number of selected antennas increases the power required by linear processing, such as precoding matrix computation, and short-term channel estimation. In this paper, we propose four antenna selection (AS) approaches to be deployed in XL-MIMO systems aiming at maximizing the total energy efficiency (EE). Besides, employing some simplifying assumptions, we derive a closed-form analytical expression for the EE of the XL-MIMO system, and propose a straightforward iterative method to determine the optimal number of selected antennas able to maximize it. The proposed AS schemes are based solely on long-term fading parameters, thus, the selected antennas set remains valid for a relatively large time/frequency intervals. Comparing the results, we find that the genetic-algorithm based AS scheme usually achieves the best EE performance, although our proposed highest normalized received power AS scheme also achieves very promising EE performance in a simple and straightforward way.},

In the coverage regions of the sharing access points (APs), device to device (D2D) communication can occur among different slices, i.e., one mobile terminal (MT) acts as a D2D relay for another MT serving by a different slice. Since the slices, and the MTs are selfish who will not help others voluntarily, this paper proposes a two-layered incentive scheme to stimulate cooperation. To achieve this, two resource allocating problems of the proposed incentive scheme are formulated which introducing the slices,&#39; and the MTs&#39; cooperative activities, thus more resources will be allocated to the cooperative slices, and MTs as reward. Since the slices,&#39; and the MTs&#39; instantaneous resource allocations can not be obtained by the two optimal problems, the incentive scheduling algorithms of the slices, and the MTs are designed. Finally, we define the isolation indexes to evaluate slice isolation when carrying out cooperation. By simulating, it is proved that the proposed incentive scheme can stimulate cooperation efficiently, since the throughputs of the cooperative slices, and MTs are both improved. And the proposed incentive scheme is helpful for the slices, and the MTs to meet the statistical service quality requirements, and brings the bad effect to the instantaneous service quality requirements.},

In contrast to the conventional SCMA that directly maps the information bits of each user to a predefined M-point codebook, the data in CPI-SCMA is not only conveyed by the M-point codebook as in SCMA, but also by the indexes of the codeword positions. In this paper, we first propose a simplified detector termed as message passing algorithm aided index reliability detection (MPA-IRD) that is more suitable for practical implementation. Moreover, we investigate the spectral efficiency (SE) in CPI-SCMA, and two important features are identified to facilitate the design of the system. A tight approximation of the average block error probability (ABLEP) under the maximum likelihood detector (MLD) is also derived from studying the error rate performance of CPI-SCMA. Finally, to further improve the SE of CPI-SCMA, an enhanced version of CPI-SCMA termed as hybrid CPI-SCMA (HCPI-SCMA) is proposed. Itis shown via both simulation, and analytical results that the proposed scheme not only achieves better error rate performance in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region but also improves the SE, and the level of robustness under channel estimation error compares to SCMA.},

Considering a base station (BS) and two users, a novel decoding order is designed that provides security to both users. With the objective of ensuring secrecy fairness between users, while satisfying their QoS requirements under BS transmit power budget constraint, we explore the problem of minimizing the maximum secrecy outage probability (SOP). Closed-form expression of pair outage probability (POP) and optimal power allocation (PA) minimizing POP are obtained. To analyze secrecy performance, analytical expressions of SOP for both users are derived, and individual SOP minimization problems are solved using concept of generalized-convexity. High signal-to-noise ratio approximation of SOP and asymptotically optimized solution minimizing this approximation is also found. Furthermore, global-optimal solution from secrecy fairness standpoint is obtained at low computational complexity, and tight approximation is derived to get analytical insights. Numerical results present useful insights on globally optimized PA which ensure secrecy fairness and provide performance gain of about 55.12%, 69.30%, and 19.11%, respectively, compared to fixed PA and individual users&#39; optimal PAs. Finally, a tradeoff between secrecy fairness performance and QoS demands is presented.},

In this research, the authors present a new direction for both stages of feature-based (FB) approach. In the feature extraction stage, the authors design a new architecture that 1) removes the bias issue for the estimator of fourth-order cumulants, and 2) extracts polar-transformed information of the received $IQ$ symbols, and finally 3) forms a unique dataset to be used in the labeling stage. Furthermore, the authors contribute to increasing the classification accuracy in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions by employing the deep belief network (DBN) platform in addition to the spiking neural network (SNN) platform to overcome execution latency concerns associated with deep learning architectures. For this research, the authors first study each individual FB AMC classifier to derive their respective upper and lower performance bounds and then propose an adaptive framework that is built and developed with these findings. This framework aims to efficiently classify the modulation scheme by intelligently switching between these different FB classifiers to achieve an optimal balance between accuracy and execution latency for any observed channel conditions derived from the main receiver&#39;s equalizer. Subsequently, a performance analysis is conducted using the standard RadioML dataset to achieve a realistic evaluation. Numerical results indicate a notably higher classification accuracy, by 16.02% on average, when DBN is employed, whereas SNN requires significantly lower execution latency to label the modulation scheme when compared against two other modified FB classifiers that are built upon convolutional and recurrent neural networks, shown to be reduced by 34.31%.},

The special spectrum structure of OFDM signals provides a range of flexibility in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) performance, data rate, and power consumption. In this paper, we study subcarrier-wise backscatter communication over ambient OFDM signals. This new AmBC is to exploit the special spectrum structure of OFDM to transmit data over its squeezed orthogonal subcarriers. We propose a basis transmission scheme, and its two modifications to support a higher data rate with superior BER performance compared to existing methods. The basis scheme can transmit one bit per subcarrier using on-off keying (OOK) modulation in the frequency domain. In the first modification, interleaved subcarrier block transmission model is employed to improve the BER performance of the system in frequency-selective channels. It results in a trade-off between the size of the blocks, and data rate. Thus, in the second modification, interleaved index modulation (IM) is employed to mitigate the data rate decrementation of the former modification. It also stabilizes, and controls the power of the signal to result in interference reduction for a legacy receiver. Analytical, and numerical evaluations provide a proof to see the performance of the proposed method in terms of BER, data rate, and interference.},

  abstract     = {The singular value decomposition (SVD) based hybrid processing for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems attempts to eliminate mutual interference between data streams by processing the original channel matrix to an approximate diagonal matrix. However, the non-zero off-diagonal entries will result in performance loss. To improve the performance with low-complexity, we propose a multistage optimal detection algorithm for SVD-based hybrid mmWave MIMO systems. At the first stage, a decision criterion is proposed by effectively exploiting the characteristic that the magnitudes of off-diagonal entries of the baseband channel matrix are relatively small. Through this decision criterion, some elements of global optimal solution can be determined. The ratio of the determined elements to all elements is analyzed to reveal the advantage of proposed decision criterion. At the second stage, we further propose a decision feedback algorithm to detect more elements of global optimal solution. If all elements are determined, the detection is complete, otherwise it enters the third stage. In the case of third stage, we apply the maximum likelihood (ML) detection algorithm to solve the residual small-scale optimization problem containing only few undetermined elements. Numerical experiments show that the number of elements required to be determined by ML detection is relatively very small or zero, in most situations, that is why the algorithm has a significantly lower complexity.},

We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) with two objective functions capturing the contradicting targets and find the Pareto optimal solutions for the pilot signals. Using weighted-sum-scalarization technique, we first convert the MOP to an equivalent single-objective optimization problem (SOP), which is not convex. Assuming that each BS is provided with the most recent knowledge of the pilot signals of the other BSs, we then decompose the SOP into a set of distributed non-convex optimization problems to be solved at individual BSs. Finally, we introduce an alternating optimization approach to cast each one of the resulting distributed optimization problems into a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) form. We provide a mathematical proof for the convergence of the proposed alternating approach and a complexity analysis for the LMI optimization problem. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach can significantly reduce pilot power, whilst maintaining the same level of channel estimation error as in a baseline.},

With propagation direction combination based on eight basic directions, for instance, east, south, west, north, southeast, northeast, southwest and northwest, provided by the Eight-Diagram, the proposed AP selection algorithm can be applied to indoor scenarios where Wi-Fi RSSI is corrupted by multipath interference. Experiments were conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed AP selection algorithm achieves an accuracy considerably better than the WKNN, MaxMean, InfoGain and PCA methods. Due to the use of fewer APs, the proposed algorithm has lower computational complexity than the MaxMean and InfoGain algorithms, and equivalent with the PCA algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a receive directional beam control method in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) wireless communication system. First, we reveal that for a given receive beam, the channel coherence time of fast varying vehicle channels decreases as time goes by. Then, we propose a novel adaptive receive beam control method termed dynamic beam management (DBM), tailored to this channel characteristic, which adaptively selects one of two predefined actions, i.e., channel estimation and beam alignment. The channel estimation is a process of reacquiring channel state information using known pilot signals for coherent detection toward a given receive beam direction. The beam alignment is a kind of analog beam selection method, which steers the direction of the receive beam to attain higher communication performance. Since the beam alignment must search through large dimension, it costs more time compared to the channel estimation. Therefore, given different time overheads of channel estimation and beam alignment, new design criteria are required to decide when each action should be conducted in V2X communications. The proposed DBM figures out the time point when to re-estimate the channel and to realign the receive beam, taking into account their gains and overheads. Furthermore, we show that although a narrow beam has a merit of high power gain, too narrow beam is vulnerable to the pointing error, and reduces channel coherence time, and thus we numerically find the optimal receive beamwidth. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed DBM are underpinned by both analytic and simulation results.},

It is essential to have an easy and relevant method for ensuring the wireless communication performance of the devices. We have recently developed a new random line-of-sight (random-LOS) measurement system for evaluating the communication performance of wireless devices, e.g., transceivers and antennas installed on a vehicle. In the measurement system, a plane wave is generated in the test zone emulating the far-field wave transmitted from a radio base station. In this paper we present both numerical simulations and actual experimental results of the random-LOS over-the-air (OTA) measurement setup operating in the 1.5-3 GHz band. The measurement accuracy is determined by the field variations within the test zone, where a smaller variation gives better measurement accuracy. In this paper the achieved accuracy expressed in terms of standard deviation (STD) was evaluated to be approximately 1 dB of the power within a cylindrical test zone of height 0.4 m and diameter 2 m. The active multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) performance of antenna systems installed on an actual vehicle was measured and evaluated using the presented setup. A comparison to a theoretical zero forcing (ZF) receiver is also presented.},

The transmitter of REF codes adapts the degrees of encoded symbols to make the degree distribution at the receiver close to the robust soliton distribution, where the distance between two distributions is measured by relative entropy. The proposed REF codes are shown to achieve excellent intermediate performance over binary erasure channels (BECs), and binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channels (BI-AWGNCs) for both unicast, and multicast scenarios. For multicast, a non-uniform input symbol selection scheme is proposed to enhance the performance of REF codes. Furthermore, since the feedback is imprecise under noisy channels, the concept “belief” is introduced to improve the reliability of REF codes. Theoretical analysis is performed for the proposed REF codes, with an upper bound, and an approximate lower bound of the intermediate performance of REF codes over BECs derived. Both theoretical analysis, and simulations show that the proposed REF codes outperform the state-of-the-art fountain codes with feedback, in terms of the intermediate performance, with low overhead.},

  abstract     = {The performance of existing frequency-domain channel estimation and equalization algorithms for faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling is seriously hampered with the noise enhancement phenomenon that results from their inverse or pseudo-inverse operations. Through simulations, we show that the linear precoding can effectively mitigate the above-mentioned noise enhancement phenomenon. At first, a low complexity precoding-based channel estimation (PCE) algorithm is proposed for FTN signaling over frequency-selective fading channels. In contrast with most existing frequency-domain channel estimation algorithms, the proposed PCE algorithm has much better mean square error performance, and the performance improvement enlarges with the increase of signal to noise ratio. Furthermore, a joint channel estimation and precoding (JCEP) algorithm is proposed to perform data detection for FTN signaling over frequency-selective fading channels. On the one hand, compared with the existing frequency-domain channel estimation and equalization algorithms, the JCEP algorithm greatly reduces the complexity of signal processing at receivers since it performs the linear precoding processing at transmitters. On the other hand, even with estimated channel state information (CSI), the proposed JCEP algorithm can approach the bit error rate (BER) performance of the Nyquist signaling for all the modulation types adopted in digital video broadcasting-satellite-second generation extension (DVB-S2X). More precisely, the BER performance degradation with perfect and estimated CSI is 0.06 dB and 0.07 dB respectively when the time acceleration parameter equals to 0.7 and the rolling factor is 0.45.},

In particular, considering the interrelationship among decisions made by different user equipments (UEs), we first model the HO, and power allocation problem as a fully cooperative multi-agent task, in which all agents, i.e., UEs, have the same target. Then, to solve the multi-agent task, and get decentralized policies for each UE, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) method, by introducing the centralized training with decentralized execution framework. That is, we use global information to train policies for each UE, and after the training is finished, each UE obtains a decentralized policy, which can be implemented only based on each UE&#39;s local observation. Specially, we introduce the counterfactual baseline to address the credit assignment problem in centralized learning. Due to the centralized training, the decentralized polices learned by multi-agent PPO (MAPPO) can work more cooperatively. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that our method can achieve better performance comparing with other existing works.},

Exploring the dual functionality enabled by OFDM, this paper presents a new cooperative method for high-resolution delay-Doppler estimation. The proposed subspace-based method exploits the combination of both the radar and received communication signals to estimate target parameters. The procedure achieves high-resolution delay-Doppler estimation for both uncorrelated, partially correlated and coherent signals, and enables a significant reduction in the required bandwidth when compared to previous approaches which do not exploit the knowledge of the communication signals.

A concave expression is adopted to lower-bound the achievable rate of each user equipment with perfect and imperfect channel estimation.

By defining the reciprocal of array pattern as the spatial spectrum, the DOA estimation problem is considered as the peak searching for it. In this paper, we present an efficient bias-compensated adaptive filtering algorithm for DOA estimation based on the adaptive nulling array. First of all, a new noise-free mean square error (NF-MSE) cost function associated with the adaptive nulling array is provided. Secondly, the proposed algorithm, called variable step-size bias-compensated least mean square (VSS-BC-LMS) algorithm, can be derived by minimizing the NF-MSE. Due to the bias compensation, the bias of the estimated weight vector caused by noises is canceled. More importantly, in order to resist the unsatisfactory DOA estimation performance when using the fixed step-size, a variable step size scheme is introduced. And then, its mean stability, steady state mean square performance and computational complexity are discussed. Additionally, we also explore a noise variance estimation method for calculating the bias term. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves an improved DOA estimation performance compared with other adaptive methods.},

  abstract     = {Mobility may degrade the performance of next-generation vehicular networks operating at the millimeter-wave spectrum: frequent mis-alignment and blockages require repeated beam-training and handover, with enormous overhead. Nevertheless, mobility induces temporal correlations in the communication beams and in blockage events. In this paper, an adaptive design is proposed, that learns and exploits these temporal correlations to reduce the beam-training overhead and make handover decisions. At each time-slot, the serving base station (BS) decides to perform either beam-training, data communication, or handover, under uncertainty in the system state. The decision problem is cast as a partially observable Markov decision process, with the goal to maximize the throughput delivered to the user, under an average power constraint. To address the high-dimensional optimization, an approximate constrained point-based value iteration (C-PBVI) method is developed, which simultaneously optimizes the primal and dual functions to meet the power constraint. Numerical results demonstrate a good match between the analysis and a simulation based on 2D mobility and 3D analog beamforming via uniform planar arrays at both BSs and UE, and reveal that C-PBVI performs near-optimally, and outperforms a baseline scheme with periodic beam-training by 38% in spectral efficiency. Motivated by the structure of C-PBVI, two heuristics are proposed, that trade complexity with sub-optimality, and achieve only 4% and 15% loss in spectral efficiency. Finally, the effect of mobility and multiple users on blockage dynamics is evaluated numerically, demonstrating superior performance over the baseline scheme.},

We propose three schemes by using time division, superposition or their mixture. For each scheme, three optimization problems are formulated to maximize either the probability of detection for radar subject to a minimum communications rate, the communications rate subject to a minimum probability of detection for radar, or a combined measure of tradeoff. Specifically, given a fixed amount of total time or power for both communications and radar, the optimal power allocation and/or time allocation between radar and communications are derived. Numerical results show that the superposition scheme outperforms the time division scheme and the mixture scheme with considerable performance gains. They also show that the surveillance channel in radar and the communications channel are more important than the direct channel in radar.},

Then, according to the NMSE obtained during channel estimation phase, we design different secure transmission schemes, and derive the approximative expressions of average security rate with respect to the behavior of active Eve, including malicious jamming, and passive eavesdropping, respectively. Finally, the power allocation at source, and relay is jointly optimized to minimize the average signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the Eve while ensuring that of the legitimate receivers to be large than a threshold for the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement. Numerical results show that the proposed DCE-based secure transmission scheme can effectively discriminate the CSI between legitimate receivers, and Eve even in the presence of an active Eve, and therefore achieve a better security performance than that without DCE.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the source localization problem with an underwater acoustic sensor network (UASN) consisting of a number of platforms each equipped with an array, such as an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Direct position determination (DPD) has been a promising topic in recent years. Existing DPD methods can be divided into two categories: global coherent processing and non-coherent processing. The former is easy to implement in practical tasks but the coherence between the received signals at different nodes are not exploited, while the requirements for coherent processing may not be fulfilled in real environments. A multi-cluster array model is constructed considering the deployment of the nodes with the intention to exploit the available coherence in the UASN and avoiding the side effects of imperfect spatial coherence. A weighted MUSIC direct source localization approach is proposed based on this model. The arrays within a cluster work coherently as a large array and contribute a MUSIC spectrum. The final source position estimate is obtained from a weighted combination of these spectra, and the weights are dependent on the eigenstucture and noise variance of each cluster. We first investigate the theoretical gain of inter-array coherence exploitation on localization accuracy by means of Cramér-Rao bound analysis. Then the model for imperfect spatial coherence is generalized to the multi-cluster system to examine the performance of the proposed approach when the inherent constraints for intra-cluster coherent processing can not be guaranteed. Numerical results demonstrate the superior resolution capability of the proposed approach and its robustness to imperfect spatial coherence.},

An “internal coordination-external confrontation” multi-user anti-jamming access game model is constructed, and the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) as well as correlated equilibrium (CE) is demonstrated. A coordination-learning based anti-jamming spectrum access algorithm (CLASA) is designed to achieve the CE of the game.

Last but not least, the fairness of the proposed approach under different jamming attack patterns is analyzed, which illustrates that this approach provides fair anti-jamming spectrum access opportunities under complicated jamming pattern.},

It is hard to obtain positive secrecy rate in the presence of a stronger NU eavesdropper.

The global closed-form optimal solution is achieved for the two-user case, while a closed-form sub-optimal solution is obtained for the multi-user case.

Numerous enhanced remote-radio-heads (eRRHs) of F-RAN are distributed in a wide area, which are connected to the central base-band-unit (BBU) pool by fronthaul links. In order to reduce the adverse effect of the limited fronthaul capacity on the wireless content transfer (WCT), eRRHs are equipped with the content caching capability. A greedy algorithm based near-optimal caching design is then proposed for reducing the content responsive latency by considering the geographic distribution of CUs. Furthermore, given this caching design, a joint optimisation problem of eRRH classification (some for WCT and some for dedicated WPT) and distributed transmit beamforming is solved by a low-complexity heuristic algorithm. This algorithm aims for maximising the total energy harvested by the EUs, while satisfying the CUs’ minimum WCT rate and the limited fronthaul capacity. Intensive simulation results in the scenarios of both uniform and non-uniform users’ distribution validate our caching, eRRH classification and distributed transmit beamforming design in an F-RAN.},

Specifically, the criterion function is constructed based on DFT beam difference (DBD) to infer the real position of arrived signal. Subsequently, the novel antenna selection and path number estimation algorithms are proposed without prior knowledge of channel. A few groups of antennas are selected to connect to the RF chains, where each group contains only a small number of antennas. Thus, the beamspace multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm can be implemented in low dimensional space to estimate the AoA(s) for each group. Then the channel estimation can be obtained by least square method after the reconstructions of steering vectors using the AoA estimations. Furthermore, the corresponding spatial smoothing algorithm is leveraged to tackle rank deficient problem at the scenario of constant path gains. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

As benefited from a coordinated and open-loop pilot beam pattern design, all the sub-arrays can perform channel sounding with less training overhead compared with the traditional orthogonal operation of each sub-array. Furthermore, two sparse channel recovery algorithms, known as joint orthogonal matching pursuit (JOMP) and joint sparse Bayesian learning with 12 reweighting (JSBL-12), are proposed to exploit the hidden structured sparsity in the beam-domain channel vector. Finally, successive interference cancellation (SIC) based hybrid precoding through sub-array grouping is illustrated for the DPA-MIMO system, which decomposes the joint sub-array RF beamformer design into an interactive per-sub-array-group handle. Simulation results show that the proposed two channel estimators fully take advantage of the partial coupling characteristic of DPA-MIMO channels to perform channel recovery, and the proposed hybrid precoding algorithm is suitable for such array-of-sub-arrays architecture with satisfactory performance and low complexity.},

The delivery of a large volume of multimedia contents for ground users is assisted by a mobile UAV base station, which caches some popular contents for wireless backhaul link traffic offloading. In cache-enabling UAV NOMA networks, the caching placement of content caching phase and radio resource allocation of content delivery phase are crucial for network performance. To cope with the dynamic UAV locations and content requests in practical scenarios, we formulate the long-term caching placement and resource allocation optimization problem for content delivery delay minimization as a Markov decision process (MDP). The UAV acts as an agent to take actions for caching placement and resource allocation, which includes the user scheduling of content requests and the power allocation of NOMA users. In order to tackle the MDP, we propose a Q-learning based caching placement and resource allocation algorithm, where the UAV learns and selects action with soft ${\varepsilon }$-greedy strategy to search for the optimal match between actions and states. Since the action-state table size of Q-learning grows with the number of states in the dynamic networks, we propose a function approximation based algorithm with combination of stochastic gradient descent and deep neural networks, which is suitable for large-scale networks. Finally, the numerical results show that the proposed algorithms provide considerable performance compared to benchmark algorithms, and obtain a trade-off between network performance and calculation complexity.},

Both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) WPT systems are considered. The sum-energy received by all sensors is maximized to find the optimal strategy for UAV deployment. Two different charging schemes are proposed. Numerical results show that the sum-energy received by all sensors is determined by sensors&#39; topology, the flight speed of the UAV and the transmit power. They also show that, when the BS charging process and the UAV power consumption are considered in the optimization, the optimal location of the UAV in the 1D and 2D WPT systems is closer to the BS than in the previous works that ignore these two practical factors.},

  abstract     = {We design an optimal non-uniform quantizer for collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). We assume non-ideal reporting channels are and consist of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). To design the optimum quantization at the transmitter, we minimize the mean square error (MMSE) at the receiver. The local data at each secondary user (SU) is quantized and transmitted via an AWGN reporting channel. Then, quantized symbols are received and decoded at the fusion center (FC) by a maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) rule and, the final collaborative decision is made. By this method, a prediction is done for representation points of the quantizer and moreover, quantization and reporting channel noises are minimized, simultaneously. In addition, by taking into account the reporting channel noise in quantizer design, detection performance will be adaptive to change of signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the reporting channel. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed quantizer compared to different quantizers in practical noisy reporting channels.},

  abstract     = {To be differentiated from the literature, in this paper, we aim to alleviate the impact of pilot contamination (PC) on the massive MIMO systems by cooperatively scheduling users (rather than just assigning) among neighboring cells to share the limited orthogonal pilots. To this end, we develop the multi-cell cooperative scheduling (MCCS) algorithm together with the cooperative scheduling indexes (COSIs) for maximizing the data rate, maximizing the Jain&#39;s fairness index and reaching a better tradeoff in-between. For convenience, they are denoted by the COSIs for the CMDR, CMMF and CPF schedulers, respectively. However, its high computational complexity may somehow resists its from practical applications. Thus, a low-complexity cooperative proportional fairness (LC-CPF) algorithm is designed to well approach the MCCS algorithm using the CPF COSI; and at the meantime, the order of computational complexity can be significantly reduced. Moreover, its ability to reach a better tradeoff can still be maintained under the impact of high spectrum-sharing interference. In addition, it is interesting to find that using the proposed cooperative scheduling methods, the open-loop power control mechanism is no longer required for compensating the differences of received signal quality between users.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are more suitable for surveillance systems than their traditional stationary counterparts. To meet the associated demanding video compression requirements, the H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) codec is invoked. Its scalable video coding extension is capable of supporting diverse video resolutions by encoding the video clips captured into multiple layers, namely the Base Layer (BL) and several Enhancement Layers (EL). In this treatise, we propose a multi-functional Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) transceiver relying on Multi-Set Space-Time Shift Keying (MS-STSK) for UAV-aided near-instantaneously adaptive layered video streaming, which is capable of promptly varying the throughput as a function of both the estimated channel quality as well as of the UAV mobility, while maintaining near-flawless video quality. Additionally, we invoke EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts for characterizing our Unequal Error Protection (UEP) based video transceiver with the aid of near-capacity channel coding. Some of the perceptually less important ELs may have to be dropped during instances of low channel quality to retain the robustness of the transmitted video stream when a low-throughput MIMO configuration is activated. The simulation results show that our proposed UEP assisted adaptive system is capable of attaining the best Y-Peak SNR (PSNR) performance in comparison to both its non-adaptive and Equal Error Protection (EEP) counterparts.},

Energy management is one of the effective methods to increase the durability of power sources and the overall economy of the vehicle. The majority of existing studies focus only on fuel consumption. Therefore, an online applicable cost minimization strategy cooperating fuel cell and battery degradation is proposed to decrease the overall operating cost including hydrogen consumption cost and lifetime costs of fuel cell and battery. Two kinds of degradation models are both designed for fuel cell and battery respectively. Empirical degradation model and prognostic model are used to calculate the degradation cost and estimate the degradation performances of power sources along with aging. Creatively cooperating two kinds of models to precisely quantify the degradation rates of power sources under real automobile operating conditions is firstly studied. Validation under a typical driving cycle shows the effectiveness of the developed cost minimization strategy in increasing the economy of the vehicle. The effects of degradation and failure states of power sources, driving cycles and price evolution of hydrogen and power sources on the optimal cost results are also analyzed.},

However, a conventional electronic stability control system, may not always yield desired path following and yaw stability performance in such circumstances merely through brake intervention. This paper pursues a detailed investigation on utilising model predictive control (MPC) and torque vectoring for path following and yaw stability control of over-actuated autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) in dangerous double lane change manoeuvre. The control problem of the AEV is formulated based on MPC by utilising active front steering and torque vectoring, and constraints are imposed explicitly on yaw rate and sideslip angle to ensure yaw stability. Four MPC-based controllers are designed based on double-track vehicle models. Specifically, they include two one-level controllers, i.e. one with torque vectoring and one with equal torque allocation, and two two-level controllers, i.e. one with optimisation-based torque allocation and one with rule-based allocation. These controllers are assessed extensively, with respect to passing velocity, tracking accuracy, tyre utilisation and robustness. The effect of horizon length on the control performance and computational efficiency is also investigated.},

Then, a multi-sensor fusion-based longitudinal vehicle speed estimator is synthesized by employing three virtual sensors which generate three longitudinal vehicle speed tracks based on multiple sensor signals. Finally, the accuracy and reliability of the proposed longitudinal vehicle speed estimator are examined under a diverse range of driving conditions through hardware-in-the-loop tests.

Unscented particle filter (UPF) algorithm is then implemented to obtain prognostic results with original error series. Next, to enhance the quality of original error data by reducing the local uncertainty, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) algorithm is utilized to reconstruct error series. The fundamental error evolution information is retained by selecting relatively highly correlated intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of the decomposition results of original error series. Finally, after employing Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm, the prognostic error to correct the UPF-based prognostic result is obtained from the reconstructed error series.

An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed, for which computational and memory requirements scale linearly with the length of the prediction horizon (and can be reduced using parallel processing). The optimal controller is compared with a low-pass filter against an all-battery baseline in numerical simulations, where it is shown to provide significant improvement in battery degradation (inferred through reductions of 71.4% in peak battery power, 21.0% in root-mean-squared battery power, and 13.7% in battery throughput), and a reduction of 5.7% in energy consumption. It is also shown that the ADMM algorithm can solve the optimization problem in a fraction of a second for prediction horizons of more than 15 minutes, and is therefore a promising candidate for online receding-horizon control.},

Moreover, the HD effect is created so that the DC-field harmonics can differentiate the effective and ineffective harmonics in the air gap to weaken the resultant effective magnetic field. Consequently, attractive flux-weakening ability and extended speed-operating range can be achieved for electric vehicle propulsion. The machine configuration, operation principle, torque-sizing equation and drive system are introduced first. Then, the harmonic analysis is conducted to elaborate on the HD effect, followed by the finite-element verification. Besides, both the electromagnetic and structural performances of the proposed machine are comprehensively evaluated by finite element analysis. Further, a comparative study is performed between the proposed design and other existing topologies in terms of electromagnetic performances.

This considers both vehicle and actuator dynamics as well as load and parameter variations. The main merits are summarized as follows. First, the proposed auto-tuning law magnifies the feedback gain for desired systems to achieve transient performance improvement with the convergence property guarantee. Second, the collaboration of pole-zero cancellation controller and disturbance observers eliminates over/undershoots through closed-loop order reduction by a special form of feedback gain. Beneficial closed-loop properties are also derived from the closed-loop analysis. The prototype rover vehicle built with TETRIX and MyRIO-1900 experimentally validates the closed-loop performance and robustness improvement.},

Corresponding operational principles are analyzed and the expressions of balancing currents are derived by analytical methods and verified by experimental waveforms. According to the comparative balancing experiments for four and six series-connected Li-ion cells, one proposed CBB-PCSC equalizer, which achieves the dual AC2AC balancing modes through the integration of both coupled buck-boost (CBB) and parallel-connected switched-capacitor (PCSC) converters, leads to the highest balancing speed and efficiency. Moreover, compared with several conventional equalizers, this CBB-PCSC topology also has the compact size and low cost, making it become a well-performing integrated topology for automotive battery voltages equalization.},

The challenging MIOCP is then reformulated by introducing augmented terms in both objective function and the dynamic model to handle the integer control variables. The reformulated problem is solved with an optimal control software package developed by the authors, the performance of which is validated with dynamic programming and equivalent consumption minimization strategy.

In the existing CACC systems, the coupling between wireless communication uncertainty, and system states is not well modeled. In this paper, we integrate the jamming attacks, and wireless channel fading effects into the CACC state space equations such that it effectively captures the coupling impact. Then, we propose a novel time domain approach to analyze the mean string stability (MSS) of such a model. Based on the proposed model, we analyze the impact of the jammer&#39;s location on the string stability. We derive a sufficient condition for the packet successful delivery probability which indicates that the jammer has a higher probability to destabilize the string when it is closer to the first vehicle following the lead vehicle. We also propose a methodology to compute the upper, and lower bounds of the inter-vehicle distance trajectories between the lead vehicle, and its follower. Furthermore, string safety is investigated by numerically estimating the collision probability across the string. We conduct comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the stability, and safety of the string in various scenarios. We identify that string stability, and safety are highly influenced by the jamming attacks signal, and jammer&#39;s location.

Existing works usually study routing strategies, and cooperative scheduling to improve the efficiency of transmission. However, the data transmission remains inefficient because of the lack of full use of communication resources. The transmission is unreliable because information cannot be completely transmitted to the destination vehicles. Moreover, the increasing number of connected vehicles, and the limitation of available communication resources make task scheduling challenging in vehicular networks. In this work, we propose Cluster-enabled Cooperative Scheduling based on Reinforcement Learning (CCSRL) to improve the communication efficiency, and reliability of vehicular networks, with the goal of maximizing the information capacity. In particular, we leverage the stability to select a cluster head vehicle to enhance data transmission efficiency, and a reinforcement learning-based auxiliary transmission is further designed to guarantee the reliable communication among vehicles. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed scheduling algorithm, especially the performance of the packet delivery ratio, and node packet loss ratio, is better than that of the state-of-the-art algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Transportation system is facing a sharp disruption since the Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can free people from driving and provide good driving experience with the aid of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. Although CAVs bring benefits in terms of driving safety, vehicle string stability, and road traffic throughput, most existing work aims at improving only one of these performance metrics. However, these metrics may be mutually competitive, as they share the same communication and computing resource in a road segment. From the perspective of joint optimizing driving safety, vehicle string stability, and road traffic throughput, there is a big research gap to be filled on the resource management for connected autonomous driving. In this paper, we first explore the joint optimization on driving safety, vehicle string stability, and road traffic throughput by leveraging on the consensus Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers algorithm (ADMM). However, the limited communication bandwidth and on-board processing capacity incur the resource competition in CAVs. We next analyze the multiple tasks competition in the contention based medium access to attain the upper bound delay of V2V-related application offloading. An efficient sleeping multi-armed bandit tree-based algorithm is proposed to address the resource assignment problem. A series of simulation experiments are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {As a key smart transportation service, public vehicle systems are intended to improve traffic efficiency and vehicle occupancy ratios, and to reduce the number of vehicles on roads, by inducing travelers to share rides with others. Despite the clear logic behind this service, achieving a viable model for matching multiple riders to vehicles with low latency and high satisfaction remains an open issue. In this paper, we propose an Edge Computing based Public Vehicle (ECPV) system to improve traffic efficiency and vehicle occupancy ratios by scheduling ridesharing among travelers and reduce the delay of decision making by leveraging edge computing. Particularly, by introducing a metric of traveler satisfaction jointly considering travel time, distance, and costs (i.e., charge), we formalize public vehicle scheduling problem as an optimization problem with maximizing traveler satisfaction as objective to reduce travel time and improve traffic efficiency. Further, as achieving globally optimal matching of rides and travelers is time consuming, to reduce the delay of decision making (i.e., response to ride-traveler pairs matching) and improve real time ridesharing service and traveler satisfaction, an edge computing based ride request transmission mechanism and a tree based heuristic matching mechanism are proposed to effectively exchange ride requests and select appropriate vehicles for mostof ride requests on edge devices. Also, our ECPV system considers driverless cars as public vehicles to remove the subjective influence of drivers and improve the efficiency of vehicle scheduling, and introduces a graph partition based depot placement mechanism to determine vehicleparking locations and balance vehicle distribution across system. Through extensive performance evaluations, our experimental results show that our proposed ECPV system can effectively match ride requests to public vehicles, reduce travel times and distances for all trips, reducecharges to travelers, and improve vehicle occupancy.},

This paper proposes a Nash-Q learning based motion decision algorithm to consider the interaction. First, the local trajectory of surrounding vehicle is predicted by kinematic constraints, which can reflect the short-term motion trend. Then, the future action space is built based the predicted local trajectory that consists of five basis actions. With that, the Nash-Q learning process can be implemented by the game between these basis actions. By elimination of strictly dominated actions and the Lemke-Howson method, the autonomous vehicle can decide the optimal action and infer the behavior of surrounding vehicle. Finally, the lane merging scenario is built to test the performance contrast to the existing methods. The driver in loop experiment is further designed to verify the interaction performance in multi-vehicle traffic. The results show that the Nash-Q learning based algorithm can improve the efficiency and comfort by 15.75% and 20.71% to the Stackelberg game and the no-interaction method respectively while the safety is ensured. It can also make real-time interaction with human drivers in multi-vehicle traffic.},

The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with an unknown transition probability matrix and solved using deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The proposed method does not require any initial data on the PEV driver&#39;s behaviour and shows improvement on learning speed when compared to a pure model-free reinforcement learning method. A combination of model-based and model-free learning methods called Dyna-Q reinforcement learning is utilized in our strategy. Every time a real experience is obtained, the model is updated, and the RL agent will learn from both the real experience and “imagined” experiences from the model. Due to the vast amount of state space, a table-lookup method is impractical, and a value approximation method using deep neural networks is employed for estimating the long-term expected reward of all state-action pairs. An average of historical price and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network are used to predict future price. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and its ability to reach an optimal policy quicker while avoiding state of charge (SOC) depletion during trips when compared to existing PEV charging schemes.},

Centralized coordination methods globally coordinate vehicles approaching the intersection from all sections by considering their states altogether.

In this paper, we propose a centralized coordination scheme of automated vehicles at an intersection without traffic signals using reinforcement learning (RL) to address low computation efficiency suffered by current centralized coordination methods. We first propose an RL training algorithm, model accelerated proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO), which incorporates a prior model into proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to accelerate the learning process in terms of sample efficiency. Then we present the design of state, action and reward to formulate centralized coordination as an RL problem. Finally, we train a coordinate policy in a simulation setting and compare computing time and traffic efficiency with a coordination scheme based on model predictive control (MPC) method. Results show that our method spends only 1/400 of the computing time of MPC and increase the efficiency of the intersection by 4.5 times.},

  abstract     = {As electric vehicles (EVs) are connected to the distribution power system, EV owners desire to charge their EVs economically, reliably, confidentially and without requiring major modification to the charging systems in their EVs. At the same time, the increasing EV connections to the distribution power system can increase the electric load demand and decrease the power quality (PQ) of the power system due to the charging current of the EV chargers. It is, therefore, necessary to devise novel strategies for the coordination of the connection of EVs at the distribution level. Although different control methods have been proposed previously, most of these solutions require costly advanced infrastructures and computational resources. In this paper, a charging control system (CCS) using a hierarchical decision-making (HDM) approach is devised that can be easily applied for the economical and reliable charging of commercial EVs with minor modifications while improving the PQ in the power grids. The HDM approach includes a primitive energy management strategy and an adaptive droop control for the real-time operation. A thorough investigation of the effectiveness of the proposed CSS to meet the major needs of EV owners while improving the PQ of the distribution network has been carried out. The results from the case studies show that the CCS can satisfy the preferences of the EV owners, while improving the PQ of distribution grids. Specifically, the CCS can meet the economical and reliable EV charging for the EV owners, and at the same time maintain the voltage deviation within the acceptable PQ limits.},

The key requirements of an effective platooning strategy include keeping a safe inter-vehicle space, ensuring string stability and satisfying vehicular constraints. To meet these requirements, this paper proposes a distributed min-max model predictive control (MPC). One technical contribution is that the proposed MPC can guarantee input-to-state predecessor-follower string stability, in the presence of vehicle-to-vehicle communication delays and realistic constraints. Another technical contribution is the development of a new concept of input-to-state stability margin for analyzing the platooning system that is nonlinear under MPC. The proposed MPC is applicable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous platoons because only the point-mass vehicle model is needed. The proposed MPC also has reduced communication burden because each vehicle in the platoon only transmits its current acceleration to the adjacent follower. The design efficacy is verified by simulating a platoon composed of five vehicles under different uncertainties and communication delays.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered to relieve energy crisis, and environmental problems due to their high efficiency, and low emissions, and energy management strategies (EMSs) have been extensively studied to improve the performance of hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) for EVs. To effectively reduce HESS energy loss, and extend battery life, this paper proposes a predictive EMS (PEMS) for the battery/supercapacitor HESSs. First, the pattern sequence-based velocity predictor is presented to accurately predict the future short-term velocity profile. Second, the PEMS is proposed by formulating an HESS power split optimization problem, where the HESS energy loss, and the battery capacity loss are considered. Third, an improved chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented to solve the formulated optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the benchmark, the proposed PEMS can effectively reduce the HESS energy loss, and extend the battery lifetime at the same time.},

  abstract     = {Motion simulation platforms (MSPs) are widely used to generate driving/flying motion sensations for the users. The MSPs have a restricted workspace area due to the dynamical and physical restrictions of the Motion Platforms active joints as well as the physical limitations of its passive joints. The motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is the reproduction of the motion signal including linear accelerations and angular velocities. It aims to simultaneously respect the MSP&#39;s workspace limitations and make the same motion feeling for the user as a real vehicle. The Classical washout filter (WF) is a well-known type of MCA. The classical WF is easy to set-up, offers a low computational burden and high functionality but has some major drawbacks such as fixed WF parameters tuned according to worst-case scenarios and no consideration of the human vestibular system. As a result, adaptive WFs were developed to consider the human vestibular system and enhance the efficiency of the method using time-varying filters. The existing adaptive WFs only cogitate the boundaries of the end-effector in the Cartesian coordinate space as a substitute for the active and passive joints limitations, which is MSP&#39;s main limiting factor. This conservative assumption reduces the available workspace area of the MSP and increases the motion sensation error for the MSPs user. In this study, a fuzzy logic-based WF is developed, to consider the dynamical and physical boundaries of the active joints as well as the physical boundaries of the passive joints. A genetic algorithm is used to select the membership functions&#39; values of the active and passive joints&#39; boundaries. The model is designed using MATLAB /Simulink and the outcomes demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method versus existing adaptive WFs.},

The stability of the dynamic system model-based estimation algorithm is analyzed, establishing the convergence of the estimation error to zero. In the proposed ML-based approach, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is designed to estimate trailer mass. The inputs of the ML-based method have been selected based on the tractor-trailer dynamic model, and are considered to be normalized by the tractor mass, tire sizes, and geometry so that re-training of the network is not needed for different towing vehicles. The simulation and experimental results justify the accuracy of the trailer mass estimation in various cases and demonstrate that the trailer mass can be estimated with less than 10% error.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on racecar longitudinal control with highly-varying driving conditions. The main factors affecting the dynamic behavior of a vehicle, including aerodynamic forces, wheel rolling resistance, traction force resulting from changing tire-road interaction as well as the occurrence of sudden wind gusts or the presence of persistent winds, are considered and assumed to have unknown models. By exploiting the theory on delayed input-state observers and using measurement data about the vehicle and wheel speeds, a dynamic filter that allows the online reconstruction of the above-mentioned unknown time-varying quantities is derived. Moreover, by exploiting the notion of effective tire radius, a reduced-degree-of-freedom model for the longitudinal vehicle dynamics is obtained, which is independent of the traction force and that enables, when used with the observer filter described above, an accurate speed control compensating for the resistance forces. One appealing feature of the proposed estimation and control method is that it requires no model information about such forces, for which, at the state-of-the-art, only heuristic approximations to be a-priori identified are available. Its effectiveness is shown via the simulation of scenarios where the car is required to execute aggressive maneuvers and the asphalt road surface abruptly changes from dry to wet, snowy, and icy. The evaluation also reveals that the proposed estimation technique outperforms standard solutions even in the presence of measurement noise.},

  abstract     = {In Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) ecosystems, intelligent toll gates (ITGs) connect nearby metropolitan cities through smart highways. At ITGs, existing solutions integrate blockchain (BC) and deep-learning schemes to leverage trusted and responsive analytics support for connected smart vehicles (CSVs) at ITGs. BC eliminates third-party intermediaries, and secures payments between vehicle owners (VO) and governing authorities (GA). Deep-Learning, on the other hand, facilitates accurate predictions for diverse and complex urban traffic conditions. However, due to fixed toll pricing schemes based on connected smart vehicles (CSV) type, VOs suffer from variable delays at different lanes due to dynamic congestion scenarios. To address the research gaps of such a fixed pricing schemes, we propose a BC-envisioned scheme DwaRa, that operates in three phases. In the first phase, future traffic is predicted based on Markov queues to balance the congestion at different lanes at ITGs efficiently. Then, we propose a novel spatially induced-long-short term memory (SI-LSTM) model to predict current traffic and weather based on historical repositories. Second, based on inputs by the Markov model, SI-LSTM, lane type, and vehicle type, a dynamic pricing algorithm is presented to improve the quality of experience (QoE) of the VO. Finally, based on dynamic price fixation between the VO and the GA, smart contracts (SCs) are executed and transactional data is secured through BC. The proposed scheme is compared against parameters like average mean-squared error (MSE), predicted traffic, scalability, interplanetary file system (IPFS) storage, computation (CC), and communication cost (CCM). At n = 100 test samples, and arrival rate β = 80, the obtained MSE is 0.0012, with a peak average value of 0.00526. The overall CC is 45.88 milliseconds (ms) and CCM is 53 bytes that indicate the proposed scheme efficacy against conventional approaches.},

  abstract     = {Due to advantages of handling problems with nonlinearity and uncertainty, Gaussian process regression (GPR) has been widely used in the area of driver behaviour modelling. However, traditional GPR lacks the ability of transferring knowledge from one driver to another, which limits the generalisation ability of GPR, especially when sufficient data for driver behaviour modelling are not available. To solve this limitation, in this paper, a novel GPR model, Importance Weighted Gaussian Process Regression (IWGPR) is proposed. The importance weight (IW) represents the probabilistic density ratio between two drivers and the unconstrained least-squares importance fitting (ULSIF) is applied to calculate IW. Meanwhile, an IW-based model selection (IWMS) method is proposed to help the model select optimal parameters. Using IWGPR, sufficient historical data collected from one driver can be used to model another driver with insufficient data, and thus improve the generalisation ability of GPR. To verify the proposed algorithm, a toy regression problem is used to illustrate the working mechanism of IWGPR. With simulated and naturalistic driving data, three experiments for driver behaviour modelling in the lane change scenario, are designed and carried out. Experimental results indicate that IWGPR performs better than GPR when sufficient data are not provided by the new driver, which proves the generalisation ability of IWGPR. Meanwhile, the comparative study between different transferable driver behaviour learning methods is detailed and analysed.},

Cooperative vehicles can quickly cover the entire environment by communicating and cooperating with each other and can also reduce localization and mapping error by merging the cooperative vehicle information from observation and navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for an effective solution of navigation and mapping for cooperative vehicles in an unknown environment. We present an improved centralized and collaborative monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (CCM-SLAM) approach. The proposed algorithm can accurately compute the transformation matrix for cooperative vehicle maps and reduce the communication delay, data loss among vehicles and decrease the bandwidth demand. The quaternion and credibility similarity transformation (QC-Sim(3)) method we proposed is used to accurately merge the matched maps and accomplish loop closures. The sending messages at variable frequencies (SMVF) method we proposed and an improved detection and resending lost data (I-DRLD) method we proposed can improve the accuracy of pose estimation. SMVF solves the time-delay problem by sending messages to the vehicles at flexible frequencies while I-DRLD detects and resends the lost data. We also adopt Intra-frame Feature Compression (IFC) to decrease the bandwidth demand in the process of the transmitting data. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {This study proposed an augmentation function to current active pedestrian safety systems (APSSs), which is expected to be effective for pedestrian crashes caused by pedestrians’ unexpected behavior. The augmentation function estimates the crash risk with a pedestrian given its time-space-distance relationship with the pedestrian; the crash risk represents the probability of hitting that pedestrian given all the pedestrian&#39;s possible random trajectories in the near future. Once the crash risk exceeds a toleration threshold, the augmentation function activates evasive actions, even if there is no current conflict with the pedestrian. A Monte Carlo process was used to estimate the crash risk under different sets of vehicle and pedestrian kinematic features. The possible pedestrian trajectories were sampled from a fine-tuned Markovian integrated random walk model; in particular, kinematic variations between pedestrian types were considered. Then, the effectiveness of evasive actions was evaluated. It was found that children and young/middle-aged pedestrians require higher-intensity evasive actions in zones of moderate and severe crash risk; while old pedestrians need higher-intensity evasive actions in zones of mild crash risk. In addition, it is necessary to select proper speed reduction rate and combination of lane change and speed, to reduce the crash risk. Finally, the study demonstrated that a field of view of 50° and a detection range of 40 m would be the minimum requirement to support the augmentation function, which requires an upgrade for many automobile manufacturers’ current APSSs.},

This is achieved without any loss of error correction performance by applying simplified path-metric (PM) computations for the rate-0, rate-1 and repetition sub-graphs of the proposed Fast Log-SCS decoder. Furthermore, a software implementation of the 32-bit fixed-point Fast Log-SCS polar decoder is conceived for x86 processors, which maintains the same block error ratio (BLER) as the floating-point Log-SCS polar decoder. Additionally, our software implementation is accelerated using SIMD instructions by relying on 512-bit Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX-512) and recursive template meta-programming for the first time, achieving a parallelism of 16, which makes it eminently suitable for the low-latency requirements of software-defined radio systems.},

The proposed receiver does not require channel estimation or equalization to perform coherent data detection. Instead, channel estimation, equalization, and data detection are combined into a single operation, and hence, the detector performs a direct data detector (D 3 ). The D 3 is applied to key practical wireless systems such as the Long Term Evolution (LTE) and the New Radio (NR) of the fifthgeneration (5G) system. The performance of the proposed D 3 is thoroughly analyzed theoretically in terms of bit error rate (BER), where closed-form accurate approximations are derived for several cases of interest, and validated by Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, extensive complexity analysis are performed to evaluate the system suitability for implementation. The obtained theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that the BER of the proposed D3 is only 3 dB away from coherent detectors with perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) in flat and frequency-selective fading channels for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). If CSI is not known perfectly, then D 3 outperforms the coherent detector substantially, particularly at high SNRs with linear interpolation. The computational complexity of D 3 depends on the length of the sequence to be detected, nevertheless, a significant complexity reduction can be achieved using the Viterbi algorithm.},

The proposed GBSM considers the both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) components in the transmission links from a UAV transmitter (Tx) to a ground receiver (Rx), the proposed 3D GBSM is used for the first time to investigate the impact of UAV rotation, which results in time-varying channel parameters and reflects the non-stationarity of channel. Based on the proposed model, we derive and study some significant statistical properties, including the transfer function, space-time-frequency correlation function, Doppler power spectrum, and quasi-stationary interval. Numerical results show that the UAV rotation has a significant impact on channel statistical properties and non-stationarity. It is found that, even for a low range of UAV rotations, channel correlations are significantly affected, and the time correlation gradually increases with the pitch angle of UAV. Finally, the impact of using directional antennas at Tx on channel characteristics is analyzed. It is found that the channel correlation with directional antenna is significantly increased compared with the results with omnidirectional antenna. These observations and conclusions can be used as a reference for the system design and performance analysis of UAV-MIMO communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Metro is important public transportation in reducing traffic congestion, protecting the environment, and moving more people efficiently. Due to ever-increasing demands on high data rate, and seamless connections of the onboard passengers, millimeter-wave (mmWave) wideband communications are considered as potential options. Therefore, realistic mmWave channel characterization, and modeling are important for the system design, network planning, and performance prediction in metro. In this work, mmWave propagation channel is analyzed, and a hybrid channel model is proposed for inside metro environment. By conducting channel measurement at 26.5-40 GHz, and calibrating ray-tracing (RT) simulations, the propagation mechanisms are revealed, the influence of the objects is found, and principal specular reflected rays are traced. A hybrid ray, and graph channel model is proposed to effectively model the diffuse scattering components by adding scattered points around principle paths traced by RT. The proposed model is validated by measurements at different receiving positions. The analysis of the channel characteristics in power, delay, and angular domains indicates that the hybrid model is appropriate to model multipath propagation in the confined metro train environment, where many objects exist, and reverberation is important.},

  abstract     = {This paper analyses the experimentally-assessed dual-polarized (DP) mobile channel in a tunnel environment at 1.35 GHz under traffic conditions. We investigate the impact of antenna polarization and radiation pattern on the non-stationary vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) channel. Basic channel evaluation metrics are examined including path gain, co-polarization ratio (CPR), and cross-polarization discrimination (XPD). In addition, the stationarity region is estimated using the channel correlation function approach, and used to calculate the time-varying delay and Doppler power profiles. Statistical models are presented for parameters like CPR, XPD, RMS delay and Doppler spreads, where the lognormal distribution provides the best fit. The polarization and the opening angle of the antennas into the propagation channel are found to strongly influence the observed non-stationarity of the channel. They impact the degree of multipath richness that is captured, thus providing different path gain, delay and Doppler spreads. Based on our analysis, the directional antenna with vertical polarization provides the longest stationarity time of 400 ms at 90 km/h, as well as the highest path gain and lowest dispersion. Furthermore, the DP channel capacity is calculated and its dependence on different normalization approaches is investigated. We propose a more accurate normalization for the DP channels that takes the conservation of energy into account. Moreover, the subchannels correlation coefficients are determined. While the condition number is found to be low on average, the correlation results show high correlation among the DP subchannels. As conclusion, we show how the CPR and XPD play the main role in providing multiplexing gain for DP tunnel channels.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to play a key role in intelligent transportation systems to complement the communication infrastructure in future smart cities. UAV-assisted vehicular networking research typically adopts throughput and latency as the main performance metrics. These conventional metrics, however, are not adequate to reflect the freshness of the information, an attribute that has been recently identified as a critical requirement to enable services such as autonomous driving and accident prevention. In this paper, we consider a UAV-assisted single-hop vehicular network, wherein sensors (e.g., LiDARs and cameras) on vehicles generate time sensitive data streams, and UAVs are used to collect and process this data while maintaining a minimum age of information (AoI). We aim to jointly optimize the trajectories of UAVs and find scheduling policies to keep the information fresh under minimum throughput constraints. The formulated optimization problem is shown to be mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and generally hard to be solved. Motivated by the success of machine learning (ML) techniques particularly deep learning in solving complex problems with low complexity, we reformulate the trajectories and scheduling policies problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the system state space considers the vehicular network dynamics. Then, we develop deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the vehicular environment and its dynamics in order to handle UAVs&#39; trajectory and scheduling policy. In particular, we leverage Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for learning the trajectories of the deployed UAVs to efficiently minimize the Expected Weighted Sum AoI (EWSA). Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show the deployed UAVs adapt their velocities during the data collection mission in order to minimize the AoI.},

In this paper, we consider multiple-input single-output (MISO) transmissions from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to a receiver, assisted by a practical IRS with a power budget constraint. The IRS can work in energy harvesting, and signal reflecting phases. It firstly harvests RF energy from the AP&#39;s signal beamforming, and then uses it to sustain its operations in the signal reflecting phase. We aim to characterize the maximum capacity by optimizing the AP&#39;s transmit beamforming, the IRS&#39;s time allocation in two operational phases, and the IRS&#39;s passive beamforming to enhance the information rate. To solve the non-convex maximization problem, we exploit its structural properties, and decompose it into two sub-problems in two phases. The IRS&#39;s phase shift optimization in the reflecting phase follows a conventional passive beamforming problem to maximize the received signal power. In the energy harvesting phase, the IRS&#39;s time allocation, and the AP&#39;s transmit beamforming are jointly optimized using monotonic optimization.

With the objective of maximising the total sum rate of all uplink and downlink user pairs, a user pairing problem is formulated. A traditional method such as Hungarian algorithm for this problem requires high computational complexity, which is impractical when the number of users increases. In this paper, we solve this problem using pointer network with lower computational complexity. Specifically, a pointer network with beam search technique and collision avoidance policy is developed and applied to the user pairing problem of different scaled scenarios. We compare our prediction performance with other two low-complexity methods called greedy assignment and random assignment algorithms. Simulation results show that our proposed method can effectively and efficiently solve the user pairing problems for both fixed and dynamic number of users. Meanwhile, our proposed method outperforms the two benchmark methods in terms of optimal ratio, average bias ratio and average total sum rate.},

To tackle this problem, an algorithm of joint beamforming and power allocation via alternating optimization (JBFPA-AO) is proposed.

  abstract     = {A generalised spatial modulation-aided sparse space-time-frequency spreading (GSM/SSTFS) scheme is proposed for supporting large-scale access at a high normalized user-load in next-generation systems by simultaneously exploiting the transmit diversity in the spatial- and frequency-domain. Specifically, in the GSM/SSTFS system employing two transmit antennas (TAs), each user equipment (UE) spreads its signal over two symbol durations, two active TAs, and multiple subcarriers by a unique pre-assigned sparse code, in order to attain spreading in three dimensions (3D). Furthermore, with the aid of GSM, extra information bits are embedded in the TA indices. At the receiver, a joint message passing-aided (JMPA) detector is employed for attaining near-single-user bit error rate (BER) performance, which is also compared to that of conventional multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) systems.},

We use the beam sweeping to find the best codeword and its two neighboring codewords to form a composite beam. We then estimate the channel gain based on the composite beam, which is computed off-line by minimizing the variance of beam gain within beam coverage. With the estimated channel gain, we propose a multicast beamforming design method under the max-min fair (MMF) criterion. To reduce the computational complexity, we divide the large antenna array into several small-size sub-arrays, where the size of each sub-array is determined by the estimated channel gain. In particular, we introduce a phase factor for each sub-array to explore additional degree of freedom for the considered problem. Simulation results show that the proposed multicast beamforming design method can substantially reduce the computational complexity with little performance sacrifice compared to the existing methods.},

Specifically, user 1 is a latency-tolerant user which has one packet with long latency requirement, while user 2 is latency-sensitive user which has multiple packets with short latency requirements. To precisely characterize the transmission latency, the finite blocklength codes (FBC) capacity formula is used to measure the achievable date rates of the users. To cope with the heterogeneous latency requirements of users, a hybrid NOMA scheme is proposed. In the hybrid NOMA scheme, the packets of user 2 are non-orthogonally delivered with the packet of user 1 in a sequential way by taking the packets arrivals and deadlines into consideration. Due to complicate FBC capacity formula and the coupling effects of the variables, the formulated transmission energy minimization problem is challenging to solve. However, by properly utilizing the the fact that the transmission energy is monotonically decreasing with the blocklength, the optimal transmission blocklength and power of user 1 are derived in semiclosed-forms; while the remaining problem, for determining the transmission blocklength and power of user 2, is efficiently solved by using a successive upperbound minimization based algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed hybrid NOMA scheme.},

However, there is a paucity of work on the finite-length performance estimation of LDPC coded CPM, primarily because existing performance estimation techniques cannot be readily applied to the LDPC coded CPM. To fill this gap, we conceive an analytical bit error probability estimation technique for finite-length LDPC coded CPM in the waterfall region.

In order to alleviate the restriction on transmission reliability, transmission capacity and energy efficiency, this paper proposes a NOMA-assisted on-demand transmission scheme for monitoring applications in industrial IoT networks. Then, an constrained optimization problem is formulated to maximum the energy efficiency under constraints of heterogenous transmission requirements and limited spectrum resources. In the solution process, the proposed scheme determines the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order by taking advantage of the heterogenous requirements of different applications, which significantly reduces the solution complexity caused by the tight coupling of decoding order, power control and channel assignment. Moreover, the pairwise matching based algorithm and the minimum cost flow based algorithm is designed to solve the formulated mixed integer programming problem effectively. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could meet the transmission requirements for heterogenous monitoring applications with limited spectrum resources and has advantages on improving the energy efficiency for the industrial IoT network with battery-powered sensors.},

However, the deployment and scheduling of ABSs introduce several algorithmic challenges. In particular, on-demand communication can change over time and be hard to accurately predict, so it needs to be handled in an online manner, accounting also for battery consumption constraints. This paper presents AirNet, an efficient software-based solution to operate ABSs which meet these requirements. AirNet is based on an efficient placement algorithm for ABSs which maximizes the number of covered users, and a scheduler which navigates and recharges ABSs in an energy-aware manner. To this end, we propose an energy-aware deployment algorithm and use an energy model to analyze the power consumption and thereby, improve the flight endurance. In addition, we evaluate a novel scheduling mechanism that efficiently manages the ABSs&#39; operations. Our simulations indicate that our approach can significantly improve the flight endurance and user coverage compared to a recent state-of-the-art approach.},

In this paper, we present a new vision of Digital Twin Edge Networks (DITEN) where digital twins (DTs) of edge servers estimate edge servers&#39; states and DT of the entire MEC system provides training data for offloading decision. A mobile offloading scheme is proposed in DITEN to minimize the offloading latency under the constraints of accumulated consumed service migration cost during user mobility. The Lyapunov optimization method is leveraged to simplify the long-term migration cost constraint to a multi-objective dynamic optimization problem, which is then solved by Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning. Simulations results show that our proposed scheme effectively diminishes the average offloading latency, the offloading failure rate, and the service migration rate, as compared with benchmark schemes, while saving the system cost with DT assistance.},

However, the computation services will be significantly affected by the UAVs&#39; capacities, and distinct power IoT applications. In this paper, we firstly propose a cooperative UAV-enabled MEC network structure in which the UAVs are able to help other UAVs to execute the computation tasks. Then, a cooperative computation offloading scheme is presented while considering the interference mitigation from UAVs to devices. To maximize the long-term utility of the proposed UAV-enabled MEC network, an optimization problem is formulated to obtain the optimal computation offloading decisions, and resource management policies. Considering the random devices&#39; demands and time-varying communication channels, the problem is further formulated as a semi-Markov process, and the deep reinforcement learning based algorithms are proposed in both of the centralized and distributed UAV-enabled MEC networks. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed DRL-based schemes in the UAV-enabled MEC framework by giving numerical results.},

In this paper, we focus on the joint remote radio head (RRH) activation and user association problem in dense C-RANs. Considering that a certain required minimum data rate may not be satisfied universally for all users in some situation, we aim to first maximize the number of users whose minimum data rate constraints can be guaranteed, and then maximize the system profit, which is a combination of the system throughput and the total power consumption. Due to the NP-hard feature of the problem, the conventional algorithms are impractical when the network size is large due to large computational complexity. Therefore, we adopt the max-sum algorithm to efficiently solve the joint RRH activation and user association problem, which can be implemented efficiently in a distributed manner. The signaling overhead of the max-sum algorithm can be reduced further by simplifying message updating rules and by shortening messages exchanged between nodes. Considering the fact that the high density of RRH deployment may hinder the convergence rate of the max-sum algorithm, we also propose a simplified algorithm by decomposing the original problem into two sub-problems, and each can be solved by the max-sum algorithm individually. Simulation results prove the efficiencies of the proposed algorithms.},

Centralized, cloud-based infrastructures present latencies too high to satisfy the requirements of emergency information processing and transmission, while Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication is too variable for reliable in-time information transmission. In this paper, we present EAVVE, a novel Vehicle-to-Everything system, consisting of vehicles with and without comprehensive data processing capabilities, facilitated by edge servers co-located with roadside units. Adding computation capabilities at the edge of the network allows reducing the overall latency compared to vehicle-to-cloud and makes up for scenarios in which in-vehicle computational power is not sufficient to satisfy the service demand. To improve the offloading efficiency, we propose a decentralized algorithm for real-time task scheduling and a client/server algorithm for information filtering. We demonstrate the practical applications of EAVVE with a bandwidth-hungry, latency constrained real-life prototype system that connects vehicular vision through Augmented Reality vision. We evaluate this prototype system with real-life road tests. We complement this practical evaluation with extensive simulations based on real-world base station and vehicular traffic data to demonstrate the scalability of EAVVE and its performance in citywide scenarios. EAVVE decreases the latency by 42.6% and 78.7% compared to local and remote cloud solutions while relaxing congestion at the bottleneck by 99% with reasonable infrastructure expenditure.},

  abstract     = {5G beyond is an end-edge-cloud orchestrated network that can exploit heterogeneous capabilities of the end devices, edge servers, and the cloud and thus has the potential to enable computation-intensive and delay-sensitive applications via computation offloading. However, in multi user wireless networks, diverse application requirements and the possibility of various radio access modes for communication among devices make it challenging to design an optimal computation offloading scheme. In addition, having access to complete network information that includes variables such as wireless channel state, available bandwidth and computation resources, is a major issue. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is an emerging technique to address such an issue with limited and less accurate network information. In this paper, we utilize DRL to design an optimal computation offloading and resource allocation strategy for minimizing system energy consumption. We first present a multi-user end-edge-cloud orchestrated network where all devices and base stations have computation capabilities. Then, we formulate the joint computation offloading and resource allocation problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a new DRL algorithm to minimize system energy consumption. Numerical results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmark policies in terms of system energy consumption. Extensive simulations show that learning rate, discount factor, and number of devices have considerable influence on the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Energy harvesting has been recognized as a good paradigm to decrease traditional grid energy expenditure, which caters for 5G visions on the green evolution of cellular networks. However, the harvested energy at each base station is random and intermittent, which imposes a great challenge to reliably satisfy the time-varying users&#39; wireless traffic requirements. What&#39;s worse, the perfect probability distributions of harvested energy and wireless traffic are hard to obtain in practical systems, making it difficult to apply the conventional optimization approach to cope with the uncertainties in the energy management problems. Inspired by this fact, we propose a distributionally robust two-stage stochastic optimization framework to minimize the expected total energy cost of mobile network operators (MNOs) in the finite time horizon. To circumvent the computational difficulty of this stochastic optimization problem, we define a novel ambiguity set to capture the uncertainties of the harvested energy and wireless traffic based on their first- and second-order statistics information. By employing the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) methodology, we equivalently transform the original two-stage stochastic programming problem into a computationally tractable second-order cone programming problem. Then, a distributionally robust two-stage energy management algorithm (DRTEMA) is proposed, which has good performance of low complexity and only requires partial information of the stochastic parameters. Rigorous computational complexity analysis and extensive numerical simulations are conducted to show the advantages of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In mobile edge computing (MEC), it is challenging to offload tasks to appropriate edge nodes due to the heterogeneity in both tasks and edge nodes. Most existing task offloading mechanisms mainly aim at optimizing the global system performance, e.g., social welfare, while ignoring the personal preferences of the individual tasks and edge nodes. However, in an open MEC system, a task offloading decision is prone to be unstable if edge nodes or task owners have incentives to deviate from the decided allocation, and seek for alternative choices to improve their own utilities. In addition, to win the competition, task owners may gradually adjust their payments, which brings new challenge in achieving the stability of the system. To address the above issues, this paper constructs a distributed many-to-many matching model to capture the interaction between mobile tasks and edge nodes, with the consideration of their diverse resource requirements and availabilities. Based on this, we design both distributed and centralized stable matching based algorithms to jointly offload the tasks to edge nodes, and determine their payments. We prove that the proposed mechanisms achieve several desirable properties including individual rationality, stability, and convergency. It is also proved that the proposed schemes can get optimal social welfare, when the considered tasks are homogeneous in terms of their resource requirements. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed work.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of downlink radio resource management for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) in fifth generation (5G) systems. To support low-latency communications, we study performance of two multiplexing schemes namely in-resource control signalling and joint encoding of data and metadata. In the former, the metadata and data are separately encoded and the metadata is sent at the beginning of transmission time prior to the data. Thus, it benefits from a low-complexity receiver structure to decode the data block. The latter takes advantages of transmitting a larger blocklength to enhance the reliability and improve spectrum efficiency by jointly encoding data and metadata as a single codeword. Dealing with small URLLC payloads, the overhead and error of sending metadata are not negligible and have a significant impact on the system performance in terms of resource usage the reliability of transmission. For each scheme, we derive expressions for the outage probability and resource usage by taking into account impacts of the finite blocklength payloads, overhead and error of sending metadata, and probability of error in uplink feedback channel. We propose a novel framework for joint data and metadata link adaptation to minimize the average number of allocated resources, while ensuring the stringent URLLC quality of service requirements. An optimization problem is formulated for each scheme that is mixed-integer non-convex problem, difficult to solve in polynomial time. Solutions based on successive convex optimization are proposed. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed algorithms perform close to the optimal solution and demonstrate remarkable gains of up to 27% improvement in resource usage. Finally, we present sensitivity analysis of the results for various network parameters.},

  abstract     = {Due to the explosive growth of data traffic, and poor indoor coverage, ultra-dense network (UDN) has been introduced as a fundamental architectural technology for 5G-and-beyond systems. As the telecom operator is shifting to a plug-and-play paradigm in mobile networks, network planning, and optimization become difficult, and costly, especially in residential small-cell base stations (SBSs) deployment. Under this circumstance, severe inter-cell interference (ICI) becomes inevitable. Therefore, interference mitigation is of vital importance for indoor coverage in mobile communication systems. In this paper, we propose a fully distributed self-learning interference mitigation (SLIM) scheme for autonomous networks under a model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. In SLIM, individual SBSs autonomously perceive surrounding interferences, and determine downlink transmit power without necessity of signaling interactions between SBSs for mitigating interferences. To tackle the dimensional disaster of joint action in the MARL model, we employ the Mean Field Theory to approximate the action value function to greatly decrease the computational complexity. Simulation results based on 3GPP dual-stripe urban model demonstrate that SLIM outperforms several existing known interference coordination schemes in mitigating interference, and reducing power consumption while guaranteeing UEs&#39; quality of service for autonomous UDNs.},

  abstract     = {Next generation (5G and beyond) mobile networks will highly rely on distributed heterogeneous infrastructure, which is foreseen to create a versatile resource ecosystem. In such network deployments, efficient traffic allocation and management is of prominent priority. The increasing congestion conditions of cellular infrastructures have steered extensive research focus towards Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) access solutions. The deployment of dense multiple radio access technology (RAT) networks combined with the enhanced capabilities of mobile devices to maintain concurrent connections through different RATs, add up to the complexity of the traffic allocation problem. Traffic allocation becomes more challenging when using diverse technologies concurrently to serve multiple traffic classes of different Quality of Service (QoS) demands. Towards a viable solution, we have proposed a pricing-based network selection process for heterogeneous networks, running in a distributed manner, which has proved to lead to equilibrium under the developed policies. In this paper, we extend our pricing algorithm by providing a new approach that introduces personalized pricing based on the load pressure that an allocation decision will impose to a RAT. The central system decisions are confined to dynamically select the UE polling rank policy that is presenting the closest potential performance to that of the optimal centralized solution, used as the benchmark ranking. The optimal policy is based on proportional fairness and is used as a reference centralized policy to drive our distributed solutions. We assess the enhanced pricing scheme proposed in this work, and we employ extensive simulations and testbed experimentation to evaluate its performance in terms of efficient bandwidth allocation, price variation, fairness and induced cost to clients served by the HetNet.},

The design of vehicle recruitment in edge-assisted mobile crowdsensing is challenging due to the selfishness, and the uneven distribution of vehicles, as well as the spatiotemporal constraints of vehicular crowdsensing applications. To deal with these challenges, this paper proposes an incentive-aware vehicle recruitment scheme for edge-assisted mobile crowdsensing. In particular, we first design an incentive mechanism to motivate cooperation among the edge server, and the intelligent vehicles, and apply the Nash bargaining theory to obtain the optimal cooperation decision. Furthermore, a practical, and efficient scheme is proposed to weigh the contribution of vehicles. Then, we formulate the participant recruitment as an optimization problem, and prove that it is NP-hard. To address this problem, an effective heuristic algorithm with a guaranteed approximation ratio is proposed, by leveraging the property in submodular optimization. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations, based on a real dataset, to validate the superiority of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {Live video streaming has become one of the key applications in mobile wireless networks. To offload the bandwidth requirement in both backhaul and radio access networks, the integration of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and multicasting have become a natural candidate. However, less attention has been paid to the user Quality of Experience-driven (QoE-driven) approach to optimize the radio resource management of multicasting in mobile wireless networks. In this work, we study the optimal radio resource management, including modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection, radio resource blocks allocation, and Forward Error Correction (FEC), for multicasting in LTE networks with the assistance of MEC. We formulate it as a convex optimization problem and propose a weighted sub-gradient (WSG) method to find the near-optimal solution. In addition, we also propose a heuristic algorithm based on the concept of Maximizing marginal Gain and Minimizing marginal Loss (MGML). Our simulation results show that both approaches are able to achieve near-optimal solutions and outperform previous work, including MSML [11] and OLM [14]. Our simulation results also show that WSG yields the best QoE fairness index while MGML yields the best system utility in most scenarios.},

We formulate the joint optimization problem, aims at minimizing the conventional grid energy consumption while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements of users. To deal with the mixed integer non-linear optimization problem, the original problem is decomposed into three lower level problems, i.e., content caching, content delivery and energy cooperation. We first propose an alternative iterative algorithm to optimize content caching and content delivery by jointly applying convex optimization techniques and matching theory. Then, by discussing two representative energy cooperative scenarios of smart grid supported networks, we propose efficient energy cooperation algorithms for the two scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, the joint content caching, content delivery and energy cooperation optimization algorithms are developed to minimize the conventional grid energy consumption in the considered HetNets. Simulation results demonstrate that the joint algorithms can significantly reduce the conventional grid energy consumption compared with other benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Network densification has been a driven force for boosting capacity throughout the different generation of cellular networks. In the current 5G networks, extreme densification is a core technology to meet the ever-increasing capacity demand by reusing the spectrum over the spatial domain. As the cell density increases, so does the handover rate, diminishing the user throughput that could potentially undermine the prospective capacity gains. Furthermore, advanced interference mitigation techniques are needed to cope with the co-channel interference, adding extra backhaul traffic. In this paper, we propose a cell-association strategy based on radio environment maps for dense 5G networks that maximises the average user throughput across the network. By exploiting the stored channel states and user location, we connect cellular users to the optimal tier dynamically. Based on stochastic geometry, the association probability and the coverage probability have been derived for dense 5G networks, where the base stations&#39; locations follow Poisson Point Processes. Moreover, the user throughput and backhaul traffic are evaluated to assess its performance in dense 5G networks. The proposed technique is validated via Monte Carlo simulations and compared to different cell-association techniques. Results show that our scheme finds a balance between the coverage probability and the handover rate by numerical optimisation. In particular, it increases the average user throughput by 65% over the traditional approach, and it reduces the amount of overhead up to 68% over the other cell-association strategies.},

  abstract     = {In a large-scale wireless sensor network, it is typically impossible to use all the sensors to localize a source due to the limited communication range and battery power of the sensor nodes, thereby a sensor selection procedure is required. In this paper, the sensor selection problem for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) based localization is addressed. We propose two nearly optimal sensor selection methods: one is based on the original TDOA model and the other is based on the transformed time-of-arrival (TOA) model. Both methods aim to minimize the trace of the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) under the condition of fixed number of selected sensors. For the first method, we introduce a special vector to distinguish the reference sensor with the non-reference sensors. We then formulate a non-convex optimization problem with a Boolean vector as the optimization variable. For the second method, we first prove that the CRLB for TDOA-based localization is exactly the same with that for TOA-based localization where the start transmission time is unknown. We then formulate a non-convex optimization problem to minimize the CRLB for TOA-based localization. Both non-convex optimization problems are relaxed as convex semidefinite programs (SDPs) by applying semidefinite relaxation, followed by the Gaussian randomization procedure to improve the quality of the SDP solutions if necessary. Simulation results show that the performance of proposed methods approaches that of the exhaustive search method.},

This paper introduces full duplex (FD) technology into UUDN and presents a joint scheme of user access, subchannel allocation and power control for FD UUDN. The scheme firstly judges the feasibility of the constraints of the transmit power and rate requirements. If they are feasible, the total network capacity is maximized under the transmit power constraints. Otherwise, the minimal total power of the network is found to satisfy the rate requirements. The sum rate maximization is solved by multiplicative linear fractional programming (MLFP) based power allocation (MAPEL) algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, respectively. The power minimization problem is transformed by averaging the total rate in each subchannel of the user, and then solved by time-sharing method. Simulation demonstrates the enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the reduction of consumed power for UUDN compared with cell-centric UDN. Moreover, the advantage of FD over half duplex (HD) is shown in terms of spectrum efficiency and power consumption.},

In particular, a Markov queueing system model with reneging is proposed for the cloud subsystem, in order to consider the premature computation requests departure due to their deadline expiration.

The studied scenarios consider four practical aspects of mobile radio communication links: i) Interference between adjacent channels, ii) interference between roadside units along the way, iii) fast and slow channel fadings, and iv) Doppler shift effects. We present first the system model for the IEEE 802.11p standard, which considers a communication network between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Next, we formulate the problem of utility maximization in the network, and propose a distributed optimization scheme. This distributed scheme is based on a two-loop feedback configuration, where an outer-loop establishes the optimal signal to interference-noise ratio (SINR) that maximizes the utility function per vehicle and defines a quality-of-service objective. Meanwhile, inner-control loops adjust the transmission power to achieve this optimal SINR reference in each vehicle node regardless of interference, time-varying channel profiles and network latency. The computation complexity of the distributed utility maximization scheme is analyzed for each feedback loop. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme reaches the objective SINRs that maximize utility and improve energy efficiency in the network with a low time cost. The results also show that the maximum utility is consistently achieved for different propagation scenarios inside the vehicular communication network.},

In this paper, we aim to address this challenge of Quality of Service (QoS) loss (i.e., edge computing service outage for vehicle users (VUs)). We formulate a QoS optimization problem for VUs and solve it in two phases: an offline solar energy scheduling phase, and an online user association and SRSU resource allocation phase. We simulate our proposed technique in a dense SRSU network environment with real-world urban vehicular traffic data and solar generation profile. The simulation results show that our proposed approach can significantly reduce QoS loss of vehicular edge computing applications using SRSUs, compared to existing techniques. Further, the results are beneficial to service providers and city planners to identify adequate SRSU configurations for expected solar energy generation and edge computing service demands.},

  abstract     = {Big data analytics has been rapidly integrated into Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), empowering diverse applications such as real-time traffic prediction and management. However, incomplete traffic time-series data during the data analysis are nearly inevitable due to the constraints of data collection or packet loss in the communication process. Existing tensor-based completion methods fail to perform well in consecutively missing (CM) cases where a sub-series of the traffic time series is completely missing. Moreover, their high computational complexity prevents the road network-level implementation. Therefore, to tackle these problems, a batch-oriented traffic data completion method for large-scale road networks is proposed in this paper. In order to preserve multi-way natures of traffic data, we first model the traffic data by tensors so that traffic data completion becomes a tensor completion problem. Several types of tensor structures are adopted in order to analyze their impacts on traffic data completion. Thereafter, a Content-Aware traffic data completion method is further developed based on the Generative Adversarial Net (CA-GAN). More specifically, the formulated traffic tensors are interpreted as samples from a high-dimensional traffic distribution and a GAN is then proposed to learn this distribution. By considering effects of traffic data from different days and links, a weighted loss function is employed to search for the raw traffic tensor in the obtained traffic distribution. Afterwards, the estimated raw traffic tensor is used to complete the missing data. Visualization results demonstrate that our GANs can produce verisimilar traffic patterns with different time spans. Finally, our experiments on real traffic datasets show that the proposed CA-GAN method can effectively batch incomplete traffic tensors in CM cases with fast recovery process.},

Through the second algorithm, the most optimal places for a desired number of APs are determined so that the average PL is minimum. The goal of the third algorithm is to determine the required number and optimal places of APs in a rail network. Furthermore, we propose a model to consider the effects of changes of communication characteristics on the efficiency of the network in different environments. Through such model, the algorithms proposed for placement of APs can be used in different railway scenarios. The proposed algorithms are validated through extensive simulations in Sydney Trains of Australia. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can improve the efficiency of the system at least 21% and up to 165% within 10 different scenarios.

In this work, we apply index coding techniques to reduce the number of transmissions required for data exchange. The index coding problem has a sender, which tries to meet the demands of several receivers in a minimum number of transmissions. All these receivers have some prior knowledge of the messages, known as the side-information. In this work, we consider a particular case of the index coding problem, where multiple nodes want to share information among them. Under this set up, lower bound on the number of transmissions is established when the cardinality of side-information is the same. An optimal solution to achieve the bound in a special case of VANET scenario is presented. For this special case, we consider the link between the nodes to be error-prone, and in this setting, we construct optimal linear error correcting index codes.},

  abstract     = {Benefiting from the development of wireless communication, WiFi localization plays a vital role in various mobile applications. However, users’ locations are breached by untrusted localization servers, thus disclosing users’ location privacy and other sensitive personal information. Existing works on WiFi localization preservation employed homomorphic encryption, which incurs extremely high overheads. On the other hand, lightweight methods like &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -anonymity and dummy-based approaches are hardly used for privacy preservation in WiFi localization scenarios due to their inherent drawbacks, i.e., &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -anonymity approaches rely on trusted third parties while dummy-based approaches are susceptible to spatio-temporal correlation attacks. To design an effective yet lightweight WiFi localization privacy algorithm, this paper proposes to reinforce dummy techniques with plausible dummy location to resist the attacks. This study presents a novel algorithm, referred to as Location Preservation Algorithm with Plausible Dummies (LPPD), which is the first attempt towards WiFi localization privacy preservation using dummy techniques. The benefits of the algorithm are three-fold: First, it is lightweight. Second, it does not rely on trusted third parties. Third, it can resist spatio-temporal correlation attacks. Moreover, this study implements a WiFi localization system that integrates the proposed privacy-preserving algorithm with a WiFi fingerprint based indoor localization algorithm. Experiments results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach when compared with existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) has been widely considered as a promising technology in the next generation wireless communication systems. Various beam-based directional transmission techniques have been proposed to compensate high pathloss caused by mmWave properties. However, mobility effect of users potentially causes severe inter-beam interferences, which has not been fully-investigated in existing studies. In this paper, we have analyzed different types of mobility-aware beam interference models. Additionally, the theoretical SINR is derived based on channel statistics and the trajectories of users. We propose a mobility-aware subband and beam resource allocation (MSBA) scheme for the mmWave subband-beam massive multi-input multi-output (SB-MMIMO) systems. The proposed MSBA benefits from reduced computation complexity for maximizing system throughput constrained by quality-of-service (QoS) demands of users. The first phase of MSBA scheme is responsible for resource block assignment; while the second phase allocates beamwidth and beam directions according to the analytical derivations. Numerical results show that the proposed MSBA scheme can effectively achieve the highest system throughput and the lowest complexity compared to existing schemes in open literatures.},

In this paper, our aim is to maximize the minimum data gathering rate of devices acting as sources. We formulate a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to compute the optimal max-min rate of sources by deciding for each slot the devices to be charged, a PB&#39;s transmission power, the amount of data routed over each link, and the active time of transmitting links. We also present a novel distributed protocol called Distributed Charging and Fairness Gathering (D-CFG) that is used by IoT devices to request charging from a PB and to ensure they forward data in a fair manner. Our results show that D-CFG achieves 57.1% of the theoretical max-min rate computed by the MILP.},

To this end, we leverage Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), where we equip APs with a DRL-based channel assignment solution, to maximize the average number of slots in which an AP has sufficient bandwidth to meet user demands. Our APs learn from their historical traffic loads and assign themselves partially overlapping channels with minimal interference.

  abstract     = {Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, which aims to enable autonomous communication between machine devices with minimum human intervention, have experienced remarkable growth over the past few years. In massive M2M communications, random access (RA) collision is one of the critical problems at the network entry stage. To alleviate the channel contention during the network access stage, most existing RA solutions for M2M communications need the base station (BS) to determine backoff parameters, whose optimal values are hard to obtain and would also incur substantial signaling overhead, especially in dense scenarios. To address this issue, a distributive approach is highly desirable. In this paper, a new method for distributive estimation of optimal backoff parameters is proposed. Specifically, each machine type device (MTD) only needs to observe their own successful and total transmissions of access requests during an estimation interval, after which each MTD can obtain an estimation of the optimal backoff parameters according to an explicit expression of the observed statistics. It is found that the estimation interval determines the performance of the proposed scheme. When the number of MTDs in the network does not change or varies slowly, the network throughput can be maximized if the estimation interval is chosen properly. Compared to existing centralized methods, the proposed method can achieve similar performance with much lower signaling overhead. The proposed scheme can be applied for both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios and provide a practical access design method for M2M communications.},

In this paper, a two-dimension-time-scale hierarchical resource allocation scheme is proposed in the multi-service wireless virtualized network, which consists of three 5G generic scenarios. The resource slicing problem is decomposed into two time scales including large time period for inter-slice resource pre-allocation and small time slot for intra-slice resource scheduling. In large time period, the inter-slice resource pre-allocation problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) by modeling the packets arriving and serving process of each slice as a queueing system. While in small time slot, the resource block (RB) and power scheduling in each slice is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem considering dynamic traffic arrivals and time-varying channel conditions, which is aimed at optimizing the overall performance subject to various quality of service (QoS) requirements such as network stability, delay, reliability, transmission rate and power constraints. The stochastic optimization problem can be transformed into a delay-aware optimization problem by applying Lyapunov optimization technique, and be solved by the proposed algorithm consisting of a heuristic algorithm and a concave optimization algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes are close to the optimal solution with a lower complexity, which can also achieve a performance-delay tradeoff related to the control factor.},

In this article, a low-complexity least-squares based post-distortion algorithm is formulated over reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for a multi-hop V2V-VLC link. The impairments encountered in V2V-VLC channels are mitigated in RKHS by a minimum symbol error-rate post-distorter using a low dimensional approximation of random Fourier features (RFF) (which is a soft approximation of the feature-map to RKHS), that facilitates computationally simple post-distortion under finite memory-budget. The convergence and the BER-performance of the proposed post-distorter is analyzed over realistic V2V VLC channels obtained via ray-tracing. From the analysis, and the presented computer-simulations, the proposed post-distorter is found to exhibit equivalent convergence characteristics and error-rate over reasonable distances, with much lower computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {In multilevel vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) scenario, dynamic vehicles, complex node distribution and poor wireless channel environment deteriorate the reliability of routing protocols. However, for the key issues of relay selection, existing algorithms analyze the wireless link performance without considering the influence of dynamics and shadow fading on location from GPS, as well as channel condition and buffer queue, which would lead to inaccurate link characterization and maladaptive to network variation. In this paper, we establish a dynamic link reliability model to portray the link complexity of multilevel VANET scenario, and propose a link reliability-based adaptive routing algorithm (LRAR) to improve the transmission efficiency. Firstly, we propose a Kalman filter-based estimation approach to amend GPS original data for precise location of vehicles. Then, we define link reliability to quantify the wireless link performance, and establish a multilevel dynamic link model (MDLM) to evaluate it. Moreover, to accurately describe the complexity of wireless links, we integrate the corrected GPS data and characteristics of multilevel VANET including vehicle dynamics, distribution hierarchy and shadow fading into the modeling of link reliability. Considering the difference of link state among diverse vehicles, a maximum deviation algorithm is introduced to adaptively calculate the weight of each parameter in the modeling. Finally, we formulate the routing decision as a multi-attribute decision problem, and select the link with highest reliability as transmission path. Simulation results demonstrate that LRAR outperforms the existing routing algorithms in terms of average end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio.},

  abstract     = {High-accuracy and low-latency localization capability is essential for the internet of things (IoT), such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For applications of UAVs such as formation control, the relative positions of the UAVs are more pertinent than their absolute positions. In this paper, we establish a framework for the design and analysis of 3D UAV relative localization. In particular, we develop a distributed algorithm for relative localization networks, where the local geometries are first obtained by a weighted semi-definite programming algorithm and then merged into a global geometry based on the statistical information. Moreover, the relative position estimation is proved to be a constrained optimization where the constraints can eliminate the effect of transformation. The Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to evaluate the relative localization accuracy, which is equal to the constrained CRLB. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can approach the CRLB and significantly outperform the conventional multidimensional scaling-based algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid beamformer design plays very crucial role in the next generation millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems. Previous works assume the perfect channel state information (CSI) which results heavy feedback overhead. To lower complexity, channel statistics can be utilized such that only infrequent update of the channel information is needed. To reduce the complexity and provide robustness, in this work, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework to deal with both hybrid beamforming and channel estimation. For this purpose, we introduce three deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We assume that the base station (BS) has the channel statistics only and feeds the channel covariance matrix into a CNN to obtain the hybrid precoders. At the receiver, two CNNs are employed. The first one is used for channel estimation purposes and the another is employed to design the hybrid combiners. The proposed DL framework does not require the instantaneous feedback of the CSI at the BS. We have also investigated the online deployment of DL for channel estimation. We have shown that the proposed approach has higher spectral efficiency with comparison to the conventional techniques. The trained CNN structures do not need to be re-trained due to the changes in the propagation environment such as the deviations in the number of received paths and the fluctuations in the received path angles up to 4 degrees. Also, the proposed DL framework exhibits at least 10 times lower computational complexity as compared to the conventional optimization-based approaches.},

Then based on the limited feedback and the available channel state information at each relay, a relay selection strategy with adaptive selection criteria is proposed for each transmission protocol to minimize the system outage probability (SOP).

  abstract     = {The combination of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and cooperative communications can be a suitable solution for fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless systems with massive connectivity, because it can provide higher spectral efficiency, lower energy consumption, and improved fairness compared to the non-cooperative NOMA. However, the receiver complexity in the conventional cooperative NOMA increases with increasing number of users owing to successive interference cancellation (SIC) at each user. Space time block code-aided cooperative NOMA (STBC-CNOMA) offers less numbers of SIC as compared to that of conventional cooperative NOMA. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of STBC-CNOMA under practical challenges such as imperfect SIC, imperfect timing synchronization between distributed cooperating users, and imperfect channel state information (CSI). We derive closed-form expressions of the received signals in the presence of such realistic impairments and then use them to evaluate outage probability. Further, we provide intuitive insights into the impact of each impairment on the outage performance through asymptotic analysis at high transmit signal-to-noise ratio. We also compare the complexity of STBC-CNOMA with existing cooperative NOMA protocols for a given number of users. In addition, through analysis and simulation, we observe that the impact of the imperfect SIC on the outage performance of STBC-CNOMA is more significant compared to the other two imperfections. Therefore, considering the smaller number of SIC in STBC-CNOMA compared to the other cooperative NOMA protocols, STBC-CNOMA is an effective solution to achieve high reliability for the same SIC imperfection condition.},

  abstract     = {For the capability of providing multi-giga BPS (bits per second) rates, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is one of the key enabling technologies for the new and future generations of mobile communications, i.e., the fifth generation (5G) and beyond. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can significantly increase the spectral efficiency by simultaneously serving multiple users in the same channel. Thus, mmWave NOMA networks have recently attracted considerable research attention. Meanwhile, a large number of confidential messages exchanged within highly interconnected systems has posed tremendous challenges on secure wireless communications, and thus in this article, we investigate the physical layer security of mmWave NOMA networks. Considering the limited scattering characteristics of mmWave channels and imperfect successive interference cancellation at receivers, we develop an analytic framework for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for mmWave NOMA networks, in which legitimate users and eavesdroppers are randomly distributed. Based on the directional transmission property of mmWave signals, we propose a minimal angle-difference user pairing scheme to reduce the SOP of users. Considering the spatial correlation between the selected user pair and eavesdroppers, we develop two maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming schemes to further enhance the secrecy performance of mmWave NOMA networks. Closed-form SOPs for the paired users with different eavesdropper detection capacities are derived. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our analysis and that there exists an optimal radius of network coverage ranges and transmit power to minimize the SOP of the user pair.},

  abstract     = {A foremost task in frequency diverse array multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) radar is to efficiently obtain the target signal in the presence of interferences. In this paper, we employ a novel “low-rank + low-rank + sparse” decomposition model to extract the low-rank desired signal and suppress the jamming signals from both barrage and burst jammers. In the literature, the barrage jamming signals, which are intentionally interfered by enemy jammer radar, are usually assumed Gaussian distributed. However, such assumption is oversimplified to hold in practice as the interferences often exhibit non-Gaussian properties. Those non-Gaussian jamming signals, known as impulsive noise or burst jamming, are involuntarily deviated from friendly radar or other working radio equipment including amplifier saturation and sensor failures, thunderstorms and man-made noise. The performance of the existing estimators, relied crucially on the Gaussian noise assumption, may degrade substantially since the probability density function (PDF) of burst jamming has heavier tails that exceed a few standard deviations than the Gaussian distribution. To capture a more general signal model with burst jamming in practice, both barrage jamming and burst jamming are included and a two-step “Go Decomposition” (GoDec) method via alternating minimization is devised for such mixed jamming signal model, where the a priori rank information is exploited to suppress these two kinds of jammers and extract the desired target. Simulation results verify the robust performance of the devised scheme.},

  abstract     = {In the intelligent transportation system, it is an efficient way for the intelligent vehicle to use the integrated radar and communications system (IRCS) to obtain the range and velocity estimations of other vehicles and simultaneously communicate with other facilities, such as vehicles and base stations. In the IRCS, the transmitted waveform is the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated radar and communications waveform that contains communications information. Due to the existence of communications information, the traditional range and velocity estimation methods in radar can not be directly utilized in the IRCS. Moreover, to improve the resolution of range and velocity estimations, the signal bandwidth and coherent processing interval (CPI) are usually required to be increased, which will result in the increase of system cost and the reduction of update rate. To solve these problems, a auto-paired super-resolution range and velocity estimation method is proposed by using the OFDM integrated radar and communications waveform. First, the communications information in the received signals is compensated. Then, the frequency smoothing is performed to reduce the correlation between the echoes reflected by different targets. Finally, the auto-paired super-resolution range and velocity estimations are obtained by exploiting the translational invariance structure of the underlying signal model in both frequency and pulse domains. Furthermore, Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) on range and velocity estimations with the OFDM integrated radar and communications waveform are derived. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Hybrid transceivers reduce the radio frequency chain count and cost by dividing the task of precoding between the digital and analog processing domains, but near-optimal design of the hybrid precoders is non-trivial and their optimal design is analytically intractable. This is due to the joint optimization of digital and analog precoding matrices as well as extra constraints for analog precoders due to their realization by analog phase shifters. Additionally, hybrid transceivers can be implemented via two architectures, either fully-connected or partially-connected. In this paper, we make use of projection algorithms to greatly simplify the design problem of the digital baseband and analog precoders into two optimization subproblems whose optimal solutions can be found. We also incorporate in the design a simplified user clustering algorithm based on the discrete Fourier transform, where users within the same and overlapping angular bins in the beam-space domain are grouped together. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed hybrid precoding and user clustering algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.},

HWI may arise due to imperfections in the devices like I/Q imbalance, phase noise, etc. With I/Q imbalance, the received signal is a widely linear transformation of the transmitted signal and noise. Thus, the effective noise at the receivers becomes improper, which means that its real and imaginary parts are correlated and/or have unequal powers. IGS can improve system performance with improper noise and/or improper interference. In this paper, we study the benefits of IGS for this scenario in terms of two performance metrics: achievable rate and energy efficiency (EE). We consider the rate region, the sum-rate, the EE region and the global EE optimization problems to fully evaluate the IGS performance. To solve these non-convex problems, we employ an optimization framework based on majorization-minimization algorithms, which allow us to obtain a stationary point of any optimization problem in which either the objective function and/or constraints are linear functions of rates. Our numerical results show that IGS can significantly improve the performance of the K-user MIMO IC with HWI and I/Q imbalance, where its benefits increase with the number of users, K, and the imbalance level, and decrease with the number of antennas.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a fast prediction model based on machine learning is established to predict the coupling coefficient between pantograph arcing, and GSM-R antenna. Compared with the method of solving coupling coefficient based on electromagnetic simulation, the prediction model established in this article can not only ensure the accuracy of coupling coefficient, but also avoid a lot of repeated simulation, and reduce the simulation time. First, the data set is constructed by Latin hypercube sampling. Then, by analyzing the distribution characteristics of the data set, the Radial Based Function (RBF), and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) are selected for modeling. Furthermore, in order to improve the prediction precision, Modular Neural Network (MNN) is introduced, and the collaborative integration strategy of segmented prediction is proposed, which realizes the complementary advantages of RBF, and GRNN, and completes the construction of prediction model. Finally, the precision, and validity of the prediction model is verified by the analysis of the prediction results, relative prediction deviation, and other related parameters.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed as aerial base stations to support communication for the ground users (GUs). However, the aerial-to-ground (A2G) channel link is dominated by line-of-sight (LoS) due to the high flying altitude, which is easily wiretapped by the ground eavesdroppers (GEs). In this case, a single UAV has limited maneuvering capacity to obtain the desired secure rate in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. In this paper, we propose a cooperative jamming approach by letting UAV jammers help the UAV transmitter defend against GEs. To be specific, the UAV transmitter sends the confidential information to GUs, and the UAV jammers send the artificial noise signals to the GEs by 3D beamforming. We propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach, i.e., multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to maximize the secure capacity by jointly optimizing the trajectory of UAVs, the transmit power from UAV transmitter and the jamming power from the UAV jammers. The MADDPG algorithm adopts centralized training and distributed execution. The simulation results show the MADRL method can realize the joint trajectory design of UAVs and achieve good performance. To improve the learning efficiency and convergence, we further propose a continuous action attention MADDPG (CAA-MADDPG) method, where the agent learns to pay attention to the actions and observations of other agents that are more relevant with it. From the simulation results, the rewards performance of CAA-MADDPG is better than the MADDPG without attention.},

  abstract     = {Suppression of radar-to-radar jammers, especially the mainbeam jammers, has been an urgent demand in vehicular sensing systems with the expected increased number of vehicles equipped with radar systems. This paper deals with the suppression of mainbeam deceptive jammers with frequency diverse array (FDA)-multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, utilizing its extra degrees-of-freedom (DOFS) in the range domain. At the modelling stage, false targets, which lag several pulses behind the true target, are considered as a typical form of mainbeam jammers. To this end the data-independent beamforming is performed to suppress false targets by nulling at the equivalent transmit beampattern with an appropriate frequency increment. However, the suppression performance degrades in the presence of transmit spatial frequency mismatch, which could be induced by quantization errors, angle estimation errors and frequency increment errors. To solve this problem, a preset broadened nulling beamformer (PBN-BF) is proposed by placing artificial interferences with appropriate powers around the nulls of the equivalent transmit beampattern. In such a way, effective suppression of deceptive jammer can be guaranteed owing to the broadened notches. At the analysis stage, numerical results in a scenario with multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the devised data-independent BF, and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio is improved compared with the conventional data-independent BF.},

The proposed scheme can break the single-beam constraint and perform NOMA transmission within the different analog beams. Then, we design the power allocation for minimizing the total power consumption, which mainly includes two stages. In the first stage, after performing beam scanning and beam selection, we design the game-theory based user grouping method for minimizing the conditional total power consumption. In the second stage, with the achieved user grouping solution and the corresponding beamspace channel state information (CSI), we formulate and solve the power allocation problem for minimizing the total power consumption. In addition, given the user grouping solution for minimizing the total power consumption, for evaluating the sum rate performance of the proposed multi-beam beamspace MIMO-NOMA scheme, we formulate and solve the power allocation optimization problem for maximizing the sum rate. In simulations, compared with the single-beam beamspace MIMO-NOMA scheme, given the user grouping solution, the proposed scheme has inferior sum rate performance when the power budget is enough high. However, at the cost of a little higher transmit power consumption, the proposed scheme has lower total power consumption and can simultaneously serve more users with the same number of RF chains.},

  abstract     = {As an important performance metric, the minimum weight distribution (MWD) determines the maximum-likelihood decoding performance. In this paper, we focus on the MWDs of polar codes and concatenated polar codes to analyze the performance and optimize the encoding structure. Existing enumeration methods cannot guarantee to get the MWD exactly and have high search complexity. In order to enumerate all the codewords belonging to the MWD, the sphere constraint property is applied, which means that the codewords with the identical Hamming weight are distribute on a spherical shell. Based on this, three enumeration methods are proposed in this paper. We first propose a sphere constraint based enumeration method (SCEM) to analyze the MWD of polar codes with moderate complexity. Then, according to the SCEM and the Plotkin&#39;s construction of polar codes, a sphere constraint based recursive enumeration method (SCREM) is proposed to recursively calculate the MWD with a lower complexity. Finally, we propose a parity-check SCEM (PC-SCEM) to analyze the MWD of concatenated polar codes by introducing the parity-check equations of outer codes. Moreover, due to the sphere constraint property, the proposed three methods can exactly enumerate all the codewords with the minimum Hamming weight. The enumeration results show that the SCREM has about 10 6 times complexity reduction compared with the existing methods at code length 128 and the PC-SCEM can be used to design high-performance CRC-polar concatenated codes.},

This paper investigates the cell coverage for the HSR communication system with narrow-strip-shaped cells. By utilizing the hard handoff scheme, a closed-form expression for the edge coverage probability (ECP) is first derived. Then, a theoretical expression for the percentage of the cell coverage area (CCA) is obtained, which is derived as the summation of the ECP, and a positive increment. To improve coverage performance, a coverage optimization problem is formulated to minimize the required number of base stations (BSs) under the coverage constraint, and the total coverage distance constraint, and then an optimal BS deployment scheme is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Numerical results indicate that all theoretical results match well with the simulation results, which verifies the correctness of the theoretical analysis. Moreover, the impacts of the received power threshold, cell radius, handoff hysteresis, transmit power, shadow fading, and path loss exponent on the cell coverage performance are also provided. Furthermore, compared to the existing coverage scheme, the proposed BS deployment scheme can improve the coverage performance significantly.},

The main objective of this investigation is to engage users in a cooperative game to confront with the problem of per-user power control and coordinate multi-user interferences. Thus, we formulate the optimization problem as a sum of the users&#39; cooperative energy efficiency (EE) functions. Firstly, a realistic and new model of the user device&#39;s power consumption is proposed. This model includes the power used for operating modes and signal processing of mobile devices during the uplink data transmission. Secondly, the EE optimization problem is formulated by maximizing the sum of the users&#39; cooperative EE function subject to each user&#39;s quality-of-service (QoS) and a power constraint. Then, we propose a fully distributed and clustered learning scheme for solving the optimization problem, where neighboring users are clustered to engage in the cooperative game of power control in order to coordinate the multi-user interferences. It is theoretically proved that the size of the clusters has an impact on the sum of the users&#39; cooperative EE. Additionally, our scheme can achieve convergence with imperfect channel feedback and the local knowledge of the user&#39;s constraints. Finally, simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed scheme compared with two benchmark methods.},

The transmitter in the CP-free OFDM-CC-CDMA system offers a unique flexibility to adjust the amount of data processed at the same time to ensure that the OFDM block size exceeds the delay spread of a multipath channel, which attributes to effective mitigation of multipath induced inter-symbol interference (ISI). At the receiver of a CP-free OFDM-CC-CDMA system, minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization and MMSE combining are used to mitigate multi-user interference (MUI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI). The obtained results show that a CP-free OFDM-CC-CDMA system offers a much higher transmission efficiency than FD-CC-CDMA and OFDM-DS-CDMA systems.

However, the potential massive access will significantly degrade the access performance of MTC. To meet the massive access requirement of MTC, we propose a spatial filtering based random access (SFRA) scheme in massive MIMO cellular networks. Specifically, the angle of arrival (AOA) information provided by massive MIMO is utilized to distinguish collided MTC devices (MTDs). To improve the preamble utilization as possible, we further propose a novel preamble reuse scheme to eliminate the influence of multipath angular spread on preamble detection at the base station (BS). Theoretical analysis and simulation results both show that the proposed SFRA scheme can efficiently reuse preambles and considerably improve the access capacity. In typical urban environments, preambles can be perfectly reused for 9 times at most. Moreover, the average access delay of SFRA is only about one seventh of that of the conventional random access scheme when 10000 MTDs attempt to access the network simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Doubly-selective channels, such as those that occur when the transmitter and the receiver move relative to each other at high speeds, are a key scenario for fifth generation (5G) cellular systems, which are mostly based in the use of the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. In this paper, we consider an OFDM system using quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols and we show that, when transmitting over deterministic doubly-selective channels, the inter-carrier-interference (ICI) affecting a symbol can be well approximated by a complex-valued normal distribution. Based on this, we derive a lower bound for the link capacity using the Shannon-Hartley theorem. Finally, we provide an approximation of the bit error probability (BEP) using the well-known BEP expressions for Gray-coded QAM constellations over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, and show numerical results that confirm that the proposed BEP expression approximates accurately the bit error ratio (BER) of the OFDM system for standardized channel models. The proposed closed-form analytical expressions for the capacity and the BEP do not only allow for discarding the need of computationally-costly Monte-Carlo system simulations, but also provide a theoretical framework to optimize the system parameters directly impacting on the achievable performance.},

  abstract     = {In cognitive radio (CR) systems, the spectrum efficiency (SE) of the secondary users (SUs) is always limited by the interference temperature constraint imposed on the primary users (PUs). Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been recently proposed as a revolutionary technique which can help to enhance the SE of wireless communications. In this paper, we propose to employ an IRS to assist the SUs’ data transmission in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) CR system. By jointly optimizing the transmit precoding (TPC) of the SU transmitter (ST) and the phase shifts of the IRS, we aim to maximize the achievable weighted sum rate (WSR) of SUs subject to the ST&#39;s total power, the PU&#39;s interference temperature and unit modulus constraints. To solve this complicated optimization problem in which the variables are coupled, the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is introduced to alternately solve the subproblems. For each subproblem, the Lagrange dual or inner approximation method is adopted with a low complexity. Simulation results confirm the benefits of employing IRS in a MIMO CR system. The performance comparisons of the proposed algorithm with several other benchmarks are carried out by evaluating the impacts of various parameters on the WSR.},

  abstract     = {We consider a Neyman-Pearson (NP) distributed binary detection problem in a bandwidth constrained wireless sensor network, where the fusion center (FC) makes a final decision about the presence or absence of a known signal in correlated Gaussian noises. Our goals are (i) to investigate whether or not randomized transmission can improve detection performance, under communication rate constraint, and (ii) to explore how the correlation among observation noises impacts performance. We propose two novel schemes that combine the concepts of censoring and randomized transmission (which we name CRT schemes) and compare them with pure censoring scheme. In CRT (pure censoring) schemes we map randomly (deterministically) a sensor&#39;s observation to a ternary transmit symbol u k ∈ {-1, 0, 1} where “0” corresponds to no transmission (sensor censors). We model the randomization in CRT schemes using two independent Bernoulli random variables with parameters g, f. Assuming sensors transmit over orthogonal fading channels, we formulate and address two system-level constrained optimization problems: in the first problem we minimize the probability of miss detection at the FC, subject to constraints on the probabilities of transmission and false alarm at the FC; in the second (dual) problem we minimize the probability of transmission, subject to constraints on the probabilities of miss detection and false alarm at the FC. The optimization variables include g, f. Both problems are non-convex and their solutions can be found via exhaustive search. Seeking to shed some light on the qualitative behavior of randomization, we propose methods to find sub-optimal solutions of the original problems and study the relation between these solutions. Through analysis and numerical evaluations, we explore and provide the conditions under which CRT schemes outperform pure censoring scheme.},

These systems have challenges, such as involving in users&#39; privacy and high initial cost, so they are not highly popular. In order to resolve these challenges, a single commodity Wi-Fi device is utilized to design a device-free intelligent alarm system. The proposed system relies on the cooperation of active and passive alarm modules so that the user is not required to wear any sensor. In the active alarm module, a novel algorithm is proposed to identify the user&#39;s tiny help-seeking action (e.g.special breath) using channel state information (CSI). Moreover, the passive alarm module employs the CSI-based prospect detection to identify the physical attack behavior. The proposed system uses the invisible Wi-Fi signal to identify the people&#39;s motion. Then, it uses the results of the activity recognition to identify the dangerous event, which has the characteristic of the concealment. A large number of experiments are carried out in the present study to investigate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed system. It is found that the average accuracy of the system identification is over 95%.},

  abstract     = {A planar 2 × 2 filtering patch antenna array with high selectivity and wide stopband is investigated for marine communications. The 2 × 2 patch array is composed of a driven patch and four identical parasitic patches placed nearby. A forked-microstrip-line-coupled rectangular slot is used to excite the driven patch, while the neighboring parasitic patches are capacitively coupled by the driven patch. Owing to the hybrid feeding effect of the forked feed line, a radiation null can be generated at the lower band-edge. Simultaneously, another radiation null can be generated at the upper band-edge owing to the radiation cancellation effect between the driven patch and the parasitic patches. Consequently, no power dividing feeding network is required for the 2 × 2 array, and the quasi-elliptic bandpass filtering response is achieved without utilizing any complex filtering/non-filtering circuits. In addition, the proposed filtering array exhibits a wide stopband capable of suppressing the second-harmonic radiation effectively. Based on this 2 × 2 array, a larger 4 × 4 filtering array is further designed by just using a traditional four-way power dividing network. For validation, both of the 2 × 2 and 4 × 4 filtering patch arrays operating at 5.25 GHz are fabricated and tested. The measured results show that the two patch arrays have comparable impedance bandwidths of about 4.4%. The in-band peak gains are given by 11.1 and 15.5 dBi respectively, which are suitable for the long-distance shore-to-ship communications.},

Therefore, we investigate transceiver design in a multi-user mmWave MIMO system for simultaneous wireless information and power multicast (SWIPM). First of all, we obtain the asymptotically optimal solution include full-digital solutions for the transmitter and information users (IUs) as well as analog solutions for energy users (EUs) in the mmWave MIMO aided transceivers. It maximizes information multicast spectral efficiency of IUs, while satisfying individual wireless charging requirement of EUs. Then, based on this asymptotically optimal solution, hybrid beamformer at a transmitter and signal combiners at IUs are jointly designed with the same objective, when considering low hardware complexity (e.g. limited number of RF chains and low-resolution phase shifters). A low-complexity algorithm is developed for solving the resultant constraint max-min problem. Additionally, we also demonstrate a practical multi-antenna aided receiver architecture of EUs by considering practical non-linear energy harvesters. Numerical results validate the advantage of our joint transceiver design for SWIPM.},

Our scheme leverages the fact that an endpoint only requires the knowledge of the location and velocity of another endpoint and not its identity, thereby our mechanism introduces confusion in the mapping form identity of nodes to packets. Each node can send any other node&#39;s packet masquerading as its own packet. We further introduce causal dependence amongst masqueraded packets to ensure non-repudiation. Our scheme reduces traceability by 6× when compared to baseline pseudonym changing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Various positioning techniques have been developed to localize Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices accurately. Because IoT communications are often narrowband, efficient localization can be achieved by deducing the device position from the estimated signal Angle-of-Arrival (AOA) at multiple arrays of antennas. It has recently been shown that significant accuracy gains can further be obtained by iterating between the AOA estimation and multi-lateration steps. However, the existing method relies on the knowledge of the transmitted signal (Data-Aided (DA) estimation) which makes it impractical for narrowband communications where the preamble is short. Non-Data-Aided (NDA) estimation is recommended to improve the positioning accuracy for low capacity IoT sensors. This paper proposes an NDA iterative (NDA-It) algorithm using AOA measurements to determine the position of an IoT sensor. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the DA-It in a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) context because it can use a much higher number of samples (snapshots); however, it needs more iterations to converge. The computational complexity analysis proves the competitiveness of the proposed NDA-It. The performance of the algorithms is further investigated in multipath and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation environments. Finally, an experimental setup is built to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

Despite fruitful recent studies, the optimal beamforming/combining method remains unknown for a practical multiuser, broadband mmWave MIMO equipped with low-resolution phase shifters and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In this paper, we leverage artificial intelligence techniques to tackle this problem. Particularly, we propose a neural hybrid beamforming/combining (NHB) MIMO system, where the various types of hybrid analog/digital mmWave MIMO systems are transformed into a corresponding autoencoder (AE) based neural networks. Consequently, the digital and analog beamforming/combiners are obtained by training the AE based new model in an unsupervised learning manner, regardless of particular configurations. Using this approach, we can apply a machine learning-based design methodology that is compatible with a range of different beamforming/combing architectures. We also propose an iterative training strategy for the neural network parameter updating, which can effectively guarantee fast convergence of the established NHB model. According to simulation results, the proposed NHB can offer a significant performance gain over existing methods in terms of bit error rate (BER). Moreover, NHB can fast formulate the neural network parameters as channel changed, which is believed more promising for practice due to its better flexibility and compatibility.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider secure communication via a wireless-powered untrusted relay with outdated channel state information (CSI). The low security clearance of the relay means that both the source and destination wish to keep information confidential from it. To prevent the relay from decoding the source information, the destination emits a jamming signal to the relay during data transmission by the source. The wireless-powered relay uses both the data and the jamming signals as valuable sources of energy for the amplify-and-forward relaying process. In addition, it can adopt either a power splitting or a time switching policy to determine the proportions of energy harvesting and information processing. However, when the CSI of the relay-to-destination link is outdated, the destination cannot remove the jamming signal completely from the relaying signal due to imperfect channel reciprocity. To evaluate the effect of outdated CSI on the secrecy performance, we derive the analytical expressions of two performance metrics, outage probability ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$P_{out}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) for delay-limited transmission and ergodic secrecy rate ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\bar{R}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) for delay-tolerant transmission.

Numerical simulations are used to verify the precision of our analysis, and confirm that the proposed secure relaying protocols accomplish near-optimal secrecy performances. Our results indicate that there is a need to reduce the jamming power level to ensure secure communication when the channel is severely outdated, while outdated CSI has a relatively low impact on the energy harvesting ratio.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate hybrid precoders for massive MIMO systems with the objective to reduce the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains. The users are first partitioned into groups that share similar angles of departure (AoDs) to design an angular-based RF-beamforming stage. Then a multi-user-Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) baseband precoding stage is developed with reduced channel state information (CSI) dimension in massive MIMO systems. We develop a systematic approach to simultaneously determine the number of groups and to cluster the users accordingly. The partition is done by minimizing the inter-group interference using a similarity graph. We also incorporate a simple transfer block between the digital precoding and RF-beamforming stages to reduce the number of RF chains in massive MIMO systems. For a sufficiently large number of antennas and over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the proposed hybrid RF/baseband precoding schemes can offer a sum-rate performance approaching that of the single-stage full digital optimal precoder, while keeping the number of RF chains equal to the number of users. Next, we propose a simple way to design the RF and baseband digital precoding stages in the case of multiple scatterings to fully exploit the multiple reflections that occur in dense urban environments. The proposed hybrid 2-stage RF/baseband schemes significantly outperform other hybrid RF/baseband precoding schemes using orthogonal multiplexing.},

  abstract     = {Existing rate adaptation protocols have advocated training to establish the relationship between channel conditions and the optimum modulation and coding scheme. However, innate with in-field operation is encountering scenarios that the rate adaptation mechanism has not yet encountered. Frequently, protocols are optimally tuned for indoor environments but, when taken outdoors, perform poorly. Namely, the decision structure formed by offline training, lacks the ability to adapt to a new situation on the fly. The changing wireless environment calls for a rate adaption scheme that can quickly infer the channel type and adjust accordingly. Typical SNR-based rate adaptation schemes do not capture the nuance of the performance variable in different channel types. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that allow SNR-based rate selection algorithms to be trained online in the environment in which they are operating. Inspired by the idea that, to do well, an athlete must train for the type of athletic event and environment in which they are competing, we propose FIT, an on-the-fly, in-situ training mechanism for SNR-based protocols. To do so, we first propose the FIT framework which addresses the challenges of making rate decisions with unpredictable fluctuation and lack of repeatability of real wireless channels. To distinguish between channel types in the training, we then characterize wireless channels according to the link-layer performance and introduce a novel, computationally-efficient, channel performance manifold matching technique to infer the channel type given a sequence of throughput measurements for various link-level parameters. To evaluate our methods, we implement rate selection which uses FIT for training alongside channel performance manifold matching. We then perform extensive experiments on emulated and in-field wireless channels to evaluate the online learning process, showing that the rate decision structure can be updated as channel conditions change using existing traffic flows. The experiments are performed over multiple frequency bands. The proposed FIT framework can achieve large throughput gains compared to traditional SNR-based protocols (8X) and offline-training-based methods (1.3X), particularly in a dynamic wireless propagation environments that lack appropriate training.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) are wireless radio technologies adopted by the new Fifth Generation (5G) of mobile communications. A very large number of antennas (massive MIMO) is used to perform the beam-forming of the transmitted signal, either to reduce the multi-user interference (MUI), when spatially multiplexing several users, or to compensate the path-loss when higher frequencies than microwave are used, such as the millimeter-waves (mm-Waves). Usually, a coherent demodulation scheme (CDS) is used in order to exploit MIMO-OFDM, where the channel estimation and the pre/post-equalization processes are complex and time consuming operations, which require a considerable pilot overhead and also increase the latency of the system. As an alternative, non-coherent techniques based on a differential modulation scheme have been proposed for the up-link (UL). However, it is not straightforward to extend these proposals to the down-link (DL) due to the (usually) reduced number of antennas at the receiver side. In this paper we overcome this problem, and assuming that each user equipment (UE) is only equipped with one single antenna, we propose the combination of beam-forming with a differential modulation scheme for the DL, enhanced by the frequency diversity. The new transmission and reception schemes are described, and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the complexity are analysed. The numerical results verify the accuracy of the analysis and show that our proposal outperforms the existing CDS with a significant lower complexity.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) ensure improvement in road safety and traffic management by allowing the vehicles and infrastructure that are connected to them to exchange safety messages. Due to the open wireless communication channels, security and privacy issues are a major concern in VANETs. A typical attack consists of a malicious third party intercepting, modifying and retransmitting messages. Heterogeneous vehicular communication in VANETs occurs when vehicles (only) or vehicles and other infrastructure communicate using different cryptographic techniques. To address the security and privacy issues in heterogeneous vehicular communication, some heterogeneous signcryption schemes have been proposed. These schemes simultaneously satisfy the confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation security requirements. They however fail to properly address the efficiency with respect to the computational cost involved in unsigncrypting ciphertexts, which is often affected by the speeds at which vehicles travel in VANETs. In this paper, we propose an efficient conditional privacy-preserving hybrid signcryption (CPP-HSC) scheme that uses bilinear pairing to satisfy the security requirements of heterogeneous vehicular communication in a single logical step. Our scheme ensures the transmission of a message from a vehicle with a background of an identity-based cryptosystem (IBC) to a receiver with a background of a public-key infrastructure (PKI). Furthermore, it supports a batch unsigncryption method, which allows the receiver to speed up the process by processing multiple messages simultaneously. The security of our CPP-HSC scheme ensures the indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) under the intractability assumption of q-bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion (q-BDHI) problem and the existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack (EUF-CMA) under the intractability assumption of q-strong Diffie-Hellman (q-SDH) problem in the random oracle model (ROM). The performance analysis indicates that our scheme has an improvement over the existing related schemes with respect to the computational cost without an increase in the communication cost.},

The SU can access the PU&#39;s channel in a hybrid interweave/underlay channel access mode using time division multiple access (TDMA) technique. This hybrid access mode combines the benefits of interweave channel access mode of accessing the PU&#39;s channel opportunistically with high transmission power to gain high throughput and that of the underlay channel access mode of transmission at any time regardless of the PU&#39;s activity with controlled power. Moreover, energy harvesting from ambient sources promotes the SU&#39;s device to be portable and self sustainable. To deal with the random environment, the system is modeled as a mixed (full/partial) observable Markov decision process (MOMDP). Moreover, to reduce the solution complexity, the point-based value iteration (PBVI) algorithm is used to solve the proposed model. The simulation results show the superiority of the proposed model compared to other related models in terms of throughput. Based on an insight on the optimal policy of the proposed model and the time complexity comparison with the related models, a couple of suboptimal policies are proposed, namely, a myopic policy, an interweave only policy, and a combined-policy approach.},

However, there has been little attention on the quantification of the delay-limited performance of downlink NOMA systems. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a two-user downlink NOMA system over generalized α-μ fading in terms of delay violation probability and effective rate (ER). In particular, we derive an analytical expression for an upper bound on the delay violation probability and we derive the exact sum ER of the downlink NOMA system. We also derive analytical expressions for high and low-SNR approximations to the sum ER, as well as a fundamental upper bound on the sum ER which represents the ergodic sum-rate for the downlink NOMA system. We also analyze the sum ER of a corresponding timedivision-multiplexed orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system. Our results show that while NOMA consistently outperforms OMA over the practical SNR range, the relative gain becomes smaller in more severe fading conditions, and is also smaller in the presence a more strict delay QoS constraint.},

In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized baseband processing based signal detection under the framework of the expectation propagation algorithm (EPA) for uplink massive MIMO systems. This architecture partitions the base station antennas into multiple independent antenna clusters, each associated with analog and digital modulation circuitry, independent radio-frequency chains, and computing hardwares. The antenna clusters only access local channel state information and require low communication bandwidth. In the proposed scheme, the decentralized processing unit executes local channel estimation and signal detection, and delivers the partial message to the centralized processing unit parallelly, where the message contains the local means and variances iteratively updated by the EPA detector from each antenna cluster. The centralized processing unit operates the message fusion based on the proposed message fusion rule for decoding operation. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed decentralized EPA signal detection approaches the conventional centralized one with marginal computational complexity overhead when the number of antenna clusters is small, and outperforms the state-of-the-art decentralized counterparts.},

  abstract     = {The demanding bitrate requirements of supporting flawless streaming of immersive video remains a challenge. To minimize the bandwidth without degrading the user&#39;s experience, we may opt for partitioning the panoramic video frame into numerous tiles and only transmit those covered by the predicted Field of View (FoV), but naturally, this philosophy critically hinges on the accuracy of the Head Movement Prediction (HMP). However, since the HMP is never 100% accurate, rebuffering of the missing portions due to misprediction is likely to introduce video freezes or artefacts, which may significantly degrade the users&#39; experience. Hence, instead of only transmitting the FoV tiles, Scalable Video Coding (SVC) comes to rescue. Explicitly, in SVC schemes, multiple layers having different importance provide a promising solution, where the basic quality of the entire panoramic video is supported by the Base Layer (BL) that only requires a low bitrate, while the Enhancement Layers (EL) are invoked for enhancing the quality of the predicted FoV. In this treatise, we propose coding rate adaptation assisted near-instantaneously Adaptive Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (AQAM) for layered panoramic video streaming. In our design, we categorize the video streaming into three priority classes according to the FoV and the SVC layer index, each of which is mapped to the most appropriate modulation mode determined by the instantaneous channel quality. Furthermore, we conceive an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) assisted Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding rate optimization method for providing Unequal Error Protection (UEP) in order to maximize the uncoded source-rate according to the inter-frame and inter-layer decoding dependency for tile-based panoramic video streaming. The simulation results show that the proposed AQAM assisted UEP scheme configured by our EA assisted coding rate optimization algorithm significantly improves the overall video performance compared to its Equal Error Protection (EEP) counterpart, and provides perceptually pleasing video quality across a wide range of channel conditions by selecting the most appropriate modulation mode based on the instantaneous channel Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).},

Traditional discovery protocols are constrained by the in-technology communication paradigm.

In this work, we introduce a new direction for neighbor discovery based on Cross-Technology Communication technique and propose a physical-layer technique called NewBee. NewBee takes the advantages of coordinations from a WiFi node to assist ZigBee nodes for neighbor discovery. A simple yet effective Countdown Mechanism is employed so that ZigBee nodes are coordinately waked up according to the beacons in the Countdown Mechanism. We give a rigorous analysis on NewBee and the worst-case discovery latency is significantly reduced from the traditional O(n 2 ) to O(n), where n indicates the reciprocal of node&#39;s duty-cycle. The experimental results show that NewBee only needs 11%, 10%, 2.5%, 2.4% and 4.4% percent of discovery time compared with the state-of-the-art BlindDate, SearchLight, Disco, Quorum, and Birthday protocols with 5% nodes&#39; duty-cycle, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of edge computing (EC) and intelligent vision-based driver assistance system is of great significance for the prospective development of Internet of Vehicle (IoV). The additional computation capability and extensive network coverage provides energy-limited smart devices with more opportunities to enable IoV system for time-sensitive applications. However, when implemented in a vision-based driver assistance system, the transmission of a large amount of redundant data not only causes delay but also severely compromises the accuracy of object detection. In this paper, an improved object detection algorithm based on video key-frame for latency reduction on edge IoV system is proposed. It can significantly improve latency reduction performance at the expense of small detection accuracy. In our proposal, we adopt an important coefficient and frame similarity comparison algorithm to filter redundant frames and achieve key frames for object detection. Then an improved Haar-like feature based classification algorithm is used for object detection under the edge computation model. Finally, a scalable cluster object detection system is implemented as a practical EC case to verify our proposal, and extensive simulations confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme over regular schemes. It can speed up about 84 times with 40% of the similar frames filtered in comparison.},

  abstract     = {This paper evaluates the performance of uplink transmission in an LTE/Wi-Fi coexisting heterogeneous network (HetNet), where user equipments (UEs) capable of jointly performing LTE/Wi-Fi dual access and dual power control have a higher preference in connecting the Wi-Fi access points (WAPs) than the LTE base stations (LBSs). Thereby, each UE competes for Wi-Fi connection using carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) and, only if unsuccessful, employs cellular communication. During uplink transmission, the UEs employ truncated channel inversion power control with receiving thresholds adjusted according to the occupied communication modes. Based on the stochastic geometry theory, we derive the analytical expressions for the successful connection probability and the average energy efficiency (EE) of Wi-Fi communications. We show that there exists a maximal successful connection probability for Wi-Fi communications, where the optimal receiving signal and energy thresholds of WAPs depend critically on the density of WAPs. Moreover, the average EE of UEs successfully accessing WAPs saturates in the large receiving signal threshold regime, independent of the density of WAPs. These findings significantly differ from those in cellular communications, where maintaining stable service connection is more emphasized than other operation goals, and reveal that deploying Wi-Fi communication has a potential for improving the EE of the considered HetNet. Both simulation and experiment results validate the analytical derivations. These results together show that, compared with single-mode uplink transmission, the considered dual-mode transmission can achieve higher connection probability and EE simultaneously in LTE/Wi-Fi coexisting HetNets.},

  abstract     = {The near-field effect of short-range multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems imposes many challenges on direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. Most conventional scenarios assume that the far-field planar wavefronts hold. In this article, we investigate the DoA estimation problem in short-range MIMO communications, where the effect of near-field spherical wave is non-negligible. By converting it into a regression task, a novel DoA estimation framework based on complex-valued deep learning (CVDL) is proposed for the near-field region in short-range MIMO communication systems. Under the assumption of a spherical wave model, the array steering vector is determined by both the distance and the direction. However, solving this regression task containing a massive number of variables is challenging, since datasets need to capture numerous complicated feature representations. To overcome this, a virtual covariance matrix (VCM) based on received signals is constructed, and thus such features extracted from the VCM can deal with the complicated coupling relationship between the direction and the distance. Although the emergence of wireless big data driven by future communication networks promotes deep learning-based wireless signal processing, the learning algorithms of complex-valued signals are still ongoing. This article proposes a one-dimensional (1-D) residual network that can directly tackle complex-valued features due to the inherent 1-D structure of signal subspace vectors. In addition, we put forth a cropped VCM based policy which can be applied to different antenna sizes. The proposed method is able to fully exploit the complex-valued information. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CVDL approach over the baseline schemes in terms of the accuracy of DoA estimation.},

This paper investigates a long-term energy efficiency (EE) optimization problem in hybrid energy supplied C-RAN. In order to maximize the long-term utility and still maintain the network stability, a stochastic optimization problem is formulated. Particularly, both of the instantaneous quality of service (QoS) requirements and time-averaged limits are considered in the problem. By introducing Lyapunov framework together with the drift-plus-penalty method, we propose an EE-based power allocation and energy cooperation (EE-PAEC) scheme by jointly optimizing both of the sustainable energy and the grid power. The power allocation scheme contributes to optimal long-term EE with the deterministic upper bound of the data queue backlog, without requiring any prior knowledge of the dynamic system. Furthermore, theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate the performance advantage of energy cooperation, and show that the proposed scheme can provide a balanced trade-off between utility and stability.},

Rather than the well-known network-centric global energy efficiency (GEE) metric, which is a pseudo-concave (PC) function, the weighted sum energy efficiency metric is considered, which is not PC in general. To find the optimum user power allocation Dinkelbach-like algorithm is adopted, by which each individual fractional EE function is converted to a parametric function where under some conditions on the weights falls into a class of convex optimization problems and it is solved in the dual domain. The dual variables are updated using a sub-gradient and cutting plane-based algorithm, which here ellipsoid method is used. Since the optimum solution restricts user weights, a low complexity suboptimum algorithm that does not consider any condition on user&#39;s weights is proposed. The problem is non-convex in general; hence, epigraph form followed by successive convex approximation (SCA) is used to deal with that problem. Results demonstrate that with the user-oriented metric, one can provide different priorities to users, and by choosing proper weights entail fairness among users.},

Furthermore, it is assumed that a single backhaul RF link is activated by the mobile relay and due to feedback delay, the RF link activation is based on outdated channel state information (CSI). The performance of this system is analyzed in terms of outage probability and bit error rate (BER), and novel closed form analytical expressions are provided. Furthermore, the analysis is extended for the case where the average SNR over the RF links and/or LED optical power is high, and approximate analytical expressions are derived which determine performance floors. Numerical results are provided which demonstrate that the utilization of multiple RF backhaul links can significantly improve overall RF-VLC system performance when outage/BER floors are avoided. This calls upon joint design of both subsystems. Additionally, the outdated CSI exploited for active RF selection can significantly degrade the quality of system performance.},

The interference problem in LoRa occurs when nodes are attached with a gateway using the same spreading factor. To overcome the problem, the literature assumes that the spreading factor is allocated to each node for a fixed time duration. Since all nodes may not have equal data to transmit to the gateway, the network revenue estimated by using fixed time duration is lower than the allocation based on the needs of the network. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the time duration of using the allocated spreading factor for each node. Such time duration satisfies the service requirement of the node and maximizes the network revenue. We assume that each node in the network takes multiple services from the same or different gateways. We use the game theory approach for formulating the interaction among the nodes and interaction between gateways and nodes. We propose a solution that builds the strategic interactions among the gateways and nodes to estimate the time duration for using the allocated spreading factors. We also propose distributed and centralized algorithms for implementation of the solution.},

To fill this gap, we propose a physical layer secure MIMO-SVD (singular value decomposition) communication scheme (SSVD) to defend against such an eavesdropper with any number of antennas. In the SSVD scheme, the confidential information first goes through a special data frames secure process at the transmitter. After that, by integrating with SSVD precoding, the key information is attached and delivered in the combination of activated/non-activated MIMO parallel sub-channels of the legitimate receiver through the wireless channel. Due to the uniqueness and independence of wireless channel, only the legitimate receiver can observe the key information and use it to “decrypt” (XOR) the confidential information step by step with an arbitrary low BER (bit error rate). However, for any other eavesdropper who suffers an independent channel from legitimate users, the eavesdropper cannot obtain any key information from the received signals, regardless of how many antennas he/she has. Consequently, the eavesdropper cannot “decrypt” any information about the confidential information. The SSVD security and reliability are theoretically analyzed, and the simulation and numerical results fully verified its validity and effectiveness.},

These systems are operated over many contiguous or non-contiguous channels based on the TVWS frequency band availability. Accordingly, we consider realistic channel estimation for TVWS system and analyze the corresponding system performance of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithms. While LMMSE estimates channel path gains assuming perfectly known tap delay locations, OMP estimates both channel path gains and delays. Owing to the realistic implementation and estimating the full channel state information (CSI) of sparse channels, we mainly assess the OMP performance together with the LMMSE estimation for comparison in terms of channel reconstruction and symbol detection errors. To address the channel estimation performance, Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound is derived theoretically for both perfect and imperfect CSI, and confirmed with the simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the realistic OMP-based symbol detection performance is found to be only 1-2 dB inferior compared to the near-optimal LMMSE-based estimation with known delays in low and medium signal-to-noise-ratio regions, where communication mainly occurs in practice. In addition, the effects of channel multipath number, channel resolution and operation modes on the system performance are studied for different scenarios. The results of this work are important for the practical implementation of IEEE 802.11af-based systems.},

Existing hybrid precoding schemes either require full channel state information (CSI) or use codebook-based design, causing large feedback overhead or degraded system performance, respectively. In this paper, we propose a balanced scheme with limited feedback CSI and element-level quantization. Our key idea is to maximize the system sum rate by using an adaptive baseband precoder and an eigenbeam radio frequency (RF) precoder. The adaptive baseband precoder can balance the effective channel gain and the multiuser interference according to the transmitted power. The eigenbeam RF precoder is optimized with only requiring a limited length of feedback vector. Considering the practical constraints on RF precoders, we then propose a quantization algorithm that minimizes the subspace distortion between the optimized eigenbeam RF precoder and the quantized one. The quantization algorithm also works for the case when RF chains are more than users. Extensive simulation results are provided and validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid precoding scheme.},

However, a common problem of these approaches is that many physical layer (PHY) operations, e.g., synchronization, are not considered. As a result, existing methods may find difficulties in real-world implementation. In this article, we propose a simple yet practical uplink scheme for systems with multiple antennas. The main idea is to conduct multi-user beamforming (MU-BF) at an access point such that it can resolve collided signals from multiple competitive users; the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the upstream collision probability and improve system throughput. The other distinct advantage of the proposed scheme is that the MAC protocol of the original IEEE 802.11 standard, i.e., distributed coordination function (DCF), can remain unchanged. The mathematical analysis of system performance is also presented and verified. Simulations show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional WLAN systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel multi-beam transmission scheme is proposed to enhance physical layer (PHY) security. This scheme utilizes index modulation (IM) based on frequency diverse array (FDA) beamforming with cooperative legitimate users (LUs). By leveraging IM based on FDA, the indices associated with multiple LUs are directly used as additional sources to transmit information. Using this scheme, the confidential messages can be retrieved only if all the index information and the corresponding symbols are obtained. This adds an extra level of PHY security hence reduces the possibility of information interception by eavesdroppers (Eves). Here instead of maximizing the secrecy rate, we propose a minimum message transmission power criterion to design the FDA beamforming vector, subject to prescribed minimum received power at each of the LUs, in addition to the orthogonality constraints of the remaining LUs. This provides a reliable and accurate transmission assurance for the LUs to obtain the corresponding messages under minimum message transmission power. To further deteriorate the quality of the received signals at Eves, we also add artificial noise (AN). Moreover, by elaborating the time-variant characteristics, we provide a new and more accurate perspective for the range-time dimension secure transmission.

  abstract     = {Wireless power transfer (WPT) and cooperative relaying (CR) can promisingly sustain the operations of wireless nodes and improve the communication reliability. We design both orthogonal and non-orthogonal CR schemes with two sources communicating to two destinations with assistance from an energy harvesting relay. The WPT and CR are alternately and periodically performed. In the WPT phase, the relay can harvest energy from a power beacon. In the CR phase, two sources transmit their data to the relay, who can adaptively forward the source data according to its decoding status. When the relay cannot forward any data due to the decoding failures, a new WPT phase begins and the relay continues to harvest and accumulate energy. The energy status of the relay is properly modeled by defining a series of discrete levels. The average throughput is analyzed by considering various decoding and energy statuses of the relay. Numerical results reveal the impacts of key parameters to the system performance, such as the transmit powers of sources, the data transmission rates, and the relative distances between different terminals. It is shown that the non-orthogonal scheme performs much better than the orthogonal scheme for some system settings.},

Generating and optimizing multibeam subject to the requirements is critical and challenging, particularly for systems using analog arrays. This paper develops optimal solutions to a range of multibeam design problems, where both communication and sensing are considered. We first study the optimal combination of two pre-generated subbeams, and their beamforming vectors, using a combining phase coefficient. Closed-form optimal solutions are derived to the constrained optimization problems, where the received signal powers for communication and the beamforming waveforms are alternatively used as the objective and constraint functions. We also develop global optimization methods which directly find optimal solutions for a single beamforming vector. By converting the original intractable complex NP-hard global optimization problems to real quadratically constrained quadratic programs, near-optimal solutions are obtained using semidefinite relaxation techniques. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed constrained multibeam generation and optimization methods.},

  abstract     = {Grant-free Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is a promising solution to enable massive wireless access service for 5G systems and beyond. Conventional grant-free NOMA schemes directly apply the spreading signatures optimized for the grant-based scenarios, which, however, ignore the users&#39; diversified activation probabilities. In addition, the conventional grant-free NOMA schemes are not designed with finite-alphabet signatures, which hinders the encoder/decoder implementation using practical low-cost hardware. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, we propose a finite-alphabet signature design for the grant-free NOMA with random and nonuniform user activations. Herein, the NOMA signatures are optimized by the autoencoder-based transceivers with both transmitter and receiver being in the form of deep neural network. First, the quantized deep learning is employed in the NOMA signature training, which jointly optimizes the sequence generation and quantization. Moreover, in order to improve the training rate, we propose a specific neural network receiver, where the network structure resembles the successive interference cancellation procedures. The experiment results show that the obtained NOMA signatures commendably exploit the users&#39; activation profiles, and the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional ones especially when the users have unequal activation probabilities.},

We formulate two power allocation optimization problems which guarantee quality-of-service for QoS users and maximize the sum-rate of non-QoS users simultaneously. These two problems are solved by two proposed successive convex approximation algorithms, and we show that these two algorithms surely converge to a local maximum Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point.

The paper focuses on the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) approach for sharing pilot sequences among users. Unlike the conventional cell-free massive MIMO-NOMA systems in which the UL signals from different access points are equally combined over the backhaul network, this paper first develops an optimal backhaul combining (OBC) method to maximize the UL signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). It is shown that, by using OBC, the correlated interference can be effectively mitigated if the number of users assigned to each pilot sequence is less than or equal to the number of base stations (BSs). As a result, the cell-free massive MIMO-NOMA system with OBC can enjoy unlimited performance when the number of antennas at each BS tends to infinity. A closed-form SINR expression is derived under Rayleigh fading and used to formulate a max-min quality-of-service (QoS) power control problem to further enhance the system performance. To deal with the NP-hardness of the concerned optimization problem, a successive inner approximation technique is applied to convert the original problem into a series of convex optimizations, which can be solved iteratively. In addition, a user grouping algorithm is also developed and shown to be better than random user grouping and a grouping method recently proposed in the literature. Numerical results are presented to corroborate the analysis and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed optimal backhaul combining over both equal-gain backhaul combining and zero-forcing backhaul combining.},

A specific transmission strategy is proposed to transmit the symbols of multiple users which enables a significant saving of transmission time slots as compared to a trivial time division multiplexing based strategy. In order to detect the symbols at different receivers, the concept of left null of channel vector is utilized. The statistical properties of received signal-to-noise ratio at receiving end are studied by using probability density function, cumulative distribution function. Further, analytical performance of the system is discussed in terms of symbol error rate and diversity order by using moment generating function based approach. It is observed through theoretical analysis that the error performance of the proposed scheme degrades with increasing number of users; but this loss in performance can be compensated by deploying more antennas at the receivers. It is also shown through simulations that the computational complexity of the proposed scheme is also very much less as compared to the existing schemes.},

We propose an optimum beamforming design at the cognitive transmitter such that the rate of cognitive network is maximized, under a constraint that the rate of the primary network is above a certain threshold. Results show that proposed optimization framework can substantially enlarge the rate region toward both primary and secondary networks. Furthermore, in order to characterize the network delay-constrained throughput, tractable outage probability expressions for primary and secondary networks assuming sub-optimum zero-forcing based beamforming scheme are derived. Our results reveal that due to required minimum power for harvesting operation as well as saturation of the harvested power at high transmit power levels, conventional linear EH model may lead to performance mismatches for practical non-linear EH circuits in both low and high transmit power regimes.},

Here, the conflict of SE-EE trade-off in downlink (DL) transmission is expressed methodically by Pareto Optimal Set (POS) based on a multi-empirical most effective use of a resource scheme as a function of femto base station (FBS) and macro base station (MBS) transmit power and base station (BS) density, respectively. Then, SE and EE are formulated in a utility function by applying Cobb-Douglas production function to transform the multi-empirical difficulty into the single-empirical optimization case. Besides, it is analytically shown that the SE-EE trade-off can be optimize through a distinctive universal optimum among the Pareto optimal by fine-tuning the weighting metric other than BS transmit power and density, respectively. Simulation results validate that it is possible to obtain the EE-SE trade-off with SINR threshold at different weighting factor.},

Linear analysis in frequency domain shows that the RDC can significantly reduce the magnitude and increase the phase lag of sideslip response as well as enlarge the bandwidth of yaw response in a broad frequency range. Through the incorporation of a novel sliding mode controller, the RDC algorithm is further extended for nonlinear applications. Analysis based on nonlinear model shows that, the RDC can guarantee the performance of the closed-loop (CL) system in the presence of uncertainties in system parameters and state feedback values. Moreover, the RDC is robust to arbitrary lateral disturbances and can guarantee that the vehicle converges to reference yaw rate and zero sideslip. Simulation results show that the RDC can effectively improve the lateral and directional performance of the vehicle in comparison with previous control methods. Excellent robustness to external disturbance and road friction variation is reported as well.},

Various designs have been proposed for compact, and multi-functional wheel modules. However, the architecture of vehicular active safety systems, by adopting such a modular approach, has not yet been well studied in the literature. Conventional stability control systems are developed in a centralized manner to seek the optimal distribution of control efforts, and the resultant controllers are highly dependent on the vehicle platform. Any changes to the actuators as well as modelling complexity will lead to a system redesign. This paper proposes a distributed control architecture as inspired by the modular chassis design for great re-usability. Each wheel module is treated as an agent in a cooperative game to determine their share in the overall control efforts, while encapsulating their configuration as well as modelling details within each module. Re-configurable agent models are also derived in a weak-coupled fashion to enhance modularity of the control system. The resultant distributed model predictive controller demonstrates greater flexibility in adaption to various configurations as well as enhanced robustness against computational units failure in the system. The proposed architecture also offers a new perspective for the controller design of conventional vehicles.},

In this article, we address the problem of designing a supervisory controller that achieves minimum fuel consumption while optimally preserving battery life. Electrochemical degradation dynamics are used in the multi-objective problem formulation to accurately capture, and control battery performance, and aging during the control design phase. The electrochemical degradation model accounts for the electrolyte dynamics to capture high C-rate operation of the battery which are properl in charge sustaining hybrid powertrains. We resort to the optimal control formalism, and nonlinear optimization techniques along with the full discretization approach (in the state, and in the control) to cast the energy management problem into a large scale non-linear programming problem, that is able to deal with multi-scale dynamics, namely from the stiff electrolyte battery dynamics to map-based slow dynamics of the actuators. Numerical simulations conducted over four different standard driving cycles (with, and without road grades) show that our aging-aware energy management approach is able to significantly reduce the deterioration of the battery, while retaining very good fuel reduction performance.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have been widely applied in industrial applications. It is desired to predict the health state of batteries to achieve optimal operation and health management. However, accuracy is the biggest bottleneck for battery health prediction. In this paper, a new hybrid ensemble data-driven method is proposed to accurately predict the state-of-health (SOH) and remaining-useful-life (RUL) of Li-ion batteries. A health indicator is selected as feature inputs to predict the degradation trend of battery, after the Pearson correlation analysis. Two random learning algorithms are integrated to extract the inherent relationship between the extracted health indicator and practical SOH due to their good learning performance. Based on the estimated SOH, the nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) structure is designed to reduce the RUL prediction error of each learning model since the NAR structure makes good use of historical and current information. Finally, in order to quantitatively evaluate the prediction interval of the RUL, a Bootstrap-based uncertainty management method is designed. Test results on two publicly available datasets show that the proposed hybrid data-driven method can accurately predict the SOH and RUL of batteries. The proposed method does not require any other additional hardware or system downtime, which makes it suitable for online practical applications, such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles.},

In order to obtain a low-cost and high-precision positioning strategy, an integrated positioning strategy for intelligent vehicles based on the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), dead reckoning (DR), ultra-wide band (UWB), and visual map matching (VMM) was proposed in this paper. First, the error sources of the three independent positioning methods of GNSS, DR, and UWB were analyzed, and independent positioning algorithms with improved accuracy were proposed. Then, the fusion positioning algorithm of GNSS/DR/UWB with an adaptive information distribution coefficient was established using a federated Kalman filter to improve the positioning accuracy and continuity. Afterward, to avoid reliance on the previous moment, the positioning result was further corrected by VMM. Finally, offline simulation and real vehicle tests were conducted under typical working conditions with the impact of real-world noise and the real-motion states of vehicles. The results showed that the GNSS/UWB/DR/VMM positioning algorithm could effectively improve the positioning accuracy and reliability of intelligent vehicles at a low cost.},

When the ECB works, the mechanical energy of the vehicle is converted into thermal energy under the action of the electromagnetic field, which is a process of mutual influence between the electromagnetic field and temperature field, and this process can be simulated by establishing a transient Magneto-thermal coupling model with bidirectional data transmission. However, due to the long calculation time required for accurate 3D electromagnetic analysis, the above model must be simplified. The parameter sensitivity analysis of the ECB shows that the temperature of the eddy current generating location directly affects the braking torque. Through the 3D electromagnetic field numerical analysis, the mapping relationship between the temperature of the eddy current generating layer and the braking torque is established and brought into the transient heat transfer model. The finite difference method is used to calculate the heat transfer model. The calculation results can predict and analyze the braking performance of the ECB during its working process.},

  abstract     = {There is increasing popularity of using permanent magnet (PM) machines in vehicle propulsion systems. Due to the pre-excitation of PM, the machines could offer higher efficiency and torque density. However, their inherent torque ripple could be problematic for electric vehicles (EVs) due to low damping of torsional vibration which may affect passenger comfort. This can prohibit the use of PM machines to improve vehicle energy efficiency. This paper presents the application of resonant control (RC) to suppress the impact of the PM torque ripple, which aims to reduce the vibration of a vehicle. A prototype PM machine and driveline have been fitted to a light-duty off-road vehicle. Firstly, the drivetrain frequency response was analyzed. The main source of the vibration is identified as the 24 th harmonic torque ripple of the 12-slot/8-pole PM machine, which originates from the cogging torque and air-gap flux harmonics. The vibration becomes more severe when the torque ripple frequency is close to the natural frequency of the drivetrain. Then, the RC in conjunction with PI controller (PIR) was introduced to be used at the outer speed loop, so that an accurate current reference signal can be generated for the inverter to mitigate the speed ripple. When compared to the conventional Proportional-Integral (PI) controller, PIR controller has demonstrated over 80% reduction in speed ripple, even when the torque ripple frequency is close to the natural frequency of the vehicle.},

By designing a new type of particle filter (PF), the online identification of unknown tire model is realized and its uncertainties and road surface disturbances are both considered. The constraints of vehicle motions tracking ideal values are derived according to the estimated tire lateral forces with Lyapunov stability theory. And then based on the thought of backstepping and optimization, the drive torque distribution method and the rear wheel steer strategy are obtained aiming at minimizing tire load and control inputs, which also take the effective working range of in-wheel motor into account. Finally, the validity and practicability of overall controller are verified through the simulation of Carsim and Matlab/Simulink.

The incremental capacity is analyzed to clarify the reason for the capacity loss of the battery pack. The current and temperature are also discussed to investigate the characteristics. On the other hand, an identification method is proposed based on the experiments. The parallel-connected battery unit is regarded as a large battery. The parameters of the large battery are estimated by recursive least squares. It is judged whether the large battery has a loose connection or internal resistance increases by the estimated resistance and its standard deviation. Then, combine with the tab voltage and temperature, the specific faulty cell is identified. The fault is considered as the second level. When the temperature difference among cells exceeds 5°C, the fault deteriorates to a first level.

To reduce energy consumption while ensuring handling stability, we propose an optimal torque vectoring control strategy based on a two-level distribution formula. This strategy can naturally decouple front/rear axle torque vectoring from left/right torque vectoring and avoid the contradiction between stability and energy saving. First, considering the motor efficiency, the vehicle&#39;s total torque is optimally distributed to the front and rear axles based on model predictive control. Then, based on the front/rear axle distribution ratio, the left/right torque vectoring is revised to produce a suitable additional yaw moment to improve the handling stability. A sliding mode controller is designed to track the reference yaw rate calculated from a nonlinear reference model. The nonlinear reference model is more suitable for extreme conditions due to the accurate reflection of the nonlinear characteristics. A suitable additional yaw moment can ensure vehicle stability and avoid excessive energy consumption due to vehicle instability. The simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy can reduce energy consumption while ensuring vehicle stability.},

  abstract     = {High-precision navigation of the underground excavating machine is the core of realizing safe excavating and autonomous control, but it is difficult to realize high-precision navigation for the underground excavating machine. The integration of GNSS and inertial navigation system are generally adopted for the high-precision navigation of the ground equipment, which can provide high-precision navigation for a long time. However, the GNSS signals cannot be used in underground operation, so the navigation scheme applied to the ground cannot be used underground. At the same time, the velocity of the underground excavation machine is very slow and the operation time is very long, which makes it impossible to use pure inertial navigation scheme for navigation. Because the inertial navigation error accumulates with time, if the operation time is too long, the navigation accuracy cannot be guaranteed. The integration of inertial navigation and odometer is considered as a reliable scheme, but simulation and experimental analysis show that the traditional integration of inertial navigation and odometer cannot meet the operation requirements of the underground excavating machine in the presence of serious slipping and measurement noises. This paper proposes an integration of fully damped inertial navigation/odometer to provide long-term high-precision orientation navigation information for mining equipment. The advantage of the fully damped inertial navigation/odometer integration approach is that it can maintain high accuracy of orientation measurement in one week or longer under the condition of sensor drift error and odometer measurement error.

The attitude and velocity data of INS are well investigated to build the relationship between the DVL velocities at transmitting epoch and receiving epoch. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under various trajectories, where the DVL outputs without correction and the correction methods based on constant velocity assumptions are employed for comparison. The results indicate that the existing correction methods may achieve good navigation accuracy in specific trajectories, where the motion coincides with the assumptions.

With amplitudes up to several volts and dozens of amperes, such harmonics can cause significant problems and lead to performance limitations or even component failures. In order to maintain the quality of the dc-link voltage and guarantee the sound interaction of all components, power electronics must therefore be equipped with filter capacitors damping these harmonics. However, the filter stages account for a large part of the overall component cost and volume. Usually, the required dc-link filters are designed independently for each component on its own without taking into account the configuration of the complete powertrain. This, however, might result in undersizing of filters and possible system failures or contrary to that to oversized and expensive components. In this study, an analytic approach for the computation of the electric harmonics generated by the drive unit of a hybrid fuel cell vehicle will be derived and validated using measurement data. Using this model, the significance of the electric harmonics for the design of the powertrain as well as the sizing process of the filter capacitors will be analyzed.},

In this study, the control subsystem of each EVCS is demonstrated to have weak interaction with the filter subsystem and the DC network. Moreover, a method for designing proper parameters to ensure self-stability of the EVCS is proposed. Additionally, when multiple EVCSs are connected to the DC network, the interaction among the connected EVCSs may decrease the DC system stability. Therefore, the positive-net-damping stability criterion is used to analyze the small-signal stability of the DC system, confirming that the instability of the DC system is caused by two factors, the filter subsystem of the EVCS and the equivalent impedance of the DC network. Considering the restrictions on stability, the maximum number of connections of SC-EVCSs and PC-EVCSs should be limited in planning. Furthermore, the study theoretically proves that compared with PC-EVCS, SC-EVCS can service more EVCSs to the DC network while ensuring stability. Finally, an example using MATLAB is presented to demonstrate the analytical conclusions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the vibration characteristics of a parallel hydraulic hybrid vehicle (PHHV) powertrain are investigated. A powertrain model is built to capture the natural frequencies and mode shapes before model reduction is conducted to simplify the system complexity. The natural frequencies and the mode shapes of the PHHV are compared with the original vehicle. Results show that with a hydraulic pump/motor (HPM) added on the powertrain, the dynamic response to engine excitation is increased only at the first natural frequency. Due to the minimum engine excitation frequency being higher than the first natural frequency of the system, resonance is avoided. The HPM also introduces excitation to the PHHV powertrain due to its instantaneous torque fluctuations. As HPM excitation is much smaller than the engine excitation, it does not produce excessive vibrations even though the powertrain frequency response is near its lowest resonant frequency. These results indicate that the NVH characteristics of the powertrain are not significantly influenced by the significant changes to the system architecture resulting from the addition of the HPM. Additionally, the HPM is not exposed to significant sources of vibration from the forced responses of the engine. Consequently, the need for substantive vibration isolation for the HPM is reduced.},

In this paper the system modeling and controllers design of series hydraulic hybrid wheel loader were illustrated. A tunable energy management strategy has been proposed and studied. By changing the hybrid weight factor in the strategy, the powertrain hybridization degree was adjusted without any additional hardware. This study shows that higher use of the hydraulic accumulator power indicates a higher degree of hydraulic hybridization.

  abstract     = {Anti-jerk controllers actively suppress the torsional oscillations of automotive drivetrains, caused by abrupt variations of the traction torque. The main benefits are: i) enhanced passengers&#39; comfort; and ii) increased component life. Extensive literature deals with the design of anti-jerk controllers for electric powertrains with on-board motors, i.e., in which the electric motor is part of the sprung mass of the vehicle, and transmits torque to the wheels through a transmission, half-shafts and constant velocity joints. Nevertheless, a complete and structured comparison of the performance of the different control options is still missing. This study addresses the gap through the assessment of six anti-jerk controllers - five exemplary formulations from the literature, and one novel formulation based on explicit nonlinear model predictive control (eNMPC). All proposed control structures have the potential to be implemented on production vehicles. A set of objective performance indicators is defined to assess the controllers, which are tuned through an optimization-based routine. Results show that the wheel speed input is critical to enhance controller performance, but may lead to reduced robustness.},

  abstract     = {The sideslip angle and attitude are crucial for automated driving especially for chassis integrated control and environmental perception. In this article an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based automated vehicle body sideslip angle and attitude estimation method aided by low-sample-rate global navigation satellite system (GNSS) velocity and position measurements using parallel adaptive Kalman filters is proposed. This method can estimate the sideslip angle and attitude simultaneously and is robust against the vehicle parameters and road friction even as the vehicle enters critical maneuvers. First, based on the acceleration and angular rate from the six-dimensional inertial measurement unit, the attitude, velocity and position (AVP) are integrated with the navigation coordinates and the AVP error dynamics and observation equations of the integration results are developed. Second, parallel innovation adaptive estimation (IAE)-based Kalman filters is designed to estimate the AVP error of the integration method to address the issues of the GNSS low sampled rate and abnormal measurements. Then the AVP error is forwarded to the AVP integration to compensate the accumulated error. To improve the heading angle estimation accuracy, the heading error is estimated by a decoupled IAE-based Kalman filter aided by GNSS heading. In addition, time synchronization of the IMU and GNSS is realized through hardware based on the pulse per second signal of the GNSS receiver and the spatial synchronization is achieved by a direct compensation method. Lastly, the sideslip angle and attitude estimation method is validated by a comprehensive experimental test including critical double lane change and slalom maneuvers. The results show that the estimation error of the longitudinal velocity and lateral velocity is smaller than 0.1 m/s (1σ), and the estimation error of the sideslip angle is smaller than 0.15° (1σ).},

Due to the potential difference in electricity price between the grid and the renewable plants, an EV may purchase electricity at charging stations powered by renewable plants, and then discharge the surplus energy in the battery to the grid, to gain profits and enhance the overall renewable energy utilization. In this work, we aim to optimize the route selection and charging/discharging scheduling to improve the overall economic profits of EVs, taking into account the constraints, including the time-varying energy supply caused by the intermittent generation of renewable energy, the limited number of charging piles in a charging station, and the traveling delay tolerance of EVs. Firstly, a time-expanded vehicle-to-grid graph is designed to model the objective and related constraints. Then, we apply an AI-based A* algorithm to find K-shortest paths for each EV. Finally, a joint routing selection and charging/discharging algorithm, namely, K-Shortest-Paths-Joint-Routing-Scheduling (KSP-JRS), is proposed to minimize the total cost of EVs by maximizing their revenue from energy discharging under time constraints. The proposed approach is evaluated using the real traffic map around Santa Clara, California.

Firstly, a dynamic programming approach is introduced to convexify the corridor constraints in path pre-selection and replanned for obstacle avoidance. The idea is to find a convex feasible set for the optimization problem using the convex constraints. And then a standard quadratic convex problem is formulated to optimize the longitudinal motion and steering angle control in prediction and control horizon. The longitudinal progression and lateral tracking errors are decomposed in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. The centerline as well as road borders are also described by using cubic spline curves.

Sending and storing such vehicle trajectory data cause sustainable communication and storage overheads. Trajectory data compression becomes a promising way to alleviate overhead issues. However, previous solutions are commonly carried out at the side of the data center after data having been received, thus saving the storage cost only. Here, we bring the idea of mobile edge computing and transfer the computation-intensive data compression task to the mobile devices of drivers. As a result, the trajectory data is reduced at the side of data generators before being sent out; thus, it can lower data communication and storage costs simultaneously. We propose DAVT , an error-bounded trajectory data representation, and a compression framework. Specifically, the trajectory data is reformatted into three parts (i.e., D istance, A cceleration &amp; V elocity, and T ime), and three compressors are wisely devised to compress each part. For D and AV parts, a similar Huffman tree-forest structure is exploited to encode data elements effectively, but with quite different rationales. For the T part, the large absolute timestamps are transformed to small time intervals firstly, and different encoding techniques are adopted based on the data quality. We evaluate our proposed system using a large-scale taxi trajectory dataset collected from the city of Beijing, China. Our results show that our compressors outperform other baselines.},

The current standard restricts most current simulation tools by a cut-off frequency of 20 Hz. This low-frequency range of interest cannot fully describe the current collection quality of pantograph-catenary. This paper includes simulation with cut-off frequencies up to 200 Hz to investigate the high-frequency behaviour of pantograph-catenary interaction. The reference model of pantograph-catenary in the benchmark is taken as the analysis object. Firstly, the effect of key simulation parameters of the resulting contact force is investigated. A small element length in the finite element model is proposed to prevent the frequency range of interest being contaminated by the numerical error. The contact stiffness has an opposite effect on the contact force in low and high-frequency ranges. Then the source and the amplification factor of high-frequency components of contact force are investigated. The results show that the half and quarter of the dropper/steady arm interval length presents the primary source of high-frequency components of the contact force. The corresponding wavelength can also be found in the high-order modes of the catenary. Finally, a variable time step procedure is also proposed to capture the contact loss occurring at high frequencies accurately. The comparison of the results between the variable and constant time steps indicates that the traditional constant time step may result in errors when calculating the contact loss duration.},

  abstract     = {The path tracking system is a crucial component in fully autonomous vehicles. While many methods provide stateof-the-art tracking performance, they tend to emphasize tracking accuracy for safety, at the price of ride quality. Although methods based on a dynamic model and optimization theory guarantee improved tracking performance, a high-fidelity model is unavailable in most autonomous systems, and the complex optimization process may increase the computational burden. Therefore, for practical, real-life systems, it is urgent to develop a tracking method with a simple, effective control framework for real-time implementation. Moreover, the tracking approach should adaptively balance between tracking accuracy and the passenger experience. With that in mind, a simple tracking scheme with adaptive lateral and longitudinal control approaches is proposed. For lateral control, a pure pursuit (PP) geometric controller is used as a basic tracking framework to design the steering method. A detailed analysis shows that PP inefficiently reduces the lateral error. A PID controller is integrated with PP by a customized reinforcement learning model to better deal with tracking error by trading off between PP and PID. Moreover, a rough-to-fine velocity adaptation method is proposed to adjust the speed according to the geometry of the predefined path and the real-time tracking feedback. The proposed controlling approach is tested in different path tracking scenarios. The results show that the approach can adaptively change the weights of PP and PID to maintain a balance between tracking error (within ±0.5 m) and jerk (within ±0.5 m/s 3 ),and can adapt to high-speed scenarios (up to 80 km/h). Finally, a field test is carried out to validate the practicability.},

These lead to a reduction in the operational efficiency of the power grid. V2G (Vehicle 2 Grid) enabled electric vehicles (EVs) can act as a reactive power resource and can provide active power regulation, load matching, and current harmonic filtering. We propose a smart framework based on Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge computing to manage the V2G operations efficiently. The proposed framework can handle distributed energy sources, and can help in grid stabilization, increasing its reliability, and improving the power efficiency. V2G energy transfers can affect the EV&#39;s battery lifetime, however if carefully managed, they can be economical both for the grid operators, as well as the EV owners. The proposed framework creates an optimum charging schedule for each EV to maximize the profit of the EV owners, keeping the preferences set by the vehicle owner and the grid requirement in consideration.},

Due to unknown data association and false alarms, all possible track initiation points need to be evaluated, which suffers from computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient track initiation method for multi-static multi-frequency passive coherent localization systems, where bistatic measurements from different illuminators are incorporated at a receiver to find the most probable track initiation points. By the proposed likelihood utility function, our method resolves unknown data association between measurements and targets to reduce computational complexity. In addition, the proposed method can be extended to process a set of multi-scan measurements in association-free manner, which results in improved estimation accuracy.

This study proposes an efficient recognition approach based on Nonlinear Polynomial Regression (NPR) and Recurrent Hidden Semi-Markov Model (R-HSMM) to recognize the driver lane-change intention accurately in the early stage. The NPR model is utilized to transform the input signal amplitude into the standard form in order to improve system adaptability. Besides, an unsupervised time-series segmentation method named the Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-based Clustering (TICC) is applied to label the driving data automatically. The R-HSMM is utilized as a time-series classifier to classify the driving intention during the lane-change process into predefined categories based on the signals processed by the NPR. The proposed method is verified by the experiments with a driving simulator. The experimental results show that the proposed method can recognize driver intention earlier than the popular recognition methods, and also can reduce the number of false warnings during the lane-change process, which has great significance for driving safety improvement. Moreover, the proposed method can adapt well to various vehicle speeds achieving stable recognition performance.},

However, current works rarely consider the influence of navigation uncertainties, i.e., uncertain water waves and winds, and fail to address two characteristics of shipboard ESS, i.e., redundant capacity and distributed locations. In this paper, a two-stage robust optimal shipboard microgrid operation method is proposed to mitigate the pre-voyage and intra-voyage navigation uncertainties. The first stage is to regulate the onboard generation and voyage variables for addressing the worst pre-voyage navigation uncertainties and the second stage is an on-line recourse action which acts on intra-voyage uncertainty realization. To address the characteristics of shipboard ESS, the onboard batteries are separated into two groups and a multi-battery management strategy is proposed for the battery lifetime extension. An AES with 4 DGs and 4 batteries is used in the case studies. The simulation results show that the proposed method can well adapt to the navigation uncertainties and the multi-battery management can extend the battery lifetime by iteratively using different battery groups.},

  abstract     = {Train integrity resolution is an important part of a train operation control system. In current train operation control systems, train integrity resolution is achieved by using information on the track circuit or the wind pressure. However, both approaches have limitations; the utilization of the track circuits requires high construction and maintenance costs, and the wind pressure approach has to overcome the problem of low update rate and false alarm caused by the incident pipe leakage. In this paper a new train integrity resolution method based on double-differenced carrier phase relative positioning is proposed. To improve the system performance, an online integer ambiguity fixing method is applied to overcome the frequent integer ambiguity re-fixing problem caused by the high train speed and the complex operational environment. Moreover, the elevation angle constraint optimal distribution based reference satellite selection method is applied to guarantee optimal satellite geometry distribution during train operation. To evaluate the performance of the proposed train integrity resolution method, a real train test was carried out on the Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway. The experimental results show that the proposed train integrity resolution method can provide train integrity solutions with an accuracy of better than 0.5 m, with STD and RMS of 0.15 m and 0.17 m respectively. Compared with the conventional GNSS single point positioning based train integrity method, the proposed method can achieve a much better performance, with an improvement, in this test, of 77%.},

  abstract     = {New simulation tools are necessary to predict the fuel savings, safety, and performance benefits of connectivity-enabled control systems for Class 8 trucks. The simulation framework described here combines high fidelity vehicle and powertrain models (uniquely, and with their controllers provided by the manufacturer) with a novel production-intent platooning controller. This controller commands propulsive engine torque, engine-braking, or friction-braking to a rear vehicle in a two-truck platoon to maintain a desired following distance. Additional unique features of the framework include high fidelity road grade and traffic speed data. A comparison to published experimental platooning results is performed through simulation with the platooning trucks traveling at a constant 28.6 m/s (64 MPH) on flat ground and separated by 11 m (36 ft). Simulations of platooning trucks separated by a 16.7 m (54.8 ft) gap are also performed in steady-state operation, at different speeds and on different grades (flat, uphill, and downhill), to demonstrate how platooning affects fuel consumption and torque demand (propulsive and braking) as speed and grade are varied. For instance, while platooning trucks with the same 16.7 m gap at 28.6 m/s save the same absolute quantity of fuel on a 1% grade as on flat ground (1.00 per-mile), the trucks consume more fuel overall as grade increases, such that relative savings for the platoon average decrease from 6.90% to 4.94% for flat vs. 1% grade, respectively. Furthermore, both absolute and relative fuel savings improve during platooning as speed increases, due to increase in aerodynamic drag force with speed. There are no fuel savings during the downhill operation, regardless of speed, as the trucks are engine braking to maintain reasonable speeds and thus not consuming fuel. Results for a two-truck platoon are also shown for moderately graded I-74 in Indiana, using traffic speed from INDOT for a typical Friday at 5PM. A 16.7 m (54.8 ft) gap two-truck platoon decreases fuel consumption by 6.18% over the baseline without degradation in trip time (average speed of 28.3 m/s (63.3 MPH)). The same platooning trucks operating on aggressively graded I-69 in Indiana shows a lower platoon-average 3.71% fuel savings over baseline at a slower average speed of 24.5 m/s (54.8 MPH). The impact of speed variation over, and grade differences between, these realistic routes (I-74 &amp; I-69) on two-truck platooning is described in detail.},

However, current risk analysis methods either are time-consuming or not suitable for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). In this paper, an efficient security risk analysis method, Vehicles Risk Analysis (VeRA), is proposed, fitting for evaluating the risks of attacks in the context of AV and CAVs. VeRA firstly considers the human capabilities and vehicle automation level to conduct a security risk analysis. Meanwhile, compared to the benchmark (i.e., SAE J3061), VeRA uses a simplified analysis process and fewer factors, significantly reducing the required analysis time without affecting analysis accuracy. Moreover, based on VeRA, a simple but efficient mathematical model is established to assess the risk value by considering the attack probability, severity and human control, avoiding the tedious process of looking up tables in previous methods. A case study on a general AV model shows that VeRA not only captures the critical attacks as accurate as other methods, but also analyzes the changes of human controllability with the vehicle&#39;s automation level. The performance compared to other available methods shows that VeRA can obtain the same analysis results by using around 43% less time than the benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Along with the growing demands of intelligent traffic system, how to recognize the category information of a car from surveillance cameras has been an important task. Fine-grained car recognition is facing challenges mainly due to similar appearance of inter-class car images. Moreover, unlike other forms of object recognition, there are a large quantity of car models, that most other objects do not have, which causes fine-grained car recognition to be of vital importance but challenging. Recent research focuses on training a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) on a large dataset. Typically these methods largely rely on the holistic appearance of cars and may fail to train an optimal DCNN to comprehend information from multiple parts of a car. To address this issue, we carefully measure the effectiveness of different parts of a car and highlight the importance of car fronts for fine-grained car recognition. Then, considering multiple important parts from cars, we propose a novel multi-path DCNN model which is equipped with a 3-branch deep convolutional network to better exploit holistic as well as part information for fine-grained car recognition. Multiple parts from cars provide complementary information to boost performance. To further facilitate research on fine-grained car recognition, we also collect a large-scale dataset named “Multiple Parts from Cars” (MPF-Cars) which contains category annotation as well as car part information. We evaluate our proposed multi-path DCNN on MPF-Cars and another benchmark dataset CarFlag-563. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a stable fuzzy controller in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is designed for an electric vehicle (EV). The proposed controller evaluates the stabilization of the EV speed with robust disturbance rejection approach throughout both transient and steady states and in the presence of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. In order to achieve an efficient control, EV&#39;s battery voltage, as control input, and EV speed, as system output, are constrained. The proposed control strategy is based on Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model and the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) fuzzy controller. Proposed controller can be practically implemented due to low computational load of control input that is owing to the offline process of obtaining the feedback gains, very small amplitude of control input and low power consumption. To evaluate the performance of the designed controller, simulations in five steps are conducted on an EV equipped with a brushed direct current (BDC) motor as a case study in MATLAB simulation environment. Ultimately, the real-time digital simulation results using real-time digital power system simulator (RTDS) confirm the efficiency of the proposed input-output constrained robust disturbance rejection stable fuzzy controller (IOCRDRSFC) in stabilizing the EV speed. The simulation results obtained from MATLAB and the RTDS confirm the energy-efficient and robust performance of the proposed controller in quick stabilization of the EV speed in the presence of all structured and unstructured uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {The motion cueing algorithms (MCAs) is the method that reproduces the motion sensation of the real vehicle for the users of simulation-based motion platforms (SBMPs). Classical MCA is the most common type of MCA due to its simplicity, easy tunning procedure, and higher speed. The fixed neutral position of the SBMP restricts the available workspace and makes the motions of the platform conservative. Then, the high frequency motion inputs cannot be reproduced precisely using SBMP and it increases the motion sensation error between the SBMP and real vehicle driver. The main objective of this study is to enlarge the reachable workspace of the SBMP adaptively using the new prepositioning technique based on fuzzy logic and artificial neural network (ANN). Prepositioning of the SBMPs to an off-centre point can increase the available linear space of the SBMPs based on different driving scenarios to decrease the motion sensation error. The fuzzy logic-based units are working based on the current position of the SBMP and the predicted motion signals. Therefore, the ANN is employed to forecast the motion signal of the SBMP on the finite history of input. The prepositioning of the SBMP using fuzzy logic and ANN is established for the first time in this research with consideration of the road information and vehicle motion information. The proposed method is performed and validated using MATLAB/Simulink and the outcomes show that using the new prepositioning method will lead to better driving sensation with less wrong motion sensation errors compared with the non and previous prepositioning methods.},

  abstract     = {Mobile-to-mobile channels often exhibit time-variant Doppler frequency shifts due to the movement of transmitter and receiver. An accurate description of the Doppler frequency turns out to be very difficult in Cartesian coordinates and any subsequent algebraic analysis of the Doppler frequency is intractable. In contrast to other approaches, we base our investigation on a geometric description of the Doppler frequency with the following three mathematical pillars: prolate spheroidal coordinate system, algebraic curve theory, and differential forms. The prolate spheroidal coordinate system is more appropriate to algebraically investigate the problem. After the transformation into the new coordinate system, the theory of algebraic curves is needed to resolve the ambiguities. Finally, the differential forms are required to derive the joint delay Doppler probability density function. This function is normalized by the equivalent ellipsoidal area of the scattering plane bounded by the delay ellipsoid. The results generalize in a natural way our previous model to a complete 3D description. Our solutions enable insight into the geometry of the Doppler frequency and we were able to derive a Doppler frequency that is dependent on the delay and the scattering plane. The presented theory allows describing any time-variant, single-bounce, mobile-to-mobile scattering channel.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the problem of vehicle traffic density estimation without relying on infrastructure cameras or sensors on the road. Previous infrastructure-less approaches still require some prior knowledge on the road infrastructure, e.g., via road topology map. We seek a lightweight estimation method based only on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, i.e., without using any prior knowledge. The main objective of this paper is to examine traffic density through simple yet efficient packet probing within a survey time period and obtain a snapshot of the traffic density distribution map. We propose an on-demand vehicle sampling algorithm that makes a probing packet at a vehicle (i.e., sampler) keep sampling to explore the local traffic density on a cell basis. If a current sampler does not operate as an efficient carrier, the packet selects another one as the next sampler via inner-relaying and outer-relaying procedures. To effectively adapt the level of granularity of traffic density depending on the remaining survey time, we present an adaptive cell sizing algorithm. Further, we extend the sampling activity to multiple vehicle samplers by making them aggregate their collected information and also negotiate their future areas to explore. Within a designated deadline, multiple samplers collaborate for more accurate and fast traffic density estimation. By doing so by iterations till the given survey deadline, we can gather a complete view of traffic density estimates based on multiple sources where some areas have more detailed information, whereas others do less. Experiments with a real trace-driven simulation demonstrate that our proposed algorithm effectively estimates the distribution of traffic density considering local traffic conditions compared to other counterpart algorithms, with a factor of up to 9.5.},

This letter proposes a media modulation based mMTC solution for increasing the throughput, where a massive multi-input multi-output based base station (BS) is used for enhancing the detection performance. For such a mMTC scenario, the reliable active device detection and data decoding pose a serious challenge. By leveraging the sparsity of the uplink access signals of mMTC received at the BS, a compressive sensing based massive access solution is proposed for tackling this challenge. Specifically, we propose a structured orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm for detecting the active devices, whereby the block-sparsity of the uplink access signals exhibited across the successive time slots and the structured sparsity of media-modulated symbols are exploited for enhancing the detection performance. Moreover, a successive interference cancellation based structured subspace pursuit algorithm is conceived for data demodulation of the active devices, whereby the structured sparsity of media modulation based symbols found in each time slot is exploited for improving the detection performance. Finally, our simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed scheme over state-of-the-art solutions.},

Furthermore, more and more information needs to ensure the transmission delay within a predefined bound. However, the satellite networks possess the time-varying characteristics and limited energy, which causes challenges for the low delay multicast design. In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient delay-bounded (EEDB) multicast problem to accomplish the multicast transmission within the given delay bound, but to consume energy as less as possible. Specially, with the help of the time-expanded graph (TEG), we construct the multicast time-expanded graph (MTEG) through introducing some auxiliary vertices and arcs to accurately depict the across-time multicast transmission and the “wireless multicast advantage”. Then, we formulate the EEDB multicast problem as one combinatorial optimization and propose an iterative heuristic algorithm to achieve the suboptimal multicast scheme. Simulation results are also presented to verify our proposed algorithm.},

First, they treat the two tasks separately, thus requiring high computational capabilities. Second, they perform data mining on the information collected from the data plane, which is unsuitable for the mobile edge. To bridge this gap, this paper properly tailors a Multi-Task Learning model running directly at the edge of the network to anticipate information on the type of traffic to be served and the resource allocation pattern requested by each service during its execution. Our study exploits data mining from the control channel of an operative mobile network to also reduce storage and monitoring processing. Different configurations of neural networks, which adopt autoencoders (i.e. Undercomplete Autoencoder or Sequence to Sequence Autoencoder) as key building blocks of the proposed Multi-Task Learning methodology for common feature representations, are investigated to evaluate the impact of the observation window of traffic profiles on the classification accuracy, prediction loss, complexity, and convergence. The comparison with respect to conventional single-task learning approaches, that do not use autoencoders and tackle classification and prediction tasks separately, clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed Multi-Task Learning approach under different system configurations.},

The process of energy harvesting and offloading span over multiple fading blocks. The target is to maximize the average amount of processed data in unit time. To achieve this target, we optimize the stopping rule for energy harvesting (i.e., when to stop energy harvesting and start offloading) and the number of fading blocks for data offloading. To solve the formulated problem optimally, we decompose it into two levels. In the lower level, the stopping rule for energy harvesting is optimized given a fixed number of fading blocks for offloading. The associated lower-level problem is solved optimally based on a series of special properties of the problem. In the upper level, the number of fading blocks for offloading is optimized. Efficiency of our work with fully offloading mode and partially offloading mode is shown by using simulation.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing-based traffic monitoring plays an important role in advanced traffic management systems due to its high accuracy and low costs, but it may expose drivers real identities and sensitive locations that results in the privacy leakage of drivers. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing-based traffic monitoring scheme that enables a transportation management center (TMC) to achieve traffic flow statistics at road intersections in an efficient, verifiable, and privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, by integrating a homomorphic encryption primitive and a super-increasing sequence, traffic flow can be flexibly structured and encrypted by drivers, i.e., each drivers travel direction at T-junctions or crossroads is protected. As a middle-ware between drivers and TMC, roadside units (RSUs) are introduced to aggregate and further perturb the aggregated encrypted traffic flow based on a differential privacy mechanism. In this way, TMC is capable of acquiring the traffic flow statistics by decrypting the perturbed encrypted traffic flow, without disclosing each individual drivers traffic information. In addition, based on a lightweight commitment proof, the correctness of the encrypted drivers data can be guaranteed, i.e., a selfish driver cannot arbitrarily manipulate his data to poison the aggregated traffic flow. Finally, security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme satisfies all desirable security properties, including confidentiality, verifiability, unlinkability, and traceability. Extensive simulations are also conducted to show that the proposed scheme is efficient in terms of low computation and communication costs.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed increasingly more uses of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms for rapidly providing wireless coverage to ground users. Each UAV is constrained in its energy storage and wireless coverage, and it consumes most energy on flying to the top of the target area, thus leaving limited leftover energy for hovering at its deployed position and keeping wireless coverage. The literature largely overlooks the sustainability issues of deploying UAV swarm and the UAV-to-UAV cooperation, and we aim to maximize the minimum leftover energy storage among all the UAVs after their deployment. Our new energy-saving deployment problem captures that each UAV&#39;s wireless coverage is adjustable by its service altitude, and also takes the no-fly-zone (NFZ) constraint into account. We show that a UAV with larger initial energy storage in the UAV swarm should be deployed further away from the UAV station, and we propose an optimal energysaving deployment algorithm by jointly balancing heterogeneous UAVs&#39; flying distances on the ground and final service altitudes in the sky. When n UAVs with different initial energy storages are dispatched from different initial locations, we prove this problem is NP-hard in general by reduction from partition problem. Despite of this, we propose to preserve the UAVs&#39; location order and successfully design an approximation algorithm of complexity n log1/g to arbitrarily approach the optimum with error e. Inspiring by this proposed (1 - ε)-approximation algorithm, we present a heuristic algorithm to solve the general case by balancing the efficiency and computation complexity well.},

In this work, we measure the timeliness of the status by the recently proposed age of information (AoI) metric. Different from the previous works about AoI, we consider the short packet feature of MTC in our system, where status packets will suffer from a significant packet error rate. Considering that the status packets may not be decoded by the receiver correctly, this work investigates the performance of MTC under traditional protocol (the sender discards the error status packets directly) and automatic repeat-request (ARQ) protocol (the sender retransmits the error status packets), and obtains the approximated closed-form expressions of the average AoI, respectively. Based on the closed-form expressions of the average AoI, we design two suboptimal blocklengths to minimize the average AoI under the two protocols. Numerical results verify the correctness of theoretical analysis, and show that the proposed scheme can achieve almost the same optimization performance as the exhaustive search method. Moreover, in the case of different packet generation rates, we find that the ARQ/traditional protocol can achieve better performance in low/high packet generation rate scenarios, respectively.},

In specific, we consider two types of vehicular content requests, i.e., location-based and popular contents, with different delay requirements. Both types of contents are encoded according to fountain code and cooperatively cached at multiple servers. The proposed scheme can be optimized by finding an optimal cooperative content placement that determines the placing locations and proportions for all contents. To this end, we first analyze the upper bound proportion of content caching at a single server, which is determined by both the downloading rate and the association duration when the vehicle drives through the server&#39;s coverage. For both types of contents, the respective theoretical analysis of transmission delay and service cost (including content caching and transmission cost) are provided. We then formulate an optimization problem of cooperative content placement to minimize the overall transmission delay and service cost. As the problem is a multi-objective multi-dimensional multi-choice knapsack problem, which is proved to be NP-hard, we devise an ant colony optimization-based algorithm to solve the problem and achieve a near-optimal solution. Simulation results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, including its convergence and optimality of caching, while guaranteeing low transmission delay and service cost.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the throughput stability of nonsaturated 802.11 networks with distributed coordination function (DCF). We find that this throughput stability exhibits distinct characteristics in two different regions (or scopes) of parameter settings: the maximum stable throughput is higher than the saturation throughput and lasts for a long duration (say, in order of months) in one region, while the former is bounded by the latter in another region. Our core contribution is an innovative approach (called SatOpt partition) that can identify these two regions quickly and accurately, by a comparison between the sat urated and opt imal attempt rates. Our partition approach is suitable for a wide range of 802.11 DCF contention window settings, while our partition result is unique. Further, for 802.11 DCF standard settings, we predict the maximum stable throughput successfully, and reveal that it is often higher than the saturation throughput. We verify our approach via the widely adopted 802.11 DCF ns2 simulator (mostly with typical 802.11 DCF standard settings). We speculate that this two-region stability property should be inherent for any random-access networks. This suggests that the research on the throughput-stability problem should differentiate regions of parameter settings and failing to do so might produce inconsistent results. This study is expected to take a critical step toward solving the throughput-stability problem.},

  abstract     = {Many rate adaptation (RA) solutions have been proposed for legacy Wi-Fi standards. However, these solutions lack extensibility, and cannot therefore be easily applied to new Wi-Fi standards such as IEEE 802.11ac. Furthermore, while several practical RA solutions have been proposed for IEEE 802.11ac network interface cards (NICs), e.g., Minstrel and Iwlwifi, they achieve poor goodput performance in some cases since they lack scalability or thoroughness. Given a large number of rates in IEEE 802.11ac, the lack of scalability results in a slow convergence on the search of the best rate over time. To accelerate the rate search, several RA solutions skip some rates to narrow down the scope of candidate rates, but lack thoroughness and may miss the best rate. Accordingly, the present study proposes a holistic RA solution, designated as Machine Learning-based RA (MLRA), which is not only practical, but also extensible, scalable and thorough. MLRA achieves the extensible property by leveraging machine learning to automatically identify the correlations among the rate, goodput performance and link quality. Moreover, it achieves the scalable and thorough properties using a two-level rate search procedure and a congestion detector. The performance of MLRA is evaluated on commodity IEEE 802.11ac NICs using TensorFlow with an asynchronous framework implemented across the kernel and user spaces of the operating system. The results show that MLRA outperforms other practical RAs by up to around 133.0%-658.0% with a negligible overhead.},

However, secure access control and incentive design are rarely taken into account in existing solutions. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure access control (ESAC) scheme for content delivery in V-NDN. Specifically, we construct the proxy re-encryption method to achieve access control and data confidentiality, while using pseudonyms and the identity-based signature to ensure anonymous authentication and content integrity. Furthermore, the revocation of illegal vehicles and updating operations are performed by the constructed proxy re-encryption method, which significantly reduces communication overhead. Finally, an incentive scheme is designed to improve the utility of NDN in VANETs. The security analysis shows that ESAC can meet the security requirements of the content delivery in VANETs while significantly lowering the overhead.},

In recent years, it has drawn considerable attention due to its potential application in the fields of fatigue driving detection, vital sign monitoring, human-computer interaction, etc. State-of-the-art work has achieved excellent sensing performance when there is one target only. However, when there are multiple targets need to be sensed simultaneously, the influenced signals from different targets will be mixed together, and thus traditional DFWS methods will fail. There still lacks an effective system solution to this problem. Inspired by the multiplexing mechanisms utilized in communication systems, in this paper, we explore and exploit the idea of separating and extracting the influenced signal from each target by leveraging three novel multiplexing mechanisms, i.e., angle division multiplexing sensing, range division multiplexing sensing, and source division multiplexing sensing, and thus realize multi-target DFWS accordingly. Meanwhile, we also give theory analysis on the sensing capability of the proposed multiplexing mechanism based multi-target sensing systems. Furthermore, taking multi-target vital sign monitoring as a case study, we develop a 77 GHz FMCW hardware based prototype system, and evaluate the proposed mechanisms extensively. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Aided by scalable video coding, multirate multicast has become a promising technique of providing differentiated quality of experience (QoE) for massive numbers of video subscribers operating in heterogeneous channel conditions. Nevertheless, due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels and the subscribers’ diverse requirements, it is challenging to dynamically control the video rate in the light of the available radio resource to achieve the best QoE. To elaborate a little further, the time scale of resource scheduling is of short-term nature, which determines the short-term video quality variation, but from a service provider&#39;s perspective the design objective is to optimize the long-term QoE for all subscribers. Despite its importance, this problem has not been considered before. Explicitly, we formulated this problem as a time-averaged stochastic optimization problem which avoids the impact of both the short-term channel quality fluctuation and that of the video bitrates, whilst maintaining both inter- and intra- group fairness. The stratified structure of the problem inspires us to decompose it into a two-phase optimization: coarse grained assignment for each user group and fine grained assignment for each subgroup. We propose an adaptive multicast algorithm based on Lyapunov&#39;s optimization theory for solving this problem, by striking a compelling trade-off between the system&#39;s utility and its queue stability. We quantify the achievable performance of our proposed solution based on realistic video traces.},

However, due to the differences among the performance of UTDs, and the resource limitation of MEC servers, the joint optimization between the offloading decisions of UTDs and the allocation of resources in network is still a focus of the research. This paper studies the joint computation offloading and resource allocation strategy in multi-user and multi-server scenarios. Firstly, we formulate the joint optimization problem of computation offloading and resource allocation as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP) problem to minimize the energy consumption of UTDs, by constraining the offloading decision, channel selection, power allocation and resource allocation. Secondly, we propose a two-stage heuristic optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which divides the joint optimization problem of computation offloading and resource allocation in two stages. Based on the coupling relationship between the offloading decision and the resource allocation scheme, we iteratively update the solution of the problem, and finally obtain the stable convergence solution of the optimization problem. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with other classical methods to prove the effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the problem of Stable Global Broadcasting (SGB) with continuous packet injections at a source node has attracted considerable attention and much work has been carried out. However, existing SGB algorithms are all centralized and under the graph-based interference model. How to achieve efficient distributed SGB under the more realistic Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) interference model is still an open issue. In this paper, we focus on the design of distributed SGB algorithms for multi-channel wireless multi-hop networks under the SINR model. We first present an efficient Backbone-based Multi-channel Concurrent Scheduling (BMCS) strategy and prove an upper bound of $1/2$ packets/slot for the broadcast capacity (i.e., the maximum supportable packet injection rate for all possible SGB algorithms). By iterating the BMCS strategy in different ways, we present two distributed SGB algorithms, one for deterministic packet injection model corresponding to the broadcast capacity (called SGB-DPI) and another for stochastic packet injection model (called SGB-SPI). We prove that: 1) both SGB-DPI and SGB-SPI meet the queue stability and latency stability constraints for providing stable global broadcasting services, and 2) SGB-DPI is throughput-optimal. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms through simulations. The simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and also show that even under the stochastic packet injection model, SGB-DPI has a comparable and even better throughput performance than SGB-SPI.},

  abstract     = {Recent developments and advancements in wireless networks have brought about new challenges including the backhaul bottleneck and content download latency. The paper focuses on an enterprise wireless network consisting of various candidate caching nodes to serve users&#39; requests such as Femto Access Points (FAPs) and Mobile Users (MUs), supported by Device-to-Device (D2D) communications. Due to the fact that user&#39;s mobility is one of the inherent features of massive wireless networks, where FAPs operate in an open access mode, the small transmission range of FAPs leads to triggering frequent handovers. Taking the above challenges into account, we propose a novel Mobility-Aware Femtocaching scheme based on Handover (MAFH). To implement a real wireless network, a random walk model as the mobility pattern of users is utilized within the proposed scheme. In this regard, the best caching node is selected by considering the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value and the velocity of users as decision criteria to extend the time interval between two consecutive handovers and increase the battery life of devices. The effectiveness of the proposed MAFH algorithm is evaluated in terms of the cache hit ratio, transferred byte volume, connecting time, content delivery time, the number of handovers, and the energy consumption of clients. Based on the simulation results, the proposed MAFH framework illustrates significant performance improvements in companion to its counterparts across all the aforementioned aspects.},

  abstract     = {Human mobility prediction techniques are instrumental for many important applications including service management and city planning. Previous work looks at the inherent patterns of a user&#39;s historical trajectories to predict his/her future location. Such method suffers when only a small number of historical locations are available, which is a main challenge for mobility prediction on sparse trajectory datasets. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning based algorithm to predict users’ mobility by learning the mobility behaviors of different users at the same time and exploiting the similarities among them to overcome the sparse issue and improve the prediction performance. Specifically, we use a Bayesian mixture model to describe users’ spatio-temporal mobility patterns, where we introduce a novel von Mises distribution to model the temporal distribution of users’ mobility to better preserve its continuity across time. Then, we use the hierarchical Dirichlet process to perform joint prediction of all users’ mobility. This model allows us to leverage similar mobility patterns among users to improve the prediction performance for users with sparse trajectory data. We conduct extensive evaluations using data collected by a cellular network operator and mobile applications. Our evaluations show that our algorithms achieve prediction accuracy of 53.9% on average and 73.2% for users with high-quality mobility data, with the performance gap over 8.7% on average compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

In order to mitigate interferences, we incorporate base station (BS) idling into our analysis. Under the random caching framework, we derive the association probability for each tier as well as the successful transmission probability (STP) by utilizing stochastic geometry and taking the blockage effect into account. In addition, we adopt the Convex-Concave Procedure (CCP) to obtain the locally optimal caching probabilities and propose a two-stage scheme to obtain the globally optimal caching probabilities under the special case where the blockage parameters for K tiers are sufficiently small. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional caching strategies such as Most Popular Content (MPC) and Uniform Caching (UC) and the truncated Zipf distribution-based caching schemes.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many satellites are being launched for providing global internet broadband service to individual consumers. Since satellites and users could move separately, providing seamless connectivity has become one of the most important tasks for mobile satellite networks. Current handover methods are based on either signal strength or service time, however, due to the randomness of user terminal (UT) arrivals and the unbalanced traffic distribution for high-mobility satellite networks, the success rate can hardly be guaranteed. To this end, we propose a QoE-driven intelligent handover mechanism for user-centric mobile satellite networks, through which the access satellites can be selected by predicted service time and communication channel resources. Accordingly, to ensure the service duration, a spatial relationship coupling model is proposed to predict relative motion pattern between UT and satellites; To improve the effectiveness of handover, an available channel estimation model is then developed based on the mobility pattern of adjacent satellites. Finally, reinforcement learning is adopted to maximize the UT &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$^\prime$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; s Quality of Experience (QoE) through predicted handover factors.

  abstract     = {A tri-polarized antenna with diverse radiation characteristics is proposed in this paper. This design mainly consists of two pairs of loop radiating dipoles and an omnidirectional monopole antenna element, which are used for the fifth generation (5G) and vehicle to everything (V2X) communications, respectively. By adding eight pairs of inverted L-shaped patches with unequal sizes around the proposed dipoles, wide beamwidths in both E- and H-planes can be obtained across the desired lower and upper frequency bands. Furthermore, by employing eight fork-shaped microstrip stubs to combine the circular monopole antenna element and the L-shaped patches, the flare angle of the conical beam can be increased to 180°, which results in gain enhancement in the azimuth plane. Finally, the proposed loop radiating dipoles are excited by a pair of symmetrical differentially-fed feeding lines. Consequently, high port isolation for the proposed loop radiating dipoles as well as low gain variations for the monopole antenna element can be achieved. Measured results show that the impedance bandwidths of 32.84% (2.8-3.9 GHz) and 18.18% (4.5-5.4 GHz) can be achieved for the 5G communications. Wide half power beamwidths (HPBW) of larger than 103° in E-plane and 91° in H-plane can be achieved across the operating bands. In addition, a bandwidth of 5.5% (5.82-6.15 GHz) with gain of 2.47 ± 0.69 dBi in the azimuth plane can also be obtained for V2X communications.},

But most constructions of polar codes in fading channel are only suitable for the Rayleigh fading and involve complex iterative-calculation. In this paper, we establish a systematic framework in term of the polar spectrum to analyze and construct polar codes in various fast fading channels, such as Rician, Rayleigh and Nakagami channels. In these three fading channels, by using the polar spectrum, we derive the upper bound of the error probability of the polarized channel and that of block error rate of polar codes. The analysis based on the polar spectrum explicitly reveals the relationship between the diversity order and the codeword weight. Furthermore, we propose two construction metrics, named logarithmic upper-bound weight (LUW) and minimum-weight LUW (MLUW) respectively, to design the polar codes in fast fading channels. These two constructions are simple with a linear complexity and explicit for the practical implementation. In addition, for various fading channels, they can construct polar codes with similar or better performance over those based on traditional methods.},

To maximize the users&#39; sum-rate, we formulate a optimization problem, in which the UAV deployment position and the power control are jointly optimized subject to the transmission power constraints and the quality of service (QoS) constraints. However, this problem is a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem and thus it is difficult to solve directly. Therefore, we first transform the non-convex optimization problem into a convex one based on the first-order approximation technique and the penalty function method. Then, a successive convex approximate (SCA) technique based iterative algorithm as well as its initialization scheme are developed to find a suboptimal solution to the original problem. Afterwards, a low-complexity approximate algorithm is proposed to reduce the high computational complexity of the iterative algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed iterative algorithm and low-complexity approximate algorithm can achieve a similar performance, and they can efficiently improve the sum-rate compared with OMA scheme and conventional NOMA scheme.},

In this paper, we propose and evaluate the use of UAVs traveling over the area of interest to relieve congestion in 5G+ systems under spontaneous traffic fluctuations. To this end, we assess two inherently different offloading schemes, named routed and controlled UAV `bridging&#39;. Using the tools of renewal theory and stochastic geometry, we analytically characterize these schemes in terms of the fraction of traffic demand that can be offloaded onto the UAV `bridge&#39; as our parameter of interest. This framework accounts for the unique features of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio propagation and city deployment types with potential line-of-sight (LoS) link blockage by buildings. We also introduce enhancements to the proposed schemes that significantly improve the offloading gains. Our findings offer evidence that the UAV `bridges&#39; may be used for efficient traffic offloading in various urban scenarios.},

Subsequently, it is shown that an equivalent source vector can be obtained by squaring any row of the noise-free signal covariance matrix, irrespective of the coherency between the signals. Finally, an improved sparse representation, which enhances signal sparsity via utilizing a designed weight vector, is derived to determine the DOAs of the signals.

Then, an iterative difference-of-two-convex-function (D.C.) algorithm is proposed by applying the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach. To further reduce the computational complexity, a sub-optimal alternating D.C. (ADC) algorithm is devised by decoupling beamforming and mapping the AN to the null space of legitimate users. In the ADC algorithm, optimal null space and beamforming vectors are alternately solved by convex programming. Furthermore, the convergence of the proposed D.C. and ADC algorithms is derived.

Thus, in this paper, we propose a power allocation (PA) scheme for NOMA-UAV networks with circular trajectory, to maximize the sum rate of common users while guaranteeing the security for a specific user. To achieve this, we consider three cases based on the distance from the UAV to the secure user. Specifically, the lowest transmit power is assigned to the secure user in each time slot to guarantee its security, with the remaining power allocated to common users to maximize their sum rate. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we analyze its monotonicity and derive the closed-form solutions for these three cases. To further improve the transmission rate of the secure user, we also derive the upper bound for its decoding threshold, and analyze the linear relationship between the secure decoding threshold and the sum rate of common users. Simulation results are demonstrated to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed secure PA scheme in NOMA-UAV networks.},

A joint optimization of power allocation and beamforming is important to maximize the secrecy rate to the closer receiver, while keeping the requested data rate of the farther receiver unaffected. The optimization problem is challenging because of coupled variables, and has yet to be addressed. We propose to decouple the problem between subcarrier power allocation and beamforming. Given beamforming, we prove the subcarrier power allocation for the two receivers can be equivalently transformed to two convex problems with waterfilling structures and closed-form solutions. Given power allocation, beamforming can be decoupled between subcarriers by distributing the rate requirement of the farther receiver across the subcarriers. The per-subcarrier beamforming is convexified by applying semidefinite relaxation and the Dinkelbach method. Simulations show the proposed approach can outperform its existing alternatives in terms of secrecy rate, and holistic designs of power allocation and beamforming are critical.},

The design consists of four identical vertically-polarized monopole-based antenna elements, which are symmetrical about the central axis and are placed 90 degrees apart from each other. The wideband and decoupling features are theoretically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated. Four resonant frequencies are created by the F-shaped radiator, independent reflector and cross-π-shaped structure, which increase the MIMO antenna bandwidth. Parasitic stubs further improve the impedance matching in the high-frequency band. The cross-π-shaped structure acts as a decoupling function and reduces the mutual coupling, which is realized by using two metal strips shorted to the ground plane, perpendicular to each other. The etched slots further improve port isolation. The effects of imitated perfect vehicle metallic surface are also analyzed. The proposed MIMO antenna prototype is fabricated and measured to verify the concept of design. The operating frequency band is from 1.95 GHz to 6.25 GHz with a reflection coefficient of better than −10 dB, where the realized gain is higher than 3.3 dBi, and the maximum value is 6.16 dBi at 2.6 GHz.

  abstract     = {Predictive resource allocation (PRA) can leverage machine learning and historical data to boost the performance of mobile networks, say to support high throughput or improve the quality of service. While the large gain of PRA has been demonstrated by assuming perfect prediction or by optimizing with modeled prediction errors, how the prediction errors translate to the performance loss of PRA and how the future information should be predicted are not well understood. In this paper, we consider high throughput PRA policy for non-real-time (NRT) mobile users when the base stations also serve real-time (RT) users, where the future average rates of NRT users in a prediction window need to be predicted. The average rate can be predicted in various ways, where one typical way is to predict the rate directly from the historical average rates and another typical way is to predict the rate indirectly by first predicting traffic load and user trajectory. Given that the traffic load and user location can be gathered easily in cellular networks, we consider such an indirect prediction and analyze the impact of prediction errors of traffic load and trajectory on the prediction errors of average data rate. To this end, we first find the relation between the RT traffic load and the residual bandwidth after serving the RT users by resorting to effective capacity and effective bandwidth theory. To further justify why we analyze the indirect prediction, we compare the predictability of the time series used for the typical direct prediction and indirect prediction with entropy theory. Since different machine learning techniques lead to different prediction bias and prediction error variance, we then derive the relation between the prediction error statistics of the average data rate and those of traffic load and trajectory. We evaluate the performance loss of PRA using both modeled prediction errors and real predictions with deep learning. Our analyses show that for a network busy with RT service, the prediction errors of RT traffic load have larger impact on those of average data rate than the prediction errors of trajectory. The prediction bias has a larger impact on the throughput loss of PRA than the prediction error variance. This provides a guidance of designing learning techniques for predicting the required information.},

The joint problem of energy harvesting and resource allocation in EH-based D2D Communication Networks (EH-DCNs) is a challenge issue. In this paper, we investigate the joint problem of resource allocation and EH time slot allocation of DUEs in EH-DCNs, where the DUEs harvest energy and multiplex Cellular User Equipments (CUEs) uplink resources. A channel assignment, power allocation and EH time slot allocation problem in EH-DCNs is formulated. The goal is to maximize energy-and spectral-efficiency with α-fairness while guaranteeing the EH constraints of DUEs and the quality of service of CUEs. The formulated problem is a non-convex mixed integer multi-objective optimization problem. In order to solve the formulated problem, the multi-objective optimization problem is transformed into a single-objective optimization problem based on the weight sum method. We propose a joint iterative algorithm based on Lagrangian dual decomposition for α &gt; 0 and α = 0, respectively. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher energy efficiency and spectral efficiency for different network parameter settings.},

  abstract     = {Device-to-device (D2D) communications are becoming a promising technology to support ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). This paper incorporates contention-based access scheme into radio resource management (RRM), which can not only deal with the sporadic packet arrivals for URLLC-oriented D2D communications, but also avoid wasting time on sending requests and waiting for feedback. However, it cannot be ignored that the collisions may occur to yield transmission failure, especially when two or more users access the same resource block (RB). Thus, we should pay more attention to optimizing users’ RB selection to foster strengths and offset weaknesses of introducing contention-based access scheme, and thereby improve the transmission reliability within the latency budget. Specifically, we formulate the contention-based RRM as an optimization problem which aims to maximize the sum successful transmission probability (STP) of all D2D pairs under the strict latency constraint. Due to its intractability, this optimization problem is transformed into a mixed strategy non-cooperative game, which is proved to be an exact potential game with the sum STP as its potential function. Accordingly, the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) can be guaranteed, and importantly, the optimal integral solution to the optimization problem constitutes a pure strategy NE of the game. Moreover, we propose a distributed RB selection algorithm based on sequential spatial adaptive play (S-SAP), which can converge to the optimal pure strategy NE of the proposed game. The numerical results verify the convergence and optimality of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The fast proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) exacerbates the current spectrum shortage. As a promising solution, licensed spectrum sharing has received great attentions recently. However, due to the unpredictable activities of incumbent users, the availability of the shared spectrum is uncertain, making the quality of service (QoS) provisioning based on it a difficult task, especially under multi-hop scenarios. In this paper, considering the energy-efficiency issue, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) QoS guaranteed green traffic off-loading scheme over the uncertain shared spectrums in multi-hop networks. Specifically, we formulate it into a two-step problem, an off-loaded traffic maximization (OTM) problem and an energy-efficiency improvement (EEI) problem. The former one is to determine the admitted sessions. To achieve the E2E QoS guarantee under the uncertain spectrum supply, we develop a concept of equivalent link capacity, and construct a risk-averse joint chance constraint. Since the formulated problem is intractable, we first develop a data-driven conservative transformation to make the joint chance constraint a set of deterministic individual ones. Then, we design a convex-hull-based and a substitution-based linearization approach to make all the constraints tractable. For the second step, the EEI problem with the same constraints as the OTM problem is designed to refine the resource scheduling for the admitted sessions to optimize the energy-efficiency. To deal with the fractional-form energy-efficiency objective, a Dinkelbach method based iterative algorithm is further developed. Numerical results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

The existing pseudo analog systems are optimized under the minimum mean squared error criterion. However, their power allocation strategies do not take the perceptual video quality into consideration. In this article, we propose a human-perception-based pseudo analog video transmission system named ROIC-Cast, which aims to intelligently enhance the transmission quality of the region-of-interest (ROI) parts. Firstly, the classic deep learning based saliency detection algorithm is adopted to decompose the continuous video sequences into ROI and non-ROI blocks. Secondly, an effective compression method is used to reduce the data amount of side information generated by the ROI extraction module. Then, the power allocation scheme is formulated as a convex problem, and the optimal transmission power for both ROI and non-ROI blocks is derived in a closed form. Finally, the simulations are conducted to validate the proposed system by comparing with a few of existing systems, e.g., KMV-Cast, SoftCast, and DAC-RAN. The proposed ROIC-Cast can achieve over 4.1 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio gains of ROI compared with other systems, given the channel signal-to-noise ratio as -5 dB, 0 dB, 5 dB, and 10 dB, respectively. This significant performance improvement is due to the automatic ROI extraction, high-efficiency data compression as well as adaptive power allocation.},

  abstract     = {Information dissemination in mobile networks turns out to be a problem when the network is sparse. Mobile networks begin to establish a separate cluster attributable to the limited communication range of terminals. The multi-beam satellite communication systems can play a significant role in providing direct-to-user satellite mobile services and connecting the separated clusters. This paper focuses on how to efficiently schedule limited satellite-based radio resources to enhance transmission efficiency and meet the requested traffic with low complexity. Taking the inter-beam interference and resource utilization variance into consideration, we build a game-theoretic based model for bandwidth allocation in the forward link. As the size of satellite beams increases, the size of the action space for deep reinforcement learning based on a single agent becomes large, resulting in high time complexity. Thus, we extend the single-agent deep reinforcement learning to the multi-agent context and then propose a cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method to achieve the optimal bandwidth allocation strategy. Each beam works as a player who is willing to satisfy the request traffic with flexible payloads. We built a multi-beam satellite platform using real historical data. The experimental results show that this approach is capable of enhancing transmission efficiency and can be flexible to achieve the desired goal with low complexity.},

  abstract     = {To meet the exponentially increasing air traffic, L-band (960--1164 MHz) digital aeronautical communication system (LDACS) has been introduced. The LDACS aims to exploit the vacant spectrum between incumbent Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) signals and envisioned to follow an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) approach to support high-speed delay-sensitive multimedia services. This paper deals with the design and implementation of end-to-end LDACS the transceiver on the Zynq System on Chip platform, consisting of FPGA as programmable logic (PL) and ARM as processing system (PS). We consider OFDM based LDACS and improve it further using windowing and/or filtering. We propose a hardware-software co-design approach and analyze various transceiver configurations by dividing it into PL and PS. We demonstrate the flexibility offered by such a co-design approach to choose the configuration as well as word-length for a given area, delay and power constraints. The transceiver is also integrated with the programmable analog front-end to validate its functionality in the presence of various RF impairments and wireless channels and interference specific to the LDACS environment. Via in-depth performance analysis concerning parameters such as out-of-band attenuation, DME interference, bit-error-rate, word-length, and complexity, we demonstrate wide bandwidth filtered OFDM as an attractive solution for the next generation LDACS.},

  abstract     = {The simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has recently attracted much attention since both information and energy are integrated within radio frequency signals, which is considered to be one of the most important technologies for future networks. However, security becomes one of the most critical issues in SWIPT networks due to its broadcasting features over wireless media and the transferring requirements for strong signal strength. To improve the security of SWIPT networks, in this paper, a SWIPT system enabled by full-duplex (FD) jamming is proposed, where an FD energy-limited receiver with the power splitting (PS) structure, powered by a transmitter, generates jamming signals. Both linear and nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) models are considered. To evaluate the secrecy throughput (ST) of the system, we derive the closed-form connection outage probability and secrecy outage probability for the proposed PS-based scheme in the delay-constrained transmission (DCT) mode. The ST is maximized by optimizing the PS ratio based on the asymptotic cases of the high signal-to-noise ratio as well as the perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC). Besides, the exact integral forms of the ergodic secrecy capacity and their closed-form lower bounds are presented for both the PS-based and the time switching (TS)-based schemes in the delay-tolerant transmission (DTT) mode. Simulation results suggest that the PS-based scheme outperforms the TS-based scheme for the DTT mode. For the DCT mode, the PS-based scheme can achieve better performance than the TS-based scheme only in low target communication rate, small PS/TS ratio, high transmit power, and weak path loss. Meanwhile, given a tolerable amount of SIC, the ST obtained in the linear EH model is higher than that achieved in the nonlinear EH model.},

  abstract     = {Timely and reliable information sharing among autonomous vehicles (AVs) provides a promising approach for reducing traffic congestion and improving traffic efficiency in future intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, we consider millimeter-wave (mmWave) based multi-hop vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to facilitate ultra-reliable low-latency information sharing among AVs. We propose a novel framework for performance analysis and design of relay selection schemes in mmWave multi-hop V2V communications, while taking into account the mmWave signal propagation characteristics, road topology, and traffic conditions. In particular, considering the minimum tracking distance requirement of road traffic, the headway, i.e., the distance between adjacent AVs, is modeled as shifted-exponential distribution. Moreover, we model the communication path losses using the Manhattan distance metric in the taxicab geometry, which can more accurately capture the characteristics of mmWave signal propagation in urban grid roads than conventional Euclidean distance geometry. Based on the proposed model, we investigate the latency and reliability of mmWave multi-hop V2V communications for three widely adopted relay selection schemes, i.e., random with forward progress (RFP), most forward with fixed radius (MFR), and nearest with forward progress (NFP), respectively. Furthermore, we propose a novel relay selection scheme for joint optimization of the single-hop forward progress (FP) and single-hop latency according to the AVs&#39; instantaneous locations and an estimate of the residual multi-hop latency. Simulation results show that, by balancing the current single-hop latency and the residual multi-hop latency for the multi-hop V2V network, the proposed relay selection scheme significantly outperforms the MFR, NFP and RFP in both multi-hop transmission latency and reliability of mmWave V2V communications.},

The optimization model is established with the aim of improving the sum of weighted posterior Cramer-Rao lower bounds (PCRLBs) of multiple targets, which is predicted based on the feedback information in the tracking recursive cycle, subject to the limited power and bandwidth budget. By exploiting the convex relaxation technique and the cycle minimizer, this problem is transformed into a two-stage convex problem, and an efficient solution is provided using the cyclical optimization framework.

  abstract     = {This article considers the dual-use unimodular signal design for a novel dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) architecture. The information of downlink communication is modulated via the ambiguity function (AF) sidelobe nulling in the prescribed range-Doppler cells. At the same time, the sidelobe around the AF mainlobe is suppressed to ensure the radar detection performance. User equipment (UE) computes the AF of the received signal to make a judgment of the position of nulling for achieving demodulation. To this end, an objective function to evaluate the depth of nulling in AF is developed as figure of merit accounting for the worst-case sidelobe level ratio over the range-Doppler cells of interest. The resultant design is very challenging to solve due to the non-convex and non-smooth quartic fractional objective function and the NP-hard constant modulus constraint. Herein, we develop a fractional-alternating direction penalty method (FADPM) algorithm that invokes the fractional program theory and the ADPM framework. Specifically, we formulate a new ADPM form through introducing an auxiliary variable and resorting to the Dinkelbach&#39;s procedure. In each iteration, we transform the original quartic fractional program into two quadratic optimization subproblems both of which are approximated successively through a series of convex subproblems. We also provide the analytical convergence guarantee of the proposed FADPM algorithm. The simulation results verify the performance of the proposed algorithm and exhibit the effectiveness of the DFRC framework in modulation and demodulation process guaranteeing that a high data rate is achievable.},

But the lack of intrinsic security mechanisms makes FlexRay vulnerable to spoofing and DoS attacks while existing features are not sufficient to assure reliable communication in the presence of adversaries. Since adding cryptography mandates for secret shared keys, providing secure key establishment techniques is critical in assuring the intended security objectives. In this paper we propose a backward compatible key agreement scheme for FlexRay communication based on intrinsic characteristics of the FlexRay physical layer. In particular, we determine that the symbol window is suitable for implementing a covert channel based on physical properties of the bus which allows us to bootstrap a secure session key between two nodes or to re-enforce existing shared keys. We evaluate and discuss the performance of software-based implementations of the proposed mechanism on two different automotive embedded platforms relying only on the application level.},

Assuming average-based resource allocation, we propose a multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP) approach to deal with the EE and SE maximization problem. Specifically, the formulated MOOP results in the maximization of the total ergodic sum rate of the D2D users and the minimization of the total average transmit power of the D2D transmitters. Two practical scenarios are considered, i.e., a limited interference scenario, which includes the sparsely deployed scenario, and a densely deployed scenario, where for each scenario the maximum achievable EE and SE are derived. Specifically, considering the limited interference scenario, an upper bound is imposed on the received interference across different D2D communications, and closed-form expressions for the optimal power allocation, ergodic sum rate, and maximum EE are obtained. In the general, densely deployed scenario, however, the cross D2D network interference needs to be taken into account. We provide an optimal solution for the power control based on sequential fractional programming to tradeoff between complexity and performance gain. Simulation results unveil an interesting tradeoff to strike a balance between EE and SE.},

D2D links share spectrum resources of cellular users or dedicated mm-wave sub-channel. Densely deployed small cells scenario provides an ideal platform to implement mm-wave, FD and D2D communications. With large bandwidths available, mm-wave has the potential to meet the expected extreme data rate demands. Leveraging highly directional beamforming, severe transmission loss and the blockage phenomenon of mm-wave can be alleviated. Theoretically, FD communications can double the spectral efficiency due to bi-directional communications with the same spectral and temporal resources. However, such benefit comes at the cost of residual self-interference (RSI). Multi-user interference (MUI) and RSI among network uplink, downlink and D2D links are the main challenges. In the paper, we formulate an optimization problem for FD access and D2D links sub-channel allocation underlaying HCNs combining sub-6 GHz and mm-wave bands to make the system transmission rate maximized. Then, a scheme based on the coalition formation game is proposed to deal with this challenging NP-complete optimization. Finally, performance evaluation investigates the suitable conditions for FD and HD operations. Under different network parameter settings, we quantify associated performance of proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Current cellular systems use pilot-aided statistical-channel state information (S-CSI) estimation and limited feedback schemes to aid in link adaptation and scheduling decisions. However, in the presence of pulsed radar signals, pilot-aided S-CSI is inaccurate since interference statistics on pilot and non-pilot resources can be different. Moreover, the channel will be bimodal as a result of the periodic interference. In this paper, we propose a max-min heuristic to estimate the post-equalizer SINR in the case of non-pilot pulsed radar interference, and characterize its distribution as a function of noise variance and interference power. We observe that the proposed heuristic incurs low computational complexity, and is robust beyond a certain SINR threshold for different modulation schemes, especially for QPSK. This enables us to develop a comprehensive semi-blind framework to estimate the wideband SINR metric that is commonly used for S-CSI quantization in 3GPP Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and New Radio (NR) networks. Finally, we propose dual CSI feedback for practical radar-cellular spectrum sharing, to enable accurate CSI acquisition in the bimodal channel. We demonstrate significant improvements in throughput, block error rate and retransmission-induced latency for LTE-Advanced Pro when compared to conventional pilot-aided S-CSI estimation and limited feedback schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the problem of distributed coherent beamforming in wireless networks where multiple distributed transmitters adjust the phases of their signals to form a directional and targeted communication link to a client receiver. The quality-of-service (QoS) and security are key components of robust and secure wireless networks. Although the security can be improved by exploiting information about potential adversaries, such information may not be available in practical networks since the adversaries are often passive. Therefore, we introduce transmission strategies which not only send a confidential message by forming a beam towards the client but also broadcast interference with the aim of obfuscating adversaries without having any information about them. Since the interference may degrade the QoS of the client, the transmitters radiating the interference steer a null to the client to alleviate the interference. We develop two algorithms. The first assumes that a subset of the transmitters send the confidential message in the direction of the client via coherent beamforming. Then, the others transmit interference while creating a null towards the client. In the second, each node transmits both the confidential message and interference simultaneously. Two different client feedback scenarios are considered, two-bit and rich feedback. Both of the proposed algorithms can be performed in a fully distributed manner without any knowledge about potential adversaries. Numerical simulations in both microwave and low-very high frequency (low-VHF) bands validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a full-duplex unmanned aerial vehicle-(UAV) base station is used to provide wireless communication to an area lacking a conventional terrestrial infrastructure, and its efficient deployment is investigated. More concretely, the UAV positioning and resource allocation problems are solved with the aim of minimizing the transmit power of the UAV, while serving users with their rate requirements and accounting for the backhaul limitation of the UAV. To this end, a complete solution for the optimal 3D position of the UAV, the bandwidth assignment and the transmit power distribution in the access and backhaul links is proposed that accounts for both the backhaul interference and the self-interference. When the UAV power budget is insufficient to fulfill rate requirements, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) pairing is conducted to enhance system performance. Simulation results show that, when using the proposed approach, both the achieved sum rate and the percentage of satisfied users are significantly increased, when compared to a strategy that uses separate frequency bands in the access and backhaul links, as well as to a previously proposed method.},

The use of waveforms that lack orthogonality leads to possible harmful effects in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar and distributed coherent aperture radar (DCAR). For the purpose of enhancing the orthogonality of the signal, a multi-pulse joint transmission strategy of polyphase signal and the corresponding echo signal processing algorithm based on sliding window are proposed. We further analyze the relationship between the degradation of detection performance and the step size of the sliding window. In addition, the Doppler tolerance of the signal is also derived.

  abstract     = {Future railway is expected to accommodate both train operation services and passenger broadband services. The millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is a promising technology in providing multi-gigabit data rates to onboard users. However, mmWave communications suffer from severe propagation attenuation and vulnerability to blockage, which can be very challenging in high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. In this paper, we investigate efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) design for train-to-ground communications. First, we develop a two-stage HBF algorithm in blockage-free scenarios. In the first stage, the minimum mean square error method is adopted for optimal hybrid beamformer design with low complexity and fast convergence; in the second stage, the orthogonal matching pursuit method is utilized to approximately recover the analog and digital beamformers. Second, in blocked scenarios, we design an anti-blockage scheme by adaptively invoking the proposed HBF algorithm, which can efficiently deal with random blockages. Extensive simulation results are presented to show the sum rate performance of the proposed algorithms under various configurations, including transmission power, velocity of the train, blockage probability, etc. It is demonstrated that the proposed anti-blockage algorithm can improve the effective rate by 20% in severely-blocked scenarios while maintaining low outage probability.},

In addition, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the grid currents will increase correspondingly. In this paper, the coupling mechanism between the DC bus voltage ripple and the grid harmonic currents is revealed. Based on the situation above, a grid harmonic current suppression method is proposed. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has the advantages in the following three aspects. Firstly, the proposed method does not require either the extraction of positive/negative sequence or the positive/negative sequence current control, which can highly reduce the complexity of the system. Secondly, the grid current harmonics can be reduced by an improved proportional quasi resonant (IPQR) controller. Thirdly, the IPQR controller has little effect on the parameter design of the control system, which facilitates the control design. Finally, the experiments show the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Then, by using numerical methods, the thermal stress of the rotor is calculated and compared with the 3-D FEA methods. To improve the mechanical strength of the rotor, the size of the screw, lug boss and filler is optimized, meanwhile, the rotor loss is optimized and thermal stress is evaluated. The results show that the proposed modular fabrication method demonstrates the improved mechanical strength and material utilization rate compared with the conventional fabrication process. Based on the three-dimensional finite-element analysis (3-D FEA) results, a 100 kW HESM prototype is successfully designed and manufactured using the proposed modular magnetic-shunting rotor. The experimental tests validate the effectiveness of the modular fabrication method and mechanical strength analysis.},

  abstract     = {Unlike micro aerial vehicles, most mobile robots have non-holonomic constraints, which makes lateral movement impossible. Consequently, the vision-based navigation systems that perform accurate visual feature initialization by moving the camera to the side to ensure a sufficient parallax of the image are degraded when applied to mobile robots. Generally, to overcome this difficulty, a motion model based on wheel encoders mounted on a mobile robot is used to predict the pose of a robot, but it is difficult to cope with errors caused by wheel slip or inaccurate wheel calibration. In this study, we propose a robust autonomous navigation system that uses only a stereo inertial sensor and does not rely on wheel-based dead reckoning. The observation model of the line feature modified with vanishing-points is applied to the visual-inertial odometry along with the point features so that a mobile robot can perform robust pose estimation during autonomous navigation. The proposed algorithm, i.e., keyframe-based autonomous visual-inertial navigation (KAVIN) supports the entire navigation system and can run onboard without an additional graphics processing unit. A series of experiments in a real environment indicated that the KAVIN system provides robust pose estimation without wheel encoders and prevents the accumulation of drift error during autonomous driving.},

Moreover, an adaptive law is incorporated in the control law to estimate the switching gain such that the complex uncertainty bound information can be avoided. 3) The desired steering angle is realized by a lower steering controller via ASM for an SBW system.

In order to increase the usability, a simplified reduced model that describes the filling phase is designed. The proposed model is used to construct a model-based feed-forward controller, which is not affected by a time delay in the hydraulic system. Furthermore, an adaptation algorithm of a key model parameter is proposed to cope with the model changes due to the disturbances and uncertainties of the plant. In addition, a new volume indicator is proposed to observe the status of the filling phase. Based on the proposed controller and the indicator, tracking performance of the filling phase is guaranteed without over-fill or under-fill.

Existing microscopic fuel consumption models are mostly steady state models with limited vehicle parameters as dynamic variables. Data-driven solutions can make the model comprehensive by introducing broad impact factors. However, without the required accessible online computational capability and fast model adaptation mechanisms, those data-driven solutions cannot quickly adapt to unseen driving conditions and engine condition changes based on real-world vehicle data to support MB-VPC. In this paper, a connected vehicle-based data mining (CV-DM) framework is proposed to achieve online adaptive dynamic fuel consumption modeling through knowledge sharing over CVs and the CV remote data center. Based on the CV-DM framework, CV-supported Distributed Meta-regression (CV-DMR) algorithms are developed to realize a fast few-shot adaptation with limited training data. Extensive proof-of-concept experiments are conducted with steady-state and transient vehicle engine data. Compared to the baseline physical model and the existing non-adaptive grey-box model, prediction accuracy is improved by 47%-85% and 38%-80% respectively with only limited training data needed for the subject vehicle. Accordingly, a fuel savings of up to 9.4% can be achieved owing to the improvement of prediction accuracy.},

A new cascade structure of relative filter which consists of float estimator and fixed estimator is presented that can take advantage of both the multi-sensor data and the information from Least-squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment (LAMBDA). Also, a cooperative baseline estimation method based on multidimensional scaling (MDS) is proposed to further exploit the relative estimation from many other collaborators. Lastly, we combine the cascade relative filter (CRF) with MDS to estimate the relative states cooperatively using a feedback scheme. In the verification part, we use realistic sensor noise and a GNSS signal simulator to obtain inter-vehicle and GNSS measurements for a multiple-vehicle network. In a harsh GNSS scenario, only 51.20% of epochs in RTKLIB software can pass the LAMBDA acceptance test, but our proposed methods can achieve 77.85% (CRF) and 85.05% (CRF/MDS). Referring to the recovery time from a float solution to fixed solution, RTKLIB needs 179.23 s in the case of 4 satellites, but only 34.88 s (CRF) and 21.39 s (CRF/MDS) for the proposed methods. Results show that the proposed CRF has good performance when fusing with IMU and V2V observations, and has a better performance than existing methods. Moreover, the proposed architecture that combines CRF and MDS can have a further improvement, which substantially increases the robustness and accuracy of relative state estimation.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a hierarchical architecture using the biased min-consensus (BMC) method, to solve the path planning problem of unmanned surface vessel (USV). We take the fixed-point monitoring mission as an example, where a series of intermediate monitoring points should be visited once by USV. The whole framework incorporates the low-level layer planning the standard path between any two intermediate points, and the high-level fashion determining their visiting sequence. First, the optimal standard path in terms of voyage time and risk measure is planned by the BMC protocol, given that the corresponding graph is constructed with node state and edge weight. The USV will avoid obstacles or keep a certain distance safely, and arrive at the target point quickly. It is proven theoretically that the state of the graph will converge to be stable after finite iterations, i.e., the optimal solution can be found by BMC with low calculation complexity. Second, by incorporating the constraint of intermediate points, their visiting sequence is optimized by BMC again with the reconstruction of a new virtual graph based on the former planned results. The extensive simulation results in various scenarios also validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method for autonomous navigation.},

Typically, a Safe-aaS infrastructure provides customized safety-related decisions dynamically to multiple end-users using the concept of decision virtualization. We consider road transportation as the application environment of Safe-aaS to generate trustworthy decisions. On the other hand, the efficiency and accuracy of the decisions generated depend on the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of the participating sensor nodes and the route through which data transit. We propose a trust evaluation model to compute the trustworthiness of the data generated from these nodes. Further, we consider direct and indirect trust mechanisms for each of the sensor nodes and update their trust measures at regular intervals of time. Based on these measures, we evaluate the trust of each data item sourced from the network. We formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model to select the optimal data for decision-making, while alleviating the effects of illegitimate sensor nodes. Further, we show that the formulated ILP problem is NP-hard and use a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Experimental results show that our proposed trust evaluation model exhibits more than 8% attack detection rate and 13% reduction in false attack detection rate in a network with 50% malicious nodes, compared to the benchmark schemes. The proposed trustworthy data selection algorithm outperforms different existing greedy approaches.},

It is urgent to design efficient warning strategies for rear-end collisions which is one of the main causes of traffic accidents. The existing researches have been conducted to predict the collisions. Learning-based methods are proposed to solve this complicated issue, which the traditional methods are difficult to solve. However, due to some limitations in terms of the feature extraction and prediction performance, back-propagation learning methods are facing challenge. In this paper, we proposed a novel Rear-end Collision Prediction Mechanism with deep learning method (RCPM), in which a convolutional neural network model is established. In RCPM, the dataset is smoothed and expanded based on genetic theory to alleviate the class imbalance problem. The preprocessed dataset is divided into training and testing sets as the input to train our convolutional neural network model. The experimental results show that compared with the Honda, Berkeley and multi-layer perception neural-network-based algorithms, RCPM effectively improves performance to predict rear-end collisions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we design the UAV trajectory to minimize the total energy consumption while satisfying the requested timeout (RT) requirement and energy budget, which is accomplished via jointly optimizing the path and UAV&#39;s velocities along subsequent hops. The corresponding optimization problem is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity and combinatorial nature. To overcome this difficulty, we solve the original problem via two consecutive steps. Firstly, we propose two algorithms, namely heuristic search, and dynamic programming (DP) to obtain a feasible set of paths without violating the GU&#39;s RT requirements based on the traveling salesman problem with time window (TSPTW). Then, they are compared with exhaustive search and traveling salesman problem (TSP) used as reference methods. While the exhaustive algorithm achieves the best performance at a high computation cost, the heuristic algorithm exhibits poorer performance with low complexity. As a result, the DP is proposed as a practical trade-off between the exhaustive and heuristic algorithms. Specifically, the DP algorithm results in near-optimal performance at a much lower complexity. Secondly, for given feasible paths, we propose an energy minimization problem via a joint optimization of the UAV&#39;s velocities along subsequent hops. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. The results show that the DP-based algorithm approaches the exhaustive search&#39;s performance with a significantly reduced complexity. It is also shown that the proposed solutions outperform the state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of both energy consumption and outage performance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a parallel concatenated index modulation and M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) to integrate with carrier interferometry (CI) codes into the orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) differential chaotic shift keying (DCSK) communication system. Our objective is to meet different quality of service (QoS) user demands while achieving higher energy efficiency and retaining reliable communications with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In our design, one input bit set is modulated by the index of the CI codes matrix whose rows are rotated circularly, another bit set is mapped to the MPSK symbols to realize the M-ary modulation. Subsequently, the resultant MPSK symbols are modulated by reference chaotic sequences and spread by the information-bearing rotated CI codes matrix at the transmitter. After the OFDM modulations, the information bearing symbols are transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, after the non-coherent chaotic correlation demodulation, the maximum likelihood detection method is firstly applied to attain the estimates of the index modulated bit set, which are then used to recover the phases of chaotic sequences for further evaluation of another MPSK modulated symbols. Since no additional energy is required while more bits can be transmitted via the M-ary modulation and index modulation, the energy efficiency can be improved. In addition, thanks to the orthogonality of the CI codes matrix and the spreading in the frequency domain, the PAPR could be suppressed and reliability performances can be improved. Then theoretical analysis is conducted and simulation results validate the theoretical analysis. Moreover, the results demonstrate the superior bit error rate (BER) performances to benchmarks and flexible data rate could be provided for user terminals via different combinations of the index modulation and the M-ary modulation.},

  abstract     = {Wireless channels generally exhibit dispersion in both time and frequency domain, known as doubly selective or doubly dispersive channels. To combat the delay spread effect, multicarrier modulation (MCM) such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and its universal filtered variant (UF-OFDM) can be employed, leading to a simple per-subcarrier one tap equalization. The time-varying nature of the channel, in particular, the intra-multicarrier-symbol channel variation induces spectral broadening and thus inter-carrier interference (ICI). Most existing works address both effects separately, focusing on the one effect while ignoring the respective other. This paper considers both effects simultaneously for cyclic prefix (CP)-, zero padded (ZP)- and universal filtered (UF)-based OFDM with a simple one tap equalization, assuming doubly dispersive wireless channel model. For this general channel model, we show that the independent (wide sense stationary uncorrelated scatter, WSSUS) selectivity in time and frequency domain starts to intertwine in contrast to the ideal cases with single selectivity. We derive signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in closed form for arbitrary system settings and channel parameters, e.g., bandwidth, delay- and Doppler-spread. With the SINR analysis, we compare the three MCM schemes under different channel scenarios.},

A signal and system model is developed for the B2B measurements, where only some pairs of the Tx and Rx ports of the sounder are utilized among all pairs of the ports. Using the measurement model, a least-square estimation problem is then formulated and converted in the frequency domain to weighted rank-one approximation problems. The notion of system identifiability of a MIMO channel sounder is introduced and some optimal sets of B2B connections are proposed. Given a proposed optimal set of B2B connections, the alternate convex search (ACS) algorithm with a proper initialization is also proposed to solve the weighted rank-one approximation problems. Finally, it is shown how to calibrate field measurement data by using the estimated response matrices. Numerical results show that, only after a couple of iterations, the ACS algorithm with the proposed initialization achieves a comparable identification and calibration performance to the conventional method that requires the B2B connections of all port pairs.},

The novel sum of Markov chains (sum of MC) model is designed to do two main tasks successfully; capturing the dynamics of blockers affecting a moving transceiver and computing the arising channel attenuation. The sum of MC model has advantages over existing Markov chains models, which are: that it can adapt to model non-stationary scenarios. The sum of MC model can integrate any attenuation function, including the 3GPP blockage model and any lab measurement attenuation profile. Additionally, it is computationally efficient. The sum of MC model can match well with the performance results from a more complex geometric channel model.},

However, using shared sensing data raises grave concerns about the truthfulness of information reported by unreliable stakeholders. For example, a transmitting vehicle may deliberately disseminate false locations to the surrounding receivers. Trusting the data, the automatic control systems in such connected receivers can be trapped to change to a wrong lane or accelerate unexpectedly, and then potentially lead to a crash. This work introduces a novel approach to support a host vehicle in verifying the motion behavior of a target vehicle and then the truthfulness of sharing data in cooperative vehicular communications. Initially, at the host vehicle, the detection system recreates the motion behavior of the target vehicle by extracting the positioning information from the V2V received messages. Furthermore, the next states of that vehicle are predicted based on the unscented Kalman filter. Unlike prior studies, the checkpoints of the predicted trajectory in the update stage are periodically corrected with a new reliable measurement source, namely 5 G V2V multi-array beamforming localization. If there is any inconsistency between the estimated position and the corresponding reported one from V2V, the target vehicle will be classified as an abnormal one. The simulation results demonstrate that our method can achieve accuracy over 0.97 in detecting abnormal reports, including those from collusion and Sybil attacks.},

However, pedestrian safety is hindered as pedestrians often do not carry hand-held devices that provide low latency wireless communication (e.g., dedicated short-range communication (DSRC)-enabled device or emerging 5G-enabled cell phone) to communicate with nearby connected vehicles. The contribution of this paper lies in developing a vision-based approach to generate personal safety messages (PSMs) in real-time utilizing video streams from roadside traffic cameras, following the standard of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) (SAE J2945) that can be used by connected vehicle pedestrian safety applications. Our analysis reveals that the vision-based approach can estimate pedestrians&#39; location and speed more accurately than existing DSRC-enabled pedestrian hand-held devices. A system-level validation was performed by developing a connected vehicle related pedestrian safety application, “pedestrian in signalized crosswalk warning (PSCW),” that uses the generated PSMs from our vision-based approach. The results from the calculated average time-to-collision (TTC) value demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating real-time collision warnings to avoid possible vehicle-pedestrian collisions. Our analysis also shows that the vision-based pedestrian safety warning system satisfies the latency requirement for the PSCW safety application in a connected vehicle environment.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly common, although there remain a number of limitations that need to be addressed in order for their deployment to be more widespread. For example, to mitigate the failure of self-driving functions in AVs, introducing the remote control capability (which allows a human driver to operate the vehicle remotely in certain circumferences) is one of several countermeasures proposed. However, the remote control capability breaks the isolation of onboard driving systems and can be potentially exploited by malicious actors to take over control of the AVs; thus, risking the safety of the passengers and pedestrians (e.g., AVs are remotely taken over by terrorist groups to carry out coordinated attacks in places of mass gatherings). Therefore, security is a key, mandatory feature in the design of AVs. In this paper, we propose a cloud-centric three-factor authentication and key agreement protocol (CT-AKA) integrating passwords, biometrics and smart cards to ensure secure access to both cloud and AVs. Three typical biometric encryption approaches, including fuzzy vault, fuzzy commitment, and fuzzy extractor, are unified to achieve three-factor authentication without leaking the biometric privacy of users. Moreover, two session keys are negotiated in our protocol, namely: one between the user and AV to support secure remote control of the AV, and the other is negotiated between the mobile device and the cloud to introduce resilience to the compromise of ephemeral security parameters to ensure cloud data access security with a high security guarantee. Finally, we formally verify the security properties and evaluate the efficiency of CT-AKA, whose findings demonstrate that the protocol achieves high security strength with reasonable computation and communication costs.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, intelligent transportation systems are a vital part of the development of smart cities. In intelligent transportation systems, it is necessary for each vehicle to know the states of all other running vehicles within a range, depends on the road speed limit. The states include location, travelling direction, speed, and possibly other useful information. Knowing the states of surrounding vehicles is critical in high-risk locations, such as traffic intersections and roundabouts. The development of 5G and its technologies, such as massive multiple-input multiple-output antenna, enables a new communication model, termed vehicle-to-infrastructure edge network (V2IEN), to achieve the above communication goal. In this paper, we study the optimization of the data throughput of the proposed V2IENs in 5G with the Time Division Duplex scheme. We show that due to the nature of information flow in the proposed V2IENs, the uplink and downlink traffic loads are asymmetric. This asymmetric characteristic allows maximizing the degrees of freedom of the V2IENs by optimizing the time-slot resources for uplink and downlink transmission. In this work, we present the sum-DoF capacity of the V2IENs with proof. We demonstrate that a significant DoF gain is achieved for the V2IENs by carefully allocate the system transmission time resources. We further propose an iterative algorithm for network sum-rate maximization via the optimization of the vehicle and base station precoders. Numerical results demonstrate that a careful design of the precoders at the base station and at the vehicles can considerably improve the V2IENs performance.},

  abstract     = {The advent of 5G technologies enables highly anticipated prospect of the internet of things in smart cities. Smart terminals become a necessity with increasing number of applications and tasks. The limited computational resources and constrained battery energy at terminals compel tasks to be offloaded for execution sometimes. For time-sensitive and safety-critical tasks, fog computing is the preferred option instead of cloud computing, since fog computing brings the computing resources to the edge of networks and thus has shorter response latency. In this context, vehicular fog computing (VFC) that supplements fog computing by contributing vehicular computing resources has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, a few of challenging issues regarding task offloading in VFC still need to be addressed. For example, decision making for task allocation and response latency optimization are not straightforward, since on one hand the connection between vehicles and end users is usually short or intermittent; on the other hand the multi-hop inter-vehicle task forwarding is time-consuming and thus prone to packet loss. To address the latency related issue, we in this paper propose a three-layer architecture of VFC to schedule the tasks offloaded from mobile devices (MDs). The road side unit (RSU) is endowed with computing facilities and storing resources such that it can act as not only a gateway to the remote cloud center but also a centralized infrastructure responsible for task scheduling among vehicles. A greedy heuristic based scheduling strategy and algorithms are proposed in the next. Last, an extensive series of experiments are carried out to investigate the proposed scheduling strategy. The results show that the proposed scheduling strategy outperforms other well known heuristics based scheduling strategies such as Min-Min and Max-Min and thus has wide prospects.},

  abstract     = {Channel gain based path selection has been recently proposed to simplify the network design of a cluster-based cross-layer multihop vehicular communications. In vehicular network systems, end-to-end packet delay increases with the growing number of vehicles associated in that path. In delay-sensitive application, the information exchange must be successfully carried out very quickly to ensure the quality of infotainment services. In the case of excessive packet delay, some important information either are needed to be enqueued before reaching the destination or are lost. The packet loss makes it impractical to deploy the network in practice. In this paper, a new delay-sensitive buffer-aided relay selection is proposed using the channel-based greedy scheduling algorithm (CGSA) to overcome the limitations imposed by processing delay. The proposed scheme significantly minimizes average delay by selecting a set of alternative paths based on individual node buffer status. This scheme has less packet delay than existing Max-link scheme with very close system performances, making it an ideal candidate for delay-sensitive applications. Finally, both analytical and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm compared with the existing relaying schemes.},

  abstract     = {User-centric ultra-dense network (UDN) has been considered a key enabler of high data rate and high reliable vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. In this paper, an analytical framework is developed based on stochastic geometry to characterize the uplink V2I transmission performances, in terms of the outage probability, the average vehicle throughput and the average spatial throughput, particularly resolving two important but not well-understood factors in such networks: the spatial correlation in the interference powers among the cooperative roadside units (RSUs) as caused by the shared set of co-channel vehicles, and the combined vertical distance (CVD) owing to the lane width and the antenna height difference between the vehicle and the RSUs. Exact analytical expressions of the outage probability are derived for the general multiple association cases, a far-distance approximation method is introduced to reduce the computational complexity, and lower and upper bounds are obtained corresponding to two extreme assumptions of the spatial interference correlation. We show that the impacts of the spatial interference correlation can be significant and ignoring the correlation can lead to non-optimal system deployment, and that the far-distance approximation can approach well with the exact results. Meanwhile, although CVD diminishes the V2I uplink transmission performances, the diminution can be mitigated through RSU cooperation.},

One of the critical challenges for autonomous driving is the inadequate precision of autonomous vehicles in detecting pedestrians, which is a major safety hazard to human beings. In this paper,a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) demonstration system with a normalization-based validity index (NbVI) has been proposed for real-time pedestrian detection. The proposed algorithm can accurately detect pedestrians by calculating the Manhattan distance between the target histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features and real-time pedestrian HOG features. In lieu of sophisticated circuit layout and substantial training burden with neuron computation circuit, the proposed detection system with adaptive features clustering is hardware-friendly and is capable of real-time pedestrian detection using fewer training images with high detection rate (up to 99.2%). Moreover, the function execution time of pedestrian detection is shortened by 25% using FPGA acceleration.},

The time-domain characteristic of the UWB system using the proposed circularly polarized antennas with wide bandwidth and omnidirectional radiation is investigated by transient response. Contrary to UWB system using the conventional linearly polarized antenna, the pulse distortion is insignificant and is verified by the measured antenna performance with high signal fidelity (&gt;0.98) and low standard deviation (STD) of time delay (&lt;; 0.05 ns). By considering the NLOS electromagnetic wave propagation models, the locations of the anchors in the UWB system are effectively optimized by using the proposed GA to minimize the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of each tag location in the dense multipath area. By optimizing the three anchor locations, the average RMSE of tag location is minimized to 36.72 cm for a 45 m 2 area with concrete walls and pillars. The adaptive NLOS mitigation is investigated by using and optimizing machine learning models, including deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The three-anchor UWB system for a 45 m 2 area is established to track an autonomous vehicle in severe NLOS environment by using the proposed circularly polarized antenna combined with the optimized LSTM model, achieving the measured positioning error of 26.1 cm. Moreover, the measured result of 20-30 cm positioning error with concrete walls, pillars and walking humans is demonstrated and analyzed.},

The autonomous vehicles are all connected to the internet to form a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) system. Because of the multi-levels and multi-stopes in underground mines, the key point is to obtain the precise locations of the vehicles in real-time. Therefore, the microseismic monitoring, image recognition technology, artificial intelligence training, and smart sensors are comprehensively utilized, based on the internet of things and cloud computing, to locate the autonomous driverless vehicles. Virtual sources localization and pencil lead break tests are conducted to simulate and eliminate the effectiveness and accuracy of the velocity-free localization method. Virtual sources localization demonstrate that the velocity-free localization method is accurate and reliable. Results of pencil lead break tests show that the average locating errors of X coordinates, Y coordinates, and absolute distance are 0.4318 cm, 0.1136 cm, and 0.5188 cm, respectively.

Many collision avoidance strategies have emerged in recent years, but the dynamic and complex nature of driving environment poses a challenge to develop robust collision avoidance algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a decentralized framework named RACE: Reinforced Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Collision AvoidancE. Leveraging a hierarchical architecture we develop an algorithm named Co-DDPG to efficiently train autonomous vehicles. Through a security abiding channel, the autonomous vehicles distribute their driving policies. We use the relative distances obtained by the opponent sensors to build the VANET instead of locations, which ensures the vehicle&#39;s location privacy. With a leader-follower architecture and parameter distribution, RACE accelerates the learning of optimal policies and efficiently utilizes the remaining resources. We implement the RACE framework in the widely used TORCS simulator and conduct various experiments to measure the performance of RACE. Evaluations show that RACE quickly learns optimal driving policies and effectively avoids collisions. Moreover, RACE also scales smoothly with varying number of participating vehicles. We further compared RACE with existing autonomous driving systems and show that RACE outperforms them by experiencing 65% less collisions in the training process and exhibits improved performance under varying vehicle density.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power transfer system, where a UAV is dispatched as an energy transmitter (ET), transferring radio frequency (RF) signals to a set of energy receivers (ERs) periodically. We aim to maximize the energy harvested at all ERs by jointly optimizing the UAV&#39;s three-dimensional (3D) placement, beam pattern and charging time. However, the considered optimization problem taking into account the drone flight altitude and the wireless coverage performance is formulated as a non-convex problem. To tackle this problem, we propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm to decompose the original problem into four sub-problems in order to optimize the variables sequentially. In particular, we first use the sequential unconstrained convex minimization based algorithm to find the globally optimal UAV two-dimensional (2D) position. Subsequently, we can directly obtain the optimal UAV altitude as the objective function of problem is monotonic decreasing with respect to UAV altitude. Then, we propose the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) based algorithm to control the phase of antenna array elements, in order to achieve high steering performance of multi-beams. Finally, with the above solved variables, the original problem is reformulated as a single-variable optimization problem where charging time is the optimization variable, and can be solved using the standard convex optimization techniques. Furthermore, we use the branch and bound method to design the UAV trajectory which can be constructed as traveling salesman problem (TSP) to minimize flight distance. Numerical results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that significant performance gain in terms of sum received power of ERs can be achieved by the proposed algorithm in UAV-enabled wireless power transfer networks.},

  abstract     = {A trajectory planning is a technique that is widely used to automatically generate an expected geometric path that a vehicle needs to follow within a certain future time horizon. We propose a way to generate trajectories of multiple vehicles for a short-term planning with the formal guarantee of the collision avoidance using a SAT (Satisfiability) solver. We assume that each vehicle sends the local status (e.g., speed or position) and its planned trajectory to the server (e.g., road-side units or cloud servers). The server collects the information, and determines if the group of vehicles would encounter any collision within a fixed amount of time. Then, the server calculates the modified trajectories, and sends them back to the vehicles to avoid collisions. Calculating such trajectories is generally a complex problem, which makes it challenging to find them within a short amount of time. Given a driving scenario where multiple vehicles are engaged, we propose two methods to reduce the computation time to generate the trajectories. Firstly, we introduce the grouping method which systematically identifies vehicles that are not engaged in the collision scenario, and removes the related parameters from the SAT solving process. Our case study of the ramp merging driving scenario shows the grouping method saves the computation time by 40% compared to solving the constraints with the original parameters. Secondly, we introduce the collision check point method that chooses some waypoints to maintain their previous control input to reduce the problem complexity. Our experiment shows up to 98% computation time reduction compared to the approach without this method.},

  abstract     = {This article studies edge caching in fog computing networks, where a capacity-aware edge caching framework is proposed by considering both the limited fog cache capacity and the connectivity capacity of base stations (BSs). By allowing cooperation between fog nodes and cloud data center, the average-download-time (ADT) minimization problem is formulated as a multi-class processor queuing process. We prove the convexity of the formulated problem and propose an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm that can achieve the minimum ADT and converge much faster than existing algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the allocation of fog cache capacity and BS connectivity capacity needs to be balanced to take the full advantage of edge caching. While the maximization of the edge-cache-hit-ratio (ECHR) by utilizing all available fog cache capacity is helpful when the BS connectivity capacity is sufficient, it is preferable to keep a lower ECHR and allocate more traffic to the cloud when the BS connectivity capacity is deficient.},

  abstract     = {The third generation partnership project (3GPP) has issued specifications for the autonomous assignment of radio resources by vehicles on the sidelink of the cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technology. It is based on a sensing mechanism for resource selection and a semi-persistent scheduling for resource reservation to periodic safety messages. Imperfect sensing due to hidden terminals and to half-duplex on board transceivers may result in the selection of interfered resources for successive message transmissions. As a consequence of the lost packets, involved vehicles may become blind to the presence of other vehicles in their vicinity even for many seconds, with threats to the road safety. In this paper, we define these events as wireless blind spots (WBSs) and characterize their probability to occur. We propose an enhancement to the autonomous mode in order to reduce the WBS duration and demonstrate the benefits of the proposal against the legacy mode, both analytically in a simplified scenario and through simulations in a highway environment.},

Most existing work assumes the ideal channel estimation, which can be challenging due to the high-dimensional cascaded MIMO channels and passive reflecting elements. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep denoising neural network assisted compressive channel estimation for mmWave IRS systems to reduce the training overhead. Specifically, we first introduce a hybrid passive/active IRS architecture, where very few receive chains are employed to estimate the uplink user-to-IRS channels. At the channel training stage, only a small proportion of elements will be successively activated to sound the partial channels. Moreover, the complete channel matrix can be reconstructed from the limited measurements based on compressive sensing, whereby the common sparsity of angular domain mmWave MIMO channels among different subcarriers is leveraged for improved accuracy. Besides, a complex-valued denoising convolution neural network (CV-DnCNN) is further proposed for enhanced performance. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over state-of-the-art solutions.},

In frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems, the downlink CSI is generally estimated at the user equipment (UE) and then fed back to the BS. The huge number of antennas at the BS leads to overwhelming feedback overhead. To address this issue, we propose a framework, named CS-ReNet. In this framework, the CSI is first compressed at the UE based on the compressive sensing (CS) technology and then reconstructed at the BS using a deep learning (DL)-based signal recovery solver, named ReNet. We analyze the CSI quality at the BS in terms of the normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) and cosine similarity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing CS-based and some DL-based methods.},

Specifically, the encoding at the transmitter makes sure that all the coded messages are required to decode a private message. Consequently, security is achieved if the eavesdropper loses one or more coded messages. The encoding at the relay is operated by introducing a public auxiliary message, which changes the eavesdropper&#39;s decoding method from combining-before-decoding to combining-after-decoding, and thus decreases the eavesdropper&#39;s signal-noise-ratio (SNR) obviously. Intercept probability is used to measure the security, and results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the security performance of full-duplex relay networks.},

  abstract     = {With the development of millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, the mmWave vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is envisioned to support rapidly growing number of vehicles. Against this background, each V2V user (VUE) is expected to employ large-scale array to form directional analog beams for improving spatial spectrum reuse, and it is capable of achieving concurrent transmissions from multiple other VUEs simultaneously. However, due to the high dynamics of V2V links, it can be challenging for each VUE to quickly select an effective analog beam. In this paper, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach to achieve an efficient and fast analog beam selection for mmWave V2V communications. Specifically, we first derive the probabilities that multiple V2V transmitters (TXs) serve one VUE to obtain the average sum rate (ASR) for mmWave V2V communications. On that basis, we develop an ML approach to maximize the ASR, whereby the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is utilized for optimizing the analog beam selection. Besides, we further proposed an iteration sequential minimal optimization training algorithm to train data samples of all V2V links, and convergence of the proposed solution is also discussed. Finally, an extensive sample training and simulations are evaluated by Google TensorFlow. The results verified that our proposed ML approach is capable of achieving a higher ASR yet substantially lower computational complexity than traditional solutions based on explicitly estimated channels.},

Hence, we embark on the comparison of time- and frequency-domain equalization for FTN signaling both by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. It is shown that frequency-domain equalization fails to reliably detect the FTN signal with a low FTN packing factor, while the time-domain equalization still performs well.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the security issues for a spatial modulation system. Here, a multi-antenna transmitter equipped with a single radio frequency (RF) chain attempts to communicate with a legitimate receiver secretly, and the secret messages are modulated into the index of an active transmit antenna and a baseband symbol. Multiple RF mirrors are placed near the transmit antennas to facilitate the secure transmission. Particularly, in each transmission, one symbol duration is equally divided into multiple sub-symbol periods. During each sub-symbol period, a specific mirror activation pattern is determined, and the sub-symbol is sent along with the weighted jamming signals. The weighting coefficients of the intentionally interfering signals are properly designed to defend against eavesdropping by severely degrading the wiretap channel. The proposed secure SM scheme has two main advantages. First, the dimensionality for jamming is significantly enhanced by deploying multiple RF mirrors at the transmitter. This would on one hand improve the secrecy performance, and on the other hand guarantee the proposed scheme to be immune to eavesdroppers with a large number of antennas. Second, the usage of RF mirrors and sub-symbol division approach provides massive degrees of freedom to preprocess the modulated symbol for further secrecy performance improvement. Numerical results show that the proposed secure SM scheme significantly outperforms the benchmark techniques in secrecy rate.},

Conventional OQAM-FBMC systems are mainly designed with long filters that offer better spectral shape. However, latency is also another key parameter when considering low response systems. Therefore, in this context, short prototype filters should be applied for OQAM-FBMC. In this letter, we propose to design short filters with low undesirable spectral emission by using an optimization method. In this approach, we propose a novel objective function to be minimized.

Furthermore, opportunistic relay selection is employed, activating one or two FD relays to support the end-to-end communication. The network performance is improved through buffers, allowing to switch to half-duplex (HD) transmission/reception when FD operation is not feasible. A hybrid BA FD/HD NOMA relay selection algorithm is proposed, herein called BAHyNOMA, orchestrating the three aforementioned techniques, towards a simple yet efficient and robust relay selection. BAHyNOMA is evaluated in terms of outage probability, average sum-rate and average delay, and it is observed that the average sum-rate can be doubled, while maintaining low latency.},

The range is estimated by MUSIC-like method. Our method is superior to traditional methods and exhibits enormous advantages in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and small number of snapshots regions.

Sparse vector coding (SVC) appears as a strong candidate for future URLLC networks by enabling superior performance in terms of bit error rate (BER). SVC exploits the virtual digital domain (VDD) and compressed sensing (CS) algorithms to encode and decode its information through active symbol indices. In this paper, first, a clever encoding/decoding algorithm is proposed for the SVC scheme, which allows the use of all possible activation patterns (APs) resulting in increasing spectral efficiency. Second, a novel solution is proposed to convey additional information bits by further exploiting index modulation (IM) for the codebooks of the SVC scheme. Computer simulation results reveal that our low-complexity algorithm and novel IM solution provide not only a superior BER performance but also an increase in the number of bits conveyed by IM compared to the ordinary SVC approach.},

  abstract     = {With the dense deployment of millimeter wave (mmWave) front ends and popularization of bandwidth-intensive applications, shared backhaul in fiber-wireless (FiWi) networks is still facing a bandwidth crunch. To alleviate the backhaul pressure, in this paper, caching capability is enabled at the edge of FiWi networks, i.e., optical network unit access points (ONU-APs). On the other hand, as both power budget and backhaul bandwidth in FiWi networks are constrained, it is challenging to properly leverage power for caching and that for wireless transmission to achieve superior system performance. As caching has a significant impact on resource allocation, we reconsider performance optimization and analysis in cache-enabled FiWi networks. Firstly, in the cache-enabled FiWi network with mmWave, we formulate the joint power allocation and caching problem, with the goal to maximize the downlink throughput. A two-stage algorithm is then proposed to solve the problem. Secondly, to investigate the theoretical capacity of the cache-enabled FiWi network with mmWave, we derive an upper bound of the downlink throughput by analyzing properties of the average rate of wireless links. Particularly, we show that appropriate power allocation for wireless transmission and caching at ONU-APs is essential to achieve higher throughput. The numerical and simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the proposed algorithm can approach the analytical upper bound.},

In this paper, with the road traffic assignment to “proactively” reshape the spatiotemporal distribution of resource demands, we investigate the joint service migration and mobility optimization problem for vehicular edge computing. The goal is to meet the service delay requirements of vehicular edge computing with minimum migration cost and travel time. As service migration and mobility optimization are coupled, the joint scheduling problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which cannot be solved in real time by centralized algorithms. To this end, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm is proposed to maximize the composite utility of communication, computing, and route planning in a distributed way. In the MADRL algorithm, a two-branch convolution based deep Q-network is constructed to coordinate migration action and routing action. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is scalable and substantially reduces service delay, migration cost and travel time as compared with the existing baselines.},

  abstract     = {At present, Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) have been widely used in enormous applications, and simultaneously face many security threats. The trust management mechanism plays an important role in protecting network security. Many theories, e.g., subjective logic, Bayesian, cloud model, entropy theory, evidence theory, etc., have been adopted to evaluate the node trust of wireless sensor networks. However, due to the unique characteristics of the underwater dynamic environment, the existing trust mechanisms used in traditional networks (such as P2P networks, Ad-hoc networks, etc.) cannot be directly used in UWSNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a new trust evaluation and update mechanism for underwater wireless sensor networks based on the C4.5 decision tree algorithm (TEUC). In the TEUC, trust evidences are first collected including data-based, link-based and node-based trust evidences. Then, the collected trust evidences are used to train the C4.5 decision tree. In addition, the reward and penalty factors are defined to update trust based on the sliding time window. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional ones in a dynamic network environment in terms of malicious node detection and energy consumption.},

In this paper, we researched the energy-saving strategies for data aggregation on the combination of store-carry-forward (SCF) routing and hop-by-hop routing, which are suitable for large-scale multi-UAV networks, and proposed Single Coalition Strategy (SCS) and Coalition Formation Strategy (CFS) based on the coalition game theory. In SCS, all source UAVs transmit data individually or can form a coalition. The coalition aggregates all data to a ferry UAV for transmission, the ferry choose between SCF routing mode and hop-by-hop routing mode with the help of predicted energy-cost calculation. In CFS, all source UAVs form a coalition structure by coalition formation game (CFG) algorithm according to data amount, location, and network topology. Each coalition can aggregate data to its own ferry, and then the ferry transmits data in the optimized mode. We analyze the performance of SCS and CFS by simulations, the average transmission energy consumption of a UAV in SCS and CFS are about 30% of hop-by-hop routing mode. Based on the results, we recommend that SCS should be used when the application scenario is small and the number of UAVs is limited. In the case where the application scenario is great and the number of UAVs is large, CFS with the Utilitarian order and limited message propagation hops is recommended.},

  abstract     = {Software-Defined Datacenters (SDDC) have been widely used for load-aware data management for different applications across the globe. Due to its centralized architecture, the issues of scalability along with resilience (to overcome the failure of single or multiple controllers) are still challenging because of an exponential increase in the data generated from different smart devices. Most of the solutions reported in the literature for this problem use a single controller which may not address the scalability issues. However, the issues as mentioned above of scalability and resilience in SDDC can be solved by deploying multiple distributed controllers at the control plane. However, the primary concern in a network having various controllers is the optimal Controller Placement Problem (CPP) to resolve the issues of fault-tolerance, latency among controllers, availability, and placement. Hence, to resolve the issues described above, in this paper, we propose Placement Availability Resilient Controller (PARC) scheme. The PARC scheme works in the following four phases: (i) stable network partitioning (ii) localization of controllers using the cooperative game theory (iii) computation of an optimal number of multiple controllers and (iv) computation of minimal extra backup controllers to improve the overall network cost. The numerical results of the PARC scheme are evaluated on Internet2 OS3E topology using POCO-toolset simulated in Matlab. The experimental results demonstrated that the cost of deploying the number of controllers using the PARC scheme has reduced to 12.98%, 8.16%, and 6.25% as compared to the POCO-SA, POCO-MOALO, and CNCP schemes respectively. Moreover, the PARC scheme outperforms the existing state-of-the-art schemes (POCO-SA, POCO-MOALO, and CNCP) for inter-controller as well as switch-to-controller latency.},

  abstract     = {We consider a fully-loaded ground wireless network supporting unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) transmission services. To enable the overload transmissions to a ground user (GU) and a UAV, two transmission schemes are employed, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and relaying, depending on whether or not the GU and UAV are served simultaneously. Under the assumption of the system operating with infinite blocklength (IBL) codes, the IBL throughputs of both the GU and the UAV are derived under the two schemes. More importantly, we also consider the scenario in which data packets are transmitted via finite blocklength (FBL) codes, i.e., data transmission to both the UAV and the GU is performed under low-latency and high reliability constraints. In this setting, the FBL throughputs are characterized again considering the two schemes of NOMA and relaying. Following the IBL and FBL throughput characterizations, optimal resource allocation designs are subsequently proposed to maximize the UAV throughput while guaranteeing the throughput of the cellular user. Moreover, we prove that the relaying scheme is able to provide transmission service to the UAV while improving the GU&#39;s performance, and that the relaying scheme potentially offers a higher throughput to the UAV in the FBL regime than in the IBL regime. On the other hand, the NOMA scheme provides a higher UAV throughput (than relaying) by slightly sacrificing the GU&#39;s performance.},

First, the entire sea area with the thermocline layer is stratified based on the underwater communication radii of the gliders. Next, the glide angles and initial navigation points of the gliders are determined based on their communication radii at each level to construct the complete-coverage path. Finally, by combining the ant colony algorithm and the determined initial navigation points, the complete-coverage path with obstacle avoidance is planned for the gliders. Simulation results show that the proposed CCPP-OA algorithm enables complete coverage of the entire sea area.

As a distinguishing range-free scheme, DV-Hop localization can localize those unknown nodes which have less than 3 or even no neighbor anchors. However, the localization results by existing DV-Hop based algorithm are found to be inconsistent with the real connectivity between nodes. The inconsistency inspires us to propose two algorithms to improve localization accuracy. First a Centralized Connectivity-based DV-Hop (CCDV-Hop) algorithm is proposed to optimize the accuracy of DV-Hop localization. Establishing an optimization problem which takes the real connectivity between any two nodes as the constraints, the proposed algorithm can make the localization results conform to the real connectivity. Then an algorithm with lower complexity is proposed, namely Distributed Connectivity-based DV-Hop (DCDV-Hop) algorithm, which can obtain near-optimal localization performance in distributed networks. Without including the connectivity of all nodes, the constraints in the proposed DCDV-Hop algorithm only consider the real connectivity within two hops. Simulation results show that despite higher complexity, the proposed algorithms can achieve much better accuracy than other DV-Hop based methods.},

How to effectively use non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to realize energy efficient MEC networks has been of high interest and calls for in-depth study. In particular, there has been yet no work to study the energy efficient communication scheme from system perspective in this area. In this work, we focus on the design of a system-centric computation energy efficiency (EE) scheme in a NOMA-based MEC network. The system computation EE is maximized by jointly optimizing the computing frequencies of the MEC server and the local users, the offloading time, the transmit powers of local users, as well as the execution time for the local users and the MEC server. Employing the fractional programming theory and introducing auxiliary variables, we develop an efficient Dinkelbach-based iterative scheme to tackle the formulated non-linear fractional programming problem. For obtaining instrumental insights, we further derive closed-form expressions for the partial solutions based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Simulation results are provided to verify the quick convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm, to obtain insights, as well as to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed resource allocation scheme in terms of the system computation EE by comparing it with benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played an important role in air-ground integration network. Especially in Internet of Things (IoT) services, UAV equipped with communication equipments is widely adopted as a mobile base station (BS) for data collection from IoT devices on the ground. In this paper, we consider an air-ground network in which the UAV flies straightly to collect information from the IoT devices in a 2-D plane based on the CSMA/CA protocol. Due to UAV&#39;s continuous mobility, the communication durations of devices in different locations with UAV are not only time-limited, but also vary from each other. To analyze the throughput performance of uplink multiple access control (MAC) protocol, we propose a new analysis model to deal with the communications heterogeneity in the network. Firstly, we divide the devices in the coverage into different clusters according to their communication durations. Then, a quitting probability indicating the probability that a device quits the UAV&#39;s coverage at each time slot is clarified. A modified three-dimensional Markov chain model adopting the quitting probability and cluster division is developed for the performance analysis. Besides, we also propose a modified CSMA/CA protocol which fully considers the heterogeneity of the access time and adaptively allocates the time resource among the devices in different clusters.

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are wireless self-organizing networks, whose communication is conducted through open wireless channels, thus making it vulnerable to various attacks. It is therefore necessary to employ encryption technology to ensure secure communication. In view of the foregoing, key agreement techniques are introduced to VANET communications. The group key agreement (GKA) protocol allows a group of participants to establish a public session key for a secure communication channel over an insecure network. The traditional GKA protocol is inefficient, however, and consumes considerable amounts of resources. With the aim of resolving problems related to information security and privacy preservation in VANETs, this paper proposes a full session key agreement scheme based on chaos mapping. In this paper, the first phase describes the key agreement between the fog server and group administrator; the second phase describes the group key agreement for vehicle nodes in the group where the vehicle can only communicate with vehicles having the same group key without the aid of a trusted key center or centralized key distributor. The proposed scheme is based on Chebyshev chaotic mapping algorithm, in which a chaotic map is utilized to provide a one-way hash; Chebyshev polynomial is also employed to establish a public multi-party key; it avoids the modular multiplication index or scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve. The proposed scheme does not only satisfy the security requirements in VANETs but also performs detailed analysis.},

  abstract     = {To accommodate ever-increasing computational workloads while satisfying the requirements of delay-sensitive tasks, mobile edge computing (MEC) is proposed to offload the tasks to nearby edge servers. Nevertheless, it can introduce new technical issues in terms of transmission and computation overheads affected by the underlying offloading decisions. In this paper, we investigate the computation offloading problem in a hierarchical network architecture, where tasks can be offloaded to nearby micro-BS and further forwarded to macro-BS equipped with an MEC server. Specifically, we propose a scheme of joint channel allocation and resource management, named JCRM, to make offloading decisions and maximize the long-term network utility with considering stochastic task arrival/dispatch and dynamic changes in available resources. As the formulated utility maximization problem is a mixed-integer non-linear stochastic programming problem that is directly intractable, we, therefore, leverage the Lyapunov optimization technique to decouple the original problem into three separate sub-problems. Based on the solutions to those sub-problems, our proposed scheme can make optimal offloading-downloading decisions with maximizing the overall task offloading rate. Finally, we verify the long-term network stability and near-optimal performance of JCRM via both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.},

In this paper, we study the resource allocation and pricing problem for network slicing that captures interactions among access/backhaul service providers and their UEs by using the multi-leader multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg game approach. Toward this end, we show how to formulate such a Stackelberg game and prove the existence of a unique game equilibrium.

  abstract     = {Accurate sensor localization is a crucial requirement for the deployment of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) in a large variety of applications. However, the asynchronous clock, stratification effect and mobility characteristics of underwater environment make it challenging to realize accurate node localization for UASNs. This paper develops an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) aided localization solution for UASNs, subjected to asynchronous clock, stratification effect and mobility constraints in cyber channels. A hybrid architecture including surface buoys, AUVs, active and passive sensor nodes, is first presented to construct a cooperative location-aware network. Then, an iterative least squares estimator is developed for AUVs to capture the unknown water current parameters, through which the relationship between propagation delay and location estimation can be established. With the assistance of AUVs, two asynchronous localization algorithms are designed to estimate the locations of active and passive sensor nodes. Particularly, motion and ray compensation strategies are jointly employed to improve the localization accuracy. It is worth noticing that, the proposed localization algorithms incorporate the current field estimation into the localization process of UASNs, and more importantly, they can eliminate the influences of asynchronous clock, stratification effect and node mobility together. Moreover, performance analyses for the proposed localization solution are also presented. Finally, simulation and experimental results reveal that the node localization accuracy in this paper can be significantly improved as compared with the other works.},

The virtualization paradigm is tightly integrated into UDN to address the problem of interference management. However, mobility management based on virtual cells meets significant challenges in UDN due to the frequent handovers and massive signaling overhead. These problems become severe for vehicles owing to their high-speed movement. In this paper, driven by trajectory prediction using a real-world vehicle mobility dataset, we propose a proactive mobility management solution based on virtual cells. Four modules are designed in the centralized Software-Defined Networking controller to support the proposed solution. The proposed LSTM-DR framework predicts the next locations of vehicles by integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Dead Reckoning (DR) method. The active gNBs selection algorithm selects the serving gNBs to form virtual cells according to predicted locations and mobility preferences. The corresponding signaling procedure is then carefully designed to further reduce the signaling overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed prediction framework can achieve higher accuracy and robustness in trajectory prediction. The proposed proactive solution reduces the handover frequency and handover failure rate and thereby saves the handover signaling overhead significantly.},

  abstract     = {The increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks have become a serious challenge for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which presents two new characteristics: low frequency and multi-stage. That is, hackers could gain authority to attack industrial equipment/infrastructure gradually in a long interval through lurking, lateral intrusion and privilege escalation. While, the existing Machine Learning (ML) based intrusion detection schemes all require the participation of expert knowledge, so it is difficult to adaptively select an attack interval and a retraining period of the detection model in IIoT, resulting in poor detection performance. To solve above problems, a bidirectional long and short-term memory network with multi-feature layer (B-MLSTM) is designed. Firstly, sequence and stage feature layers are introduced in the model training phase model which can learn the corresponding attack interval from historical data, so that the model can effectively detect attacks with different intervals. Then, a double-layer reverse unit is introduced to update the detection model. By collecting information from test data and making association analysis with historical data, the retraining period is adaptively selected to match the new attack interval. Compared with the previous works, our proposed scheme has a lower false positive rate than existing schemes by at least 46.79%, and the false negative rate is reduced by at least 79.85%, which are carried out on three classic IIoT datasets.},

Closed-form bounds are delivered for the average outage probability of a UAV from its nearest neighbor in the swarm, and the density of the swarm, which allows the swarm to operate uninterruptedly in the presence of the interference. Our analysis involves closed-form approximations of the instantaneous outage probability of a UAV from its nearest neighbor by using the first-order Marcum Q-function and the zero-th order modified Bessel function of the first kind. The analysis also involves applying Jensen&#39;s inequality to the instantaneous outage probability to bound the average outage probability and the density of the swarm.

These UAV applications are complicated as they demand not only huge computational resources but also strict latency requirements.

To cope with these problems, we propose an online algorithm for UAV swarms to jointly optimize the computation offloading and multi-hop routing scheduling in the Edge-Cloud environment. First, we propose a UAV-Edge-Cloud computing model to meet the requirements of latency and computing capability. We then formulate a joint optimization of workflow assignment and multi-hop routing scheduling in order to minimize the computation cost and latency. To tackle this NP-hard problem, an algorithm based on the Markov approximation technique is designed to obtain near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, to achieve high long-term performance in online environments, we exploit Lyapunov optimization to control the migration cost caused by the dynamics of application and environment. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves a long-term high-efficiency and stable performance in an online environment for UAV swarms with respect to computation offloading and traffic routing.},

  abstract     = {Long-Term Evolution (LTE) over unlicensed spectrum extends LTE technology to the spacious unlicensed spectrum with readily available bandwidth. The provided capacity surge makes it one of the most high-profile technologies to meet the explosive growth of mobile traffic demand. Among its different variants, Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) is considered as a promising global solution attributed to its mandatory listen-before-talk (LBT) procedure. Nevertheless, although LBT effectively maintains transmission fairness between LTE and other unlicensed systems (e.g., Wi-Fi), the current LAA protocol specified in 3GPP Release 13 is far from perfect to achieve harmony coexistence. To this end, in this paper, we first develop an analytical model to evaluate the throughput performance of Category 4 (Cat 4) algorithm agreed in 3GPP release 13. Subject to the system fairness constraint, the aggregate throughput of LTE-LAA and Wi-Fi networks is maximized based on a semi branch and bound algorithm. To make the complex optimization tractable, reinforcement learning techniques are introduced to intelligently tune the contention window size for both LTE-LAA and Wi-Fi nodes. Specifically, a cooperative learning algorithm is developed assuming that the information between different systems is exchangeable. A non-cooperative version is subsequently developed to remove the previous assumption for better practicability. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed learning algorithms in contrast to the analytical upper bound under various conditions. It is shown that both proposed learning algorithms can significantly improve the total throughput performance while satisfying the fairness constraints. Particularly, the proposed cooperative learning algorithm can closely approach the analytical bound.},

In order to completely separate the desired signal and interference, we consider a finite size of buffer at the relay. We propose zero-forcing based beamforming schemes for two different cases of the buffer-aided relay and non-buffer-aided relay. We derive exact closed-form expression and lower bound of the outage probability for those two-way relay system, respectively.

The mathematical model to maximize sum-rate and energy efficiency (EE) of these two HBF-NOMA configurations is formulated to corroborate our simulation results. We aim to maximize both the sum-rates and EEs of the SCS-HBF-NOMA and FCSHBF-NOMA systems via successive interference cancellation-zero forcing (SIC-ZF) and phased-zero forcing (P-ZF) schemes, respectively. Associated performance analysis under New York University (NYU) mmW channel model is investigated for both two and four users per cluster. It is found that our proposed SCS-HBF-NOMA generally yields higher EE than the FCS-HBF-NOMA in both LOS and NLOS links having high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime. Moreover, the proposed multistream HBF-NOMA leverages spatial multiplexing to attain higher sum-rates than the single stream counterpart. The employment of 3 bit quantization is capable of optimizing the sum-rate for energy efficient finite resolution HBFNOMA systems. Results also manifest that SCS-HBF structure with reduced antennas in its sub-array beamforms a wider beam capable of mitigating against the performance degradation on the account of channel imperfection in NOMA system. Furthermore, it is found that the number of users per cluster should be carefully selected for optimal performance of HBF-NOMA system. Lastly, space complexity of the HBF-NOMA scheme is found to be the lowest in P-ZF FCS-HBF-NOMA.},

  abstract     = {Polar codes are known as the first capacity-achievable codes with low encoding and decoding complexity. The sequential decoding nature of traditional polar decoding algorithms such as successive cancellation (SC) results in high decoding latency, which is not suitable for services that require high reliability and low latency. Deep learning for decoding, referred to as neural network decoder (NND), has shown strong competitiveness because of its non-iterative and full-parallel feature. Whereas, the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of NND is still not satisfactory. In this paper, we first propose a residual learning denoiser (RLD) for polar codes. The RLD can remarkably improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduce the symbol-error-rate (SER) of received symbols. In order to decode polar codes more efficiently, we subsequently propose a residual neural network decoder (RNND) for polar codes. Different from the traditional pure-NND (PNND) which directly uses neural network for decoding received symbols, the proposed RNND concatenates a RLD used for denoising and a NND used for decoding. We provide a novel multi-task learning (MTL) strategy to jointly optimize the denoiser and decoder, and find that the denoising gain of Joint-RLD is more significant than the Independent-RLD. Numerical results show that the proposed RNND outperforms its counterpart PNND with regard to the BER performance. In addition, the optimal RNND(MLP-MLP) approaches the traditional SC decoding performance, while saving more than one hundred times of computation time. Eventually, scalability of the RNND to longer polar codes as well as LDPC codes further demonstrates the superiority of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Admission control is an effective solution to managing a wireless network with a large user set. It dynamically rejects users in bad conditions, and thereby guarantees high quality-of-service (QoS) for the others. Unfortunately, a frequently-varying admissible user set requests remarkable power to continually re-establish the transmission link. In this work, we explore the stability of admissible user set, and propose a joint long-term admission control and beamforming problem for a network with one multi-antenna base station (BS) and multiple single-antenna users. We consider the downlink transmission in a time period comprised of multiple time slices. By jointly optimizing the admissible users and the BS transmit beamformers in different time slices, we aim to balance the size of user set and the network total power cost for both QoS guarantee and user status switching. We develop two (offline and online) algorithms to find some efficient suboptimal solutions of this NP-hard problem. The offline algorithm requires all channel state information (CSI), and then solves the admissible users and beamformers in different time slices in one shot, based on successive upper-bound minimization (SUM). To support real-time data transmission, we further design an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based online algorithm, which outputs the admissible users and beamformers in different time slices successively, utilizing the previous admissible user set, the actual value of current CSI, and the distribution of future CSI. Simulations validate the performance of the two algorithms, and show that the online algorithm is an efficient practical alternative to the offline algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) based millimeter wave (MMW) radar systems have found widespread applications in advanced driving assistant system recently. MMW radar has clear superiority in many aspects, such as excellent range resolution, adaptability to various environments and low cost. However, its fatal weakness is the poor angular resolution which is very important in automotive radar applications. This shortcoming can be overcome by using a physically large aperture. However, achieving moderate angular resolution requires an array that is too large to be practically integrated into a vehicle. In this paper, a high resolution direction of arrival (DOA) approach is proposed by utilizing the relative motion between radar and targets, and a very large virtual aperture can be created by combining the signal vectors from multiple consecutive coherent processing intervals (CPIs). It should be pointed out that, the proposed approach is applicable for both stationary and moving targets even without motion data of vehicles. Therefore, it is completely different from the synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The effectiveness is verified by both simulation results and the measurement data. It is demonstrated that the angular resolution can be superior to 1° by a linear array consisting of only 4 elements.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the problem of parameter estimation for a Fluctuating Two-Ray (FTR) model in the context of wireless mobile communications. Precisely, the received signal is assumed to be the superposition of two dominant components (typically a direct plus a reflected path signal) in addition to diffusive secondary contributions. The signal components may be affected by random amplitude shadowing, statistically modeled by Nakagami-m distribution, multiplied by unknown scaling factors with random uniform independent phases, whereas the diffusive component is assumed to follow the complex Gaussian distribution. Exploiting the method of moments, a 4 × 4 nonlinear system is herein mathematically derived, which is very hard to be solved due to the strong nonlinearity. Therefore, a sequential procedure based on some prior information about the diffusive component power level is devised to solve it. The effectiveness of the proposed estimation technique is shown by evaluating the normalized root mean square errors as well as mean errors and standard deviations in several operating conditions of practical interest also considering the limit case of only one-ray in order to compare the proposed approach to simpler estimators, already presented in the literature. The results show the robustness of the new estimator even under a multipath model mismatch. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed estimation procedure is confirmed through measured mmWave data.},

In this case, the RSS-based method has the advantages as well as light-load and low-cost hardware. The pretreatment method is firstly conducted due to the discrete and anamorphic original data. Then the direct localization (DL) algorithm is proposed by fitting the change rate of RSS. Thereafter, the filtering and clustering localization (FCL) method is developed to improve the localization robustness. Additionally, the positioning error bound of FCL is analyzed using spherical geometry in some circumstances.

  abstract     = {Grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is promising to achieve low latency massive access in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In grant-free NOMA, pilot signals are often used for user activity detection (UAD) and channel estimation (CE) prior to multiuser detection (MUD) of active users. However, the pilot overhead makes the communications inefficient for IoT devices with sporadic transmissions and short data packets, or when the channel coherence time is short. Hence, it is desirable to improve the efficiency by avoiding the use of pilot signals, which can also further achieve lower latency. This work focuses on Bayesian receiver design for grant-free low density signature orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (LDS-OFDM), where each user is allocated a unique low density spreading sequence. We show how to achieve joint UAD, CE and MUD without the use of pilot signals. Firstly, the task of joint UAD, CE and MUD is formulated as a novel structured signal estimation problem. Then the structure of the effective channel matrix is encoded to a probabilistic form, and message passing based Bayesian approach is developed to solve the structured signal estimation problem. In particular, belief propagation (BP), expectation propagation (EP) and mean field (MF) message passing are used to develop efficient hybrid message passing algorithms to achieve trade-off between performance and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed receiver for grant-free LDS-OFDM without the use of pilot signals.},

  abstract     = {Deploying a large number of distributed access points (AP)s to serve a smaller number of users is one of the promising network architectures for future wireless communication systems. Such network architecture can be operated as a distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system or as a small-cell (SC) system to satisfy the anticipated high rate requirements for beyond-5G networks. However, in a practical scenario with non-ideal hardware components and high-velocity users, the network experiences an inevitable performance degradation. This paper aims at analyzing the network performance under the operation of distributed massive MIMO and SC systems, taking into account the impairments of real and dynamic systems. Considering multiple-antennas APs, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the downlink (DL) spectral efficiency of both systems. We reveal that limiting the number of served users per AP in distributed massive MIMO systems leads to a corresponding loss in the performance, especially under max-min power control. Besides, despite the SC system provides the largest per-user average DL rate under the deployment of ideal APs, distributed massive MIMO systems become superior in the presence of non-ideal APs. Notably, while increasing the number of deployed non-ideal APs can reduce the introduced loss in distributed massive MIMO systems, this leads to an extra performance loss in SC systems. Finally, we show that the presence of high-velocity users is more harsh in SC systems. In addition, our results show that the SC system operation is more suitable for low-velocity users, however, it is better to operate networks with high velocities users under the distributed massive MIMO systems operation.},

This paper considers the problem of obtaining the beamforming gain for receivers with the analog beamforming architecture in the initial access, assuming that a fixed beam pattern is employed. We present the necessary and sufficient condition to obtain the receive beamforming gain in the absence of CSI, and then derive the upper bound of the receive beamforming gain for different antenna spacings. It is shown that oversampling in space is needed at the receiver to obtain a non-trivial beamforming gain without CSI, since the total received signal power is proportional to the number of receive antennas. We also design the beamformer that can achieve the upper bound. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamformer in the scenarios of downlink synchronization and random access in millimeter-wave systems.},

Cellular users communicate with each other through the base station (BS). Vehicular users communicate through direct vehicular links while sharing the spectrum of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with cellular users. In particular, we focus on the underlay approach, in which vehicular users can transmit at the same time in a sub-carrier that is being used by a cellular user. Assuming a limited number of sub-carriers, the number of allowed vehicular links is limited by the quality of service (QoS) requirement for cellular users because of the interference from vehicular links. Our goal is to maximize the number of vehicular links while satisfying the QoS for cellular users. To achieve this goal, we state the optimization problem of resource allocation in C-V2X networks mode-3, assuming high mobility of vehicular users, which results in Doppler effect for them. We also assume that the global channel state information (CSI) of mobile links is not available for the BS. We propose a novel scheme for the BS to jointly allocate resources, such as power and sub-carriers, to cellular and vehicular users, while minimizing the number of non-allowed vehicular links, considering high data rate requirements for cellular users and high reliability requirements for vehicular users. Using numerical results, we obtain the maximum number of vehicular links that can be established for a given available bandwidth and cellular user distribution.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted communications system, including two cooperative UAVs, a wireless-powered ground destination node leveraging simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique, and a terrestrial passive eavesdropper. One UAV delivers confidential information to destination and the other sends jamming signals to against eavesdropping and assist destination with energy harvesting. Assuming UAVs have partial information about eavesdropper&#39;s location, we propose two transmission schemes: friendly UAV jamming (FUJ) and Gaussian jamming transmission (GJT) for the cases when jamming signals are known and unknown a priori at destination, respectively. Then, we formulate an average secrecy rate maximization problem to jointly optimize the transmission power and trajectory of UAVs, and the power splitting ratio of destination. Being non-convex and hence difficult to solve the formulated problem, we propose a computationally efficient iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation to obtain a suboptimal solution. Finally, numerical results are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed multiple-UAV schemes, compared to other existing benchmarks. Specifically, we find that the FUJ demonstrates significant secrecy performance improvement in terms of the optimal instantaneous and average secrecy rate compared to the GJT and the conventional single-UAV counterpart.},

However, the UAV mmWave beamforming must be carefully designed to provide directional transmission and support reliable connections. In this paper, we consider a UAV mmWave system, where the UAV serves as a BS to cover mobile users on the ground. Firstly, we study the beam training and propose beam training codebook designs for both insufficient and sufficient beam training cases. Then, we propose efficient beam tracking methods to predict the beam direction with user mobility, where both random and inertial motion are considered. Simulation results show that the average downlink capacity increases with the proposed beam training codebook. Further, the mean angular error of our proposed beam tracking is lower than existing method.},

  abstract     = {Covert communication is often limited in rate because it is difficult to hide the signal in the background noise. Recent work has shown that jamming can significantly improve the rate at which covert communication can be conducted, but this jamming signal has a devastating effect on the receiver. To tackle this issue, we equip the jammer with multiple antennas so that it can employ beamforming to place the intended receiver in the null space of the jamming. Moreover, in order to increase rate in this network, we equip the transmitter with an antenna array to be able to perform 3-dimensional (3D) beamforming toward its intended recipient. To evaluate this design, we formulate an optimization problem and present an iterative algorithm to solve it. Moreover, since Willie is passive, it is possible that Alice is not able to estimate the location of Willie perfectly. Hence, we investigate a new practical scenario in which the information about Willie&#39;s location is imperfect at Alice. Numerical results consider both the rate of covert communication with the proposed architecture and the gap between the result from our optimization and that obtained from exhaustive search. Numerical results highlight that the optimality gap is on average approximately 10%, and 3D beamforming compared to 2D beamforming increases covert rate by approximately 70%.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks provide various applications for vehicles to improve road safety and traffic efficiency as well as infotainment. Security and privacy are of great importance for the deployment of vehicular networks. However, how to efficiently secure vehicular networks with privacy-preserving remains a big challenge. Many solutions have been proposed in the past decade, but most of them either rely too much on the ideal tamper-proofed devices or not being efficient enough for scenarios with high vehicle density. Meanwhile, in recent years, great progresses have been made in both the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and the fifth-generation (5G) wireless network based vehicular networks. The 5G enabled vehicular networks are envisioned to support higher data transmission rate and a larger number of connected devices than the 802.11p and LTE based networks. Noting the great potential of 5G technology, in this paper we explore a new architecture of 5G software defined vehicular network and propose a secure and efficient privacy preserving authentication scheme for vehicular networks. The proposed scheme uses elliptic-curve public-key cryptography and a registration list to achieve efficient message authentication and to avoid the usage of ever-growing certificate revocation list. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme has strong security guarantees without using the ideal tamper-proofed devices. Simulation results exhibit that the proposed scheme has ultra low computational overhead and packet loss ratio.},

In addition, user mobility can increase the communication chances among different users, and therefore, the network delay can be further effectively reduced by proper designing the caching strategy. In this paper, mobility-aware caching strategies in D2D networks are studied to minimize the network delay. Specifically, based on the inter-contact user mobility model, the expression of the average file delivery delay is analytically obtained. Considering the limited cache capacity, a delay minimization cache placement problem considering the user mobility is investigated. To optimally solve this nonlinear integer programming problem, we reformulate it as a multistage decision problem. According to the recursive relationship between adjacent stages, dynamic programming is adopted to obtain the optimal mobility-aware caching strategy stage-by-stage. Furthermore, to lower the complexity, we also demonstrate that the original problem can be recasted as a monotone submodular function maximization problem over a matroid constraint. Then, a low-complexity greedy mobility-aware caching strategy with (1-1/e)-optimality performance guarantee is put forward. Numerical results show that, in the scenario with high user mobility, the file delivery delay can be reduced by 47% with our proposed mobility-aware caching strategy, as compared with the most popular caching. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed caching strategy is verified by real-world data set.},

It is well-known that rendering is the key performance bottleneck in wireless VR systems, especially for VR games. However, real-time rendering and data correlation are ignored by most researchers. In this paper, we propose an adaptive VR framework that enables high-quality wireless VR in future mmWave-enabled wireless networks with mobile edge computing (MEC), where real-time VR rendering tasks can be offloaded to MEC servers adaptively and the caching capability of MEC servers enables further performance improvement. First, we formulate the addressed problem to maximize the quality of experience (QoE) of the users, where association, adaptive offloading mode selection, and caching policy are jointly optimized. Considering the high complexity of the addressed problem, we then propose a distributed learning approach consisting of an offline training phase and an online running phase, which maintains scalability and adaptation capability. The offline phase is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) while the latter utilizes game theory. At last, simulation results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the other baseline algorithms in terms of QoE utility values, latency, and convergence time.},

To exploit the spatial characteristics of the channel, we consider three-dimensional multiple input multiple output (3D-MIMO) technology. In addition, to increase the spectral efficiency of the network, sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is used as the transmission technology for both bands. A practical scenario in which the channel information is not known perfectly is assumed, and hence a robust scheme is developed. We formulate the resource allocation problem as an optimization problem which is highly nonlinear and non-convex. To solve the problem, we rely on iterative approximation methods, such as successive convex approximation, and we provide a joint transmit power allocation and beam-forming to increase the secrecy rate of the network. Using simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme for different network settings. Simulations show a performance increase of about 24.85% with 3D-MIMO over two-dimensional MIMO (2D-MIMO). In addition, the use of both μW and mmW bands results in a 20.25% performance increase over a case where only μW is used. We also show that 3D-MIMO and dual connectivity have better performance than 2D-MIMO and μW in high-rise and dense urban areas.},

Without compensation, I/Q imbalance can severely degrade the system performance. This paper addresses the joint compensation of TX and RX I/Q imbalances for single carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) systems. Specifically, we develop an expectation maximization (EM) based approach to separately estimate TX and RX I/Q imbalances, and the multipath channel. With the obtained estimates, we can readily fulfill the compensation of I/Q imbalances. Unlike previous methods, which only estimate the combined effect of I/Q imbalances and the multipath channel, we are able to obtain the separate estimates of the TX I/Q imbalance, the RX I/Q imbalance and the multipath channel. This will significantly alleviate the computation burden of the proposed compensation scheme in the long run. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the counterparts, and can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of I/Q imbalances.},

To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a KQIs-based QoE anomaly detection framework using semi-supervised machine learning algorithm, i.e., iterative positive sample aided one-class support vector machine (IPS-OCSVM). There are four steps for realizing the proposed method while the key step is combining machine learning with the network operator&#39;s expert knowledge using OCSVM. Our proposed IPS-OCSVM framework realizes QoE anomaly detection through soft decision and can easily fine-tune the anomaly detection ability on demand. Moreover, we prove that the fluctuation of KQIs thresholds based on expert knowledge has a limited impact on the result of anomaly detection. Finally, experiment results are given to confirm the proposed IPS-OCSVM framework for QoE anomaly detection in cellular networks.},

D2D communications can increase the spectral efficiency of wireless cellular networks by establishing a direct link between devices with limited help from the evolved node base stations (eNBs). A well-designed user pairing and power allocation scheme with low complexity can remarkably improve the system&#39;s performance. In this paper, a simple and distributed FG based approach is utilized for power control and user pairing implementation in an underlay cellular network with D2D communications. A max-min criterion is proposed to maximize the minimum rate of all active users in the network, including the cellular and multiple D2D co-channel links in the uplink direction. An associated message-passing (MP) algorithm is presented to distributedly solve the resultant NP-hard maximization problem, with a guaranteed convergence compared to game theoretic and Q-learning based methods. The complexity and convergence of the proposed method is analyzed and numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms alternative algorithms in terms of complexity, while keeping the sum-rate of users nearly the same as centralized counterpart methods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, secrecy performance is investigated over the cascaded fading channel for the κ-μ distribution. The probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the cascaded κ-μ fading channels as well as for some of its special cases, such as the Rayleigh and Rician fading channels are derived. A communication system operating over the cascaded κ-μ fading channel is analyzed in which the outage probability (P o ), the average symbol error probability (ASEP), and the average channel capacity (ACC) are obtained in terms of the Meijer G-function. In addition, the secrecy is examined for a system model where we have a transmitter, a receiver, and multiple colluding eavesdroppers attempting to overhear the information received. The secrecy performance is investigated in terms of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity (P r nzc ). The analyses illustrate that increasing the number of eavesdroppers in the network degrades the secrecy of the system. Furthermore, increasing the cascade level in the channel degrades the system performance as well as the information security. In addition, the impact of the wiretap channel parameters and the average received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the eavesdroppers over the security are studied. To verify the accuracy of the derived analytical expressions, Monte-Carlo simulations are utilized.},

  abstract     = {The continued development of connected and automated vehicle technologies presents the opportunity to utilize these technologies for vehicle energy management. Leveraging this connectivity among vehicles and infrastructure allows a powertrain controller to be predictive and forward-looking. This paper presents a real-time predictive powertrain control strategy for a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) in a connected vehicle environment. This work focuses on the optimal energy management of a multi-mode PHEV based on predicted future velocity, power demand, and road conditions. The powertrain control system in the vehicle utilizes vehicle connectivity to a cloud-based server in order to obtain future driving conditions. For predictive powertrain control, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) is developed to make torque-split decisions within each operating mode of the vehicle. The torque-split among two electric machines and one combustion engine is determined such that fuel consumption is minimized while battery SOC and vehicle velocity targets are met. The controller has been extensively tested in simulation across multiple real-world driving cycles where energy savings in the range of 1 to 4% have been demonstrated. The developed controller has also been deployed and tested in real-time on a test vehicle equipped with a rapid prototyping embedded controller. Real-time in-vehicle testing confirmed the energy savings observed in simulation and demonstrated the ability of the developed controller to be effective in a real-time environment.},

  abstract     = {The performance and safety of batteries of electric vehicles deteriorate when the battery temperature is too low or too high. The thermal management system regulating the battery temperature consumes considerable electric energy, particularly, for cooling the battery. To maximize the vehicle driving range, the means of controlling the battery temperature should minimize the energy consumption. In this paper, stochastic model predictive control is applied to the battery-cooling controller. Effective model predictive control requires a good but simple system model with proper estimation of near-future disturbances. The components of the battery cooling system are modeled to represent the energy-consumption and heat exchange mechanism with some assumptions for simplicity. The future information is estimated using historical driving data in a stochastic sense. For real-time implementation, an unequally spaced probability distribution is introduced when designing a stochastic model of future heat generation. The proposed control method shows significantly lower energy consumption while maintaining an acceptable temperature regulation performance compared to other temperature controllers, such as a thermostat-type controller and a model predictive controller with simply assumed future information. The proposed predictive controller shows robust performance compared to typical controllers by utilizing the stochastic estimation of future information.},

To avoid such problems, a novel, effective and robust traction control platform is proposed.

State machines are designed according to preset high and low thresholds to select among integral increasing control, integral decreasing control, or keeping control. It has no vehicle parameters, no variants hard to measure, and no road identification. The design only counts tire slip ratios, wheel speeds and vehicle speed.

We propose a modular algorithmic approach to kinematic modelling of nonholonomic (multi-)articulated buses, including the N-trailer vehicles as a special case, comprising a car-like prime-mover passively interconnected with arbitrary number of segments (wagons/trailers) equipped with fixed or steerable wheels, and with various locus of a driving axle in a kinematic chain. Kinematic models are valid under an assumption of a pure rolling of all the vehicle wheels (no skid/slip motion), which is practically justified for the low-speed maneuvering conditions. The proposed approach leads to compact nonlinear models which, thanks to their modular construction, preserve clear geometrical interpretation of velocity couplings between the vehicle segments. Derivations of kinematic models for popular structures of articulated and bi-articulated urban buses are presented for various driving-axle locus and steering capabilities. Experimental model validation, conducted with a full-scale wagon-driven articulated bus, illustrates utility of the approach.},

  abstract     = {Developing energy management strategies (EMSs) for different types of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is a time-consuming and laborious task for automotive engineers. Experienced engineers can reduce the developing cycle by exploiting the commonalities between different types of HEV EMSs. Aiming at improving the efficiency of HEV EMSs development automatically, this paper proposes a transfer learning based method to achieve the cross-type knowledge transfer between deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based EMSs. Specifically, knowledge transfer among four significantly different types of HEVs is studied. We first use massive driving cycles to train a DRL-based EMS for Prius. Then the parameters of its deep neural networks, wherein the common knowledge of energy management is captured, are transferred into EMSs of a power-split bus, a series vehicle and a series-parallel bus. Finally, the parameters of 3 different HEV EMSs are fine-tuned in a small dataset. Simulation results indicate that, by incorporating transfer learning (TL) into DRL-based EMS for HEVs, an average 70% gap from the baseline in respect of convergence efficiency has been achieved. Our study also shows that TL can transfer knowledge between two HEVs that have significantly different structures. Overall, TL is conducive to boost the development process for HEV EMS.},

  abstract     = {On account of complementary control, reduced size, and energy saving, the switched-capacitor (SC) based equalizer becomes promising for the energy management of energy storage system. Traditionally, the number of the bypass capacitor in the SC based equalizer equals to the number of the battery module in series or parallel connections. The amount of bypass capacitors is enormous, thus costly and bulky for electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, the integrated energy storage is proposed to reduce cost and save space, meanwhile, the equalizations between the batteries and the ultracapacitors (UCs) are achieved by the reutilization of SC network. UCs not only perform as energy storage units, but also work as energy exchange units. Thus, the number of balanced elements can be reduced significantly. The operational principles of the storage system and the analyses of the balancing process are examined in detail. The system simulation is performed for functionality evaluations. Meanwhile, an experimental prototype is also implemented for six cells to demonstrate the balancing process. The accordance of experiment and simulation can further testify the feasibility and effectiveness.},

Then, to utilize the processed data and to handle the nonlinearity of semi-active actuators, a hybrid horizon-varying (HV) model predictive control (MPC) method is given. The method can adapt to speed variation and meanwhile take the most of the road data within a fixed preview length. Further, based on the global information and considering multiple road irregularities in a driving path, a speed planning problem is established in the spatial domain and a dynamic programming based solution is provided.

  abstract     = {A novel framework is proposed for enhancing the driving safety and fuel economy of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with the aid of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication networks. The problem of driving trajectory design is formulated for minimizing the total fuel consumption, while enhancing driving safety (by obeying the traffic rules and avoiding obstacles). In an effort to solve this pertinent problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed for making collision-free decisions. Firstly, a deep Q-network (DQN) aided algorithm is proposed for determining the trajectory and velocity of the AV by receiving real-time traffic information from the base stations (BSs). More particularly, the AV acts as an agent to carry out optimal action such as lane change and velocity change by interacting with the environment. Secondly, to overcome the large overestimation of action values by the Q-learning model, a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm is proposed by decomposing the max-Q-value operation into action selection and action evaluation. Additionally, three practical driving policies are also proposed as benchmarks. Numerical results are provided for demonstrating that the proposed trajectory design algorithms are capable of enhancing the driving safety and fuel economy of AVs. We demonstrate that the proposed DDQN based algorithm outperforms the DQN based algorithm. Additionally, it is also demonstrated that the proposed fuel-economy (FE) based driving policy derived from the DRL algorithm is capable of achieving in excess of 24% of fuel savings over the benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The Ultra-short baseline (USBL) positioning system has important application in the positioning of underwater vehicles. The installation error angle of the USBL positioning system has an important influence on the positioning accuracy of USBL system. The traditional calibration methods have limited estimation accuracy for installation error angles and have high route requirements. To solve the above problems, a calibration method of installation error angle based on attitude determination is proposed in this paper. When strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and USBL are fixed together in the application process, the installation error angle of USBL is fixed and unchanged. Then the calibration of installation error angle can be accomplished with the idea of attitude determination. The vector observation model based on the installation error angle matrix is established first. Observation vectors are obtained by the relative position of transponders in the USBL coordinate frame. The reference vector is calculated by position of transponder, position and attitude of SINS and lever arm between SINS and USBL. By constructing the observation vectors and the reference vectors, the proposed method can calibrate the installation error angle of SINS and USBL in real time. The advantages of the proposed method are that it has no specific requirements for the calibration route and can calibrate the installation error angle in real time with high accuracy. In order to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, simulation experiment and field experiment are carried out in this paper. The results of simulation experiment and field experiment show that the proposed method can give the estimated installation error angle of USBL in real time, and the estimated result is the best among several methods. The proposed method can not only achieve the calibration of the installation error angle in circular trajectory, but also in straight trajectory.},

The correct utilization of non-holonomic constraint requires a compensation of lever arm between the IMU center and the valid point of this constraint on the vehicle. Non-holonomic constraint is not always valid for anywhere on the vehicle since rotation of the vehicle may produce a corresponding lateral/vertical velocity in motion. However, the lever arm impact to non-holonomic constraint has not been paid attention sufficiently and been researched thoroughly. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the lever arm error on the auxiliary ability of the non-holonomic constraint. The lateral/vertical velocity and additional position drift error during GNSS outages caused by the lever arm error were studied. Two integrated navigation systems with different grade of IMUs were used to analyze the accuracy requirements of the lever arm. Analysis results show that the forward lever arm is the most important influence factor, and the lever arm error should be controlled within sub-decimeter to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the non-holonomic constraint assistance.},

  abstract     = {Collision imminent steering is an automotive active safety feature designed to perform an aggressive lane change to avoid a forward collision in the event that the system determines there is insufficient distance to avoid a collision by braking alone.In this paper, a collision imminent steering system is developed using nonlinear model predictive control to perform a lane change at high speed in a highway environment. Two formulations are presented: one formulation to show the theoretical minimum lane change distance within which a safe lane change can be performed, and a second formulation to find the minimum aggressive maneuver for a given lane change distance. The nonlinear model predictive control formulation is posed as a constrained optimization problem, where solutions obey hard safety constraints of the highway environment. Constraint aggregation techniques are analyzed and introduced to monitor the peak tire slip throughout the maneuver. Numerical simulations of a typical luxury sedan in a highway setting show that minimum distance required to change lanes is about half the limit braking distance. Hence, there is a window of feasibility where the vehicle cannot avoid collision by braking alone, but can change lanes safely and maintain a safe trajectory throughout the maneuver. Additional simulations show that an active four wheel steering architecture improves performance over front only steering.},

  abstract     = {In the vehicle type classification area, the necessity to improve classification performance across traffic surveillance cameras has garnered attention in research especially on high level feature extraction and classification. The backpropagation (BP) training approach of traditional deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach is time-consuming without using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). In this paper, we propose a semisupervised strategy for the end-to-end Principal Component Analysis Convolutional Network (PCN) in the area of vehicle type classification. Even without using a GPU, the proposed model eliminates the time-consuming training procedure of convolutional filter bank. In particular, the convolutional filters of the network are generated using unsupervised learning by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which has tremendously reduced training cost and also reinforced the robustness of extracted features against various distortions. In order to further improve the training procedure while still preserving the discriminative characteristic of the system, only the fully-connected layer is fine-tuned in the supervised classification stage. The PCN is tested using a public BIT-Vehicle dataset which comprises 9850 surveillance-nature vehicle frontal-view images. The PCN can be easily implemented and readily compatible with many effective classifiers. Two classifiers, namely softmax classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are employed in this network and their classification performances are then compared. Both classifiers take less than 100 seconds in the training process and are able to produce an average accuracy of above 88.35%, even under various inferior imaging conditions.},

  abstract     = {As the population keeps growing, traffic congestion happens more and more often. Consequently, travel time has become an important indicator of driving experience. Accurate travel time information helps drivers plan their route more wisely and thus effectively alleviate traffic congestion. In this research, we propose a vehicle travel time prediction model for freeway traffic. The data used in this research are derived from the traffic dataset of the Taiwan Freeway Bureau, and the travel time prediction is made for the Sun Yat-sen Freeway between Taipei and Hsinchu. First, the missing value of the raw data is imputed by Autoencoder. The data are then segmented according to time series and are used to build the prediction model. To effectively capture the hidden features required to predict the travel time for the vehicle traveling on the freeway, a deep learning architecture is adopted in our system, which includes the GRU neural network model, the XGBoost model, and the Hybrid model that combines the GRU and XGBoost through linear regression. To increase computational efficiency, the travel time predictions for consecutive toll gates every 5 minutes apart are pre-computed offline, so that the online travel time prediction of the whole trip can be obtained by simply summing up a few numbers. Experimental results based on actual traffic data show that the proposed system can achieve good performance in terms of prediction accuracy and execution time.},

  abstract     = {As urban traffic condition is diverse and complicated, applying reinforcement learning to reduce traffic congestion becomes one of the hot and promising topics. Especially, how to coordinate the traffic light controllers of multiple intersections is a key challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Most existing MARL studies are based on traditional &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Q$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -learning, but unstable environment leads to poor learning in the complicated and dynamic traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent recurrent deep deterministic policy gradient (MARDDPG) algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for traffic light control (TLC) in vehiclar networks. Specifically, the centralized learning in each critic network enables each agent to estimate the policies of other agents in the decision-making process and each agent can coordinate with each other, alleviating the problem of poor learning performance caused by environmental instability. The decentralized execution enables each agent to make decisions independently. We share parameters in actor networks to speed up the training process and reduce the memory footprint. The addition of LSTM is beneficial to alleviate the instability of the environment caused by partial observable state. We utilize surveillance cameras and vehicular networks to collect status information for each intersection. Unlike previous work, we have not only considered the vehicle but also considered the pedestrians waiting to pass through the intersection. Moreover, we also set different priorities for buses and ordinary vehicles. The experimental results in a vehicular network show that our method can run stably in various scenarios and coordinate multiple intersections, which significantly reduces vehicle congestion and pedestrian congestion.},

Two complementary algorithms are demonstrated in this paper. The first algorithm uses iterative learning control (ILC) to simultaneously improve lateral and longitudinal tracking of the desired racing trajectory over multiple laps, while the second algorithm is focused on altering the trajectory itself using a search method. When driven experimentally at the limits of handling, the result is a reduction in lap time of nearly 1.4 seconds, a major improvement.},

  abstract     = {A representative driving cycle is crucial to estimating emissions and energy consumptions of vehicles. However, their traditional data acquisition is subject to large sampling requirements and high costs, whether a chase-car method or an on-board measurement method is adopted. Presently, the public transportation department and many private companies collect low-frequency driving data to track and monitor their vehicles. And a large number of typical driving cycles have been generated in the automobile field, which have been limited by the traditional designed method and have not been fully utilized. Herein, we investigate a driving cycle reconstruction method based on empirical information and low-frequency driving data. First, characteristic parameters were selected, based on the ergodicity of a Markov Chain method and an interpolation analysis of the low-frequency data. Second, similar driving cycles were grouped by K-means clustering and principal component analysis, based on the existing typical driving cycles. These were considered as empirical information of the original transient driving cycles. Ultimately, a Markov Chain evolution method based on the empirical information was used to reconstruct driving cycles. The method reconstructs driving cycles using low-frequency data of different sampling intervals, keeping the relative deviations of the characteristic parameters within a threshold range. In comparison with the original driving cycles having a 1-s sampling interval, the reconstructed cycles exhibit a high similarity with the original driving cycles in terms of their velocity and acceleration probability distribution and power spectral density. Additionally, calculation deviation of fuel consumption per 100 km is small. Therefore, this method can estimate energy consumption of urban vehicles in a timely and effective manner.},

In the design process of CACC controller, a parameter space approach and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) method are applied to guarantee the string stability and optimized performance. The influence of communication time delay and dropout rate is revealed by the changing of string stable region. Analytical results are verified by numerical simulations of a six-vehicle platoon where the leading vehicle follows the FTP-75 drive cycle speed profile. Furthermore, a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test is carried out with Carsim to simulate a high-fidelity vehicle dynamic model and dedicated short range communication (DSRC) modems as hardware in the loop as well as the control unit to achieve the inter-vehicle communication.

Existing scheduling approaches usually fall into biases and myopia due to their single target perspective of satisfying the immediate order acceptance, or maximizing the global business success rates.However, the highly complex spatiotemporal dependencies among multiple factors and the efficiency bottleneck of massive order flows make the taxicab scheduling issue still challenging. To this end, in our paper, we propose an integrated scheduling algorithm with both future-aware and context-aware mechanisms. In particular, we first present a generalized graph-based framework which aims to capture traffic dependencies, providing precise and quantified supply-demand prediction in taxicab scheduling. Then, we develop a measurement of regional supply-demand context to perform cooperative and distributed scheduling. To tackle the efficiency bottleneck in massive order flow scenario, we correspondingly design a model to learn business patterns with considering benefits from both drivers and passengers, and further promote service delivery rates via a novel bi-incentive strategy. Extensive numerical studies illustrate the remarkable significance of our method, in terms of both service delivery rates and global driver revenues. The promising results and brand-new perspectives enable our algorithm to be a paradigm in general spatiotemporal scheduling tasks.},

To prove the concept, a quad-element vivaldi array is located at the top part of the handset and the frame with grooves is placed in front of it. The groove dimensions that form the hard surface inspired structure are studied to provide the best gain and reflection coefficient performance. The impedance bandwidth achieved is 25.3-27.5 GHz. The radiation pattern plots show that the main beam direction corresponds to endfire, the same as the original array without the frame. The mm-wave array provides beam-steering properties with a scanning angle of ±65° for a realized gain higher than 7 dBi.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a physical layer security (PLS) scheme for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) based transceivers, termed link-signature-based discriminatory channel estimation (LS-DCE). The proposed scheme exploits the space-time uniqueness of the channel responses (i.e. link-signatures) at different transceiver pairs to facilitate a reliable signal reception at legitimate receivers, while equivocating reception at non-legitimate adversaries. While most PLS studies focus on transmitted data to provide such an equivocation, LSDCE focuses on channel estimations. Since the quality of estimates impacts the overall performance, LS-DCE facilitates distinctive detection error probabilities by enforcing a poor channel estimation at non-legitimate receivers as compared to legitimate ones. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, analytical, simulated, and experimental evaluations are performed. First, a theoretical analysis is established in terms of the probability of bit error (PBE) at the legitimate and non-legitimate receivers. Then, indoor/outdoor stochastic and deterministic channel models are adopted using correlated Nakagami-m simulation model and software-defined radio (SDR) testbed, respectively. With -10 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), it is found that a spatial correlation ≤ 0.1 between the legitimate and non-legitimate channels results in an average PBE of 0.48, 0.48, and 0.49 for BPSK, QPSK, and 16-QAM, respectively, at the non-legitimate receiver; and 0.45, 0.46, and 0.48 with 50 dB SNR.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a multi-feature fusion based propagation scene recognition model for high-speed railway (HSR) channels and presents the channel relevance analysis of HSR scenes. Extensive field measurement data in typical HSR scenes, including rural, station, suburban and multi-link scenes, are collected with the assist of railway long-term evolution (LTE) networks. The datasets of space-time-frequency channel features, involving Ricean K-factor, root mean square delay spread, Doppler spread, and angle spread, are generated for the model training and testing as well as the relevance analysis. The proposed model merges a weighted score fusion scheme into the deep neural network (DNN) in order to adaptively determine the optimal weights for each feature stream. This weighted score fusion based DNN model is implemented and evaluated in terms of accuracy, confusion matrix, F-score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which exhibits better performance than other machine learning models like random forest, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and weighted KNN. In addition, the channel relevance of HSR scenes is analyzed from perspectives of high-dimensional distribution distance and joint correlation of multiple features. Two metrics, Wasserstein distance and correlation matrix collinearity, are used in the analysis. Statistical results are provided, which reveals the relatively strong channel relevance between the multi-link and suburban scenes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the α-F composite fading distribution is introduced. It is worth highlighting that the α-F distribution offers more flexibility as it includes the composite F and the α-μ distributions, and their inclusive ones, as special cases. Moreover, unlike the compositeF and the α-μ distributions, the α-F distribution jointly considers two important effects, namely the shadowing and the non-linearity of the propagation medium. Novel exact closed-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF), cumulative density function (CDF), moment-generating function, and higher order moments of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio are derived. The PDF and CDF are then employed to analyze the performance of a wireless communication system. To this end, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability, average channel capacity, and average bit error rate for binary coherent and non-coherent modulation schemes as well as for M-ary modulation schemes. The analytical results are verified through numerical and Monte-Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that the system performance improves as the non-linearity of the propagation medium and (or) the multipath parameter increase(s). Additionally, the system performance improves as the shadowing parameter increases. To demonstrate practical applications of the α-F distribution, we apply it to realistic channel measurements obtained for two different wireless emerging applications, namely underwater acoustic and device-to-device communications. The results demonstrate that the PDF of the α-F distribution provide a good fit to the measured data PDFs compared with other well-known distributions, namely K, κ-μ shadowed, and α-μ distributions.},

In these situations, the time variation of channels shortens the channel coherence time and decreases the efficiency of traditional channel estimation schemes significantly. This paper focuses on the time-varying channel estimation problem in massive MIMO systems, where the mobility of BS/user is assumed to be high. The sparse property of the time-varying massive MIMO channels is analyzed, which reveals that the angular domain channels exhibit two kinds of spatial-temporal sparse (STS) structures, namely the temporal-common sparse structure and spatial-clustered sparse structure. By exploiting the STS structures, a novel structured variational Bayesian inference (VBI) framework is formulated to make a robust channel estimation during the training phase. A data-aided channel predication scheme is further proposed to combat the time variation of the channels during the data transmission phase without increasing the pilot consumption. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in the time-varying scenarios with different BS/user mobilities.},

We examine single carrier frequency domain processing (SC-FDP) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDM). In four scenarios. In the first scenario, which is the comprehensive scenario, we consider both the channel aging and channel estimation error effect due to Doppler Frequency. Therefore, we assume to have knowledge of the estimated channel in the previous block which was estimated in presense of Doppler shifts and noise. The other three scenarios are special cases of the first scenario which are studied to have a better insight on the Doppler effects on massive MIMO systems. In the second scenario the system is subject to both channel aging and channel estimation errors, but the channel estimation error is model with Gaussian noise. In the second scenario, we focus only on channel aging effect. In the fourth scenario, to investigate only the impact of channel time variation within the block duration, we assume perfect channel state information (CSI) with no channel aging. The results indicate that in all the scenarios, SC-FDP achieves higher sum-rate than OFDM. For the first scenario the sum-rate of both systems get bounded as the number of BS antennas tends to infinity. However, for the other three cases the sum-rate of SC-FDP, unlike OFDM, increases unboundedly as we increase the number of BS antennas. The results from the block error rate (BLER) studies validate the sum-rate results.},

A state-dependent undirected graph is introduced to depict the underlying communication topology. Coordinated control laws are established that, in addition to achieving consensus among trains at the reference displacement and speed profile and avoiding collision, preserve communication connectivity. It is worth mentioning that, for each train, only the position information from its neighboring trains is needed to cause speed and displacement consensus.

In order to preserve information privacy against the untrusted RUs, the trusted RUs are enabled with full-duplex (FD) capability and transmit a jamming signal towards the exotic RUs, while receiving and forwarding UL signal to the CU. Note that the transmitted jamming signal degrades the decoding capability at the untrusted RUs, however, it can be later subtracted from the UL communication as it is apriori known by the CU. An optimization problem is then formulated to maximize the sum uplink private information rate by jointly designing the fronthaul compression, as well as the information and jamming transmission strategies. Due to the intractability of the resulting mathematical problem, an iterative solution is proposed with convergence to a point satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a dual-hop wireless powered communication network (DH-WPCN), where the two-way communication between the users and the access point (AP) is assisted by a relay. Assuming a piece-wise linear energy harvesting (EH) model for the users and the relay, we investigate the problem of total throughput maximization for both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying modes. To deal with the non-convexity of the throughput maximization problem, we apply the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique and alternately optimize different blocks of optimization variables until convergence is achieved. Numerical results demonstrate the substantial performance gain of the proposed scheme with piece-wise linear EH model as compared to the case with oversimplified linear EH model. This is due to the fact that our proposed scheme takes into consideration the saturation effect of practical EH circuits in optimizing the resource allocation.},

The first scheme aims to jam the eavesdropping with highest power while meeting rate requirements without ECSI.

  abstract     = {A key challenge of enabling massive machine type communications (mMTC) is to support infrequent small data transmission from a large number of machine type devices (MTDs). Random access with spatial successive decoding allows a packet to be received by multiple receivers and decoded with successive interference cancellation (SIC) across receivers, increasing not only throughput but also reliability, which is a promising random access protocol for mMTC. However, its theoretical throughput analysis is still an open issue. To address this issue, an innovative bipartite graph based throughput analysis framework is proposed in this paper, in which multiple receivers serve as sum nodes, active users serve as burst nodes, independent on-off fading channels are used to model edges connecting sum nodes and burst nodes. With this bipartite graph representation, an and-or tree iteration with binomial distributed node perspective degree distribution is formalized to evaluate the asymptotic throughput of random access with spatial successive decoding. Moreover, as a byproduct theorem, an alternative simplified proof is given to derive the analytical throughput of random access with spatial diversity but without successive decoding. Comprehensive numerical results are provided to illustrate their critical performance characteristics and verify the advantages of including spatial diversity and successive decoding for random access.},

Second, with the derived bases, we flat the response of the passband by solving a max-min optimization problem using semidefinite relaxation technique. Third, we perform hybrid decomposition to achieve compatibility with phased array antenna with hybrid structure.

To reduce the receiver complexity for OTFS scheme, this paper proposes a variational Bayes (VB) approach as an approximation of the optimal MAP detection. Compared to the widely used message passing algorithm, we prove that the proposed iterative algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum of the approximated MAP detector regardless the resulting factor graph is loopy or not.

One of the basic elements of these systems is quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), which has in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) modulators. It is not uncommon for transceiver hardware to exhibit an imbalance in the I/Q components, causing degradation in data rate and signal quality. Under an amplitude and phase imbalance model at both the transmitter and receiver, 2D positioning performance in 5G mmWave systems is considered. Towards that, we derive the position and orientation error bounds and study the effects of the I/Q imbalance parameters on the derived bounds. The numerical results reveal that I/Q imbalance impacts the performance similarly, whether it occurs at the transmitter or the receiver, and can cause a degradation up to 12% in position and orientation estimation accuracy.},

In this paper, we consider the effect of in-phase/quadrature imbalance (IQI) on the process of SI cancellation in FD AF transceivers. We model the cumulative SI as a function of IQI, and thoroughly analyze the stability of the performance of the relay by analyzing the different transmission parameters and configurations that guarantee the stability of the system. In particular, depending on the RF impairments of the relay&#39;s transceiver, the wireless channel conditions, and the channel estimation accuracy, the relay&#39;s maximum amplification factor and transmission power that limit the residual SI power and prevent the system oscillations are analytically derived and verified by Monte-Carlo simulations.

  abstract     = {The recent advances in vehicular communications and networking are bringing self-driving vehicles closer to reality. Once full automation (i.e., levels 4 and 5 as defined in the five levels of autonomous driving) becomes a reality, entertainment services for both drivers and passengers will shift from listening to radios (or music) to watching videos. Hence, how to improve the quality of experience (QoE) for autonomous vehicle (AV) users, and to reduce the network load will become a crucial problem. Information-centric networking (ICN) is seen as one of the potential paradigms for next-generation networks, and could potentially be used for content distribution in vehicular networks. Caching, an important feature in ICN-based networks, is an efficient way to reduce network load, and to improve QoE for users. However, traditional reactive caching approaches are inefficient for AV users due to the high delay caused by their high speed. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical proactive caching approach that considers both users&#39; future demands and AV user mobility. The proposed approach uses the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) technique to predict user&#39;s preferences which are then used to predict users&#39; future demands by considering the historical popularity of videos. A user mobility prediction model is used to predict the AV users&#39; next location based on the current location and the planned route information which can be retrieved from the self-driving system. Based on the predicted users&#39; future demands and locations of AVs, the proposed caching approach can proactively cache videos that are likely to get requested at the next base station (BS) or roadside unit (RSU) that the users are moving to. The proposed approach has been evaluated under two scenarios: a highway scenario and a grid street scenario. Results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the efficiency of caching in terms of hit ratio and the average number of hops.},

One difference between a 5G-enabled model and a traditional model for vehicle ad hoc networks is that secure communication between vehicles in a 5G-enabled model is challenging. The authentication protocol proposed in this study can be divided into two parts. The first part involves authenticating and selecting an edge computing vehicle, wherein a fuzzy logic mathematical method is used in the selection process. The second part is the mutual authentication between edge computing and ordinary vehicles. In this process, the exchange of security information between vehicles in a group is possible. Simultaneously, the identity privacy and traceability of the vehicle are ensured. Moreover, the proposed signature scheme is proved to be secure under a random oracle model. Performance evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme has relatively lower computational and communication overhead than existing schemes.},

In this paper, we develop an accurate device-free action recognition system utilizing a Commodity Off-The-Shelf (COTS) router and propose a novel deep learning framework (termed two-stream network) mining spatial-temporal cues in channel state information (CSI). Specifically, an entire action sample is segmented into a series of coherent sub-activity clips. Then we try to capture the complementary features on appearance from the original CSI clips and motion between CSI frames. The spatial and temporal information are processed with separate networks which are then integrated for the final recognition task. The extensive experiments are implemented on the data collected from two indoor environments, respectively reaching 97.6% and 96.9% recognition accuracies.},

  abstract     = {The vehicular network needs efficient and reliable data communication technology to maintain low latency. It is very challenging to minimize the energy consumption and data communication delay while the vehicle is moving and wireless channels and bandwidth are time-varying. With the help of the emerging mobile edge computing (MEC) server, vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) can offload computing tasks to MEC associated with base station (BS). However, the environment for offloading tasks to MEC, e.g., wireless channel states and available bandwidth, is unstable. Therefore, ensuring the efficiency of computation offloading under such an unstable environment is a challenge. In this work, we design a task computation offloading model in a heterogeneous vehicular network; this model takes into account multiple stochastic tasks, the variety of wireless channels and bandwidth. To obtain the tradeoff between the cost of energy consumption and the cost of data transmission delay and avoid curse of dimensionality caused by the complexity of the large action space, we propose an adaptive computation offloading method based on deep reinforcement learning (ACORL) that can address the continuous action space. ACORL adds the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise vector to the action space with different factors for each action to validate the exploration. Multi transmission equipment can execute local processing and computation offloading to MEC. Nevertheless, ACORL considers the variety of wireless channels and available bandwidth between adjacent time slots. The numerical results illustrate that the proposed ACORL can effectively learn the optimal policy, which outperforms the Dueling DQN and greedy policy in the stochastic environment.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the formulation of power allocation for cluster based multihop vehicular relaying communications in order to improve the network quality-of-services (QoS). The cluster-to-cluster (C2C) channel is completely depend on the power gain of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channel that increases the difficulties of the power allocation problem. To meet this goal, we have derived a global channel obtained by joint V2V and C2C cooperation. The most challenging aspect is however the joint V2V and C2C power allocation of the global channel due to the association of its multi-variables objective function. To solve this problem, we apply an alternative optimization technique to make the global problem into a series of sub-problems. We then apply a semi-definite programming (SDP)-based iterative gradient descent (SDP-IGD) power allocation to assign power in each relay. The SDP-IGD power allocation algorithm has been extended from Lagrange Multiplier (LM) that provides better performance than separate LM technique. The minimum mean-square error (MMSE)-decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) is designed at the receiver to improve the signal detection capability under exact channel state information (CSI) in all forward-and-backward links. Finally, simulation results confirm that our proposed solution performs significantly superior compared to other solutions found in the literature.},

Current localization methods mainly depend on expensive acoustic positioning systems, which limit the wide application of AUVs. In this paper, referring to the low-cost visual localization method and focusing on challenges caused by underwater environment, we propose an underwater self-localization method based on Pseudo-3D vision-inertia for AUVs. The proposed method merges depth information into 2D visual image to achieve continuous and robust localization under dramatically changing underwater environment. In order to decrease errors, we propose an online fusion method based on tightly-coupled nonlinear optimization to fuse the measurements of the pre-integrated inertial measurement unit and the observations from the down-looking camera. We also optimize four degrees-of-freedom pose graph to enhance the global consistency and design an online loop detection module to realize the underwater relocalization. In addition, we develop a low-cost, portable, and small volume sensor suite for underwater vehicle localization and test the proposed self-localization method. We test the proposed method in the underwater environment using the custom-made sensor suite, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under dramatically changing underwater environment.},

  abstract     = {As software may be used by multiple users, caching popular software at the wireless edge has been considered to save computation and communications resources for mobile edge computing (MEC). However, fetching uncached software from the core network and multicasting popular software to users have so far been ignored. Thus, existing design is incomplete and less practical. In this paper, we propose a joint caching, computation and communications mechanism which involves software fetching, caching and multicasting, as well as task input data uploading, task executing (with non-negligible time duration) and computation result downloading, and mathematically characterize it. Then, we optimize the joint caching, offloading and time allocation policy to minimize the weighted sum energy consumption subject to the caching and deadline constraints. The problem is a challenging two-timescale mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, and is NP-hard in general. We convert it into an equivalent convex MINLP problem by using some appropriate transformations and propose two low-complexity algorithms to obtain suboptimal solutions of the original non-convex MINLP problem. Specifically, the first suboptimal solution is obtained by solving a relaxed convex problem using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and then rounding its optimal solution properly. The second suboptimal solution is proposed by obtaining a stationary point of an equivalent difference of convex (DC) problem using the penalty convex-concave procedure (Penalty-CCP) and ADMM. Finally, by numerical results, we show that the proposed solutions outperform existing schemes and reveal their advantages in efficiently utilizing storage, computation and communications resources.},

  abstract     = {The application of network slicing to mobile edge computing (MEC) systems has aroused great interests from both academia and industry. However, the optimization of network slicing and MEC in most existing research works only focuses on resource slicing, energy scheduling, and power allocation from the perspective of mobile devices, without considering the operator&#39;s revenue. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for network slicing in MEC systems, including slice request admission and a revenue model, to investigate the operator&#39;s revenue escalation problem while considering traffic variations. The revenue model is mainly composed of the longer-term revenue and short-term revenue. Particularly, we jointly optimize slice request admission in the long-term and resource allocation in the short-term to maximize the operator&#39;s average revenue. By employing the Lyapunov optimization technique, we develop an algorithm without requiring any prior-knowledge of traffic distributions, referred to as the DNSRA, to solve the problem. To reduce the computational complexity of directly solving the DNSRA, we decouple the optimization variables for efficient algorithm design. By this, the strategies for user association and CPU-cycle frequency are obtained in closed forms, respectively. Power allocation and subcarriers assignment are obtained by employing the successive convex approximation approach. Meanwhile, we develop a heuristic algorithm to obtain the dynamic slice request admission decision. Simulation results show that the proposed DNSRA can strike a flexible balance between the average revenue and the average delay, and can significantly increase the operator&#39;s revenue against existing schemes.},

In this paper, we develop an online network slicing scheduling strategy for joint resource block (RB) allocation and power control in vehicular networks. The long-term time-averaged total system capacity is maximized while guaranteeing strict ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements of vehicle communication links, subject to stability constraints of task queues. The formulated problem is a mixed integer nonlinear stochastic optimization problem, which is decoupled into three subproblems by leveraging Lyapunov optimization. In order to tackle this problem, we propose an online algorithm, namely JRPSV, to obtain the optimal RB allocation and power control at each time slot according to the current network state. Furthermore, rigorous theoretical analysis is conducted for the proposed JRPSV algorithm, indicating that the system capacity and the system average latency obey a [O(1/V ), O(V )] trade-off with the control parameter V . Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of JRPSV as well as the impacts of various parameters.},

  abstract     = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is an emerging IoT technology for improved performance of cellular networks in terms of aspects like spectral efficiency, battery lifetime, coverage range. The 5G cellular network is supposed to provide a perception of 99.999% network availability. One of the approaches to obtain it is by intercell D2D communication that eliminates the issue of unavailability of bandwidth between two users connected with different base stations (BSs). The interference mitigation is a key challenge while using licensed cellular spectrum for D2D links. It is seen that the resource allocation to the D2D links is a complex problem when D2D pairs are connected with different base stations. This paper presents a dynamic Resource-Block (RB) sharing scheme between the D2D users and cellular users in a multi-cell cellular network. Here a D2D user pair plays a Repeated Game with the nearby base stations in such a way that the players share a subset of their initial allotted resource to maximize their utility. The game is played by every intercell D2D player with the base stations simultaneously. We show that the punishment period of a deviating player may be reduced by invoking an additional penalty factor for its fast adherence. In addition, we also compute the optimal number of initial orthogonal RBs that is allocated to the D2D and the cellular users. Evaluation of our proposed scheme in comparison to few well known existing techniques shows a marked improvement in throughput of the overall system.},

  abstract     = {Distributed storage systems can provide reliable service of data storage. Lots of scenarios, such as data center, P2P network are all applications of distributed storage systems. There are mainly three storage schemes for distributed storage systems, including replication, erasure codes and regenerating codes[2]. With the same storage space, more reliable data storage is assured by erasure codes than replication. However, replication can save more repair bandwidth (i.e., the communication cost for node repair) than erasure codes. To ensure both high reliability and low repair bandwidth, regenerating codes are intensively investigated. In practical systems, the communication between two nodes may be restricted by physical factors or economic considerations, such as transmission distance or network traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel model considering the connectivity limitations in ring networks. Each node can only connect to or communicate with its neighbors within a given range. Inspired by the concept of regenerating codes, we investigate the theoretical necessary condition for all possible storage codes. Then, a tradeoff between storage space and repair bandwidth is derived by analyzing the information flow graph of our model. Two interesting points on the tradeoff curve are further investigated, corresponding to the ring minimum-storage-regenerating (rMSR) codes, and the ring minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (rMBR) codes. Besides, two types of code constructions are presented. (i) For both rMSR and rMBR codes, we provide code constructions under exact repair models. (ii) Under functional repair models, we derive the size of the coding finite field, based on which the algorithm in [3] can be applied to construct the corresponding codes.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a realistic feasibility of radio frequency identification (RFID) based self-localization of objects in real environments using simple infrastructure composed of chipless tags. These tags are designed as arrays of dielectric resonators (DR) in order to overcome the range limitations of the traditional chipless tags, where the DR array structure of the tags boosts the radar cross section (RCS) and, consequentially, extends the range coverage. Furthermore, an efficient algorithm for tag detection is proposed considering the environmental and hardware impairments that alter the backscattered signal from the tag. In this system, the reader interrogates the reference nodes, i.e. chipless tags, by a frequency-sweep RF signal, and the backscattered signals from the tags are captured and analyzed at the reader for detection, ranging and location estimation. A testbed is implemented with fabricated chipless RFID tags in order to evaluate the validity and accuracy of the proposed self-localization system. Experimental measurements based simulations are conducted in several scenarios in order to evaluate the proposed system. Moreover, an object (the reader) is moved to several locations in an interrogation area of $2.5\times 1.2$ m, and, afterwards, its location is estimated. The averaged measured location error achieved based on the proposed system is approximately 5 cm with a variation of 0.9 cm as a minimum observed error and 7 cm as a maximum error.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the scheduling design of a mobile edge computing (MEC) system, where active mobile devices with computation tasks randomly appear in a cell. Every task can be computed at either the mobile device or the MEC server. We jointly optimize the task offloading decision, uplink transmission device selection and power allocation by formulating the problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP). Compared with most of the existing literature, this is the first attempt to address the transmission and computation optimization with random device arrivals in an infinite time horizon to our best knowledge. Due to the uncertainty in the device number and location, the conventional approximate MDP approaches addressing the curse of dimensionality cannot be applied. An alternative and suitable low-complexity solution framework is proposed in this work. We first introduce a baseline scheduling policy, whose value function can be derived analytically with the statistics of random mobile device arrivals. Then, one-step policy iteration is adopted to obtain a sub-optimal scheduling policy whose performance can be bounded analytically. The complexity of deriving the sub-optimal policy is reduced dramatically compared with conventional solutions of MDP by eliminating the complicated value iteration. To address a more general scenario where the statistics of random mobile device arrivals are unknown, a novel and efficient algorithm integrating reinforcement learning and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is proposed to improve the system performance in an online manner. Simulation results show that the gain of the sub-optimal policy over various benchmarks is significant.},

  abstract     = {Vehicles equipped with sensors can participate in mobile crowdsourcing applications. Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) based on Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) are used to carry sensing data. However, multi-hop transmissions for gathering data to Road Side Units (RSUs) in VANETs suffer from low data rate and long end-to-end delay, which can hardly meet the QoS requirements of delay-sensitive services. This triggers the consideration of constituting a DSRC and Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) hybrid vehicular network. Nevertheless, using cellular links to carry traffic can cause high cellular bandwidth costs. In this paper, we propose a Traffic Differentiated Clustering Routing (TDCR) mechanism in a Software Defined Network (SDN)-enabled hybrid vehicular network. The proposed mechanism includes a centralized one-hop clustering approach and a data delivery optimization method. Particularly, the optimization is to make a tradeoff between cellular bandwidth cost and end-to-end delay, for Cluster Heads (CHs) delivering their aggregated data either by multi-hop Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) transmissions or by cellular networks. Since the problem is proven to be NP-hard, a two-stage heuristic algorithm is designed. We carry out simulations to evaluate the performance of our data collection scheme and the results show that it performs better than traditional mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The present world of vehicle technology is inclined to develop Electric Vehicles (EVs) with various optimized features. These vehicles need frequent charging which takes a longer time to charge up. Therefore, scheduling of vehicles in charging stations is required. Besides, the information of the EVs and its location is also stored by the charging stations and therefore creates a concern of EV privacy. Various researches are going on to solve these problems; however, an efficient privacy-preserving solution is less practiced till date. In this paper, a framework for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging is discussed. The framework uses the concept of Matching Market to identify a charging station and uses the lattice-based cryptography for secure communications. The matching market considers multiple factors to provide the best allocation of charging station and cryptography ensures security and privacy preservation. The use of lattice-based cryptographic hash SWIFFT avoids heavy computation. This usage of matching market and lattice cryptography, more specifically signcryption for EV charging framework are the highlights of the solution and add-ons to the novel features. Overall, the presented framework is efficient in terms of computation and communication cost, satisfaction ratio, slot ratio, charging latency and load balancing index. The performance metrics are compared with recent developments in this field.},

Specifically, we investigate the WPCN using non-orthogonal multiple access, where all nodes transmit information simultaneously to H-sink and H-sink performs successive interference cancellation to alleviate the noise from other nodes. Energy transfer duration, data transmit powers of nodes and the decoding order of nodes&#39; signals are jointly optimized to maximize the CT. We first formulate the CT maximization (CTM) as a non-convex optimization problem, then separate the CTM problem into a number of subproblems to solve, and finally recover the optimal solution of the original problem from the optimal solutions of subproblems. Our CTM scheme significantly outperforms the available scheme using up all harvested energy. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm to maximize the sum throughput while guaranteeing that the maximum CT is achieved. This scheme further greatly increases the sum throughput.},

Furthermore, it utilizes the anchor information to detect and to compensate for measurement errors. We have proven the correctness of the rigidity graph construction by TRiForm. We have also evaluated TRiForm in various scenarios using simulation with the measured parameters from real underwater sensor nodes.

  abstract     = {In Cache-enabled dense small cell networks (DSCNs), energy consumption and file delivery delay are two critical performance metrics. On the other hand, power control is an essential mechanism to mitigate inter-cell interference in DSCNs. However, the impact of power control at small base stations (SBSs) on the system performance when caches are involved has not been well studied. Observing energy consumption and file delivery delay are coupled with each other in cache-enabled DSCNs, different from existing studies, we attempt to optimize these two performance metrics at the same time, taking into account sophisticated power control at SBSs. Firstly, we formulate the energy-delay optimization problem as a utility maximization problem, where cooperative power control among SBSs, file placement and user association are considered. Then, we solve the optimization problem in two stages (i.e., caching stage and delivery stage), based on the fact that caching is performed during off-peak time. At the caching stage, a local popular file placement policy is proposed by estimating user preference at each SBS. At the delivery stage, with given caching status at SBSs, the optimization problem is further decomposed by Benders&#39; decomposition method. An efficient algorithm is proposed to approach the optimal association and power solution by iteratively shrinking the gap of the upper and lower bounds. Finally, extensive simulations are performed to validate our analytical and algorithmic work. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve a better tradeoff between energy consumption and file delivery delay than the existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We study the physical-layer security of multiple source-destination (SD) pairs communicating within a wireless network in the face of an eavesdropper attacking the SD pairs. In order to protect the wireless transmission against eavesdropping, we propose a cooperation framework relying on two stages. Specifically, an SD pair is selected to access the total allocated spectrum using an appropriately designed scheme at the beginning of the first stage. The other source nodes (SNs) simultaneously transmit their data to the SN of the above-mentioned SD pair relying on orthogonal resources during the first stage. Then, the SN of the chosen SD pair transmits the data packets containing its own messages and the other SNs&#39; messages to its dedicated destination node (DN) in the second stage. Finally, this dedicated DN will forward all the other DNs&#39; data to the application center via the core network. We conceive a specific SD pair selection scheme, termed as the transmit antenna selection aided source-destination pair selection (TAS-SDPS). We continue by deriving the secrecy outage probability (SOP) expressions of both the TAS-SDPS conceived, as well as of the conventional round-robin source-destination pair selection (RSDPS) and of the conventional non-cooperative (Non-coop) schemes for comparison. Furthermore, we carry out the secrecy diversity gain analysis in the high main-to-eavesdropper ratio (MER) region, showing that the TAS-SDPS scheme is capable of achieving the maximum attainable secrecy diversity order. Additionally, we show that increasing the number of transmitting pairs will reduce the SOP, whilst increasing the secrecy diversity order of the TAS-SDPS scheme. It is demonstrated that the SOP of the TAS-SDPS scheme is better than that of the RSDPS and of the conventional Non-coop schemes. We also demonstrate that the secrecy diversity gain of the proposed TAS-SDPS scheme is $M$ times that of the RSDPS scheme in the high-MER region, where $M$ is the number of the SD pairs.},

This paper studies UAV as aerial base station (BS) enabled wireless communication system, where a UAV is dispatched to provide wireless communication service to a set of ground users with difference quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements. In real world, user requirements are randomly and unevenly distributed. In addition, UAV communication coverage and on-board energy are limited and system resources are also limited (e.g., transmission power, spectrum). In order to meet the QoE of all users with limited system resources and limited UAV energy, we jointly optimize user communication scheduling, UAV trajectory, transmit power and bandwidth allocation to maximize energy-efficiency and satisfy user QoE requirement. The formulated problem is mixes integer non-convex and non-concave so it is difficult to solve. In this paper, we solvevv the problem with two steps as follows. Firstly, we transform the objective function into a tractable form. Secondly, we divide the optimal problem into four sub-optimal problems, and then use a powerful iterative algorithm with the Dinkelbach and block coordinate descent to solve the optimal problem. That is to say, the user scheduling, UAV trajectory, transmission power and bandwidth allocation are alternately optimized in each iteration. Extensive simulation results present that our proposed method can obtain higher energy efficiency than that of baselines. Specifically, the energy efficiency obtained by our proposed method is 12.5% higher than the approach that only maximizes throughput.},

In this paper, we investigate the secure communication between the on-board unit and the roadside unit which has strong computing ability to remedy the insufficient computing power of on-board unit. The novel schemes are developed to guarantee both security and energy harvest. Specifically, a muti-antenna roadside unit (PT) conveys a secret message to a muti-antenna primary on-board unit (PR) intercepted by multiple muti-antenna adversaries (Eves). Simultaneously, a secondary roadside unit (ST) adopts simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) strategy to send secret-free data embeded with energy-carrying artificial noise (AN) to its service subscriber (SR), by which secrecy guarantee is provided for the primary on-board unit and the quality of service (QoS) is satisfied, i.e., data traffic and harvested energy. Technically, considering the secondary link&#39;s data transmission rate, harvested energy, and transmit power, we propose joint power allocation designs for the nonconvex secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problems under either perfect channel state information (CSI) or norm-bounded channel uncertainty model. Simulation results show that the proposed secondary link-aided secrecy designs can achieve better performance in terms of secrecy rate and energy efficiency.},

  abstract     = {With the continually increasing demand for higher data rate and link density as well as better network coverage, wireless networks, including 5G-enabled vehicular communication network (VCN), will be designed/deployed to cover more overlapping areas, experiencing more severe interferences. As a result, interference becomes a key impediment to the improvement of network performance, thus requiring a thorough investigation. There have been numerous interference management (IM) methods, of which interference alignment (IA) has been receiving significant attention in recent years. IA compresses the dimension of interference subspace by confining multiple interfering signals into a finite subspace, so that the desired signal subspace may be maximized. However, when IA is applied to the situation where multiple interferences are from the same source, the interference subspace cannot be compressed due to the fact that if these interfering components are aligned in the same direction at their unintended receiver (Rx), they will become indistinguishable at their desired Rx. To solve this problem, we propose Inside-Out Precoding (IOP). With IOP, multiple data streams that may cause interference to the other Rx are at first pre-processed at the interfering transmitter (Tx), by employing an inner-precoder which makes the streams spatially separable, and then, by exploiting interactions among wireless signals, multiple interfering components are treated as an effective interference to which an outer-precoder is applied, so that multiple interferences can be compressed into one dimension at the interfered Rx while making them distinguishable at their desired Rx. We present two IOP realizations - forward IOP (F-IOP) and backward IOP (B-IOP) - and propose a protocol to realize the synchronization of processing parameters at the interfering Tx and its intended Rx so that the Rx can adapt itself to the precoding strategy employed at the Tx side. Our in-depth analysis and simulation results have shown that the proposed IOP can effectively manage multiple interferences from the same source while guaranteeing the performance of transmission from the interfering Tx to its intended Rx.},

Downlink sparse beamforming and uplink power control are effective methods to reduce cross-link interference involved in NAFD with finite-capacity backhaul. We study joint downlink beamforming and power control for NAFD by maximizing the aggregated uplink and downlink spectral efficiency subject to quality-of-service constraints and backhaul constraints. Two approaches have been proposed to solve the optimization problem, where the first approach converts the objective function to the difference of two convex functions with semi-definite relaxation, and then, an iterative SDR-block coordinate descent method is applied to solve the problem. The second method is based on sequential parametric convex approximation.

We characterize the impact of battery charging in the charging area by designing an optimal spectrum sensing policy. The objective is to maximize the secondary throughput subject to energy and collision constraints. To be specific, a metric defined as a function of the spectrum sensor detection threshold is proposed to divide the CRN into three network states with respect to the relationship among energy consumption, energy harvesting, and battery charging. Accordingly, ST in the charging area decides to charge the battery or to exploit transmission opportunity. In each network state, we optimize the spectrum sensor detection threshold for the objective, which is a challenging problem since the spectrum sensor detection threshold is intertwined with the energy constraint, the collision constraint, and secondary throughput. Then we characterize the impact of battery charging in the charging area on the state classification and optimal spectrum sensing, respectively.

In this work, we propose a novel cross-layer design to enhance the delivery of emergency messages so that accidents can be further avoided. Particularly, in the PHY layer, imperfect full-duplex (FD) simultaneous transmitting and sensing is analysed and dynamic thresholds for determining the channel status before and during transmissions are mathematically formulated. Then a novel FD MAC protocol, named priority-based multiple access (PBMA), based on prioritised messaging between different vehicles is proposed. Average collision probability, collision duration, waiting time as well as successful delivery rate of the system are formulated too. The delivery performance of emergency messages is also mathematically derived. In addition, comparisons have been made among three different mechanisms. Benchmark is the DSRC standard which uses half-duplex (HD) technology with enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) protocol. We also compare our proposed protocol with FD EDCA. Simulations have verified the accuracy of our analysis. They have also illustrated the delivery of emergency messages has been enhanced by deploying our proposed design.},

  abstract     = {In the heterogeneous networks (HetNets), the downlink-uplink decoupled (DUDE) user association is a very promising technology that can employ different association strategies for uplink and downlink. The DUDE mode has great potential for improving system capacity and frequency efficiency. However, interference between the DUDE user equipment (DUDE UE), macro user equipment (MUE) and small user equipment (SUE) still needs to be considered and properly tackled. Therefore, this paper presents an optimization scheme of frequency allocation and power control to improve the communication quality of users. Firstly, the multiple region frequency allocation (MRFA) scheme is proposed for non-uniform user distribution to alleviate interference among users and allocate spectrum resources equally to dense users. This scheme is modelled as a sub-region partition problem with maximum sum rate, which can disperse densely distributed users to different sub-bands for transmission. Secondly, the convergent power control (CPC) algorithm is considered to improve the transmission performance of each user. It can converge the transmit power to the optimal transmit power for reducing interference among co-channel users when there is no disturbance in the network. The CPC algorithm can also make the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) of each active user always greater than the target threshold until the end of communication by dynamically adjusting the transmit power of users. Simulation results show that the joint scheme of MRFA and CPC achieves a higher system throughput and better user performance than existing frequency allocation schemes or power control schemes.},

In this paper, we study the performance of full duplex amplify and forward (AF) relaying-based vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative wireless communications over Nakagami-m fading channels. In such systems, in practical scenarios, the communication link inevitably suffers from co-channel interference, residual self-interference, and blockage from other vehicles on the road. In this context, we consider independent and not necessarily identically distributed (i.n.i.d) Nakagami-m fading channels and derive novel exact and asymptotic outage probabilities of the exact equivalent and approximated signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), respectively. Building on this, the end-to-end exact and asymptotic outage probabilities are expressed in terms of the blockage probability and then used to evaluate the throughput of the proposed system. In addition, a lower bound to the symbol error rate of the considered system is also derived. Monte-Carlo simulation results are provided to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed analytical expressions. The results demonstrate the significant impact of the considered interference and blockage on the system performance. Precisely, it is shown that the system performance is degraded when the average height of the obstacles is increased. This highlights the importance of taking into account these phenomena in the performance evaluation in order to assess the practical limit of V2V cooperative wireless communications.},

Accurate prediction of video traffic can endow networks with intelligence in resource management, especially for the forthcoming beyond the fifth-generation (B5G) networks. However, the existing approaches fail to accurately predict video traffic with all types of frames, due to the natures of strong long-range dependence, self-similarity and burstiness. Obviously, it is unable to meet the QoS and QoE requirements of dynamic bandwidth allocation. In this paper, we propose the feasibility of advanced machine learning methodology applied in nonstationary video traffic prediction, i.e., smoothing-aided support vector machine (SSVM) model. The model utilizes classical smoothing methods to preprocess video traffic by relieving the drastic fluctuation of video stream. It can provide an effective association for the subsequent support vector regression, as the preprocessed data becomes more smooth and continuous than the original unprocessed one. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state of the art model, i.e., logistic smooth transition autoregressive, in prediction performance. The superior nonlinear approximation capacity is further demonstrated by visualized statistical analysis.},

Moreover, the analysis of the conventional space-time transmission (STT) is carried out as a baseline. In order to intuitively show the effect of the number of antennas on secrecy outage performance, the secrecy diversity analysis for STT, SAS and OAS schemes is carried out through the asymptotic secrecy outage probability as the MER (the average gains between main channel from S to D and wiretap channel from S to E) tends to infinity. Additionally, the results show that the secrecy diversities of STT, SAS and OAS are the product of the number of antennas at S and D, which has no relation to E.

In this paper, we design a novel non-slotted A-BFT frame structure for multi-users in order to alleviate packet collisions providing flexible training slots. To further reduce collision occurrence, we propose two association mechanisms including the time-based distributed coordination function (TDCF) and time-based beam collision avoidance (TBCA) schemes. The theoretical closed-forms of both TDCF and TBCA methods are also derived, and proved to outperform the random association. Furthermore, the adaptive beam search (ABS) and dynamic A-BFT adjustment (DAA) schemes are proposed to consider historical beam training information by adjusting the number of training beams and A-BFT length, respectively.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates pilot design and allocation in multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output systems with two-tier receiving. As the length of pilot is limited, the pilots cannot be orthogonal and cause interference. The sum rate as well as the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the system are firstly analyzed. The sum rate upper bound and the asymptotic SINR are derived. The analysis shows that the pilot correlation and the spatial correlation jointly affect the sum rate. Based on this observation, the discrete Fourier transform vectors are employed in designing pilots with various correlation values. Then, with the channel correlation information and the designed pilots, the pilots are allocated to the cells in a greedy way with the object of maximizing the sum rate upper bound. Moreover, the sum rate analysis, the pilot design, and the pilot allocation are extended to the scenario with grouped correlations. Simulation results show that the proposed pilot design and allocation performs better than other pilots and the derived upper bound is effective.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes two low-cost precoding architectures for massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems to alleviate multiuser interference, where one has the objective of reducing the power consumption of the conventional 1-bit precoding architecture and the another has the objective of improving the performance of the conventional 1-bit precoding schemes. However, jointly identifying the precoding factor and the precoding vector of the proposed precoding architectures is intractable because they are coupled together. We address this issue by utilizing an alternating minimization (AltMin) framework to optimize alternatively the precoding factor and the precoding vector. Nevertheless, this framework experiences difficulty in optimizing the precoding vector, which we address by proposing a machine learning-inspired algorithm developed from the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) framework to obtain a near-optimal precoding vector. Although the CEO-based AltMin algorithm provides excellent performance, the complexity of the CEO part is relatively high. We thus develop an AltMin algorithm using a sequential greedy descent algorithm as a low-complexity counterpart of the CEO-based AltMin algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the proposed precoding algorithms can successfully determine the weights of the proposed precoding architectures, thereby providing considerable performance improvements over previous 1-bit precoding algorithms. Moreover, the hardware complexity and power consumption of the proposed precoding architectures are considerably lower than those of previous 1-bit precoding architectures.},

In this paper, we propose an innovative idea to proactively manipulate, reconfigure, and augment wireless transmission environments to better support end-to-end services. Specifically, we implement this idea into the commercialized millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless local area networks (WLANs) to address the vulnerability to blockages in mmWave bands. Without damaging the aesthetic nature of environments, we deploy multiple small-piece highly-reflective metallic reflecting surfaces as tunable reflectors, where alternative indirect line-of-sight links are created by tuning the orientations of the reflecting surfaces. To demonstrate our idea, we devise a novel adaptive mechanism, mmRef, to enable the implementation of tunable reflectors in mmWave WLANs, where the system architecture, operational procedures, and the signaling process are developed, respectively. To theoretically quantify the expected benefits, we characterize the outage probability and system throughput of mmRef mechanism based on stochastic geometry theory. Simulation and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing mmRef and the significantly improved system performance.},

The paper proposed a cooperative secrecy transmission mechanism, which can take advantage of transmitter signal of primary user (PU) as a dedicated radio frequency (RF) source with decode and forward (DF) UAV selection and energy harvesting (EH) under cognitive network. Specifically, the transmitting signal of PU in the cognitive network can be viewed and used as energy to drive secondary user (SU) nodes and multi-relay nodes to send signals. It was worth noting that the DF UAV relay may bring about the unexpected noise and decrease the received signal to noise ratio (SNR), therefore, the multiple UAV assisted relays selected with secrecy capacity maximization criteria under cognitive network was proposed and investigated in detail, where the destination node equipped with multiple antennas and adopted the optimal antenna selection receiver. Moreover, By using the function analysis method, the closed expressions of the system secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity were calculated and derived accurately. Furthermore, the asymptotic expressions of the UAV assisted relay system under the large SNR cases were analyzed in detail, where the expressions of secrecy diversity order and secrecy diversity gain of the UAV assisted relay cognitive system were obtained thoroughly.

The maximum ratio combining and maximum ratio transmission are used at the base station (BS) for the uplink and downlink, respectively. By leveraging on the additive quantization noise model, tight closed-form approximations of the uplink and downlink achievable rates are obtained for both perfect and imperfect channel state information cases. The results show the impact of the Rician K-factor, ADC/DAC resolution, loop interference, and inter-user interference of the systems. In addition, we adopt the power scaling law to show that to achieve a fixed level of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, the transmit power of each user and the BS can be scaled down proportionally to the inverse of the BS antenna number. Moreover, we compare the performance of the FD mode and the half-duplex mode, and study the trade-off between the achievable rate and BS energy efficiency. Numerical results show that the use of low-resolution ADCs/DACs can significantly improve the BS energy efficiency with only small reduction in the achievable rate of the FD system.},

  abstract     = {This article considers a multi-pair massive multiple-input multiple-output relaying channel where K single-antenna sources communicate with K single-antenna destinations via the assistance of a decode-and-forward relay equipped with massive antenna arrays. The relay station uses maximum-ratio processing to decode the signals transmitted from the sources and precode the signals before broadcasting to the destinations. To perform maximum-ratio processing, the relay needs to know the channels to the sources and the destination. This is done during the training phase where all sources and destinations send pilot sequences to the relay. We consider a very general case in which the pilot sequences are arbitrary. An exact closed-form expression for the end-to-end spectral efficiency is derived taking into account the imperfect channel estimates with arbitrary power control coefficients. From the spectral efficiency formula, we formulate and propose to solve a max-min fairness power allocation. With this power control scheme, the spectral efficiency improves significantly, compared to the uniform power control. In particular, a simple greedy pilot assignment scheme is proposed to reduce the pilot contamination effect, and hence, improve the system performance under the limitations of training duration.},

As variable gain AF relay network is considered, processing delay results in outdated channel state information (CSI) during amplification at the relay. For general applicability, the RF link is modeled with the generalized Nakagami-m fading. The FSO link is modeled with the Gamma-Gamma distribution which is affected with the atmospheric turbulence and pointing error impairments, and both the intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) and heterodyne detection are employed at the FSO receiver. In this context, analytical expressions of outage probability and ergodic capacity are derived in terms of Meijer-G function and extended generalized bivariate Meijer-G function. For diversity order, asymptotic outage probability expression is also derived. Further, cumulative distribution function based generalized average symbol error rate expressions for various quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes such as hexagonal QAM, rectangular QAM, and cross QAM are derived in terms of Meijer-G function. Furthermore, a detailed comparative study of various modulation schemes is presented and the impact of pointing error, atmospheric turbulence, outdated CSI, and Nakagami-m parameter are highlighted on the system performance.

The received power levels of SMTs in different groups are designed by taking into account their path losses, which effectively reduces the energy consumption of SMTs. The threshold based capture model at the gateway demodulator is adopted, and the packet loss ratio (PLR) based on this model is derived by using density evolution analysis. An optimization problem is formulated and solved to jointly find the optimal number of power levels and the optimal values of power levels, which maximizes the RA system throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can obtain considerable performance improvement with respect to the conventional schemes in terms of normalized throughput, PLR, and average energy consumption.},

Meanwhile, Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, as an underlay to cellular networks, is also a proposed solution to promote the spectrum efficiency. However, it is a challenge to design an appropriate virtual resource slicing strategy among different wireless service providers in the two-tier LTE-D2D networks. In this paper, considering dynamic traffic arrivals and time-varying channel conditions, the virtualized resource management in the multi-service coexisting LTE-D2D networks is formulated into a multi-objective stochastic optimization problem. Leveraging on weighted Tchebycheff approach and Lyapunov optimization technique, the multi-objective stochastic optimization problem can be transformed into a delay-aware optimization problem, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and can be transformed into a convex one by a series of reformulation. A distributed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to obtain a close-to-optimal solution with a lower computational complexity. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a performance-delay tradeoff related to the control factor V with at most 0.2% performance loss compared with the optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {We consider a multi-antenna wireless system consisting of a source transmitting to its destination with limited feedback, where the channel state information (CSI) is considered to be quantized and fed back from the destination to the source in the face of channel quantization errors (CQE). We propose a multi-antenna precoding (MAP) scheme to mitigate an adverse effect of the CQE, which is called the CQE oriented MAP and denoted CQE-MAP for short. Typically, using more channel quantization bits enhances the accuracy of quantized CSI acquired at the source and improves the data rate of the source-destination transmission, which, however, results in an increase of the CSI feedback overhead. We define an effective throughput as the difference of the data transmission rate and the CSI feedback rate that is used for characterizing the system overhead of sending the quantized CSI. An optimization analysis of the CQE-MAP scheme is carried out in terms of maximizing the effective throughput with regard to the number of quantization bits per channel. It is proved that the conventional maximal ratio transmission (MRT) based MAP method denoted by MRT-MAP could be a special case of the proposed CQE-MAP scheme for centralized antenna systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the CQE-MAP generally achieves a higher effective throughput than the MRT-MAP for distributed antenna systems, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. It is also illustrated that the effective throughput of CQE-MAP scheme can be further maximized through an optimization of the number of quantization bits per channel. Moreover, with an increase of the SNR or a decrease of the terminal moving speed, an increased number of quantization bits per channel is needed for the sake of maximizing the effective throughput.},

Specifically, safety applications should be delivered in a reliable manner within a limited time period. Several time division multiple access (TDMA) protocols have been proposed to realize this. However, most of the existing research have proposed slot management approaches by taking into account the static topology; they have not sufficiently discussed research on “merging collision” arising from overlapping two or more collision domains due to vehicle mobility. In this study, we examine the effect of merging collision in terms of packet delivery ratio, overhead, and inter-basic safety message (inter-BSM) delay. 11 Delay between BSMs received in succession. To mitigate the effect of merging collision, we also propose a lightweight distributed TDMA protocol, where the order of vehicles on the road and their relative distances are exploited to determine the dedicated slot. The collision is further resolved using in-band signaling from the surrounding vehicles. Simulation studies show that the proposed scheme improves the performance of the packet delivery ratio (PDR) 10% more than the comparative protocol, and consequently achieves 97% and 95% PDRs, in highway and urban environment, respectively. Furthermore, the overhead and inter-BSM delay are substantially reduced.},

  abstract     = {In device-to-device (D2D) underlaying vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, radio resource blocks (RBs) are allocated to primary cellular users, which yields sub-optimal rates and a long access latency for secondary D2D-enabled vehicles. This work investigates a joint radio resource and power management (RRPM) problem for secure cellular underlaying V2V communications, where cellular users and vehicles have the same priority, giving vehicles more opportunities to access the RBs. Specifically, we aim to maximize secrecy rates of V2V channels under the condition that eavesdropper has an adaptive receiving detection vector to maximize the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) from vehicles. For a single pair of a vehicle and a cellular user, the closed-form optimal power allocation expressions are derived for the interference-limited scenario and the noise-limited scenario, respectively. Moreover, for multiple pairs of vehicles and cellular users, a 3-partite hypergraph based 3-dimensional matching approach is proposed to solve a mixed-integer and non-convex problem, which achieves a near-optimal result with an &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(n^4)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; time complexity.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the information-energy (I-E) region for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) networks in mobility scenarios, where a moving transmitter simultaneously transmits information and power to a fixed receiver, and the receiver adopts power splitting (PS) receiving architecture. In order to characterize the tradeoff between the received information and harvested energy, the I-E region is defined, and corresponding optimization problems are formulated to explore the system I-E regions by jointly optimizing the transmit power at the transmitter and the PS ratio at the receiver with three popular energy harvesting (EH) models, i.e., traditional linear EH model, the logistic nonlinear EH model and the piecewise nonlinear EH model. Particularly, to efficiently solve the nonconvex optimization problem with the logistic nonlinear EH model, a successive convex approximate (SCA)-based algorithm is proposed, which is able to characterize the lower bound of the I-E with low complexity. To solve the optimization problems with the linear and piecewise EH models, as they are convex, some closed and semi-closed solutions are derived by using Lagrange dual method and KKT conditions. Numerical results show that compared with the I-E regions under the linear and piecewise EH models, that under the logistic nonlinear EH model is smaller due to the limitations of practical EH circuit features. Moreover, with a fixed moving speed, when the transmit power is relatively large, the logistic nonlinear EH model can be replaced with the piecewise one due to the relatively small gap between their achieved I-E regions. Additionally, for a fixed moving track length, the higher moving speed yields the smaller I-E region with all three EH models.},

A novel cooperative downlink multicell MISO beamforming scheme is proposed with highly limited information exchange among the base stations (BSs) to maximize the sum-rate. In the proposed scheme, each BS can design its beamforming vector with only local CSI based on limited information exchange on CSI. Unlike previous studies, the proposed beamforming design is non-iterative and does not require any vector or matrix feedback but requires only quantized scalar information. The proposed scheme closely achieves the optimal sum-rate bound in almost all signal-to-noise ratio regime based on non-iterative optimization with lower amount of information exchange than existing schemes, which is justified by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) have been slowly replacing conventional fuel based vehicles since the last decade. EVs are not only environment-friendly but when used in conjunction with a smart grid, also open up new possibilities and a Vehicle-Smart Grid ecosystem, commonly called V2G can be achieved. This would not only encourage people to switch to environment-friendly EVs or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), but also positively aid in load management on the power grid, and present new economic benefits to all the entities involved in such an ecosystem. Nonetheless, privacy and security remain a serious concern of smart grids. The devices used in V2G are tiny, inexpensive, and resource constrained, which renders them susceptible to multiple attacks. Any protocol designed for V2G systems must be secure, lightweight, and must protect the privacy of the vehicle owner. Since EVs and charging stations are generally not guarded by people, physical security is also a must. To tackle these issues, we propose Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) based Secure User Key-Exchange Authentication (SUKA) protocol for V2G systems. The proposed protocol uses PUFs to achieve a two-step mutual authentication between an EV and the Grid Server. It is lightweight, secure, and privacy preserving. Simulations show that the proposed protocol performs better and provides more security features than state-of-the-art V2G authentication protocols. The security of the proposed protocol is shown using a formal security model and analysis.},

  abstract     = {Pulse and glide (PnG) is a driving strategy that controls vehicles in a more fuel-efficient way than driving at a constant speed does. It can be applied by the driver or, which is more likely, by an automated system with autonomy level one or higher. During the pulse phase, the vehicle is accelerated to operate the combustion engine and transmission at higher efficiency. During the following glide phase, the vehicle decelerates and the engine is decoupled from the drive train. The optimal pulse and glide strategy - as addressed in previous studies - implies high acceleration values and abrupt transitions between pulse and glide, which both degrade the ride comfort. A driveability study on PnG conducted recently identified that the acceleration, the jerk during the transitions and the duration of the glide phase have to be limited to reach the desired level of ride comfort. Thresholds have been derived for a level-eight calibration, i.e. a PnG operation that is noticeable only to skeptical customers. We use the results of the study to also provide thresholds for a level-seven calibration, i.e. a PnG operation that is noticeable to all customers without being disturbing. Subsequently, we establish a correlation between ride comfort and fuel consumption by comparing the fuel savings of three different driveability calibrations: level eight, level seven and a calibration without driveability constraints. The simulations are performed for a D-segment vehicle and two different gasoline engines. With reference to constant speed, the fuel savings of the level-seven calibration are larger than 30% below 40 km/h, decreasing gradually with increasing speed. They are around ten percent higher than those of the level-eight calibration and only a few percent lower than those of a PnG operation without driveability constraints. Hence, the level-seven calibration can nearly exploit the maximal fuel-saving potential of PnG, and, as it is not disturbing, should be considered for practical applications of PnG. The PnG strategy can be applied to any vehicle equipped with a combustion engine that features the engine-off functionality, which is the case for mild and full hybrids and for some micro hybrids. However, considering that the benefit of PnG increases with increasing engine size, the fuel saving potential of PnG is highest for micro and mild hybrids as these vehicles are commonly equipped with larger engines than full hybrids.},

Given the nonlinearity of in-wheel motor, the nonlinear variable voltage charging control law is obtained on the basis of parameters fitting via experimental data. An ideal regenerative braking torque calculated by the nonlinear variable voltage charging control law is set as one of the disturbance vectors and an optimal sliding mode-anti-lock braking control strategy is developed to provide optimal hydraulic pressure for anti-lock braking system. In this manner, the torque allocation process is omitted by using a compensation control of the hydraulic braking torque.

On the other hand, the output active and reactive powers must be regulated at constant values without any variations for participation in vehicle-to-grid technology. Thus, a particular topology is suggested and then a control system is precisely designed in order to implement SRC charging-discharging method and adjust the output active and reactive powers for vehicle-to-grid technology without the power quality problem. SRC method can also be used in online electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for state of charge and state of health estimation in battery management. The proposed control system can also generate the SRC signals, suitable for online EIS, in a controlled way unlike the recently proposed BCs.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, electric vehicles such as cars and bicycles are increasing their popularity due to the rising environmental consciousness. The autonomy required by these means of transport has marked a significant and steady growth in the development of battery technologies. In this sense, it is crucial to estimate and prognosticate critical parameters of battery packs such as the State of Charge (SOC), the State of Maximum Power Available (SoMPA), and the Failure Time. All these indicators are relevant to determine if both the energy stored in the battery of electric vehicles and power specifications are sufficient to successfully complete a required route, avoiding battery preventive disconnection before arrival. In this regard, this paper presents a novel approach to estimate and prognosticate the SOC and SoMPA of Lithium-Ion batteries in the context of electromobility applications. The proposed method uses the formulation of an optimization problem to find an analytical relationship between the SOC and the SoMPA; whereas the battery pack is modeled in terms of both the polarization resistance and the SOC. Particle filtering algorithms are used to compute online estimates and prognostic results, while the characterization of the usage profile of the battery bank is achieved using probability-based models (Markov chains). The problem of battery monitoring for an electric bicycle is used as a case study to validate the proposed scheme, when driven in flat and sloped routes to generate different usage profiles. It is demonstrated that the proposed methodology allows to successfully prognosticate both SOC and SoMPA when the future discharge current profile is characterized in terms of probability-based models.},

  abstract     = {Power split hybrid electric vehicles (PS-HEVs) dominate the US and Japanese HEV market because of their superior fuel economy and drivability. In recent years, multi-mode PS-HEVs are offered by Toyota and GM. With multiple modes, it is possible for PS-HEVs to have both good launching/towing performance and fuel economy. Multiple modes are achieved by adding clutches or brakes. However, the corresponding design space can be quite large. To expedite the design process, a hierarchical topological graph theory approach is developed to systematically design a multi-mode PS-HEV with two planetary gear sets (PGSs). The process consists of three steps: 1) model the hybrid powertrain, 2) generate the multi-mode designs with specific modes, and 3) evaluate the performance of design candidates. In the performance screening process, designs are examined using the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to evaluate their acceleration performance (0-100 km/h); and then a rapid dynamic programming (Rapid-DP) approach is used to compute their fuel economy under a specific driving cycle. Designs that pass the screening will then be retained as final vehicle designs. This design process ensures that the best designs are found and used.},

With the booming of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning technologies have been applied to autonomous driving to help vehicles better perceive the environment. Besides the perceiving environment, predictive driving is another prominent smooth control and safe driving skill for human drivers. In this work, we develop a deep Monte Carlo Tree Search (deep-MCTS) control method for vision-based autonomous driving. Compared with existing deep learning-based autonomous driving control methods, our method can predict driving maneuvers to help improve the stability and performance of driving control. Two deep neural networks (DNNs) are employed for predicting action-state transformation and obtaining action-selection probabilities, respectively. The deep-MCTS utilizes the predicted information of the two DNNs and reconstructs multiple possible trajectories to predict driving maneuvers. An optimal trajectory is selected by the deep-MCTS based on both current road conditions and predicted driving maneuvers. The proposed method achieves high control stability by avoiding sharp turns and driving deviations. We implement our algorithm in the Udacity and Torcs self-driving environments. The testing results show that our algorithm achieves a significant improvement in training efficiency, the stability of steering control, and stability of driving trajectory compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {High-power boost converters offer significant benefits to hybrid and electric vehicles, because higher-voltage propulsion power equates to lower motor losses. However, the converters themselves must have high efficiency and high power density in order to make the system-level trade-off beneficial. Thus, this paper presents an optimized design process of high power multi-phase interleaved bidirectional boost converters. In order to achieve a fast and accurate analysis and design, a generalized method is developed for the calculations of required phase inductance and output capacitance. In addition, a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method is implemented for the inductor design. Using the proposed design process, a 3-phase 60 kW interleaved converter is designed and tested using paralleled SiC MOSFETS. The converter achieves peak efficiency of 99.2% at 10 kW and is &gt;98% efficiency from 5% to 100% load. The resulting power density is 9.4 kW/L, which can be further improved to 12.2 kW/L with alternate terminal connectors.},

  abstract     = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) has been widely used in the automotive and industrial automation for over two decades. However, due to the lack of security mechanisms, CAN is vulnerable to attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel protection scheme called CANeleon. It can defend CAN against a smart attacker who might inject malicious frames with legitimate frame IDs, which cannot be mitigated by existing countermeasures. Inspired by the idea of moving target defense technologies, CANeleon equips each legitimate CAN node with the ability to shift the spoofed frame ID. In this way, the IDs of malicious frames are exposed and can be further filtered by legitimate nodes. Moreover, CANeleon neither inserts new information to the frame, nor requires any modification to the CAN protocol, so it is in compliance with the existing standards. CANeleon is a decentralized mechanism guaranteeing that the protection could be done simultaneously without additional communication. Experiments on a CAN bus prototype and a real self-driving vehicle prove the effectiveness of CANeleon.},

However, conventional DPME machine only utilizes a small amount of abundant field harmonics to yield torque, which leads to limited torque enhancement. To solve this issue, a novel DPME machine with enriched working harmonics is proposed in this paper. The key of the proposed DPME machine is to design some non-uniformly distributed permanent-magnets and flux modulation poles on the stator. Thus, increased field harmonics are produced to produce effective torque, offering the potential to enhance torque. Firstly, the topology and feature of the machine are introduced. Moreover, operating principle is analyzed by using air gap field modulation theory. Then, the operating principle and torque enhancement are verified and evaluated by using finite-element method. At last, a corresponding principle machine is fabricated, and some experiments are performed for validation.},

Because of the huge number of possible voltage vector pairs that need to be evaluated, it may consume high calculation cost to find the best pair of voltage vectors (BPVV). So, one simplified method is proposed to avoid the tedious process of enumerating and comparing all possible cases, which can find directly the BPVV from large number of possible voltage vector pairs. Besides, the current limit is introduced into MPTC to avoid the overcurrent in dynamic transients, and the proposed search method is also effective to the case with current limit. This method has been numerically simulated and experimentally tested on a platform consisting of two coupled 3kW arc induction motors. Both simulation and experimental results show that the MPTC performance is improved by using the modulation of BPVV under different conditions, and its complexity is reduced obviously.},

  abstract     = {As automotive embedded systems comprised of electronic control units (ECUs) connected via a controller area network (CAN) have continued to develop, the volume of information these systems are required to handle has also rapidly increased. Cyber attacks targeting vulnerable points of automotive embedded systems in particular are on the rise to hinder normal operation of a vehicle. However, adding security mechanisms to defend against attacks cannot neglect timing requirements in terms of vehicle safety. This is because it may lead to a violation of automobile safety. In short, both sides of this issue must be addressed from the outset of the system design stage to provide optimal security and safety. As a response to this pressing issue, we propose a novel and efficient scheme. The design optimization during the system design phase not only ensures all the real-time applications are executed within their deadline but also reduces the number of transmitted messages over the CAN bus. After optimization, we apply a hash message authentication code (HMAC) to specific messages, providing secure communication between ECUs and protecting against cyber attacks. Security analysis and experimental results prove that the proposed scheme can counter attacks on the CAN bus while meeting timing requirements. Therefore, our proposed scheme is effective in satisfying improvement of both safety and security.},

  abstract     = {Owing to a group of permanent magnets (PMs) with the same magnetization direction are replaced by salient iron core, the consequent-pole (CP) PM machines generally suffer from asymmetry flux density. This will leads to the even-order back-EMF harmonics, which have negative influence on the electromagnetic performance. It is widely known that the even-order back-EMF harmonics cannot be eliminated for the machines with odd backEMF phasor belongs to one phase in one machine periodicity, i.e., N 0 is odd (N 0 = NS/mt, where NS is the number of slot for one machine, t is the unit sub-machine periodicity, m is the number of phase). Hence, this paper proposes a general modularization method solving this problem. The elimination principle of even-order back-EMF harmonics in the modular stator (MS) is explained by the star of slots. Further, the MS with auxiliary winding (AW) and auxiliary teeth (AT) are proposed to improve the electromagnetic performance of the MS CP (MSCP) PM machine. Then, the electromagnetic characteristics, including open circuit field distribution and back-EMFs, torque characteristics, unbalanced magnetic force (UMF), loss distribution characteristics as well as efficiency contours are comprehensively compared. Finally, the MSCP PM machine with auxiliary winding (MSCP-AW) is fabricated and tested to verify the theoretical analysis as well as the finite element (FE) results.},

Considering the inconvenience of installation and high price of the pedal force sensor, we translate the control problem of brake power assist control to position tracking control. Meanwhile, a nonlinear control method for position tracking is presented to solve the problem of power assist braking, which is formalized as three parts: the steady-state control, feed-forward control based on reference dynamics, and state-dependent feedback control. The benefit of the nonlinear control method is that it offers a concise control law and performs well in engineering implementations. In addition, a second-order filter was designed to do the signal processing and obtain a higher-order derivative. Finally, the bench tests based on rapid control prototyping environment were designed and implemented to verify the performance of the controller. Test results show that both the position tracking performance and response time of the EMBB system performed well.},

The open-circuit faults of the inverter lead to output phase current distortion. Therefore, different types of faults have different space trajectories, and the corresponding shape of the space trajectory is considered to be a fault feature. Then, the fault is located by the direction vector and center-of-mass coordinate.

The estimation algorithm combines components driven by observer state error and also directly by the parameter error using a sliding-mode inspired regressor structure. The algorithm incorporates a novel information fusion method that is integral to the regressor structure and a supervised data-rejection system to limit estimation activity in periods of recognised error-promoting activity. The estimation method has been demonstrated in real time on a modified production passenger car platform. It has been shown to be effective at robustly predicting road gradient and offering more reliable and stable prediction of vehicle mass than existing estimation methods employed in the same multi-parameter estimation context.

We use CMS to estimate the population density distributions in the mobility datasets, where the error bound determines utility guarantees. We develop P4Mobi, a novel Probabilistic Privacy-Preserving Publishing framework for Mobility datasets that protects individuals&#39; privacy while complying to a specific utility requirement. We empirically validate the performance of P4Mobi in terms of utility and privacy-preservation by demonstrating its resilience against a recently proposed reconstruction attack model using two real-world datasets. We compare P4Mobi to two state-of-the-art methods and show that with the same level of privacy achieved against our attack model, P4Mobi significantly improves the utility of the published mobility datasets by up to $20\%$. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the utility achieved by P4Mobi. We found a very consistent match between the estimated and empirical utility of P4Mobi as evaluated on two datasets.},

The problem becomes more severe with the increase in traffic density, where a large number of SDVs gather within the proximity of inter-vehicular radars. Thereby, the number of resources required to maintain the neighbourhood orthogonality increases with traffic density and further leads to the problem of radar blindness. In this paper, we propose a graph-based resource allocation (GRA) scheme to assign resources to the running SDV pool. GRA assures that two closely located SDVs may not simultaneously use the same resource. Also, we integrate the notion of traffic-based dynamic-range approach (TDA) with GRA. Then, through simulation results, it is shown that GRA outperforms the state of art random allocation approach. Further, it is shown that GRA, along with TDA, may eliminate the problem of radar blindness.},

  abstract     = {The drone has been applied in various areas due to its small size, high mobility and low price. However, illegal uses of drones have posed huge threats to both public safety and personal privacy. There is an urgent demand for technologies that can timely detect and counter the drones. In this paper, we propose an adaptive switching spatial-temporal fusion detection method for remote flying drones in the airspace using electrical-optical cameras, which can enhance the contrast between the target and background as well as suppressing the noises and clutters simultaneously. For each incoming video frame, a dark-attentive interframe difference method and a row-column separate black-hat method are proposed to generate temporal feature maps (TFM) and spatial feature maps (SFM), respectively, in parallel. Inspired by the phenomenon that the features in TFMs and SFMs both go strong at the regions of the intended target while they do not at other regions where noises and clutters locate, we design an adaptive switching spatial-temporal fusion mechanism to fuse the SFMs and TFMs, generating adaptive switching spatial-temporal feature maps (ASSTFM). Finally, an adaptive local threshold mechanism is used in ASSTFMs to segment the targets from backgrounds. In order to validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct both offline experiments and field tests. The experiment results manifest that our method is superior to the other seven baseline methods and works more stably for different backgrounds and various types of drones.},

  abstract     = {The concept of smart city strives for greener technology to reduce carbon emission to ameliorate the global warming. Following this footprint, the transportation sector is experiencing a paradigm shift and the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) has prodigious plausibility in reducing carbon emission. However, the anticipated EV penetration is hindered by several challenges, among them are their shorter driving range, slower charging rate and the lack of ubiquitous availability of charging locations, which collectively contribute to range anxieties for EVs&#39; drivers. Meanwhile, the expected immense EV load onto the power distribution network may degrade the voltage stability. To reduce the range anxiety, we present a two-stage solution to provision and dimension a DC fast charging station (CS) network for the anticipated energy demand and that minimizes the deployment cost while ensuring a certain quality of experience for charging e.g., acceptable waiting time and shorter travel distance to charge. This solution also maintains the voltage stability by considering the distribution grid capacity, determining transformers’ rating to support peak demand of EV charging and adding a minimum number of voltage regulators based on the impact over the power distribution network. We propose, evaluate and compare two CS network expansion models to determine a cost-effective and adaptive CSs provisioning solution that can efficiently expand the CS network to accommodate future EV charging and conventional load demands. We also propose two heuristic methods and compare our solution with them. Finally, a custom built Python-based discrete event simulator is developed to test our outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Abnormal driving may cause serious danger to both the driver and the public. Existing detectors of abnormal driving behavior are mainly based on shallow models, which require large quantities of labeled data. The acquisition and labelling of abnormal driving data are, however, difficult, labor-intensive and time-consuming. This situation inspires us to rethink the abnormal driving detection problem and to apply deep architecture models. In this study, we establish a novel deep-learning-based model for abnormal driving detection. A stacked sparse autoencoders model is used to learn generic driving behavior features. The model is trained in a greedy layer-wise fashion. As far as the authors know, this is the first time that a deep learning approach is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent driving features for abnormal driving detection. In addition, a method for denoising is added to the algorithm to increase the robustness of feature expression. The dropout technology is introduced into the entire training process to avoid overfitting. Experiments carried out on our self-created driving behavior dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a superior performance for abnormal driving detection compared to the state-of-the-art.},

By encapsulating ASV safety area into Theta*-like heuristics, global path planning algorithm is developed to optimally generate sparse waypoints which are sufficiently clear to constraints. To deal with dynamically unforeseen environments, a local hierarchy is established by fuzzy decision-making (FDM) and fine dynamic window (FDW) layers, which are responsible for large- and close-range collision avoidance, respectively, by governing surge and yaw velocity guidance signals. With the aid of the FDW, constrained dynamics pertaining to the ASV, i.e., actuatable surge/yaw velocities and accelerations, are elaboratively embedded into local path planning, which in turn governs trackable collision-avoidance local path. By inserting virtual waypoints onto the globally optimal path, a seamless interface between global and local path-planning mechanism is devised, and thereby contributing to the entire DGL hybrid path planning scheme. Simulations and comparisons in various real-world geographies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DGL hybrid path planning scheme.},

To tackle the dilemma, an improved quadratic spacing policy with the lower bound of fault factor is proposed. Furthermore, the improved quadratic spacing policy removes the assumption of zero initial spacing errors. Based on the new spacing policy, an adaptive fault-tolerant platoon control scheme is developed, by employing radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) and PID-type sliding mode control method. The given scheme is proved to be capable of guaranteeing individual vehicle stability, string stability and traffic flow stability. The effectiveness of the scheme is verified through comparison simulation studies.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) are considered a promising technology for enhancing road safety. However, in V2V communications, passenger cars suffer from obstruction of bigger vehicles such as buses or trucks. Based on our measurement, a big vehicle can cause a signal loss from 10 to 15 dB due to shadowing. This results in a shorter communication range and reduces the safety message dissemination capability. In this paper, we analyze the impact of shadowing caused by multiple big vehicles on the V2V communication of passenger cars. We propose a model that takes into account both geometric and stochastic shadowing of multiple big vehicles. In order to cope with the physical size of vehicles and safety distance between them in the real world, we propose to use a repulsive point process called hardcore repulsive Poisson point process (PPP) to model the locations of vehicles. Generating procedure and some basic properties of this process are introduced. Based on the proposed model, we derive the average length of the shadow region and the shadowing loss caused by multiple big vehicles. We show that when the number of big vehicles increases from 10% to 80% of total vehicles in one lane, the shadow region increases from 50 m to 450 m on the road. Furthermore, the shadowing loss causes the relative number of cars within communication range of a typical car to reduce from 90% to between 15% and 50%, depending on whether the big vehicles are in the same or the adjacent lane of the consider car. We analyse the packet collision probability while taking into consideration the big vehicle shadow region and observe significant packet collisions without dedicated bus lanes.},

Based on these CIRs, we present a closed-form path loss expression which builds upon the summation of geometrical loss and attenuation loss and takes into account asymmetrical patterns of vehicle light sources and geometry of V2V transmission. The proposed expression is an explicit function of link distance, lateral shift between two vehicles, weather type (quantified by the extinction coefficient), transmitter beam divergence angle and receiver aperture diameter. Then, we utilize this expression to determine the maximum achievable link distance of V2V systems for clear, rainy and foggy weather conditions while ensuring a targeted bit error rate.},

Specifically, TRADING balances offloading data traffic among gateways focusing on vehicular traffic and network status in the vicinity of gateways. In addition, TRADING mitigates the effect of gateway advertisement overhead to liberate the transmission channels for traffic big data transmission. The performance of TRADING is comparatively evaluated in a realistic simulation environment by considering gateway access overhead, load distribution among gateways, data offloading delay, and data offloading success ratio.

However, the driving endurance of the electric vehicle is the biggest shortage that hinders the fully acceptance of this new vehicle technology. To deal with this shortage, this paper proposed a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) electricity trading scheme based on Bayesian game pricing in blockchain-enabled Internet of vehicles (BIoV). Specifically, the Bayesian game is adopted for pricing in the distributed BIoV with incomplete information sharing. The optimal pricing under the linear strategic equilibrium has been obtained which maximizes the utilities of both sides of electricity transaction. The transaction volume is determined from the formulated convex problem that maximizes the social welfare. Then, the pricing game is implemented by the dedicated smart contract. Blockchain guarantees its trustworthiness, security, and reliability. Finally, the experimental results show that referring to the benchmark of static game with complete information, the proposed Bayesian game with incomplete information can achieve approximate satisfaction of users. The degree of approximation can reach to 98% when the pricing ranges of buyers and sellers are close. Moreover, the proposed scheme has great advantages over the static game with complete information in terms of communication overhead and timeliness in the decentralized IoVs.},

  abstract     = {This correspondence proposes a localization method for mixed far-field (FF) and near-field (NF) sources based on cross arrays where two-dimensional (2-D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) and range estimation are considered. For 2-D DOA estimation, we first construct a range-free cumulant-based vector and employ the covariance matching criterion and Vandermonde decomposition theorem to retrieve DOA information. We then build a sparse model with respect to range parameter and solve an ℓ 1 -norm minimization problem to obtain range estimates. Our method enjoys the following advantages: 1) our method can locate mixed FF and NF sources; 2) the azimuth, elevation and range can be automatically paired; 3) array aperture loss can be avoided. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {User equipment mobility is one of the primary challenges for the design of reliable and efficient wireless links over millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. These high-rate communication systems use directional antennas and therefore have to constantly maintain alignment between transmitter and receiver beams. For terahertz links, envisioned to employ radiation patterns of no more than few degrees wide, not only the macro-scale user mobility (human walking, car driving, etc.) but also the micro-scale mobility - spontaneous shakes and rotations of the device - becomes a severe issue. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework for the first-order analysis of the effects caused by micro-mobility on the capacity and outage in terahertz communications. The performance of terahertz communications is compared with and without micro-mobility illustrating the difference of up to 1 Tbit/s or 75%. In response to this gap, it is finally shown how the negative effects of the micro-mobility can be partially addressed by a proper adjustment of the terahertz antenna arrays and the period of beam realignment procedure.},

We first derive new exact expressions of outage probability for the p-th terrestrial user and provide the corresponding asymptotic analysis results. The diversity order of zero and p is achieved by the p-th terrestrial user with ipSIC and perfect successive interference cancellation (pSIC), respectively. Finally, the presented simulation results show that: 1) On the condition of pSIC, the outage behaviors of NOMA-based satellite network are superior to that of orthogonal multiple access; 2) With the value of residual interference increasing, the outage performance of terrestrial users with ipSIC isbecoming worse seriously; and 3) In frequent light shadowing of Shadowed-Rician fading brings the better outage probability compared to frequent heavy and average shadowing.},

To solve this problem, a polarization M-ary differential chaos shift keying (P-MDCSK) modulation is proposed rather than the conventional MDCSK in this paper. In the proposed scheme, the reference signals are transmitted with polarization states first, and then the information bearing signals are modulated by selecting both phase and polarization states. The union bound of BER expression of the proposed scheme is derived and verified by simulations over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Results show that the BER performance of the proposed scheme is better than that of other corresponding traditional schemes with a low computational complexity.},

In the cooperative path planning model, the mission is divided into the search phase and the track phase, and the goals of the two phases are to maximize the search space and minimize the terminal error respectively. The constraints contain the maneuverability of vehicles and communication ranges between vehicles. Strategies based on random simulation experiments and asynchronous planning are developed to design the cooperative path planning algorithm in the two phases, and the paths are generated by an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm in a centralized or a distributed mode.

  abstract     = {The present work explores mitigation in end-to-end outage probability in an energy harvesting (EH) enabled cognitive radio networks (CRNs) through reinforcement learning (RL) based multi-hop Q-routing. The operation of CRN follows a frame structure that includes cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS), based on the decision of which, secondary transmit nodes either do EH from the primary user (PU) signal or make an opportunistic data transmission. In either operation, both PU reappearance and disappearance probabilities are considered in mathematical analysis. An optimization problem is formulated that minimizes the outage probability in the CRN under the constraints of primary user interference protection, individual secondary link throughput, and energy causality in EH. The closed-form expressions are derived to find the optimal values of sensing duration, secondary power allocation fraction on SS and data transmission. The present multi-hop CRN studies RL-based Q-routing in different network topologies and analyzes the worst-case runtime complexities. It is observed that the tree structure based network reduces the complexity of Q-routing over the other topologies and provides a significant gain on the outage. The present work improves the CRN outage performance by 11.01% and 39.89% over the existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {As an essential technology in the field of the Internet of Things, Human activity recognition (HAR) is a well-researched topic. Recently, some state-of-the-art WiFi-based HAR systems have been presented due to its characteristics of no-invasion, no privacy leakage, and high recognition accuracy rates (RARs). However, the commodity WiFi devices for identification are usually in a complex electromagnetic environment, where the interference caused by WiFi devices from channel overlap is common and severe. Furthermore, our extensive experiments show that the performance of these pioneer WiFi-based HAR systems may degrade significantly in co-channel interference (CCI) scenarios. To solve the above problem, we propose WiAnti, a WiFi-based HAR system that is robust to CCI. Two adaptive subcarrier selection algorithms, WiAnti-Pearson and WiAnti-DTW, are proposed to mitigate the impact of CCI and to improve the recognition performance in CCI scenarios. As demonstrated in the experimental results, WiAnti-Pearson yields a 95% RAR on average, which can improve up to a 14% RAR in the presence of constant CCI. Moreover, WiAnti-DTW achieves an 8% higher RAR in the varying CCI scenario, reaching 94%.},

In contrast to traditional UAVs, which are resource-constraint in nature and exhibit shorter flight times, our proposed UAV virtualization overcomes the limitations of short flight time of traditional UAVs, in turn allowing them to provide persistent and ubiquitous services. We achieve the virtualization of a UAV through multiple collaborating real-life UAVs performing various tasks in tandem. In this work, we focus on the placement and selection of UAVs to achieve virtualization. We use a social welfare-based approach to select suitable UAVs, from the available ones, and map the UAV to a virtual one. This work enables the provision of different UAV services to multiple end-users, without actual procurement of the UAVs by the end-users. We compare the results for optimal placement, normal maximum energy-based UAV selection, and Atkinson-based selection method. We also compare the virtual model and simple UAV-to-task model to physical UAV usage, task completion ratio, and residual energy of the system. Our proposed model outperforms the traditional model with a task completion efficiency of 94.26%. The residual energy of the system also increases with an increase in the number of tasks.},

However, it is feasible to make the address of device encode the routing information with the application of data technology. In this article, we propose new identities for networking routers -vectors, and a new routing principle based on these vectors is designed accordingly. These vectors encode the device distance information and serve as a pattern of the network topology. Then, routing decisions could be made by these vector calculations and only requirement of table query on the destination vector following the proposed routing principle. The proposed method is not limited in calculating the shortest path routing, but extend to solve the constrain routing problem. Besides, multi-paths routing is also available as long as multi-paths exist between the origin-destination pairs.

However, only limited works are available for authentication and communication, among them the `lightweight property&#39; is missing. Hence, in this paper, we design a lightweight mutual authentication protocol in an IoV scenario using cryptographic operations. The proposed protocol also enables a device and a server to establish a secret key, which can be used for secure communication, while minimizing the computational cost associated with the process. The protocol is implemented on two types of communication models, such as two Raspberry Pi&#39;s connected via an intermediate desktop computer acting as the Trusted Authority (TA) and two Raspberry Pi&#39;s connected via the cloud (here, Vehicle Server). The performance analysis results based on computation and communication cost show that the proposed protocol performs better than existing systems.},

  abstract     = {Wireless services are developing rapidly and user requirements also are becoming more demanding. Femtocell networks have great potential in many aspects, especially in expanding the capacity and increasing the coverage of traditional cellular networks. However, it is challenging to motivate femtocell base stations (FBSs) to voluntarily adopt a hybrid access strategy to provide services and access to macrocell users (MUEs). In order to maximize the transmission rate of users, we propose an incentive mechanism in two-tier femtocell networks including a macrocell and multiple femtocells that share the spectrum. In the proposed mechanism, the macrocell base station (MBS) attempts to provide femtocells with a reward by pricing the transmission rates of the accessed MUEs, which are guaranteed by the FBSs. A Stackelberg game is developed to maximize the utility of the MBS and FBSs, and to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of different users. An uncertain channel gain is formulated in the optimization problem and the uncertainty is restricted by a probabilistic constraint. Furthermore, a power control and nonuniform price bargaining algorithm is proposed to satisfy practical operation and obtain an optimal solution. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of transmission rate improvement and outage reduction.},

Traditionally, in order to access a network, a user is authorized with an identity and corresponding keys, which are generated and managed by the network operator. All users&#39; personally identifying information are centralized stored by the network operator. However, this approach makes users lose the control of their personally identifying information. Users are concerned about who can access these sensitive data and whether they have been compromised. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based identity management and authentication scheme for mobile networks, where users&#39; identifying information are controlled by the users themselves. Our scheme let users generate their self-sovereign identities (SSIs) and corresponding public keys and private keys. The private key used to authenticate the user&#39;s identifying information is only known to the user. We use blockchain to record SSIs and public keys of legitimate user, and adopt chameleon hash to delete illegal users&#39; information on the blockchain, while keeping the block head unchanged. Furthermore, other service providers can obtain the user&#39;s SSI and public key and authenticate users by querying the blockchain. Experimental results confirm that our scheme can greatly reduce the revocation overhead and communication overhead.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a quality of experience (QoE)-guided content delivery framework in cache-enabled multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, measured from the content delay index (CDI), which is formulated based on the latency involved in the delivery of contents requested by ground-based mobile users. The mobile users use the cellular devices to raise the content requests. Additionally, multiple UAVs act as aerial base stations to deliver the requested contents to ground-based mobile users. The proposed work aims to maximize the QoE. Additionally, the existing works do not consider the necessity of creating groups of ground-based mobile users based on geographic locations in order to provide contents seamlessly. Therefore, we construct an optimization problem to maximize the average CDI, which is proved as an NP-hard problem. Further, multiple UAVs incur the challenges of placing the UAVs in 3D space over the distributed ground-based mobile users. To solve this NP-hard problem, we propose QoE analysis in cache-enabled multi-UAV networks (QMUN). It functions in three steps. First, it creates clusters for the ground-based mobile users using the K-means algorithm and finds the optimized 2D positions of all the UAVs. Second, it finds the optimized heights of all UAVs before assigning them to the individual cluster. Finally, it infuses proactive content caching and optimizes the cache policy. Therefore, the delay associated with the content delivery is minimized, which leads to the generation of high value of CDI. The results of simulation depict the usefulness of QMUN in terms of average CDI, average throughput, average end-to-end delay, and user satisfaction. Specifically, the results depict that the average CDI of each user improves by &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$11.04$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; %, &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$4.46$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; %, and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$17.88$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; % compared to the QMUN Without Cache (QMUN-WC), Greedy, and Random Selection (RS).},

  abstract     = {Distributed network function virtualization management and orchestration (NFV-MANO) offers a flexible way to manage and orchestrate diversified network services in large-scale Internet of vehicles (IoV). However, it is challenging to manage different services and resources in distributed NFV due to the difficulties of reliable message synchronization among multiple MANO systems. Recently, blockchain technology has emerged to solve the trust and security problems for the interconnections of multiple MANO systems. Moreover, multi-access edge computing (MEC) has become a prospective paradigm shift from the centralized cloud due to its advantages of completing tasks near users. In this work, we propose a blockchain-enabled distributed NFV framework to reach consensus among multiple MANO systems where the computation tasks of the blockchain are processed with MEC. The consensus procedures of MANO systems and blockchain nodes are explained in detail and the representation of the blockchain throughput is given. The blockchain throughput is the number of transactions a blockchain system can handle per second, which is an important evaluation indicator for the performance of a blockchain system. We make decisions for the primary node selection, the MANO system selection and the edge server selection for reaching consensus. Moreover, the blockchain throughput, the processing delay of computation tasks of blockchain and operational costs are jointly considered in the problem formulation. A dueling deep reinforcement learning approach is applied to solve this problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Network slicing is a promising technique for cloud radio access networks (C-RANs). It enables multiple tenants (i.e., service providers) to reserve resources from an infrastructure provider. However, users&#39; mobility and traffic variation result in resource demand uncertainty for resource reservation. Meanwhile, the inaccurate channel state information (CSI) estimation may lead to difficulties in guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS). To this end, we propose a two-timescale resource management scheme for network slicing in C-RAN, aiming at maximizing the profit of a tenant, which is the difference between the revenue from its subscribers and the resource reservation cost. The proposed scheme is under a hierarchical control architecture, which includes long timescale resource reservation for a slice and short timescale intra-slice resource allocation. To handle traffic variation, we utilize the statistics of users&#39; traffic. Moreover, to guarantee the QoS under CSI uncertainty, we apply the uncertainty set of CSI for resource allocation among users. We formulate the profit maximization as a two-stage stochastic programming problem. In this problem, long timescale resource reservation for a slice is performed in the first stage with only the statistical knowledge of users&#39; traffic. Given the decision in the first stage, short timescale intra-slice resource allocation is performed in the second stage, which is adaptive to real-time user arrival and departure. To solve the problem, we first transform the stochastic programming problem into a deterministic optimization problem. We further apply semidefinite relaxation to transform the problem into a mixed integer nonconvex optimization problem, which can be solved by combining branch-and-bound and primal-relaxed dual techniques. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can well adapt to traffic variation and CSI uncertainty. It obtains a higher profit when compared with several baseline schemes.},

We employ the Lyapunov optimization theory to transform the original problem with long-term average form into the drift-plus-penalty problem, and propose a decentralized allocation scheme using alternative ascending clock auction to derive the optimal solution.

Safety applications use these data to detect and avoid dangerous situations on time. MisBehavior Detection (MBD) in Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) is an active research topic which consists of monitoring data semantics of the exchanged Vehicle-to-X communication (V2X) messages to detect and identify potential misbehaving entities. The detection process consists of performing plausibility and consistency checks on the received V2X messages. If an anomaly is detected, the entity may report it by sending a Misbehavior Report (MBR) to the Misbehavior Authority (MA). The MA will then investigate the event and decide to revoke the sender or not. In this paper, we present a MisBehavior Detection (MBD) simulation framework that enables the research community to develop, test, and compare MBD algorithms.

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising computing paradigm for improving the quality of service (QoS) of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). The local delay is one of the major components in the delay for a node to transmit a data packet to another node. This paper studies the modeling and analysis of the downlink local delay in an MEC-based highway road scenario. A theoretical model is built based on stochastic geometry for analyzing the average downlink local delay for a vehicle driving on a highway road to receive a data packet from an edge node along the highway road. In deriving the model, the spatial distributions of vehicle nodes and edge nodes are respectively modeled as an independent one-dimensional (1-D) homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). A nearest-transmitter model is used to determine the edge node for transmitting a computing result to the corresponding service requesting vehicle node. Moreover, a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) mechanism is considered for channel access. The derived theoretical model is validated through simulation results and the impacts of major parameters on the average downlink local delay are investigated based on the derived model. The built model provides an insight into the deployment of edge nodes in order to reduce the downlink local delay and provide timely network services.},

To tackle this problem, we propose a UAV-to-Everything (U2X) networking, which enables the UAVs to adjust their communication modes full dimensionally according to the requirements of their sensing applications. In this article, we first introduce the concept of U2X communications, and elaborate on its three communication modes. Afterwards, we discuss the key techniques of the U2X communications, including joint sensing and transmission protocol, UAV trajectory design, and radio resource management. A reinforcement learning-based mathematical framework for U2X communications is then proposed. Finally, the extensions of the U2X communications are presented.},

  abstract     = {The convenience of using private cars has an accompanying parking challenge which becomes a significant issue in congested metropolitans and downtown areas. The explosive increase in the number of vehicles has substantially raised the issue of finding a suitable parking spot, which is both time and resource consuming. At the same time, many private parking spots remain idle, while their owners are not present at home. To promote the utility of private parking spots and mitigate parking issues, smart parking apps can be used. Unfortunately, some of them suffer from privacy issues that affect participation willingness, while others work in a centralized environment where the availability of service is not guaranteed in the presence of malicious users. In this work, we propose Blockchain-based Smart parking with Fairness, reliability and Privacy protection, called BSFP. Specifically, group signatures, bloom filters, and vector-based encryption are leveraged to protect the user&#39;s privacy. The decentralized nature of blockchain is utilized to achieve reliability in smart parking, and the smart contract is used to realize fairness. Comprehensive security analysis and experimental results based on the real-world dataset show that BSFP achieves fairness, reliability and privacy protection with high efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Ambient backscatter is an intriguing technology that enables ultra-low-power devices to communicate with each other by reflecting and modulating the existing pervasive RF signals, e.g., TV signals, WIFI signals, cellular signals, etc. This paper works on the mathematical modeling and performance analysis of ambient backscatter communications (AmBackComs) underlying cellular networks for Internet of Things applications. Based on the time switching (TS) and power splitting (PS) receiver architectures, two operating schemes are employed to enable energy harvesting and ambient backscattering at the ambient backscatter (AB) transmitter. In order to maximize the outage capacity for the AB transmitters, we formulate two optimization problems optimizing the TS and PS ratios. Two schemes with low complexity are proposed to obtain the near-optimal outage performance. Considering the coexistence of the AmBackComs and cellular downlink transmissions, successful transmission probabilities for AB transmitters and cellular downlink transmissions are both derived for the TS and PS schemes and provide insights on how various system parameters, such as the TS ratio, the PS ratio, the density of base stations (BSs)/AB transmitters, etc., impact the system performance. Numerical results show that the outage capacity for AmBackComs can be significantly improved by selecting a proper TS/PS ratio and our proposed schemes can achieve near-optimal outage capacities. The study also shows that many more ultra-low-power devices users can be connected via the proposed scheme at a cost of a slightly reduced overall network capacity.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an adaptive perturbation-aided opportunistic hybrid beamforming (AP-OHBF) scheme for temporally correlated millimeter wave (mmWave) channels. The basic idea is that the proposed scheme perturbs the channel parameters to track the channels of the scheduled mobile stations (MSs), whose channels are in favorable conditions, based on only the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) information of MSs. Specifically, in each time slot, the proposed scheme makes random perturbations to the “best” known channel parameters in the memory, which corresponds to the maximum sum scheduling metric. Then the base station (BS) constructs the channel estimates from these parameters, which are subsequently used to generate the precoders. For data transmission, the BS adopts the successful perturbation, which achieves performance improvements. By contrast, if a perturbation results in performance degradation, it is discarded, whereas the precoders corresponding to the best-known parameters in the memory are instead used for transmission. Simulation results show that in mmWave channels, the proposed AP-OHBF scheme significantly improves the system throughput with respect to the conventional opportunistic beamforming schemes for the same amount of feedback information.},

Considering the ever-present spatial correlation at both the RS and the BS, we first study the canonical channel estimation process, from which a tractable equivalent form of the channel estimate is extracted for further analysis. Under these transmission impairments along with the ADC quantization imperfection, we derive the closed-form approximation of the achievable rate. Then the impacts of power scaling, spatial correlation level, and ADC resolution bits are revealed comprehensively to guide the practical system deployment and implementation.

Traditional long-time CI algorithms only consider the Range Walk (RW) rather than the scale effect. Actually, with the increase of target&#39;s velocity and the time-bandwidth product of the transmitted signal, the scale effect will appear in the echo signal, which influences the performance of Pulse Compression (PC) and the subsequent CI. In order to address the problem of scale effect during the long-time CI for the hypersonic target, a novel CI algorithm, i.e., SCaled Radon Fourier Transform (SCRFT), is proposed in this paper. The SCRFT can realize intra-pulse and inter-pulse integration for hypersonic target with RW and scale effect. Besides, the proposed algorithm can also estimate target&#39;s velocity. Compared to the traditional long-time CI algorithms, SCRFT can achieve better detection and velocity estimation performance. Finally, numerical simulations are carefully designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

In this network, communication between the pair of primary users is achieved with the help of the secondary transmitter (ST). In return, ST can communicate with the secondary receiver by sending a superimposed signal consisting of its own message and the received primary message. We intend to minimize the outage probability of the secondary system under quality-of-service constraints of the primary system by jointly optimizing the power allocation (PA) factor at ST and the decoding order (DO) at the receivers. When full channel state information (CSI) is available at ST, the optimal PA and DO are derived in closed form under the constraint that the target rate of the primary system should be guaranteed. When only statistical CSI is available at ST, the optimal PA and DO are derived in closed form or by using a bisection method, under the constraints that the outage probability of the primary system is not more than a predetermined threshold and is not larger than that of the secondary system. For the proposed strategies, outage probability expressions of the primary and secondary systems are derived in closed form or semi-closed form. Numerical results are shown to verify our analysis and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategies in different CSI-availability scenarios.},

  abstract     = {A novel base station antenna (BSA) configuration is presented to mitigate degrading physical antenna effects in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, while minimizing implementation complexities. Instead of using a commonly considered single antenna panel comprising of many elements covering a wide field-of-view (FOV) of 120 degrees, L tilted panels are used employing L times fewer elements and L times smaller FOV per panel. The spatial resolution of each panel is enhanced by employing sparse arrays with suppressed (grating-lobe) radiation outside its corresponding FOV. Therefore, more directive antenna elements can be deployed in each panel to compensate for the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) reduction. While sectorisation reduces the antenna gain variation in 120 degrees FOV, cooperation among multiple panels in downlink beamforming is seen to be capable of inter-panel interference suppression for sum-rate enhancement. A network model is used as a multi-user (MU) MIMO simulator incorporating both antenna and channel effects. It is shown that when the number of base station antennas is ten times the number of users, the average downlink sum-rate in pure line-of-sight (LOS), rich and poor multipath environments is increased up to 60.2%, 23% and 11.1%, respectively, by multi-panel sparse arrays applying zero-forcing (ZF) precoding.},

More specifically, it is assumed that Alice transmits information to Bob by using half-duplex randomize-and-forward relaying with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer, under the existence of a passive eavesdropper. First, considering a conventional system, i.e., without energy and data buffering, an optimal baseline policy is designed. Then, focusing on buffer-aided relaying, we maximize the average secrecy throughput under the stability requirement for data and energy queues by using the framework of Lyapunov optimization, according to which, we transform the initial stochastic optimization problem into a sequence of online subproblems. The proposed online adaptive transmission policy dynamically allocates the available resources, i.e., time and power, with respect to the channel state information, as well as the states of the buffers. In addition, our analysis reveals the existence of an interesting trade-off between the average secrecy throughput and the average queue delay. Simulation results validate the analysis and demonstrate that the proposed buffer-aided scheme significantly improves the average secrecy throughput compared to the baseline one.},

In this paper, the generalized conjugate symmetry property of L-shaped ULA is fully developed to increase not only virtual array aperture but virtual snapshots, which not only increases the maximum resolvable sources but yields better 2-D DOA estimation performance. Specifically, we first formulate the cost function as a quadratically constrained complex quadratic programming (QCCQP) problem via the subspace theory. The QCCQP problem can then be relaxed to a series of semidefinite programming (SDP) problems, which can be solved via the CVX solvers in polynomial time complexity per iteration. To avoid complex 2-D global iterations during the implementation of SDP problems, the PM-ESPRIT-like method is first applied to estimate azimuths, based on which, the proposed method can then be transformed to 1-D local iterations with no additional angles pairings needed. Furthermore, the superb performance of the proposed method still holds whether the spatial angles are very close or separate apart. Performances evaluations are confirmed based on multiple simulations examples and some criteria.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates fairness-aware transmission in a wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which a group of adjacent users receive radio frequency energy and then cooperatively transmit information to a remote access point (AP) by using the harvested energy with time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme. Considering the constraints of practical energy harvesting electric circuits, a non-linear energy harvesting model is adopted in this paper. To guarantee both throughput fairness and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) fairness among users in the group, we propose a cooperative transmission protocol which contains three phases: wireless energy transmission (WET) phase, single information transmission phase and cooperative information transmission phase. Each user harvests wireless energy in WET phase, and then divides the harvested energy into two parts to be used in the rest two phases. In single information transmission phase, each user broadcasts its information to the AP and all the other users. In cooperative information transmission phase, all the users transmit information jointly to the AP. At the AP, the same signals in cooperative information transmission phase are combined with these in single information transmission phase by using maximum ratio combining (MRC) method. The common SNR of the received signals at the AP from all the users is achieved in both single information transmission phase and cooperative information transmission phase. Furthermore, the throughput fairness is achieved by common SNR and equal time allocation for information transmission at each user. Besides, we optimize the max-min throughput by joint WET time and harvested energy allocation. The optimal time allocation ratio and harvested energy allocation ratio are derived in closed forms. The cooperative diversity gain is achieved and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed protocol has low complexity and high reliability. Moreover, it also achieves a higher minimum throughput and is more energy-efficient in harsh transmission condition than other transmission protocols in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a promising paradigm to meet the requirement of ultra-dense, low-latency and high-rate in the fifth-generation networks. However, energy consumption is a critical issue for the D2D communication, especially for D2D relay networks. To make the best use of D2D communication, the problem of optimizing energy efficiency (EE) must be addressed. In this paper, we propose a joint power allocation and relay selection (JPARS) scheme for the improvement of energy efficiency in relay-aided D2D communications underlaying cellular network. A mixed integer nonlinear fractional programming (MINLP) problem of the total EE for D2D pairs is formulated. While ensuring the quality of service (QoS) of cellular users and D2D links, we solve the power allocation problem by Dinkelbach method and Lagrange dual decomposition. After that, Q-learning, one of the reinforcement learning algorithms, is employed to solve the relay selection problem. Finally, we provide in-depth theoretical analysis of the proposed scheme in terms of complexity and signaling overhead. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme not only overcomes the bottleneck effect, but also nearly reaches the theoretical maximum in terms of the total EE of D2D pairs.},

For the demand of energy-efficiency and unique identification, our designs are conducted under the constraints of Hellinger distance criterion and uniquely decomposable constellation group (UDCG) theory and generate two kinds of multilayer modulation (MLM) constellation for different overall bit rate cases: Integer and non-integer. Correspondingly, for these two kinds of designs, we provide fast square root (FSR) receivers whose complexity are lower than that of the currently available maximum likelihood (ML) receiver. Finally, we investigate the achievable rates of downlink Poisson non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and our proposed MLMs. The benefits of these designs revealed by demonstrations or simulations include that: 1) For the considered system, the proposed MLMs have a considerable performance advantage over TDMA and admit fast square root receiver at the cost of a moderate performance penalty compared with the ML receiver; 2) Compared with the Poisson NOMA, the proposed MLMs do not require successive interference cancellation (SIC) and their achievable rates exceed the achievable rate region of Poisson NOMA in high power regimes.},

  abstract     = {D2D communications are considered as effective means to achieve vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, which can be used to improve the performance in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation and interference management based on clustering mechanism in the D2D communications under-laying VANETs aiming to optimize resource utilization efficiency. Firstly, given the transmission resources of intra-cluster for D2D communications, we design a vehicle clustering algorithm to improve intra-cluster resource efficiency and nullify the intra-cluster interference. Secondly, by analyzing the wireless service in VANETs, a cooperative communication scheme with optimized resource utilization is proposed to maximize intra-cluster spectral efficiency. Thirdly, when uplink spectrums are shared, an interference neutralization (IN) model is developed to manage inter-cluster interference, while each vehicle is equipped with one antenna and there is no extra antenna for interference cancellation. In accordance with the IN model, a cross-layer optimization frame for multi-hop VANETs is proposed to maximize the end-to-end throughput of multiple coexisting communication sessions. To evaluate the performance, we select the method without cooperative communication and IN as a benchmark and compare it against the method with cooperative communication only and the method with both cooperative communication and IN. The simulation results show that the method that uses cooperative communication and IN can dramatically increase the throughput. Furthermore, the throughput gains increase along with vehicle density growing in VANETs.},

The individual contributions are then coherently superimposed to arrive at total array RCS. The proposed method can be used to obtain the radiation mode RCS of any conventional phased array or low profile patch array with high impedance surface (HIS)-based substrate or superstrate.

Then, value iteration and relative value iteration algorithms are brought to find optimal energy cooperation policies over finite and infinite horizons for each pair of nodes respectively.

One assumption usually made in the investigation of localization methods is that the user equipment (UE), i.e., a CAV, and the base station (BS) are time synchronized. In this paper, we remove this assumption and investigate two two-way localization protocols: (i) a round-trip localization protocol (RLP), whereby the BS and UE exchange signals in two rounds of transmission and then localization is achieved using the signal received in the second round; (ii) a collaborative localization protocol (CLP), whereby localization is achieved using the signals received in the two rounds. We derive the position and orientation error bounds applying beamforming at both ends and compare them to the traditional one-way localization. Our results show that mmWave localization is mainly limited by the angular rather than the temporal estimation and that CLP significantly outperforms RLP. Our simulations also show that it is more beneficial to have more antennas at the BS than at the UE.},

  abstract     = {5G enabled Vehicular ad hoc network (5G-VANET) plays a promising role to support diverse intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications. There are three types of communication modes in 5G-VANET: cellular mode, reuse mode and dedicated mode, i.e., vehicle users (VUEs) communicate with each other using the cellular network spectrum directly, in an underlay sharing way, and utilizing the allocated dedicated spectrum, respectively. However, how to dynamically share the multi-mode spectrum to optimize the network performance (i.e., network throughput) in 5G-VANET is a challenging task due to the high dynamic VANET environment and network resource heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic Stackelberg pricing game enabled multi-mode spectrum sharing solution in 5G-VANET. In specific, we develop an access price strategy for different spectrum sharing modes considering the cellular BS&#39;s revenue and whole network throughput, while VUEs can select communication modes in a distributed way and dynamically change the selections through an evolutionary game. Through testing different traffic scenarios generated by SUMO, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm can improve the total transmission rate of VANET by at least 20% compared with the random selection method.},

We propose an efficient image transmission scheme that makes use of deep neural network-based super-resolution techniques, spatial diversity, and diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) achieving codes. The proposed scheme transmits a low-resolution (LR) image to two types of users, along with residual pixel-error map that contains high-frequency details of high-resolution (HR) images and is produced by a convex optimization technique. Then, a user retaining an HR screen employs super-resolution to reconstruct an HR image from the received LR image, and also exploits the residual map to further enhance the image quality. Our scheme properly trains deep neural network models for super-resolution, based on the source coding rates of the images to be transmitted over bandwidth-limited multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. That is, various quantization errors resulting from image compression are considered when training the deep neural network-based super-resolution models. For MIMO systems, considering and utilizing the relationship between the number of antennas and the screen resolution, which is based on hardware space of user devices, the proposed scheme encodes an LR image with spatial diversity techniques, and encodes a residual pixel-error map with DMT-achieving codes. Numerical evaluation shows that our scheme significantly outperforms the strategy that broadcasts either HR or LR images to two types of heterogeneous users.},

The algorithm efficiently finds the probability-mass-functions (PMFs) required for min P(i),i∈{Y,S̑,X,S,X̑} φ 1 I(Y; Ŝ|X⇔S) - φ 2 I(Y; X̂|X⇔S). This problem is an NP-hard and nonconvex multi-objective optimisation (MOO) one, were the objective functions are respectively the distortion function dim(Null(I(Ŝ; S)) → ∞ and the memoryless-channel capacity dim(Null(I(X; X̂)) → 0. Our novel algorithm applies an Alternating optimisation method. Subsequently, a robust version of the algorithm is discussed with regard to the perturbed PMFs - parameter uncertainties in general. The aforementioned robustness is actualised by exploiting the simultaneous-perturbation-stochastic-approximation (SPSA). The principles of detectability-and-stabilisability as well as synchronisability are explored, in addition to providing the simulations - by which the efficiency of our work is shown. We also calculate the total complexity of our proposed algorithms respectively as O(TKM 0 (K log K)) and O(TKM 0 (K log K + 0.33K)).

Finally, the key parameters of the spatial spectrum are obtained via an off-grid estimator. The performance analysis of the proposed method, and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the key parameters with unknown angular distributions are also presented. Contrary to the existing methods which presume a specific type of angular distribution, the proposed method is suitable for general angular distribution as long as it is of low-rank.

In particular, the first bit to be transmitted determines the active link; while remaining bits modulate a conventional symbol to be transmitted over the active link. Yet, before transmitting the symbol, it is precoded by another signal that is extracted from the channel coefficient of the active link. The channel coefficients for both links are assumed to be available at the transmitter and the receiver through typical channel estimation algorithms. It is revealed that the security of the proposed system is significantly enhanced, where IM concept degrades the performance of an eavesdropper who is attacking any of the communication links. Also, the use of precoding worsens the functioning of an eavesdropper who is attacking both links. The impact of channel estimation errors along with the spectral efficiency, turbulence conditions, channel fading, and eavesdropper capability on the overall performance is investigated and thoroughly discussed.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present part of our ground-breaking work that bridges building design and wireless network deployment. The original contributions lie in: i) defining interference gain (IG) as an intrinsic figure of merit (FoM) of a building&#39;s wireless performance in terms of interference signal blockage; ii) developing analytic models to calculate IG; and iii) developing a novel method to calculate the optimum transmitting power to achieve the maximum IG of a building. The IG is derived as an integral transform of the probability density function (PDF) of the distance from a probe user equipment (UE) with a random position relative to a wall, and with a uniformly distributed direction. Furthermore, the PDF of the random distance is derived in closed-form for rectangular rooms to facilitate fast computation of the IG of a building under design (BUD) tiled by rectangular rooms and corridors. For BUD with irregular rooms, a random shooting algorithm (RSA) is proposed to numerically compute the PDF. The closed-form expression and the RSA are compared and validated. Numerical results show the validity of both the model to calculate IG and the methodology to derive the optimum transmitting power to achieve the maximum IG of a given building. The results shed light to architects on how to design buildings with desirable wireless performance and for radio engineers on how densely wireless access points can be deployed to approach the intrinsic wireless performance of a building.},

  abstract     = {The pantograph installed on the train roof is responsible for collecting the electrical energy via the sliding contact with the catenary constructed along the railroad. To enhance the carrying capacity of the high-speed train, multiple pantographs are normally mounted on the EMU (Electrical Multiple Unit train) to interact simultaneously with the catenary. Especially in China, the double pantographs-catenary interaction is gradually becoming the mainstream in the newly built high-speed network. The biggest challenge of double-pantograph operation is the deterioration of the current collection quality of the trailing pantograph. The mechanical wave excited by the leading pantograph propagates along the contact wire and disturbs the trailing pantograph. This paper attempts to propose effective measures to improve the current collection quality of the trailing pantograph. To improve the understanding of the wave propagation in the contact wire excited by two pantographs, the double pantographs-catenary model is established using a FEM (Finite Element Method) approach. Through the analysis of the contact wire uplift response excited by a single moving force, the optimal interval of double pantographs is discussed. The results indicate that the bad interval appears at the velocity peak of the contact wire uplift, whereas, the good interval appears at the valley value of the contact wire uplift velocity. Based on this idea, the formula of optimal interval of double pantographs is proposed, and its validity is verified using the parameters of the European and China high-speed networks. Then the damper is introduced to the steady arm to reduce the wave intensity. The simulation results show that the slight steady arm damping has a positive effect on the performance of the double pantographs-catenary interaction.},

  abstract     = {Unlike the classical modulation, for instance, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and others, where bits are transmitted via symbols particularly from modulation alphabets, in index modulation (IM), extra information bits can be conveyed via the indices of a particular transmit entities during the transmission process. Transmit antenna elements are example of transmit entities in multi-antenna systems which can be used to convey extra information bits. Recently, frequency diverse array (FDA), as a new type of transmit antenna array which differs from the traditional phased-array has been proposed in the literature. In FDA, the element indices has small frequency increment across them. In this paper, space-frequency increment IM is proposed. The proposed scheme utilizes the indices of the activated transmit FDA antennas and their respective corresponding frequency increments &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\Delta f$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; to convey additional information bits. The proposed scheme is inspired by the principle of quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) and no additional antenna activation is required. Compared with spatial modulation (SM) and QSM, it is shown that, the proposed scheme achieved higher spectral efficiency. Further, the average bit error rate (ABER), secrecy sum rate (SSR) and system capacity are derived and evaluated. Moreover, a low-complexity decoding algorithm is examined. Finally, via numerical results, the proposed scheme shows to be better than the comparative alternatives (QSM/SM), and may offer promising properties in various contexts.},

Specifically, it is the key technique in subspace-based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms, e.g., multiple signal classification (MUSIC). The calculation of the eigenvalues therefore directly affects the real-time implementation of DOA estimation approaches. However, the classical Jacobi methods are time-consuming. In literature, a parallel implementation has been adopted to accelerate the calculation of eigenvalues. In this paper, we propose to further decrease the execution time of this parallel method. In particular, each parallel unit of the proposed method uses one coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) period per iteration, while more are required by the traditional counterparts, such that the eigenvalue decomposition of the MUSIC algorithm can be accelerated. In addition, the proposed method is implemented in an FPGA platform. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more computationally efficient.},

  abstract     = {Multiple carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) estimation in high speed single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) uplink system is a challenging issue. Most of the existing blind CFO estimation methods work for a certain type of carrier mapping scheme (CMS) or address a single CFO estimation by utilizing long data over frequency selective fading channel. These estimation methods become irrelevant at high speed and multi-user scenarios where CFO changes with symbols and users. In this paper, we propose a blind multiple CFOs estimation method for all CMS of SC-FDMA and implement over testbed. The proposed method requires only one SC-FDMA symbol to attain reliable estimation even in a high mobility environment, i.e., in a doubly selective channel. It exploits the phase difference present between even and odd samples of the received oversampled signal to estimate CFOs. Subsequently, an iterative joint CFO estimation and compensation (IJCEC) method is introduced to remove residual interference and increase CFOs estimation accuracy. Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived to characterize the CFO estimation accuracy of the proposed method. The work is compared with the conventional methods such as MUSIC, ESPRIT, CAZAC, and some existing methods and validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we authenticate the proposed IJCEC method by performing implementation and measurement on National Instrument testbed setup in an indoor propagation environment.},

Each NL consists of a metal strip and a reactive component attached at its middle position. It is connected with every two antenna radiators to generate an additional coupling path against the original antenna coupling for isolation enhancement. A general network model that leads to a systematic design procedure is developed to meet the required isolation criteria. Three practical examples are presented and used to verify the proposed NL-based decoupling technique (DT). The measurement results align well with simulations. For all these examples, good impedance matching, isolation over 25 dB, total radiation efficiencies over 70%, and very low envelop correlation coefficients (ECCs) can be achieved simultaneously after adopting the proposed NL DT. Compared with previous decoupling works using parasitic elements, decoupling networks or NLs, the proposed method can achieve either a much wider decoupling bandwidth or a much smaller antenna separation distance while keeping a low design complexity along with systematic design procedure.},

In this work, the increase of adjacent leakage power ratio (ACLR) and error vector magnitude (EVM) are estimated recursively using the detected peak amplitude. We present analytical framework for OFDM-based systems with theoretical bit error rate (BER) representations and detection of optimum peak threshold based on predefined EVM and ACLR requirements. Moreover, the optimum peak detection threshold is selected based on theoretical design to maintain the pre-defined distortion level. Thus, their degradations are restricted below the pre-defined levels which correspond to target OoB radiation. We also discuss the practical design of peak-cancellation signal with target OoB radiation and in-band distortion through optimizing the windowing size of the PC signal. Numerical results show the improvements with respect to both achievable BER and PAPR with the PC method in eigen-beam space division multiplexing (E-SDM) systems under restriction of OoB power radiation. It can also be seen that the theoretical BER shows good agreements with simulation results.},

We first introduce the SDIM scheme into C-RAN based mmWave communication system and model the signal design as an optimization problem. Then, two detection methods, namely the centralized detection and distributed detection, are proposed to demodulate the received signal. Moreover, we propose a power allocation algorithm to minimize the system symbol error rate (SER). Following this, by ignoring the side lobe of the UE, the condition which ensures the superiority performance of mmWave SDIM against the conventional communication scheme is derived. Finally, we model the position of the remote radio heads (RHHs) of the network as a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) and derive the probability that the proposed SDIM scheme outperforms the conventional communication scheme to evaluate its performance.

The advantages of the proposed multiobjective beamforming power control optimization method are threefold. First, the proposed power control scheme can simultaneously achieve three objectives as follows: 1) the optimal H ∞ robust SINR target tracking performance, 2) the optimal H 2 SINR target tracking performance, and 3) the minimum average power consumption in the multicell MU-MIMO wireless system. The proposed multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) is equivalently derived as aMOP by minimizing their corresponding upper bounds under the constraint of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Second, without the requirement of statistical information and the norm-bounded condition of the channel uncertainty, the effect of inter-cell interference, intra-cell interference, channel uncertainty, round trip delay, and noise can be efficiently attenuated by the proposed robust SINR target tracking method. Third, through the proposed LMIs-constrained multiobjective evolution algorithm (MOEA), the designer can obtain Pareto optimal solutions efficiently with a good distribution along the Pareto front to achieve the proposed multiobjective power control design. Several simulation examples with the proposed multiobjective control scheme are produced with favourable results under the guarantee of the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Energy efficiency has a significant importance to optimize the wireless communications systems by providing high data rates. In order to develop energy efficient systems, one of the promising methods is to use multiple device-to-device (D2D) underlaying multiple antenna cellular systems. The interference from cellular users to D2D pairs, the interference between D2D pairs and the interference at the base station (BS) caused by D2D pairs occur in these communications systems. In this article, we propose energy efficient resource allocation algorithms for underlaying multi-D2D enabled multiple-antennas communications by employing different multiple antenna processing techniques at the BS. A joint method based on Dinkelbach algorithm and Message Passing Algorithm (MPA) and an approach based on deep learning with multi-layer artificial neural network are proposed to maximize the global energy efficiency (GEE) while satisfying the data rate requirements of both cellular users and D2D pairs. In MPA, the factor graph of the D2D pairs is constructed by taking into account the interference among the D2D pairs and the interference level at the BS to avoid any interruption in the cellular transmission. By relying on the training based on the proposed joint algorithm, a deep neural network approach is presented for off-line implementation. The performance results of the proposed energy efficient resource allocation algorithms show the superiority of multi-D2D communications over conventional single-D2D communications.},

By modeling the locations of users as a Poisson Cluster Process (PCP), we derive tractable expressions to evaluate the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) coverage probability for two user association strategies, i.e., the closest selection (CS) strategy, where the nearest LoS BS serves the user and the strongest-selection (SS) strategy, where the user communicates with the BS that provides the most significant received signal among all BSs. Numerical results are provided to validate the accuracy of the analytical model under various system parameters. The results show that regarding SINR coverage probability, the SS strategy outperforms the CS strategy in the environment with dense blockages. The results also demonstrate that the moderate fractional power control (FPC) factors should be used at the low SINR thresholds, while full FPC is optimal for the high SINR thresholds.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, based on the architecture of diversity-achieving quadrature spatial modulation (DA-QSM) transmission scheme, we propose an Enhanced DA-QSM (EDA-QSM) scheme. In the proposed EDA-QSM scheme, by using Kronecker product extension to the eight dispersion matrices of Sezginer-Sari-Biglieri (SSB) code, the size of the dispersion matrices set is doubled compared with DA-QSM. Consequently, EDA-QSM is shown to have higher spectral efficiency as well as nonvanishing determinant (NVD) property without requiring any parameter optimization. Furthermore, EDA-QSM with an appropriate ordering of the dispersion matrices is a block-orthogonal space-time code (BOSTC), which then makes the four real variables corresponding to the same block are independent and orthogonal. By utilizing this feature, for the detection of EDA-QSM we propose a state codewords matched block-by-block sphere decoding (SD) algorithm, which significantly decreases the decoding complexity of ML decoder. Simulation results of bit error rate (BER) performance show that the new EDA-QSM scheme outperforms some newly presented diversity-achieving SM schemes.},

  abstract     = {Two key challenges of the PHY-MAC layers of the wireless body area network (i.e., WBAN) are - achieving high system capacity and ensuring secure coexistence. Besides capacity and coexistence, a WBAN PHY (i.e., physical) layer is required to fulfill some preconditions such as it should not impose any detrimental effect on the human health, the network devices must be small enough to be wearable, and it should be suitable for the small area coverage. On the other hand, besides coexistence, the MAC (i.e., Media Access Control) layer needs to ensure service priority, and fairness in resource sharing. Traditionally, the WBAN PHY-MAC is based on 2.4 GHz microwave. However, recently, 60 GHz mmWave based WBAN has been envisioned as a possible solution to the above mentioned challenges. In this paper we have conducted the quantitative comparisons between the 60 GHz and the 2.4 GHz based WBANs. We have also shown the superiority of the 60 GHz based PHY over the 2.4 GHz based PHY grounded on the derived mathematical formulas and simulation results in terms of the system capacity, per cell channel ratio, co-channel reuse ratio, network coverage, device miniaturization, and health issues. Furthermore, we have proposed a game theory based solution for the WBAN MAC layer to ensure coexistence, service priority, and fairness in resource sharing.},

We obtain lower bounds on the average signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) of the system and show that in the m-MIMO II regime, the HWI levels at the relays become the only limiting factors. Employing extreme value theory, we demonstrate that as the number of relays increases the end-to-end SNDR of the system tends to Gumbel and Weibull distributions for the m-MIMO I and m-MIMO II systems, respectively. In addition, for both arbitrary numbers of source and destination antennas and m-MIMO scenarios, we provide closed form expressions for optimal power allocation between the source and the selected relay, and the effects of HWI level distributions between the receiving and the transmitting parts of the relay (which can be exploited for optimal system design under cost constraints).},

Only very few works have suggested the use of the identifier field since identifiers are critical for the arbitration procedure and changing them at random would interfere with message priorities. To preserve priority on the bus, in this work we use an ordered CMAC buffer. In this way, we can authenticate the identifiers of CAN frames and check that the sender is a legitimate node while arbitration on the bus remains unaltered. Moreover, we determine that for real-world scenarios the achieved security level is very close to the length of the ID field despite the constraints from ordering. This procedure easily circumvents replay attacks and fuzz testing on the bus, which were exploited by many recent works. We prove the feasibility of our approach by testing practical implementations on automotive-grade microcontrollers and CAN-bus traffic allocations from a high-end vehicle. The computational requirements are some of the lowest achievable for securing CAN, with a dozen CMAC-AES computations being sufficient for extracting a table of one hundred identifiers.},

The second order partial differential equation of the model is derived and both explicit and numerical solution approaches are introduced to incorporate the model in any simulation environment or analytical response analysis. Incorporating the effect of the state of charge on the parameters of this model is more easily accomplished by changing the trends of the parameters as opposed to each of them individually. The model matches to various battery type and it is validated on a 30 Ah Lithium-Ion battery from 1 C to 8 C discharge pulse current.

  abstract     = {The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) has posed significant challenges to the existing power grid infrastructure. It thus becomes of vital importance to efficiently manage the Electro-Mobility for large demand from EVs. Due to limited cruising range of EVs, vehicles have to make frequent stops for recharging, while long charging period is one major concern under plug-in charging. We herein leverage battery swapping (BS) technology to provide an alternative charging service, which substantially reduces the charging duration (from hours down to minutes). Concerning in practice that various battery is generally not compatible with each other, we thus introduce battery heterogeneity into the swapping service, concerning the case that different types of EVs co-exist. A battery heterogeneity-based swapping service framework is then proposed. Further with reservations for swapping service enabled, the demand load can be anticipated at BS stations as a guidance to alleviate service congestion. Therefore, potential hotspots can be avoided. Results show the performance gains under the proposed scheme by comparing to other benchmarks, in terms of service waiting time, etc. In particular, the diversity of battery stock across the network can be effectively managed.},

  abstract     = {This paper derives a variable-frequency critical soft-switching control method for nonisolated DC/DC converters using wide-bandgap devices. The critical soft switching control technique under maximum frequency trajectory is introduced to maintain zero voltage switching over a wide range of modulation ratios according to the load variation. The concept prevents turn-on losses that are typically much larger than the turn-off losses in SiC and GaN FETs and the latter can be further reduced by adding external drain-source capacitors. We have derived the boundary conditions for critical soft switching operation. For the reduction of inductor value and volume, a maximum available switching frequency is applied to the converter within the constraints of device requirement and soft switching boundary conditions. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed concept reduces the power losses in the wide-bandgap devices by a factor of approximately 3, enables an increase of the switching frequency by a factor of about 5, and a decrease of the main inductance by a factor of about 10. Then variable frequency critical soft switching control method is proposed with the constraints to maintain the maximum frequency within soft switching operation. Since our test bench uses off-the-shelf inductors, the inductors are subject to significant high frequency losses. Despite this, the converter efficiency increases by 1%.},

  abstract     = {One of the most challenging components of an inductive power transfer system to be designed is the coil set (transmitter and receiver coils). Due to the great number of variables, finite element software is frequently used in the simulation of the electromagnetic quantities of coil sets. These simulations take a long time to produce results. To shorten the time it takes to design a coil set, different electromagnetic models have been published. However, the published models are still dependant on extensive equations that require several numerical loops to be solved, or are not completely validated. In this paper, a new compact electromagnetic model is proposed. The proposed model uses quadrupole superposition to predict the magnetic field, induced voltage, and inductances of a coil set through a cubic polynomial function, whose coefficients are based on the parameters of the coil set. With the proposed model, it is possible to compute the mutual inductance of multiple coil sets for different horizontal misalignment conditions, after simulating (or measuring) the open-circuit voltage of only one coil set at zero misalignment. Thus, the proposed model helps greatly for coil topology analysis and design. The proposed model is validated through seven different experimental set ups featuring different coil sets, including receivers and transmitters formed by multiple quadrupoles, a transmitter formed by one main quadrupole and a resonant booster, and coil sets working at 5 kHz and 85 kHz. The experimental results show an excellent agreement with the proposed model.},

Firstly, considering the time-varying and uncertain feature of the tire cornering stiffness and the vehicle velocity in the state space equation constructed by 2 degrees of freedom (DoF) vehicle model and the path tracking preview model, the linear parameter varying (LPV) discrete model with four polytypic vertexes is constructed. Then, based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, the novel robust MPC theory with the finite time horizon is put forward to solve the min-max optimization problem after updating four polytypic vertexes in real time, which could deal with the inevitable model mismatch problem caused by the time-varying, uncertain vehicle dynamic characteristics and external disturbance. Finally, the simulation and experimental results have verified that the proposed novel robust MPC theory could emerge from the stranglehold exercised by the conservativeness of the traditional robust MPC theory with the infinite time horizon, which strengthens the robustness of this control system as well as achieves better path tracking accuracy and handling ability of AMIDEV.},

Additionally, the generation method should be flexible enough to facilitate use by automobile engineers. This study introduces a hyper-heuristic framework into Markov chain evolution (MCE). A boundary variable is introduced to refine strategies, and multiple evolution strategies are proposed for self-adaptivity. Then an evaluation function based on the desired driving cycles is designed using allocation and update mechanisms. Finally, an efficient framework is established for generating multi-parameter driving cycles. As an example, the generation efficiency of this framework is increased by 63.25% over the standard MCE method through collecting real-world driving data and considering representative driving cycles with three parameters (velocity, acceleration, and road slope). Analyzing the proportions of hyper-heuristic evolution strategies indicates the self-adaptivity of this method. Compared with an adaptive MCE method with two strategies, the proposed method has greater running efficiency and application flexibility.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, a large number of commercial airplanes equipped with sensors have been contributing to collecting the atmospheric composition and meteorological data. Based on a worldwide commercial airplane dataset, we identify an inherent limitation of such an airplane-based sensing system as airplanes fly through airspace with spatiotemporal dynamic. As a result, the sensed data is coarse-grained and incomplete. Moreover, naive methods such as installing sensors on more airplanes, cannot effectively address the issue. In this paper, we propose a collaborative airspace sensing strategy auSense to improve the sensing performance. In auSense, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are employed to sense the airspace when the airspace is not sensed by airplanes. Particularly, auSense leverages the existing worldwide commercial airplane tracking infrastructure and fine-grained trajectory data to estimate whether and when one airspace will be sensed by airplanes. Then auSense schedules the UAV paths to improve the sensing performance. We implement auSense in different airspaces based on a 1-month airplane trajectory data. The experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our data-driven UAV and commercial airplane collaborative strategy over the ground truth and other benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Localization plays an important role in autonomous driving since a high level of accuracy in vehicle localization is indispensable for a safe navigation. Most of the motion planning approaches in the literature assume negligible uncertainty in vehicle localization. However, the accuracy of localization systems can be low by design or even can drop depending on the environment in some cases. In these situations, the localization uncertainty can be taken into consideration in motion planning to increase the system reliability. Accordingly, this work presents two main contributions: (i) a probabilistic occupancy grid-based approach for localization uncertainty propagation, and (ii) a motion planning strategy that relies on such occupancy grid. Thus, the proposed motion planning solution for automated driving is able to generate safe human-like trajectories in real time while considering the localization uncertainty, ego-vehicle constrains and obstacles. In order to validate the proposed algorithms, several experiments have been conducted in a real environment.},

Specifically, a force-based vehicle model is coupled with a simple extended battery model to simulate the impact of wireless charging on the state of charge of the accumulator sub-system. In total, three different scenarios, i.e., urban, highway and combined driving are presented. The trade-off between having a standalone charging option versus combined dynamic and quasi-dynamic wireless charging is outlined and minimum system requirements, such as charging power levels and road coverage, for unlimited range are established. Furthermore, the effect of external factors such as ambient temperature, battery age and wireless transfer efficiency is investigated. It is shown that employing combined charging at medium power levels is sufficient to achieve unlimited range compared to high power requirements for standalone charging. Finally, safety concerns regarding human exposure are addressed with lower charging powers.},

  abstract     = {The local dropper defect is the most common fault in the early service stage of the overhead contact line (OCL) system. The plastic deformation and loose of a dropper may cause the variation of the contact line height, which has a direct effect on the contact performance of the pantograph-OCL system. This paper proposes a methodology to model the OCL with local dropper defect using a nonlinear finite element approach. Employing a developed TCUD (Target Configuration under Dead Load) method, which takes the vertical defective dropper position in the contact line as additional constraints, the local dropper defect is exactly added in the initial configuration of the OCL model. Several simulations of pantograph-OCL interaction are run with different positions of the defective dropper. The effect of local dropper defect on the pantograph-OCL contact forces is analysed. The results show that the increase of the defect degree causes the increment of the contact force peak around the defective dropper point. The defect on the first or last dropper within a span is the most detrimental to the current collection quality, as it directly causes the increase of maximum contact force, which challenges the safe operation of the pantograph-OCL system, and should be strictly restricted. The PSD (Power Spectral Density) analysis of contact force indicates that the dropper defect distorts the frequency characteristics of the contact force. The energy of contact forces decreases at the dropper-interval related frequencies due to the presence of dropper defect. Similarly, a significant `break&#39; of the dropper-interval frequency component can be observed in the time-frequency representation of the contact force. This phenomenon has the potential to be used to identify and locate the defective dropper from the measured contact force.},

  abstract     = {Parking lot allocation problem has received much attention in recent years. There have been various works in the literature that target the parking slot allocation problem. However, most of these works use algorithms that run on centralized servers and are based on some predictions on historical data. Due to the dynamic nature of vehicular networks, the accuracy of such prediction models is not high which ends up in a chaotic situation for the parking lot owners as well as the vehicle owners. Therefore, a distributed Parking slot Allocation Framework based on Adaptive Pricing Algorithm and Virtual Voting is proposed in this paper. The proposed model is based on virtual voting and hashgraph consensus algorithm. Using the model, all users and parking lot owners can easily come to consensus finality about the allocation of a parking slot with the use of minimal bandwidth. The proposed model provides a fair, fast and cost-optimal parking slot allocation method. The perfect ordering of allocation requests is also maintained based on consensus timestamp. Further, an adaptive pricing model is proposed to enhance the overall revenue of the parking lot owners and comfort of the users. The proposed model is deterministic and can reduce the average parking cost and time. Performance evaluations reveal that the proposed model outperforms its counterparts in terms of accurate parking slot allocation, reduced cost and parking lot resource utilization.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles are a promising instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other local pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides. Especially the taxi sector is a promising field of application. First, their high driving distances are necessary for electric vehicles to economize against conventional vehicles. Second, taxis are operated predominantly in city centers, where the pressure to reduce local emissions is greatest. However, while the electrification potential of taxi fleets has gained great attention in literature, the question of whether charging infrastructure can be profitable if only used by taxis has not been answered yet. To answer this question, we analyze 161 taxis in Karlsruhe, Germany. We find that a high share of electric taxis would come at lower cost than their diesel counterparts. Thus, a 25-45% share of taxi driving could be electrified, if only the taxi user perspective would be taken into account. However, while ten charging sites would be necessary to do so, only one charging site could be refinanced through exclusive taxi use. Consequently, the electrification potential would fall to about 3%, if only this one profitable charging site was built. Yet, in the future, electric driving will become cheaper. In 2025, already 55% electrification potential would be possible, given that both electric driving and charging infrastructure operation would be profitable. Altogether, while currently taxi charging infrastructure would require public funding or other business models, in the medium to long term, an exclusive use by taxis would be sufficient.},

To achieve high integration, the 14 layers substrate of module is fabricated with low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology, which is advanced in incorporating the passive components in multi-layers, thus realizing the signal vertical propagation for the SOP. The designed SOP covering 30~40 GHz is the core module for the millimeter-wave radar system. When the transmitting state of the system is initiated, the introduced SOP will up mix input intermediate frequency (IF) signal with local signal (LO) to millimeter-wave band. And the received millimeter-wave signal will be down-converted to the IF signal during the receiving state. The SOP integrates two frequency conversion channels and 34 monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) chips, with final size of 35 mm × 48 mm. In the whole working band, transmitting signal has a power range of 10~13 dBm with out-of-band spurious suppression below 50 dBc, while the channel under receiving has a gain of 11~15 dB with automatic gain control (AGC) of 0~50 dB and 1dB-step. The receiving and transmitting isolation between the two channels are both greater than 40 dB, and the T/R isolation in one channel is better than 40 dB.},

A closed-form expression for an upper-bound on the outage probability is derived so that the values of key parameters can be decided to maintain the outage probability below a target value. We also consider the average error probability for finite-length codes. Simulation results are compared with the derived bounds and it is shown that the bounds are reasonably tight and can be used to decide key parameters (e.g., code rates) to guarantee target error probabilities.},

Particularly, multi-connectivity under a UDN environment facilitates user-centric communication. It requires dynamic configuration of serving base station groups so that each user experiences high quality services. This paper models user mobility and mobility-aware performance in user-centric mmWave communication systems with multi-connectivity, and proposes a new analytical framework based on the stochastic geometry. To this end, we first derive compact mathematical expressions for state transitions and probabilities of various events that each user experiences. Then we investigate mobility-aware performance in terms of network overhead and downlink throughput. This helps us to understand network operation in depth, and impacts of network density and multi-connection capability on the probability of handover related events. Numerical results verify the accuracy of our analysis and illustrate the correlation between mobility-aware performance and user speed. Our findings provide useful insights into the design of user-centric mmWave communication systems.},

We systematically investigate the QoS guaranteed optimal resource provisioning problem for the connected vehicle fleet in the MEC environment. Based on stochastic traffic analysis, we propose an optimization framework to minimize the cost of resource provisioning, while the service blocking probability is guaranteed to be smaller than a predefined threshold. We then present a lightweight two-phase algorithm based on bracketing and binary searching to solve the problem efficiently. To evaluate our method, we use two large real-world datasets collected by an online taxi service platform and validate the QoS with our resource provisioning strategy. The results demonstrate that our method can save the total provision cost up to 40%, compared with the naïve resource provisioning strategy, and meanwhile can provide reliable QoS guarantee, compared with the mobility estimation-based approach.},

This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based autonomous braking decision-making strategy in an emergency situation. Three key influencing factors, including efficiency, accuracy and passengers&#39; comfort, are fully considered and satisfied by the proposed strategy. First, the vehicle lane-changing process and the braking process are analyzed in detail, which include the critical factors in the design of the autonomous braking strategy. Second, we propose a DRL process that determines the optimal strategy for autonomous braking. Particularly, a multi-objective reward function is designed, which can compromise the rewards achieved of different brake moments, the degree of the accident, and the comfort of the passenger. Third, a typical actor-critic (AC) algorithm named deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is adopted for solving the autonomous braking problem, which can improve the efficiency of the optimal strategy and be stable in continuous control tasks. Once the strategy is well trained, the vehicle can automatically take optimal braking behavior in an emergency to improve driving safety. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal in terms of learning effectiveness, decision-making accuracy and driving safety.},

  abstract     = {Due to the poor Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) performance in high-speed mobile scenarios, passengers have bad network experiences on High-Speed Railway (HSR). As a result, improving network performance for HSR scenarios has become urgent and widespread concerns. Some previous works quantitatively analyzed the TCP performance on HSR and proposed relevant solutions. Other works focused on the handover problem (the leading cause of poor network performance on HSR), and proposed a series of handover algorithms for HSR scenarios. However, the existing works are either limited to only measurement studies without algorithm implementation or lack of integration with real-world scenarios. In this paper, with a large amount of field measurement data in real HSR networks, we study the main reasons why traditional TCP performs poorly in HSR scenarios. To improve the TCP performance, we propose Hd-TCP, a customized Congestion Control (CC) algorithm designed to deal with frequent handover on HSR from the transport layer perspective. For the transmission characteristic on HSR, Hd-TCP can accurately evaluate the link condition and apply a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to make a fine control. The simulation results show that Hd-TCP outperforms traditional CC algorithms in both throughput and latency by fully utilizing the transmission gap between handovers.},

  abstract     = {There has been an increasing trend of moving computing activities closer to the edge of the network, particularly in smart city applications (e.g., vehicle-to-everything - V2X). Such a paradigm allows the end user&#39;s requests to be handled/processed by nodes at the edge of the network; thus, reducing latency, and preserving privacy of user data/activities. However, there are a number of challenges in such an edge computing ecosystem. Examples include (1) potential inappropriate utilization of resources at the edge nodes, (2) operational challenges in cache management and data integrity due to data migration between edge nodes, particularly when dealing with vehicular mobility in a V2X application, and (3) high energy consumption due to continuous link breakage and subsequent reestablishment of link(s). Therefore in this paper, we design a blockchain-based secure data processing framework for an edge envisioned V2X environment (hereafter referred to as BloCkEd). Specifically, a multi-layered edge-enabled V2X system model for BloCkEd is presented, which includes the formulation of a multi-objective optimization problem. In addition, BloCkEd comprises an optimal container-based data processing scheme, and a blockchain-based data integrity management scheme, designed to minimize link breakage and reducing latency. Using Chandigarh City, India, as the scenario, we implement and evaluate the proposed approach in terms of its latency, energy consumption, and service level agreement compliance.},

However, VANET will present a unique range of challenges and opportunities for security. In particular, key management, as the footstone to build a practical security framework in VANET, becomes a research hotspot. In this paper, we investigate key management based on blockchain for VANET. We first propose an efficient decentralized key management mechanism for VANET with blockchain (DB-KMM) to automatically realize the registration, update and revocation of user’s public key. At the same time, we present a lightweight mutual authentication and key agreement protocol based on the bivariate polynomial. Then, we analyze the security of DB-KMM in the universally composable framework and show that the mechanism can prevent the typical attacks including internal attacks, DoS attacks, public key tampering attacks and collusion attacks. Finally, we analyze the performance of the proposed scheme through experiments and simulation. Experiment results show that DB-KMM has better performance than the existing schemes in terms of communication, storage, computation overhead and latency.},

  abstract     = {The vehicular social networks (VSNs) supports diverse kinds of services such as traffic management, road safety, and sharing data (videos, audios, roads photos, air quality, and so on). However, its complex, large-scale and dynamic network structure poses new security challenges. Among these challenges, secure data transmission has turned to be a spotlight. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) may be adopted to realize one-to-many data sharing in VSNs. In traditional CP-ABE schemes, access policy is stored and granted by the could, which lacks credibility due to centralization. In this article, we propose a secure and verifiable one-to-many data sharing scheme to solve the above problem. We use blockchain to record the access policy, realizing user self-certification and cloud non-repudiation. Considering the computing capabilities of the vehicular user, we propose an effective scheme for certificating. Meanwhile, considering the sensitive information included in the access policy, we propose a policy hiding scheme. Our scheme also supports data revocation when a vehicular user no longer wants to share the data in VSNs. Finally, security analysis and simulation show our scheme is both secure and efficient.},

However, with the emergence of advanced communication and computing technologies, more and more data can be fast and conveniently collected from heterogeneous devices, and VSN has to meet new security challenges such as data security and privacy protection. Searchable encryption (SE) as a promising cryptographic primitive is devoted to data confidentiality without sacrificing data searchability. However, most existing schemes are vulnerable to the adaptive leakage-exploiting attacks or can not meet the efficiency requirements of practical applications, especially the searchable public-key encryption schemes (SPE). To achieve secure and efficient keyword search in VSN, we design a new blockchain-based searchable public-key encryption scheme with forward and backward privacy (BSPEFB). BSPEFB is a decentralized searchable public-key encryption scheme since the central search cloud server is replaced by the smart contract. Meanwhile, BSPEFB supports forward and backward privacy to achieve privacy protection.

A robust, scalable, and cost-optimal mechanism that can support the increasing number of transactions in a V2G network is required. Existing studies use traditional blockchain as to achieve this requirement. Blockchain-enabled V2G networks require a high computation power and are not suitable for micro-transactions due to the mining reward being higher than the transaction value itself. Moreover, the transaction throughput in the generic blockchain is too low to support the increasing number of frequent transactions in V2G networks. To address these challenges, in this paper, a lightweight blockchain-based protocol called Directed Acyclic Graph-based V2G network (DV2G) is proposed. Here blockchain refers to any Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and not just the bitcoin chain of blocks. A tangle data structure is used to record the transactions in the network in a secure and scalable manner. A game theory model is used to perform negotiation between the grid and vehicles at an optimized cost. The proposed model does not require the heavy computation associated to the addition of the transactions to the data structure and does not require any fees to post the transaction. The proposed model is shown to be highly scalable and supports the micro-transactions required in V2G networks.},

However, most of the existing CP-ABE access control schemes involve intermediary entities, which might suffer from a high trust-building cost, single point of failure and so on. Due to the decentralization and transparency of blockchain, some blockchain-based access control schemes are proposed to address these problems, but bring new challenges, such as the privacy leakage of access policy or attribute. In this paper, we propose a new trustworthy secure ciphertext-policy and attribute hiding access control scheme based on blockchain, named TrustAccess, to achieve trustworthy access while guaranteeing the privacy of policy and attribute. For one thing, to make the existing hidden policy CP-ABE more efficient and scalable for blockchain, we propose an optimized hidden policy CP-ABE, named OHP-CP-ABE, to ensure policy privacy while satisfying the large universe access requirement. For another thing, we use the multiplicative homomorphic ElGamal cryptosystem to ensure the attribute privacy during authorization validation. Finally, we theoretically prove the security of our TrustAccess from the aspects of blockchain operations and OHP-CP-ABE. Comprehensive comparisons and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of our TrustAccess.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) techniques are expected to be used for specific applications in Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs). Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the typical ML methods and widely used for its high efficiency. Due to the limitation of data sources, the data collected by different entities usually contain attributes that are quite different. However, in some real-world scenarios, when training an SVM classifier, many entities face the same problem that they are lacking in data with adequate attributes. Thus multiple entities are required to share data to combine a dataset with diverse attributes and then jointly train a comprehensive classifier. However, data privacy concerns are raised because of data sharing. To sovle the problem, we propose a privacy-preserving SVM classifier training scheme over vertically-partitioned datasets posessed by multiple data providers. In our scheme, we utilize consortium blockchain and threshold homomorphic cryptosystem to establish a secure SVM classifier training platform without a trusted third-party. We keep lots of training operations locally over original data and necessary interactions between participants are protected by the threshold Paillier and consortium blockchain. Security analysis proves that our scheme can preserve the privacy of the original data and the training intermediate values. Extensive experiments indicate that our scheme has high efficiency and no accuracy loss.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing interest in connected vehicles along with electrification opportunities, there is an ongoing effort to automate the charging process of electric vehicles (EVs) through their capabilities to communicate with the infrastructure and each other. However, charging EVs takes time and thus in-advance scheduling is needed. As this process is done frequently due to limited mileage per charge on EVs, it may expose the locations and charging pattern of the EV to the service providers, raising privacy concerns for their users. Nevertheless, the EV still needs to be authenticated to charging providers, which means some information will need to be provided anyway. While there have been many studies to address the problem of privacy-preserving authentication for vehicular networks, such solutions will be void if charging payments are made through traditional means. In this paper, we tackle this problem by utilizing distributed applications enabled by Blockchain and smart contracts. We adapt zero-knowledge proofs to Blockchain for enabling privacy-preserving authentication while removing the need for a central authority. We introduce two approaches, one using a token-based mechanism and another utilizing the Pederson Commitment scheme to realize anonymous authentication. We also describe a protocol for the whole process which includes scheduling and charging operations. The evaluation of the proposed approaches indicates that the overhead of this process is affordable to enable real-time charging operations for connected EVs.},

However, the security and privacy of data generated by various applications in VSNs is a great challenge, which blocks the further development of VSNs. The emerging blockchain technology seems to be a good catalyst for the development of VSN with its high security and irreversible features, which can be also a data management tool for rapidly generated data of VSNs with tamper proof. However, the full duplicates of blockchain data need to be stored in each node to ensure security, which is unacceptable for vehicles with limited resource. In this paper, to address the above storage challenge, a lightweight Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based blockchain (LDV) is proposed for resource-constrained VSNs. Specifically, based on the in-depth analysis of VSNs, we propose the social-based data reduction approach. In detail, each node only stores the interested data within the topic groups of interest and ignores the irrelevant data. To avoid the huge storage cost within large-scale groups with large amounts of data, we further present the historical data pruning method within a group, which meets the storage requirement by reducing the number of duplicates stored in each node. Experimental results show that LDV can save 97.13% storage space and has good scalability.},

  abstract     = {The papers in this special section focus on blockchains in emerging vehicular social networks. Nowadays, human factors are involved in Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and this arises to the vehicular social networks (VSNs) that promote the prosperity of VANETs and lay a solid foundation for the development of vehicular based services. With the development of fast and reliable vehicular communication techniques and various user-centric applications, VSNs are likely to pave the way for sustainable development by promoting transportation efficiency. However, the flourish of VSNs is still somehow plagued by security issues. For instance, emerging data-intensive applications such as insurance premium assessment always rely on the analysis and mining of the large-scale VSNs data. Therefore, the users’ data security and privacy become one of the most concerned issues. More examples of real threats are easy to find. If the traffic related messages are not authenticated and integrity-protected in VSNs, a single bogus and/or malicious message can potentially incur a terrible traffic accident. Thus, the real deployment of VSNs acquires appropriate security and privacy protection against the holistic environment. To meet such security and privacy requirements, a just recently proposed technique named blockchain should be significantly considered. Blockchain, widely known as one of the disruptive technologies, can provide technical support for VSNs in terms of big data management and security. Firstly, blockchain can create a ledger for VSNs, which records all data and behaviours occurring in VSNs, and coordinates all events that occurred and will happen. Once the data is uploaded to blockchain as a ledger, it is computational impossible for tampering. Secondly, blockchain can be further used to address security issues related to VSNs, such as the safety of connection and communication between intelligent vehicles. Meanwhile, the decentralized consensus mechanism will effectively strengthen the security of the system. By integrating with the smart contract, the blockchain can turn every vehicle into an independent network node, which can self-maintain and adjust. Versatile novel security properties can be offered by blockchain. Hence, it is urgent to explore the latest understanding and advances in the blockchain based techniques in VSNs. The response to our Call for Papers on this special issue was overwhelming, with 36 articles submitted from around the world. During the review process, each paper was assigned to and reviewed by multiple experts in the relevant areas, with a Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/TVT.2020.2991623 rigorous two-round reviewprocess.

To ensure the quality-of-service (QoS) of each TU, the UAV with limited energy dynamically plans its trajectory according to the locations of mobile TUs. Towards this end, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, wherein the UAV trajectory and UAV-TU association are modeled as the parameters to be optimized. To maximize the system reward and meet the QoS constraint, we develop a QoS-based action selection policy in the proposed algorithm based on double deep Q-network.

To this end, first, a new optimization model is defined to find the best transmission power and the best transmission rate of each terminal node (TN) based on the channel conditions and the desired reliability of the network. Then, the best FN is assigned to each TN according to the topology potential between FNs and TNs, such that there exists an energy consumption balancing among all FNs. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm improves the network performance in terms of reliability and loss ratio, while maintaining the energy consumption balancing among all FNs.},

  abstract     = {Most V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) applications rely on broadcasting awareness messages known as CAM (Cooperative Awareness Messages) in ETSI or BSM (Basic Safety Message) in SAE standards. A large number of studies have been devoted to guarantee their reliable transmission. However, to date, the studies are generally based on simplified data traffic models that generate awareness messages at periodic intervals or with a constant message size. These models do not accurately represent the real generation of CAM messages that follow specific mobility-based rules. Using simplified and unrealistic traffic models can significantly impact the results and validity of the studies, and hence accurate models for the generation of awareness messages are necessary. This paper proposes the first set of models that can realistically generate CAM messages. The models have been created from real traces collected by two car manufacturers in urban, sub-urban and highway test drives. The models are based on mth order Markov sources, and model the size of CAMs and the time interval between CAMs. The models are openly provided to the community and can be easily integrated into any simulator.},

Recently, deep learning (DL) based AMC (DL-AMC) methods have attracted significant attention due to their preferable performance. However, the study of most of DL-AMC methods are concentrated in the single-input and single-output (SISO) systems, while there are only a few works on DL-based AMC methods in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Therefore, we propose in this work a convolutional neural network (CNN) based zero-forcing (ZF) equalization AMC (CNN/ZF-AMC) method for MIMO systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the CNN/ZF-AMC method achieves better performance than the artificial neural network (ANN) with high order cumulants (HOC)-based AMC method under the condition of the perfect channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we also explore the impact of the imperfect CSI on the performance of the CNN/ZF-AMC method. Simulation results demonstrated that the classification performance is not only influenced by the imperfect CSI, but also associated with the number of the transmit and receive antennas.},

The base station first transmits signals to the near user and relay via SM-NOMA, and then the relay decodes and retransmits the signal of the far user. An SM-assisted FDR is used in this scheme to improve the spectral efficiency while reducing energy consumption and making full use of the antenna resources at the relay, since SM only activates one antenna in each transmission.

Specifically, we design an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) architecture composed of dimensionality reduction network and reconstruction network to respectively mimic the pilot signals and channel estimator, which can be acquired by data-driven deep learning. For the dimensionality reduction network, we design a fully-connected layer by compressing the high-dimensional massive MIMO channel vector as input to low-dimensional received measurements, where the weights are regarded as the pilot signals. For the reconstruction network, we design a fully-connected layer followed by multiple cascaded convolutional layers, which will reconstruct the high-dimensional channel as the output. By defining the mean square error between input and output as loss function, we leverage Adam algorithm to train the end-to-end DNN aforementioned with extensive channel samples. In this way, both the pilot signals and channel estimator can be simultaneously obtained.

In this correspondence, we evaluate the physical layer security performance of QSTBC-PS in MIMO wiretap channels under Rayleigh fading. We derive the tight closed-form approximate formula of secrecy outage probability for QSTBC-PS by using moment matching approximation technique. Further, we derive the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximation and the probability of strictly positive secrecy capacity in explicit form. The numerical examples validate that our analytical results match well to the Monte-Carlo simulation results for general number of receive antennas at the desired receiver and eavesdropper.},

  abstract     = {With the development of autonomous vehicular technologies, the execution tasks become more memory-consuming and computation-intensive. Simultaneously, a certain portion of tasks are latency-sensitive, such as collaborative perception, path planning, collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping, real-time pedestrian detection, etc. Because of the limited computation resources inside vehicles and restricted transmission bandwidth, edge computing can be an effective way to assist with the tasks execution. Considering from the perspective of business, the reservation or subscription cost is cheaper than real time requests. In order to minimize the expense of consuming edge services, the desirable situation is to reserve the resources as much as needed. However, the configuration of vehicular network is variational in practice due to the diversity of road maps, different time range like peak time and off-peak time, and the various task types, which makes it challenging to figure out a general machine learning model that is suitable for any case. Therefore, to predict the resource consumption in edge nodes accurately in different scenarios, we propose a two-stage meta-learning based approach to adaptively choose the appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the meta-features extracted on database. Besides, due to the deficiency of dataset for edge resource consumption, we program in game engine unity to generate the 3D model of Manhattan area. Meanwhile, we change the factors like different road maps and number of vehicles so as to get closer to practices. In the evaluation part, we adopt root mean square error, mean absolute percentage, and mean GEH as evaluation metrics to assess the performance of each model. Also, a quantitative analysis for the total cost and waste is also conducted. Eventually, we can find that the proposed meta-learning based method outperforms the non-meta ones.},

  abstract     = {Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is recently acknowledged as one of the key pillars for the next revolution of mobile communications area, where the convergence of IT and telecommunications network provides the low latency and computation capability for cellular base stations (BSs). As a result, this is a great opportunity for mobile network operators by deploying new services and applications at BSs. Nevertheless, huge capital and operational cost can challenge mobile operators for the deployment of new BSs and MEC micro-datacenters. Colocation Edge Computing (ColoMEC) is a new concept where multiple operators share not only the same BS tower but also their radio and computation resources colocated at the edge sites. In order to reduce the operational cost of a ColoMEC system, the limited bandwidth at over-utilized colocation BSs can be extended by sharing the bandwidth among BSs, while shared MEC micro-datacenters can be scaled based on the arrival traffic loads. Thus, sharing the BS infrastructure, bandwidth, and MEC micro-datacenters among the co-located mobile operators can be an economical solution to provide high-performance services with low expenses by exploiting the temporal and spatial difference in traffic loads. Turning this vision into reality, we study a joint bandwidth allocation sharing and MEC micro-datacenter scaling in ColoMEC management problem ($\mathbf {ColoMEC-MP}$). To solve $\mathbf {ColoMEC-MP}$ problem, we propose an algorithm based on proximal block coordinate descent technique by iteratively solving the decoupled convex subproblems (i.e., user association, bandwidth allocation, and MEC micro-datacenter scaling) with additional proximal terms. To improve the convergence of the proposed algorithm, we propose a greedy initialization for the user association which is based on the link capacity at each user. Our simulation demonstrates the superiority of the algorithm in terms of the operational cost compared with fixed service rate of shared MEC micro-datacenters strategies.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes Privacy Preserving Identity-Based Broadcast Proxy Re-encryption (P2B) - a scheme to provide privacy preserving in identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption. P2B uses Lagrange interpolation polynomial theorem to provide privacy to identities of the receiver group of broadcasted re-encrypted ciphertext. Proxy re-encryption is an efficient solution to securely share cloud data with receivers. For sharing data with a group of receivers, the sender needs to regenerate the re-encryption key for every receiver, which leads to an overhead on the sender side. To solve the issue, identity-based proxy re-encryption is extensible to identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption. However, the later poses a privacy issue on the receiver side, as each receiver of the receiver group needs to know the other receiver&#39;s identity. We solve the problem using the Lagrange interpolation method. We prove that our scheme is secure against chosen plaintext attack using random oracle model and it successfully hides the identities of the receivers. Finally, we implement P2B and compare it with other existing systems. It is seen that P2B reduces the decryption time by 68% than recent existing Broadcast proxy re-encryption schemes and 98% than the existing privacy preserving schemes.},

  abstract     = {Critical machine-type communications (cMTC) are targeted as a major use case in the design of the fifth generation (5G) cellular systems. In this regard, the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) has introduced several enhancements to evolve the LTE standard to meet the 5G requirements. Shortened transmission time intervals (sTTIs) are considered one of the most significant improvements proposed to satisfy the stringent latency requirements of cMTC. However, this entails several challenges to the resource allocation and scheduling process. In this paper, we address the resource allocation and scheduling of cMTC in LTE networks. The impact on the conventional human-type communications (HTC) is considered while adopting a puncturing scheduling technique. In addition, the reliability of the cMTC is ensured by utilizing the finite blocklength coding analysis to model the transmission errors and the effective bandwidth and effective capacity concepts to guarantee the queuing delay statistics of the cMTC packets. Moreover, we propose matching theory-based computationally efficient algorithms to solve the formulated optimal resource allocation problems with reduced complexity. The proposed methods are analyzed from a practical perspective. Extensive simulations show a close-to-optimal performance of the proposed schemes while outperforming other scheduling algorithms from the literature.},

  abstract     = {In the presence of irregular transmission/reception point (TRP) topologies and non-uniform user distribution, the user-to-node association optimization is a rather challenging process in real user-centric networks, especially for the joint transmission aided coordinated multipoint (CoMP) technique. The grade of challenge further escalates, when taking the dynamic user scheduling process into account in order to enhance the system capacity attained. To tackle the above-mentioned problem, we holistically optimize the system by conceiving joint user scheduling and user-to-node association. Then, for the sake of striking a significantly better balance between the network capacity and coverage quality, we propose a generalized reinforcement learning assisted framework intrinsically amalgamated both with neural-fitted Q-iteration as well as with ensemble learning and transfer learning techniques. Consequently, a powerful policy can be found for dynamically adjusting the set of TRPs participating in the joint transmission, thus allowing the CoMP-region to breathe, depending on both the temporal and geographical distribution of the tele-traffic load across the network. To facilitate the prompt learning of the global policy supporting flexible scalability, the overall network optimization process is decoupled into multiple local optimization phases associated with a number of TRP clusters relying on iterative information exchange among them. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme is capable of producing a policy achieving a network-edge throughput gain of up to 140%$ and a network capacity gain of up to 190% under the challenging scenario of having a non-uniform geographical UE distribution and bursty traffic.},

Achieving good service quality of these applications, however, necessitates the participation of large number of smartphones, which can be obtained via providing suitable incentives to smartphone users. Nonetheless, most existing incentive mechanisms assume a centralized platform for recruiting smartphones, which is prone to expose the privacy of both smartphones and task requesters. In this context, this article studies a distributed truthful incentive mechanism (DTIM) for mobile crowdsourcing, where multiple auction rounds can be conducted locally in each smartphone and task requester. Specifically, in each auction round, the participating smartphones act as the sellers and submit bids to compete for their intended crowdsourcing tasks. The task requesters, on the other hand, act as the buyers that decide on the sellers and corresponding payments, depending on their submitted bids. Finally, based on the offered payment, each smartphone selects a buyer for trading to optimize its utility. It is shown that the proposed incentive mechanism is strategy-proof, budget balanced, individually rational, and computationally efficient. Numerical results provided corroborate the beneficial properties of the scheme.},

In our work, we consider both the task allocation (which distributes tasks to different fog nodes) and the flying control (which adjusts the drone&#39;s flying speed) to minimize the drone`s journey completion time constrained by the drone&#39;s battery capacity and task completion deadlines. We formulate this joint optimization problem as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. In consideration of the practical scenario that the future task information is difficult to obtain, we design an online algorithm to provide strategies for task allocation and flying control when the drone visits each location without knowing the future.

However, IoT mobile devices are restricted in communication and computation due to mobility and portability, so that they can&#39;t afford the high computing cost for blockchain mining process. To solve it, the free resources displayed on non-mining-devices and edge cloud are selected to construct collaborative mining network(CMN) to execute mining tasks for mobile blockchain. Miners can offload their mining tasks to non-mining-devices within a CMN or the edge cloud when there are insufficient resources. Considering competition for resource of non-mining-devices, resource allocation problem in a CMN is formulated as a double auction game, among which Bayes-Nash Equilibrium (BNE) is analyzed to figure out the optimal auction price. When offloading to edge cloud, Stackelberg game is adopted to model interactions between edge cloud operator and different CMNs to obtain the optimal resource price and devices&#39; resource demands. The mechanism realizes improving the mining utility in mining networks while ensuring the maximum profit of edge cloud operator. Finally, profits of mining networks are compared with an existing mode which only considers offloading to edge cloud. Under the proposed mechanism, mining networks obtain 6.86% more profits on average.},

  abstract     = {We study multi-hop data-dissemination in a wireless network from one source to multiple nodes where some of the nodes of the network act as re-transmitting nodes and help the source in data dissemination. In this network, we study two scenarios; i) the transmitting nodes do not need an incentive for transmission and ii) they do need an incentive and are paid by their corresponding receiving nodes by virtual tokens. We investigate two problems; P1) network power minimization for the first scenario and P2) social cost minimization for the second scenario, defined as the total cost paid by the nodes of the network for receiving data. In this paper, to address P1 and P2, we propose centralized and decentralized approaches that determine which of the nodes of the network should act as transmitting nodes, find their transmit powers and their corresponding receiving nodes. For the sake of energy efficiency, in our model, we employ maximal-ratio combining (MRC) at the receivers so that a receiver can be served by multiple transmitters. The proposed decentralized approach is based on a non-cooperative cost-sharing game (CSG). In our proposed game, every receiving node chooses its respective transmitting nodes and consequently, a cost is assigned to it according to the power imposed on its chosen transmitting nodes. We discuss how the network is formed in a decentralized way, find the action of the nodes in the game and show that, despite being decentralized, the proposed game converges to a stable solution. To find the centralized global optimum, which is a benchmark to our decentralized approach, we use a mixed-integer-linear-program (MILP). Simulation results show that our proposed decentralized approach outperforms the conventional algorithms in terms of energy efficiency and social cost while it can address the need for an incentive for collaboration.},

  abstract     = {Mobile network caching (MNC) and Coordinated MultiPoint (CoMP) joint transmission (JT) techniques are expected to play a significant role in future networks. Yet, when considering caching in a CoMP-integrated network where both single transmission (ST) and JT are permitted, some challenges need to be tackled. In this paper, we propose a cooperative online caching strategy to realize autonomous transmission-aware content caching and updating for video content delivery. Different from existing works, this paper considers practical time-varying user request patterns, and exploits storage-level and transmission-level cooperation to jointly optimize content caching under dynamic user demands for JT and ST. The former helps reduce caching redundancy and the latter helps BSs create CoMP-JT opportunities to improve cell-edge throughput. We formulate the content caching problem to be a Markov decision process (MDP), in which the system reward is defined as the delay reduction after performing a caching action. The goal is to maximize the system reward. Then, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based online learning algorithm to search the optimal caching policy. To overcome the “curse of dimensionality,” the designed RL-based algorithm is extended with linear approximation. The system performance in terms of delay and cache hit rate is evaluated in the simulations, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the cellular assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where a group of edge-computing users (EUs) exploit NOMA to simultaneously offload their computation-workloads to an edge-server (ES), and conventional cellular-user (CU) allows the EUs to reuse its authorized frequency channel for the NOMA-transmission. We firstly characterize the transmit-powers of the CU and EUs and then formulate a joint optimization of the EUs&#39; offloaded computation-workloads, offloading-duration (i.e., how long for reusing the CU&#39;s channel), as well as the ES&#39;s computation-resource allocations (for processing different EUs&#39; offloaded workloads), with the objective of minimizing the overall-latency in completing all EUs&#39; computation-requirements, subject to the CU`s and EUs&#39; limited power and energy capacities as well as the ES&#39;s limited computation-resource capacity. Despite the strict non-convexity of the formulated joint optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal offloading solution. With the optimal offloading solution for the scenario of one CU, we further investigate the scenario of multiple CUs and investigate the optimal pairing of the EUs for reusing different CUs&#39; channels for computation-offloading. Taking into account the coupling effect due to the ES&#39;s limited computation-resource, we formulate a joint optimization of the EU-pairing and the ES&#39;s capacity allocation of the computation-resource for accommodating different EU-pairs. Despite the difficulty due to the mixed binary and non-linear non-convex programming of the formulated problem, we propose an efficient layered algorithm for solving the problem. Numerical results are provided to validate the accuracy of our proposed algorithms. We also show the performance advantage of our NOMA-assisted offloading in comparison with conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based computation offloading.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of intelligent transportation systems, enormous amounts of delay-sensitive vehicular services have been emerging and challenge both the architectures and protocols of vehicular networks. However, existing cloud computing-embedded vehicular networks cannot guarantee timely data processing or service access, due to long propagation delay and traffic congestion at the cloud center. Meanwhile, the current distributed network architecture does not support scalable network management, leading the intelligent data computing policies to be undeployable. With this motivation, we propose to introduce fog computing into vehicular networks and define the Multiple Time-constrained Vehicular applications Scheduling (MTVS) issue. First, to improve the network flexibility and controllability, we introduce a Fog-based Base Station (FBS) and propose a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled architecture dividing the networks into network, fog, and control layers. To address MTVS issue, instead of normal centralized computing-based approaches, we propose to distribute mobile delay-sensitive task in data-level over multiple FBSs. In particular, we regard the fog layer of SDN-enabled network as an FBS-based network and propose to distribute the computing task based on the FBSs along multiple paths in the fog layer. By Linear Programming, we optimize the optimal data distribution/transmission model by formulating the delay computation model. Then, we propose a hybrid scheduling algorithm including both local scheduling and fog scheduling, which can be deployed on the proposed SDN-enabled vehicular networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach performs better than some recent research outcomes, especially in the success rate for addressing MTVS issue.},

Nevertheless, it remains challenging on motivating the mobile users (MU) to join NOMA networks, scheduling MUs on the same sub-bands, reducing interference among the MUs and setting optimal transmit power in the NOMA networks. In this paper, first we consider the quantization error due to the limitation of receivers&#39; equipments and the decoding error during the successive interference cancellation (SIC) procedure. Second, we model the resource allocation problems as the four-level equilibrium problems with equilibrium constraints (EPEC), where the wireless operator, on behalf of each MU, first predicts the utilities and assign the MU as a NOMA user (NMU) or a traditional MU (TMU). For the NMUs, the interference penalty pricing strategy of other NMUs are proposed. Based on the announced prices of all the NMUs, the sub-channel allocation is managed in either distributed or collaborative ways. According to the announced interference prices of other NMUs and the coalition results, the optimal transmit power to gain the maximum utility is considered. Through extensive simulation analysis, the superior performance obtained by using the proposed scheme is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {For ultra-dense networks with wireless backhaul, caching strategy at small base stations (SBSs), usually with limited storage, is critical to meet massive high data rate requests. Since the content popularity profile varies with time in an unknown way, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) to design a cooperative caching strategy with maximum-distance separable (MDS) coding. We model the MDS coding based cooperative caching as a Markov decision process to capture the popularity dynamics and maximize the long-term expected cumulative traffic load served directly by the SBSs without accessing the macro base station. For the formulated problem, we first find the optimal solution for a small-scale system by embedding the cooperative MDS coding into Q-learning. To cope with the large-scale case, we approximate the state-action value function heuristically. The approximated function includes only a small number of learnable parameters and enables us to propose a fast and efficient action-selection approach, which dramatically reduces the complexity. Numerical results verify the optimality/near-optimality of the proposed RL based algorithms and show the superiority compared with the baseline schemes. They also exhibit good robustness to different environments.},

However, orbital paradigm of LEO constellation, as well as an accordingly time-changing topology, makes a huge challenge for distributing objective file due to heavy lack of end-to-end paths. To address this issue, in this paper, a Time-evolving Covering Set instructed in-network Caching (TCSC) mechanism is proposed to achieve file distribution in the IST networks with high efficiency. In the proposed mechanism, a novel Event Updating Graph (EUG) is put forward for capturing fine-grained topological information in time domain. With it, a Minimum Time-evolving Covering Set (MTCS) is constructed for designing the caching-in-network mechanism with appropriate intermediate nodes. Furthermore, a Query-based Minimum Delay Distribution Path (QMDP) algorithm is proposed for rapidly fetching objective file from cache nodes in MTCS by fully exploiting EUG-based topological information. The simulation results verified the proposed method can obviously degrade the overall overheads and access delay of all users, compared respectively with Network Central Location (NCL) metric, Random Cache metric and Maximum Node Degree Cache (MDC) metric.},

  abstract     = {Device-free activity recognition (DFAR) is an emerging technique which could infer human activities by analyzing his/her influence on surrounding wireless signals. It may empower wireless networks with the additional sensing ability. Existing studies have achieved reasonable accuracy in a pre-trained scenario. However, due to the feature shift incurred by different radio environments, a system typically achieves poor performance in a new scenario. Generally, retraining a system is laborious or even impossible in practical applications, since we have very few number of or even no labeled training samples in a new scenario. Therefore, how to realize cross-scenario DFAR in an unsupervised manner becomes an urgent problem to solve. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a deep learning network to guide the sample features of the target scenario shift to those of the source scenario without using any label information of the target scenario. Specifically, we develop a maximum-minimum adversarial approach to move the target features to the distribution of the source features, and design a center alignment strategy to further shift the target features to the distribution center. Benefit from the shifted features, extensive experimental results on a mmWave testbed demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed framework.},

However, due to the characteristics of the IoV, the problem of privacy protection and communication security has not been sufficiently studied and remains open in the IoV; thus, it is worthwhile for us to further explore and study the precise and dynamic safety certification in high-speed driving environments. In our study, we divide the IoV into several fogs to reduce the burden on the traffic control center and propose a new security authentication scheme with the vehicle&#39;s identity based on the security elliptic curve. The fog-based identity authentication (FBIA) scheme consists of two layers: the security authentication layer for vehicles outside the fog and the security monitoring layer for the rest of the vehicles. We propose two-way authentication based on the vehicle&#39;s identity in the security authentication layer and a deep learning scheme in the security monitoring layer to conduct real-time security in the IoV. Finally, we compare and analyze our FBIA scheme with related approaches, and the results show that the FBIA scheme has higher authentication accuracy and better adaptability to a high-speed mobile network environment in the IoV.},

  abstract     = {Use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly increasing in various domains such as disaster management, delivery of goods, surveillance, military, etc. Significant issues in the expansion of UAV-based applications are the security of (IoT to UAV) communication, and the limited flight time of the UAVs and IoT devices considering the limited battery power. Standalone UAVs are not capable of accomplishing several tasks, and therefore swarm of UAVs is being explored. Security issues in the swarm of UAVs do not allow the applications to leverage the full benefits that one can offer. Several recent studies have proposed the use of a distributed network of UAVs to upgrade the level of security in the swarm of UAVs. In this paper, a framework for secure and reliable energy trading among UAVs and charging stations is presented. Advanced blockchain, based on the tangle data structure is used to create a distributed network of UAVs and charging stations. The proposed model allows the UAVs to buy energy from the charging station in exchange for tokens. If the UAV does not have sufficient tokens to buy the energy, then the model allows the UAV to borrow tokens from the charging station. The borrowed tokens can be repaid back to the charging station with interest or late fees. A game-theoretic model is used for deciding the buying strategy of energy for UAVs. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed model helps in providing increased utility for the swarm of UAVs and charging stations in a secure and cost-optimal way as compared to the conventional schemes. The results can eventually be applied to IoT devices that constantly need energy to perform under ideal conditions.},

We propose a mobility model using Single-Leader-Multiple-Followers Stackelberg game theory to avoid the jamming affected region. In the proposed model, the centralized unit (CU) identifies the jamming affected region based on the locations of the affected nodes and acts as the leader. On the other hand, the jamming affected nodes act as followers and decide the mobility pattern, including the angle of movement, while minimizing the energy consumption and delay in packet delivery.

Considering the effects from the source redundancy left by source coding and the non-linear property of non-standard coding channels, the design of DP-LDPC structure is discussed, and new design principles from a global perspective are proposed. Several DP-LDPC codes for different source statistic are designed by the aid of JPEXIT algorithm and verified by Monte Carlo simulation.

  abstract     = {Data transmission over the millimeter wave (mmWave) in fifth-generation wireless networks aims to support very high speed wireless communications. A substantial increase in spectrum efficiency for mmWave transmission can be achieved by using advanced hybrid analog-digital precoding, for which accurate channel state information (CSI) is the key. Rather than estimating the entire channel matrix, it is now well-understood that directly estimating subspace information, which contains fewer parameters, does have enough information to design transceivers. However, the large channel use overhead and associated computational complexity in the existing channel subspace estimation techniques are major obstacles to deploy the subspace approach for channel estimation. In this paper, we propose a sequential two-stage subspace estimation method that can resolve the overhead issues and provide accurate subspace information. Utilizing a sequential method enables us to avoid manipulating the entire high-dimensional training signal, which greatly reduces the computational complexity. Specifically, in the first stage, the proposed method samples the columns of channel matrix to estimate its column subspace. Then, based on the obtained column subspace, it optimizes the training signals to estimate the row subspace. For a channel with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N_r$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; receive antennas and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N_t$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; transmit antennas, our analysis shows that the proposed technique only requires &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal {O}(N_t)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; channel uses, while providing a guarantee of subspace estimation accuracy. By theoretical analysis, it is shown that the similarity between the estimated subspace and the true subspace is linearly related to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), i.e., &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal {O}(\text{SNR})$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , at high SNR, while quadratically related to the SNR, i.e., &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal {O}(\text{SNR}^2)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , at low SNR. Simulation results show that the proposed sequential subspace method can provide improved subspace accuracy, normalized mean squared error, and spectrum efficiency over existing methods.},

  abstract     = {According to advanced wireless network standards, Device-to-device based communication underlaid conventional cellular network is considered a promising technology to improve the network performance. Precisely, this hybrid architecture provides an efficient resource allocation for cellular and D2D users while increasing the flexible utilization of the spectrum resources. Recently, the sparse code multiple access (SCMA) has been proposed as an efficient non-orthogonal multiple access technology for the 5G network paradigm. The SCMA scheme enhances the spectral efficiency, supports a massive connectivity, and diverses applications by enabling system overloading. Thus, in this paper, SCMA technology is applied to a D2D enabled cellular network, targeted at utilizing the overloading feature of the SCMA scheme to support a massive device connectivity while enhancing the overall network performance. The SCMA scheme is implemented to jointly optimize the codebook and power allocation in the downlink D2D enabled cellular network, with the aim to maximize the system data rate. This joint optimization problem is solved by decomposing the original problem into two sub-problems: codebook allocation and power allocation. For the codebook allocation, the rate aware codebook selection scheme for D2D system (RACBS-D2D) is proposed using conflict graph. For the power allocation solution, a geometric water-filling (GWF) method is utilized to propose the iterative GWF-based power allocation (IGWFPA) scheme. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated through simulations that reveal the benefits of the proposed solutions under different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The anti-jamming communication of the heterogeneous Internet of Satellites (IoS) has drawn increasing attentions due to the smart jamming and high dynamics. This paper investigates a spatial anti-jamming scheme for IoS, with the aim of minimizing anti-jamming routing cost via Stackelberg game and reinforcement learning. Firstly, we formulate the routing anti-jamming problem as a hierarchical anti-jamming Stackelberg game. It has been proved that there is a Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) in the proposed game. Secondly, the spatial anti-jamming scheme for IoS consists of two stages: the available routing selection and the fast anti-jamming decision. To tackle the high dynamics caused by the unknown interrupts and the unexpected congestion, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based routing algorithm (DRLR) to obtain an available routing subset; Furthermore, to make a fast anti-jamming decision, we propose a fast response anti-jamming algorithm (FRA) based on the available routing subset. The user utilizes DRLR and FRA algorithms to empirically analyze the jammer&#39;s strategies and adaptively make an anti-jamming decision according to the dynamic and unknown jamming environment. Finally, the simulations have shown that the proposed algorithm has lower routing cost and better anti-jamming performance than existing approaches, and the anti-jamming policies converge to the SE.},

The environments considered were Rayleigh fading for representing the non-line-of-sight condition and Nakagami-Rice fading for the line-of-sight condition. The transmission characteristics of massive MIMO were evaluated using the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of a Wishart matrix composed of the channel matrix. The transmission scheme adopted here was eigen-mode multi-stream transmission that selected L from N streams of N-by-M (M ≥ N) massive MIMO. From the analysis, we determined that the effect of spatial correlation for the case of L/N being less than approximately 20% enhances the channel capacity, unlike spatial diversity operation. In this way, we clarified the effect of spatial correlation on channel capacity of massive MIMO quantitatively through asymptotic eigenvalue analysis.},

  abstract     = {In cognitive radio (CR), the test statistics of most spectrum sensing algorithms are generated from the model-based features such as the signal energy and the eigenvalues from the sample covariance matrix (CM). Despite their low complexity, their detection performance depends very much on the accuracy of the presumed model. Also, these model-based statistics may not be able to exploit the full potential of the signal samples. To this end, the data-driven deep learning-based detectors have been proposed, with test statistics generated directly from signal samples in an automatic manner. However, existing deep learning-based detectors are all supervised learning-based and they usually require a massive amount of labeled training data to achieve decent detection performance. In practical CR scenarios, however, obtaining a large amount of labeled training data may be difficult. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning based spectrum sensing method named unsupervised deep spectrum sensing (UDSS). The UDSS algorithm requires no prior information such as the noise power or the signal&#39;s statistical CM. Moreover, the UDSS only requires a small amount of samples collected in absence of the primary user&#39;s (PU) signals ($H_0$ labeled data). Simulation results show that the proposed UDSS algorithm is able to approach the performance of the benchmark deep supervised learning-based spectrum sensing algorithm and outperforms the model-based benchmark algorithms under both Gaussian noise and Laplace noise.},

  abstract     = {Beamforming (BF) training is crucial to establishing reliable millimeter-wave communication connections between stations (STAs) and an access point. In IEEE 802.11ad BF training protocol, all STAs contend for limited BF training opportunities, i.e., associated BF training (A-BFT) slots, which results in severe collisions and significant BF training latency, especially in dense user scenarios. In this paper, we first develop an analytical model to evaluate the BF training protocol performance. Our analytical model accounts for various protocol components, including user density, the number of A-BFT slots, and protocol parameters, i.e., retry limit and contention window size. We then derive the average successful BF training probability, the BF training efficiency and latency. Since the derived BF training efficiency is an implicit function, to reveal the relationship between system parameters and BF training performance, we also derive an approximate expression of BF training efficiency. Theoretical analysis indicates that the BF training efficiency degrades drastically in dense user scenarios. To address this issue, we propose an enhancement scheme which adaptively adjusts the protocol parameters in tune with user density, to improve the BF training performance in dense user scenarios. Extensive simulations are carried out to validate the accuracy of the developed analytical model. In addition, simulation results show that the proposed enhancement scheme can improve the BF training efficiency by 35% in dense user scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Blind modulation classification (MC) is an integral part of designing an adaptive or intelligent transceiver for future wireless communications. However, till date, only a few works have been reported in the literature for blind MC of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system over frequency-selective fading environment. In this paper, a blind MC algorithm has been proposed and implemented over National Instruments (NI) testbed setup for linearly modulated signals of OFDM system by using discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and normalized fourth-order cumulant. The proposed MC algorithm works in the presence of synchronization errors, i.e., frequency, timing, and phase offsets and without the prior information about the signal parameters and channel statistics. To nullify the effect of timing offset in the feature extraction process, a statistical average has been taken over OFDM symbols after introducing uniformly distributed random timing offsets in each of the OFDM symbols. In this work, we have classified a more extensive pool of modulation formats for OFDM signal, i.e., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature PSK (QPSK), offset QPSK (OQPSK), minimum shift keying (MSK), and 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM). Classification is performed in two stages. At the first stage, a normalized fourth-order cumulant is used on the DFT of the received OFDM signal to classify OQPSK, MSK, and 16-QAM modulation formats. At the second stage, first we compute the DFT of the square of the received OFDM signal and then a normalized fourth-order cumulant is used to classify BPSK and QPSK modulation formats. The success rate of the proposed MC algorithm is evaluated through analytical and Monte Carlo simulations and compared with existing methods. Finally, the work is validated by providing an experimental setup on NI hardware over an indoor propagation environment.},

While the (slowly-changing) long-term channel state information (CSI) (i.e., large scale fading and polarization) can be accurately estimated at the transmit-side, the short-term CSI (instantaneous channel response) is available at the transmit-side with quantization errors due to the limited feedback. Accordingly, the utilization of a large number of DA ports is not always beneficial due to the imperfect short-term CSI at the transmitter (CSIT). In this paper, we first derive the asymptotic achievable rate and signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) for the MU linear precoding in the massive DAS, which depends on the long-term CSIT and the number of feedback bits, and propose a transmit DA port selection based on the asymptotic SLNR performance. Here, the number of selected DA ports can be also optimized according to the long-term CSIT and the number of feedback bits. Furthermore, we also propose a polarization selection strategy at each DA port (equipped with multi-polarized antennas) so as to exploit the polarization diversity. Through the simulation, we confirm that the proposed MU precoding with the DA port selection outperforms the conventional precoding schemes for the DAS and, furthermore, the proposed polarization selection strategy achieves a rate performance comparable to the DAS with a (single polarized antenna) node density twice as large.},

A challenging problem, however, is random or uncertain channel gains. Another challenge is determining whether a set of links can co-exist together, meaning they do not cause excessive interference to one another. These challenges have a direct impact on the number of activated links as well as their data rates. To this end, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach that enables each node to learn the best link to activate and data rate to use over random channel conditions. In addition, it allows nodes to learn the opportune time to use full-duplex or half-duplex transmissions. Our simulation results show our link scheduler results in an average throughput that is triple that of Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), and up to quadruple the average throughput of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA). Moreover, our link scheduler remains superior when channel gains vary significantly from their average value.},

In this article, we propose a location privacy-preserving system for LBS by constructing “cover-up ranges” to protect the query ranges associated with a location query sequence. Firstly, we present a client-based system framework for location privacy protection in LBS, which requires no compromise to the accuracy and usability of LBS. Secondly, based on the framework, we introduce a location privacy model to formulate the constraints that ideal cover-up ranges should satisfy, so as to improve the efficiency of location services and the security of location privacy. Finally, we describe an implementation algorithm to well meet the location privacy model. Both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, which can improve the security of users&#39; location privacy on the untrusted server-side, without compromising the accuracy and usability of LBS.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are used to improve traffic management and reduce the number of road accidents by providing safety applications. However, VANETs are susceptible to a number of security attacks from malicious entities. To secure the network against these attacks, most of the researchers have proposed various security schemes based on cryptography and trust management. While both cryptography and trust management are effective to some extent, each scheme has some flaw to fully secure the network. In this paper, we propose a trust management scheme based on hybrid cryptography (TMHC) to secure VANET to a larger extent. As authentication is an integral part of trust establishment and secure communications between vehicles, the proposed TMHC integrates hybrid cryptography based authentication for efficient and robust trust management scheme. The hybrid cryptography includes, asymmetric identity-based (ID-based) digital signature and symmetric hash message authentication code (HMAC). The trusted road-side unit (RSU) evaluates trust-value, whereas, agent trusted authority (ATA) computes trust-value of vehicle based on its reward-points. The results are gained with extensive simulations to validate the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed scheme meets security requirements and performs effectively. The communication overhead, computation overhead, storage overhead, and end-to-end delay of the proposed scheme were improved by 6% to 15%, 9% to 23%, 7% to 19%, and 4% to 15.85%, respectively, as compared to existing schemes.},

Considering that fog access points (F-APs) can offer cooperation gain by jointly transmitting the same file or content diversity gain by concurrently transmitting the coded subfiles, we propose to use both joint transmission (JT) strategy and parallel transmission (PT) strategy to serve users. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we first derive the expressions of successful transmission probability (STP) under different transmission strategies, and then derive the expressions of fractional offloaded traffic (FOT) and delay. We further formulate the corresponding edge caching optimization problem to maximize the STP, FOT or minimize the delay. Considering the NP-hard property of the above optimization problem, we propose an improved fruit fly optimization (FFO) based edge caching scheme, which utilizes the dynamic search step to avoid pre-mature convergence. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence and global optimality of our proposed scheme. Numerical results show that a significant performance gain is achieved by using our proposed edge caching scheme compared with the baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {We propose a learning-based scheme to investigate the dynamic multi-channel access (DMCA) problem in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond networks with fast time-varying channels wherein the channel parameters are unknown. The proposed learning-based scheme can maintain near-optimal performance for a long time, even in the sharp changing channels. This scheme greatly reduces processing delay, and effectively alleviates the error due to decision lag, which is cased by the non-immediacy of the information acquisition and processing. We first propose a psychology-based personalized quality of service model after introducing the network model with unknown channel parameters and the streaming model. Then, two access criteria are presented for the living streaming model and the buffered streaming model. Their corresponding optimization problems are also formulated. The optimization problems are solved by learning-based DMCA scheme, which combines the recurrent neural network with deep reinforcement learning. In the learning-based DMCA scheme, the agent mainly invokes the proposed prediction-based deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm as the learning algorithm. As a novel technical paradigm, our scheme has strong universality, since it can be easily extended to solve other problems in wireless communications. The real channel data-based simulation results validate that the performance of the learning-based scheme approaches that derived from the exhaustive search when making a decision at each time-slot, and is superior to the exhaustive search method when making a decision at every few time-slots.},

  abstract     = {A wideband dual circularly polarized (DCP) antenna is presented for intelligent transport system (ITS) applications, which can be used to improve the receiver sensitivity and communication quality of ITS. The presented DCP antenna is composed of an orthogonal power divider (OPD) with two orthogonal input ports, four phase shifters for quadrature phase output, and four crossed dipoles for DCP radiation. Detailed equivalent circuit analysis shows that the OPD has two orthogonal inputs and four equal magnitude in-phase and out-of-phase outputs. To achieve two sets of orthogonal quadrature output signals for DCP radiation, the lumped element based differential right-hand transmission line unit cell and left-hand transmission line unit cell are elaborately introduced as the ±45° phase shifters, and incorporated into the OPD. Eventually, orthogonal quadrature signals are successfully obtained and fed to the crossed dipoles for DCP radiation. The proposed antenna was then designed, fabricated, and measured for ITS applications. The measured results show that the overlapped impedance bandwidth of both two input ports is 1.07-1.85 GHz (53.4%), and the isolation is higher than 15.2 dB. Moreover, low axial ratio (&lt;; 1.7 dB) and symmetrical radiation patterns are achieved for unidirectional DCP radiation.},

A novel wireless secrecy and end-to-end (e2e) system analysis employing decode-and-forward (DF) opportunistic relays and an adaptive encoder with on/off transmission are reported. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution of dual correlated Rician fading is first obtained as a function of four nested infinite summations, which (i) converges for a finite number of terms, and (ii) is employed to compute secrecy outage probability for a passive wiretapper. Using two-dimensional Laplace transform of the SNR distribution of dual correlated Rician fading, an e2e system analysis is then given by deriving compact expressions for e2e SNR distributions, and e2e ergodic capacity. Relationships between important parameters are elaborated and explained. An asymptotic analysis and proof for infinite summation convergence are also given. It is shown that there is a trade-off between transmission quality and security via line-of-sight power. Simulation results are shown to match theoretical prediction, which validates this work.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a virtual angular-domain channel estimation scheme for massive multiple-input multiple-output systems operating in frequency division duplex (FDD) mode. Different from the conventional scheme where orthogonal pilots are transmitted on different antennas, we propose to transfer the channel estimation problem to the virtual angular domain and utilize the channel sparsity to reduce the training and feedback overhead. An orthogonal matching pursuit with Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization algorithm is proposed to construct the unitary transformation between the spatial domain and the virtual angular domain, which achieves higher sparsity than the existing approaches. Furthermore, we propose to estimate the downlink (DL) dominant angular set, which captures most of the channel power with only a few elements, by utilizing the directional reciprocity of FDD systems, where a calibration algorithm is introduced to handle the different wavelengths of uplink and DL transmissions. Based on the estimated dominant sets, we introduce a partial orthogonal criterion for virtual angular-domain pilot design and further propose two pilot assignment algorithms which minimize pilot overhead and pilot-reuse interference, respectively. Theoretical analyses on pilot overhead and the mean square error (MSE) performance are also presented. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed virtual angular-domain channel estimation scheme provides excellent MSE performance with much reduced pilot overhead and, consequently, enjoys much larger per-user achievable rate in comparison to the conventional schemes.},

To solve this challenging problem, we first derive the optimal structure of the training signals, and then, we convert the original problem into a tractable convex form, from which the optimal training scheme is designed efficiently. We further consider a practical special case, for which the optimal training scheme is designed with a lower complexity and the useful insights into the optimal training design are obtained. Also, to reduce the computational complexity of the optimal training design, we propose an asymptotically optimal training scheme in the high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) regime with a low complexity.

A 2 × 4-element array prototype is architected based on the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology. Both radiators and feed networks are carefully designed and analyzed for a wideband operation. Experimentally, the proposed array obtains an impedance bandwidth of 28.6% (24~32 GHz) for both polarizations. The port isolation is larger than 18.85 dB. Peak gains are 10.5 dBi and 11.6 dBi for the horizontal and vertical polarizations, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Satellite communication (SatCom) has attracted much attention due to its inherent characteristics. Security issues have gained severe concerns in SatCom since it is susceptible to be illegally eavesdropped by malicious ground stations within large-scale wireless coverage. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of a multiuser SatCom system in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. Particularly, we propose a threshold-based scheduling scheme, where the geographically clustered eavesdroppers with both the colluded and collaborated eavesdropping scenarios are assumed. Specifically, closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) is derived for the passive eavesdropping scenario when the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdroppers is unavailable. Moreover, we obtain a closed-form expression for the average secrecy capacity (ASC) of the considered system under the proposed user scheduling scheme. In order to get further insights of the proposed scheduling scheme at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the asymptotic analysis for the SOP and ASC is also demonstrated. Moreover, the reduced percentage with respect to number of user examination is also given, which validates the simplicity and efficiency of our proposed scheme compared to the traditional approaches. Numerical results deduce that with the proposed scheme, a comparable system performance with regard to the maximal selection (MS) scheme can be achieved.},

Both CS and CRs are equipped with energy-harvesters to harvest energy from the surrounding radio frequency environment. Additionally, in order to guarantee the quality-of-service of primary communications, the transmit powers of CS and CRs are limited by the maximum tolerant power at primary destination. Depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) of wireless energy links from primary transmitter (PT) to CRs, we respectively propose non-energy aware relay selection (NEARS) and energy aware relay selection (EARS) schemes for protecting the transmission from CS via CRs to CD from leaking to Es. We consider the use of the security-reliability tradeoff (SRT) to measure the performance of NEARS and EARS schemes. For the purpose of comparison, we also carry out the analysis of SRT performance for conventional direct communication (DC).

  abstract     = {When the elevation of target is smaller than a beamwidth, the complex multipath signals will distort the feature of direct signal reflected from target. The elevation of target can hardly be estimated accurately. Hence, in this paper, we proposed three kinds of neural networks models including deep neural network (DNN), 1-D convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) and 2-D convolutional neural network (2-D CNN) and their optimization method to mitigate phase distortion caused by multipath signals and enhance the phase feature of direct signal. The direction of arrival (DOA) estimation accuracy of physics-driven methods including digital beamforming (DBF) and multiple signal classification (MUSIC) is effectively improved. Concretely, we analyze the origins of error of DOA estimation in multipath environment and discuss the importance of phase feature to DOA estimation. A complete framework of feature-to-feature phase enhancement is built for DOA estimation in radar systems. The results of experiments with real data collected from a very high frequency (VHF) radar demonstrate the superior DOA estimation performance of proposed feature-to-feature learning methods with respect to other state-of-the-art methods including physics-driven methods and existing data-driven methods.},

  abstract     = {The fifth-generation wireless network (5G) is expected to support vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication which requires an accurate understanding of its highly mobile and dynamic propagation environment for efficient physical layer design. Towards this end, this paper proposes a joint design of adaptive channel prediction, beamforming and scheduling for 5G V2I communications. The channel prediction algorithm is designed without using pilot signals and assuming the channel impulse response (CIR) model. In this regard, we first propose an adaptive recursive least squares (RLS) CIR prediction approach that uses few of the past estimated CIRs to predict one or more future orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) block CIR coefficients. Then, we jointly design beamforming and vehicle equipment (VE) scheduling for each sub-carrier to maximize the uplink channel average sum spectrum efficiency (SE) by employing the predicted CIR. The beamforming problem is formulated as a Rayleigh quotient optimization where its global optimal solution can be obtained. Moreover, the VE scheduling design is formulated as an integer programming problem solved using a greedy search. To enhance the prediction performance, we propose a model-free Q-learning technique to learn a strategy for selecting the best CIR predictor at the current OFDM block. In addition, as the CIR coefficients might contain undesired taps with zero (negligible) average powers, we further examine a dominant CIR tap index identification problem (formulated as convex) from the past observed signals. We carry out extensive simulations to validate analytical expressions and examine the effects of different parameters including the VE speed on the achievable sum SE. Numerical simulations corroborate the superiority of the proposed channel prediction and scheduling algorithms over the existing ones and the relevance of identifying dominant CIR taps.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian Detection (PD) is one of the most studied issues of driver assistance systems. Although a tremendous effort is already given to create datasets and to develop classifiers for cars, studies about railway systems remain very limited. This article shows that direct application of neither existing advanced object detectors (such as AlexNet, VGG, YOLO etc.), nor specifically created systems for PD (such as Caltech/INRIA trained classifiers), can provide enough performance to overcome railway specific challenges. Fortunately, it is also shown that without waiting the collection of a mature dataset for railways as comprehensively diverse and annotated as the existing ones for cars, a Transfer Learning (TL) approach to fine-tune various successful deep models (pre-trained using both extensive image and pedestrian datasets) to railway PD tasks provides an effective solution. To achieve TL, a new RAilWay PEdestrian Dataset (RAWPED) is collected and annotated. Then, a novel three-stage system is designed. At its first stage, a feature-classifier fusion is created to overcome the localization and adaptation limitations of deep models. At the second stage, the complementarity of the transferred models and diversity of their results are exploited by conducted measurements and analyses. Based on the findings, at the third stage, a novel learning strategy is developed to create an ensemble, which conditionally weights the outputs of individual models and performs consistently better than its components. The proposed system is shown to achieve a log average miss rate of 0.34 and average precision of 0.93, which are significantly better than the performance of compared well-established models.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, automakers face unprecedented requirements to comply and exceed quality standards while attending to consumer expectations. Among the challenges are the insertion of new functions for driving assistance towards highly automated vehicles, electrification and connectivity. Introduction of simulation - driven design in the broad wide disciplines involved within vehicles development yields significant savings in both costs and product release time. This paper introduces an approach to vehicle electrical distribution systems (EDS) simulation adapting the methods used conventionally in transmission and distribution systems to the special features found in the vehicle EDS. To this purpose, a procedure based on a backward/forward sweep (BFS) algorithm for solving power flows in weakly meshed dc traction networks is applied and described. An important part of the work has to do with the information pre-processing from the modular based format used in automotive industry into standard simulation matrices. Constant current load profiles are assumed for the consumers, while the electronic control units (ECU) are considered static power distribution boxes. The main outputs of the proposed methodology are nodal voltages, branch currents and differential voltages at components terminals in the vehicle EDS. The knowledge extracted from the simulation will help the designers during the dimensioning and validation process of modern vehicles EDS and will be a powerful tool to reach the zero-prototypes goal before the start of production.},

The proposed ZMC substantially reduces energy consumption and heat generation, produces no vibration, and provides increased reliability. Traditional MC analysis typically requires computationally expensive finite element analysis (FEA). To reduce the analysis costs, a recently proposed fast and accurate nonlinear transient path energy method (NT-PEM) is utilized to significantly reduce analysis time and costs. Analysis accuracy was verified experimentally using a fabricated ZMC prototype. The economic and environmental benefits of the proposed ZMC confirm its significant potential as an energy-efficient eco-friendly alternative to traditional MC technology.

  abstract     = {Performing precise positioning is still challenging for autonomous driving. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) performance can be significantly degraded due to the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception. Recently, the studies of 3D building model aided (3DMA) GNSS positioning show promising positioning improvements in urban canyons. In this study, the benefits of 3DMA GNSS are further extended to the GNSS/inertial navigation system (INS) integration system. Based on the shadow matching solution and scoring information of candidate positions, two methods are proposed to better classify the line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS satellite measurements. Aided by the satellite visibility information, the NLOS-induced pseudorange measurement error can be mitigated before fusing GNSS with the INS in the loosely-coupled or tightly-coupled integration system. Both the proposed satellite visibility estimation methods achieve over 80% LOS/NLOS classification accuracy for most of the scenarios in the urban area, which are at least 10% improvement over the carrier-to-noise ratio ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$C/{N_0}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; )-based method. By further extending the satellite visibility estimation to exclude NLOS measurements and adjust the measurement noise covariance, the proposed 3DMA GNSS/INS tightly-coupled integrated positioning achieves nearly a factor of 3 improvements comparing to the conventional GNSS/INS integration method during the vehicular experiment in the urban canyon.},

An optimal voltage vector is selected from several given voltage vectors by comparing their fitness values. Moreover, the position space is divided into four sectors, and the fitness of each sector boundary is calculated and compared. The rotor position is first located in the sector surrounded by two boundaries that minimize the cost function. Then the selected sector is split into two parts, and the binary search algorithm is applied to reduce the sector area to improve the accuracy of position estimation. To overcome the drawback of the back EMF-based sensorless scheme, an I-f startup method is employed to accelerate the motor to the desired speed.

  abstract     = {Recently, the demand for vehicle warning systems to avoid collisions between vehicles and pedestrians has been increasingly growing. For the implementation of such systems, three types of vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) technologies are widely adopted. In the first, vehicles communicate with pedestrians via smart devices using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), but it is neither simply intuitive nor fast responsive. In the second, vehicles generate a noise in order to help pedestrians avoid collisions, at the expense of disturbing others with unwelcome noise. In the last, an on-road short-range projection technique visually informs pedestrians that a vehicle is approaching, which can be more intuitive and responsive. However, the two main drawbacks of conventional on-road projections are that they involve a static pattern and narrow emission angle. This paper proposes an on-road dynamic pattern projection technique for grabbing more attention from pedestrians with various dynamic patterns and covering a wide emission angle using an active mirror. Theoretical analysis shows that the on-road projection pattern and its angle can easily be controlled by adjusting the switching frequency, duty-cycle, and amount of current flow in the control circuitry. The simulation and experimental results validate that various patterns can be projected within a projection angle of ±70° at a power consumption less than 0.98W.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy for direct yaw moment control (DYC) of distributed drive electric vehicles (DDEVs). The NMPC strategy is based on a control-oriented model built by integrating a single track vehicle model with the Magic Formula (MF) tire model. To mitigate the NMPC computational cost, the continuation/generalized minimal residual (C/GMRES) algorithm is employed and modified for real-time optimization. Since the traditional C/GMRES algorithm cannot directly solve the inequality constraint problem, the external penalty method is introduced to transform inequality constraints into an equivalently unconstrained optimization problem. Based on the Pontryagin&#39;s minimum principle (PMP), the existence and uniqueness for solution of the proposed C/GMRES algorithm are proven. Additionally, to achieve fast initialization in C/GMRES algorithm, the varying predictive duration is adopted so that the analytic expressions of optimally initial solutions in C/GMRES algorithm can be derived and gained. A Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition based control allocation method distributes the desired traction and yaw moment among four independent motors. Numerical simulations are carried out by combining CarSim and Matlab/Simulink to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Results demonstrate that the real-time NMPC strategy can achieve superior vehicle stability performance, guarantee the given safety constraints, and significantly reduce the computational efforts.},

  abstract     = {Integer ambiguity resolution (AR) is the key to high-precision attitude determination with carrier phases. Traditional search-based AR methods require considerable computational power that is extremely challenging for high-rate and single-epoch implementations. Whereas, search-free AR methods via direct rounding suffer from the difficult deployment of short baseline and increased measurement noise. In this paper, an improved rounding strategy without any exhaustive search is proposed for properly designed four-element arrays to overcome the deployment issues and improve the AR success rate simultaneously. First, the novel four-element array is proposed to reduce the measurement noise of the virtual baseline, thus improve the AR success rate. The fourth antenna brings another virtual short baseline, such that the measurement quality can be improved by averaging. Second, the average operation is realized after detecting the integer ambiguity parity of each satellite. With a rounding scheme, the detection is performed on an epoch-by-epoch basis. Third, the success rate of AR in the long-short baseline method with a bias term is derived. Fourth, an improved rounding strategy is proposed by resolving the ambiguities sequentially. It is abbreviated as the Improved Rounding of Long-Short baseline (IRLS) approach. The least-squares method with quadratic equality constraints is further incorporated into IRLS to improve the accuracy of baseline estimation, namely QC-IRLS. Last, numerical simulations and field tests are carried out to verify the proposed array geometry and AR approach. In the field test, the proposed array reduces the standard deviation of short baseline estimation by up to two times, wherein all the ambiguities of 1886 valid epochs are successfully resolved.},

  abstract     = {Most autonomous vehicles build their perception systems on expensive sensors, such as LIDAR, RADAR, and high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS). However, cameras can provide richer sensing at a considerably lower cost, this makes them a more appealing alternative. A driving assistance system (DAS) based on monocular vision has gradually become a research hotspot, and inter-vehicle distance estimation based on monocular vision is an important technology in DAS. There are still constrains in the existing methods for estimating the inter-vehicle distance based on monocular vision, such as low accuracy when distance is larger, unstable accuracy for different types vehicles, and significantly poor performance on distance estimation for severely occluded vehicles. To improve the accuracy and robustness of ranging results, this study proposes a monocular vision end-to-end inter-vehicle distance estimation method based on 3D detection. The actual area of the rare view of the vehicle and the corresponding projection area in the image are obtained by 3D detection method. An area-distance geometric model is then established on the basis of the camera projection principle to recover distance. Our method shows its potential in complex traffic scenarios by testing the test set data provided on the real-world computer vision benchmark, KITTI. The experimental results have superior performance than the existing published methods. Moreover, the accuracy of occluded vehicle ranging results can reach approximately $98\%$, while the accuracy deviation between vehicles with different visual angles is less than $2\%$.},

Firstly, the configuration and dynamic characteristic of power split transmission is analyzed.

  abstract     = {Car sharing offers a flexible peer-to-peer or station based car rental service to customers. On one hand, it requires customers to expose identifications (e.g., valid driving licenses) to car sharing service providers (CSSPs) for accountability, i.e., the driving qualification of customers can be verified and misbehaving customers can be traced by CSSPs. On the other hand, privacy concerns arise when customers identities are exposed as honest-but-curious CSSPs may secretly extract customers privacy information by linking their car rental records to their identities. To resolve this contradiction, we propose a decentralized, accountable, and privacy-preserving architecture for car sharing services, named DAPA. In specific, to overcome the limitation of the single point of failure, multiple dynamic validation servers are employed to substitute a single trusted third-party authority and assist in building decentralized trust for customers. In addition, to protect customers&#39; privacy and achieve accountability simultaneously under the decentralized architecture, a new privacy-preserving identity management (PPIM) scheme is introduced as a basic module for DAPA. Customers&#39; identities are protected in a distributed and dynamic manner but publicly verified based on a well-designed zero-knowledge proof protocol. Only the misbehaving customers&#39; identities can be recovered by a majority of validation servers using adaptive verifiable secret sharing/redistribution techniques. Detailed security analysis shows that DAPA can minimize privacy breaches and guarantee the accountability. Performance evaluations via extensive simulations demonstrate that DAPA is efficient in terms of computational costs and communication overheads.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this article is to improve vehicular traffic in terms of both travel time and load balance. To achieve this goal, we propose an optimization model that minimizes the sum of the total travel time in the road network and a time representation of the traffic imbalance effects in the network. This paper presents an analytic formulation of the optimization problem, and an algorithm, Dynamic Interior Point Method (DIPM), that solves this optimization through driver rerouting. Unlike user-optimum traffic optimizations, DIPM leads to better fairness for drivers and works well in case of congestion. Unlike other system-wide traffic optimizations, DIPM considers the effects of the driver behavior on traffic load. Together, these features allow our system to work well in a potential real-world deployment. DIPM benefits from a central server that computes driver routes, which is reachable via cellular networks or vehicular ad hoc networks. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that DIPM is fast and can work in real-time. The results of extensive simulations with realistic urban maps and traffic scenarios show that DIPM outperforms other dynamic rerouting algorithms in terms of travel time. DIPM also improves fairness when compared with a user-optimum approach.},

  abstract     = {In urban environments, Global Positioning System (GPS) signals are often reflected or blocked by buildings causing multipath effects and Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) reception. These effects degrade GPS positioning performance. Although improved receiver and antenna design can reduce the multipath effect to some extent, NLOS elimination is limited due to sensor cost. Measurements based modelling methods have shown promise to reduce NLOS, while positioning accuracy is limited by the correct classification of the signal reception types. These limitations are addressed in this paper by developing an integrated algorithm using matching, Particle Swam Optimized Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (PSO-ANFIS) and a spatial city model. The user&#39;s location is determined by matching the high accuracy signal reception type determined by PSO-ANFIS with satellite visibility of each candidate position determined by the ray-tracing and a 3D city model. The results from a field test in an urban area in Taiwan show that the PSO-ANFIS based algorithm achieves a classification accuracy of 96%, 88%, and 91% for LOS, multipath and NLOS signals, respectively, which is superior to the other classification algorithms. The final horizontal positioning accuracies in terms of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are 3.20 m using a commercial receiver and 1.88 m using a geodetic receiver. The proposed algorithm has consistent improvements of 88% and 70% respectively compared to the traditional Weighted Least Square (WLS) based positioning method, and is the best compared to the other state-of-the art methods with the improvements ranging from 15% to 77% depending on the test conditions.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rapid development of vehicular transportation and urbanization, traffic congestion has been increasing and becomes a serious problem in almost all major cities worldwide. Many instances of traffic congestion can be traced to their root causes, the so-called traffic bottlenecks, where relief of traffic congestion at bottlenecks can bring network-wide improvement. Therefore, it is important to identify the locations of bottlenecks and very often the most effective way to improve traffic flow and relieve traffic congestion is to improve traffic situations at bottlenecks. In this article, we first propose a novel definition of traffic bottleneck taking into account both the congestion level cost of a road segment itself and the contagion cost that the congestion may propagate to other road segments. Then, an algorithm is presented to identify congested road segments and construct congestion propagation graphs to model congestion propagation in urban road networks. Using the graphs, maximal spanning trees are constructed that allow an easy identification of the causal relationship between congestion at different road segments. Moreover, using Markov analysis to determine the probabilities of congestion propagation from one road segment to another road segment, we can calculate the aforementioned congestion cost and identify bottlenecks in the road network. Finally, simulation studies using SUMO confirm that traffic relief at the bottlenecks identified using the proposed technique can bring more effective network-wide improvement. Furthermore, when considering the impact of congestion propagation, the most congested road segments are not necessarily bottlenecks in the road network. The proposed approach can better capture the features of urban bottlenecks and lead to a more effective way to identify bottlenecks for traffic improvement. Experiments are further conducted using data collected from inductive loop detectors in Taipei road network and some road segments are identified as bottlenecks using the proposed method.},

To tackle this problem, the position estimation will instead be performed using power separated and independent measurement devices, including one inertial 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) measurement unit, four angular wheel speed sensors and one pinion angle sensor. The measurement unit&#39;s sensors are initially characterized in order to understand conceptual limitations of the inertial navigation and also to be used in a filtering process. Measurement models are then fused together with vehicle dynamics process models using the architecture of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Two different EKF filter concepts are developed to estimate the vehicle position during a safe stop; one simpler filter for smooth manoeuvres and a complex filter for aggressive manoeuvres. Both filter designs are tested and evaluated with data gathered from an experimental vehicle for selected manoeuvres of developed safe-stop scenarios. The experimental results from a set of use-case manoeuvres show a trend where the size of the position estimation errors significantly grows above an initial vehicle speed of 70 km/h. This paper contributes to develop vehicle dynamics models for the purpose of a blind safe stop.},

However, such reliance creates an opportunity for safety violating attacks intended to disrupt the platoon formation and cause accidents. In this work, we investigate more realistic attacks mounted against the communication and sensing functionalities of platooned vehicles. More specifically, we are interested in approximating the set of final unsafe states, that can be reached by mounting realistically constrained attacks capable of introducing delay and injecting false-data against the aforementioned functionalities. For that purpose, we will use reachability analysis which enables us to realize whether it is possible to drive the platoon from initial to final states given performance and physical bounds. Our results suggest that these two types of attack are able to steer the platoon towards dangerous states and generate impacts on passengers&#39; safety by causing crashes at high speeds.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the integration of inverter-based wind turbine generation systems (WTGS) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) has remarkably been expanded into distribution systems throughout the world. These distributed resources could have various technical benefits to the grid. However, they are also associated with potential operation problems due to their stochastic nature, such as high power losses and voltage deviations. An optimization-based approach is introduced in this paper to properly allocate multiple WTGS in distribution systems in the presence of PEVs. The proposed approach considers 1) uncertainty models of WTGS, PEV, and loads, 2) DSTATCOM functionality of WTGS, and 3) various system constraints. Besides, the realistic operational requirements of PEVs are addressed, including initial and preset conditions of their state of charge (SOC), arriving and departing times, and various controlled/uncontrolled charging schemes. The WTGS planning paradigm is established as a bi-level optimization problem which guarantees the optimal integration of multiple WTGS, besides optimized PEV charging in a simultaneous manner. For this purpose, a bi-level metaheuristic algorithm is developed for solving the planning model. Intensive simulations and comparisons with various approaches on the 69-bus distribution system interconnected with four PEV charging stations are deeply presented considering annual datasets.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a novel control scheme for route planning with power management for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). By considering the power management of PHEVs, we aim to find the route that leads to the minimum energy consumption. The scheme adopts a two-loop structure to achieve the control objective. Specifically, in the outer loop, the minimum energy consumption route is obtained by minimizing the difference between the value function of current round and the best value from all previous rounds. In the inner loop, the energy consumption index with respect to PHEV power management for each feasible route is trained with reinforcement learning (RL). Under the RL framework, a nonlinear approximator structure, which consists of an actor approximator and a critic approximator, is built to approximate control actions and energy consumption. In addition, the convergence of value function for PHEV power management in the inner loop and asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system are rigorously studied. Using Toyota Prius as the vehicle model and planning its route in a city with various navigation ranges, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme with simulation studies.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully applied to end-to-end autonomous driving, especially in simulation environments. However, common DRL approaches used in complex autonomous driving scenarios sometimes are unstable or difficult to converge. This paper proposes two approaches to improve the stability of the policy model training with as few manual data as possible. For the first approach, reinforcement learning is combined with imitation learning to train a feature network with a small amount of manual data for parameters initialization. For the second approach, an auxiliary network is added to the reinforcement learning framework, which can leverage the real-time measurement information to deepen the understanding of environment, without any guide of demonstrators. To verify the effectiveness of these two approaches, simulations in image information-based and lidar information-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems are conducted, respectively. These approaches are not only tested in the virtual game world, but also applied in Gazebo, in which we build a 3D world based on the real vehicle model of Ranger XP900 platform, the real 3D obstacle model, and the real motion constraints with inertial characteristics, so as to ensure that the trained end-to-end autonomous driving model is more suitable for the real world. Experimental results show that the performance is increased by over 45% in the virtual game world, and can converge quickly and stably in Gazebo in which previous methods can hardly converge.},

The method is applicable in deterministic systems where a V2G network provides or receives electricity in reoccurring and predictable patterns (events). The scheduling strategy shown is based on a robust modular high-level aggregator control structure and a proposed communications and data management system. The scheduling consists of three algorithm layers, differentiating between predictive scheduling for in-event periods, smart charging for out-of-event periods and reactive scheduling for ongoing adjustments in real-time to account for uncertainty. The scheduling process is described in terms of its underlying rules for prioritising EVs to be either charged or discharged. It&#39;s behaviour is then analysed using a simulated car park of up to one thousand connected EVs for an example application in which a V2G network is used to support nearby electrified rail infrastructure, providing power for train acceleration and accepting power from regenerative braking. The departure or arrival of a train of known type and speed pattern can be regarded as a reoccurring event and its effect on the V2G network is therefore predictable due to train schedules and tracking.},

Vehicle imaging features with 2-D motion parameters are derived theoretically by exploiting a priori knowledge of polar format algorithm (PFA). In accordance with the revealed characteristics, a vision-based VideoSAR-LRSD algorithm, called three-term decomposition (TTD) with proximal exchange-based alternating directions method of multipliers (PEADMM), is then proposed to improve the performance of vehicle detection.

Due to the complicated operation environment of high-speed railways, the communication topology of MHSTs system is time-varying and changes among a set of directed graphs, which can be characterized as a Markov chain. By adopting the concept of MPC, this paper studies the distributed cooperative leader-following consensus control for MHSTs, in which a novel event-triggered strategy is introduced to determine when information exchange among neighboring trains and control update are executed. Firstly, the leader-following consensus problem of MHSTs system is transformed to the stabilization of a Markov jump system and a sufficient condition for leader-following consensus is derived with stability analysis of the Markov jump system based on the robust event-triggered MPC scheme. Then, the robust event-triggered MPC algorithm which minimizes the objective function is proposed. By optimizing the objective function, the deviation of states and amplitude of the control force are optimized. The effectiveness of the proposed robust event-triggered MPC method on cooperative cruise control of MHSTs is illustrated by numerical examples.},

Firstly, a resilient triggering communication scheme is introduced, where the triggering condition includes the uncertainty item induced by DoS attacks. Secondly, an adaptive resilient event-triggering LFC scheme is proposed to further reduce the communication burden and defeat the DoS attacks, where the event-triggering parameter can be dynamically adjusted. Third, a stability criterion is derived for Proportional Integral-based LFC systems by employing Lyapunov theory. Finally, to validate the proposed control scheme, case studies are carried out based on three different LFC power generation systems including one-area, two-area and three-area models. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that the proposed adaptive resilient LFC scheme can reduce the communication burden while defeating DoS attacks by comparing with resilient event-triggering LFC scheme and event-triggering LFC scheme in term of defense effect and average triggering period.},

Computing the Gram matrix for each active subcarrier, however, results in excessively high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose novel, approximate algorithms that significantly reduce the complexity of Gram-matrix computation by simultaneously exploiting channel hardening and correlation across subcarriers. We show analytically that a small fraction of Gram-matrix computations in combination with approximate interpolation schemes are sufficient to achieve near-optimal error-rate performance at low computational complexity in massive MU-MIMO systems. We furthermore demonstrate that our approximate interpolation algorithms are more robust against channel-estimation errors than exact Gram-matrix interpolation algorithms that require high computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is an enabling technology for the next-generation wireless systems as it provides significant improvements in terms of spectral efficiency and per-user peak data rates compared to existing, small-scale MIMO. The presence of increasing antennas at the infrastructure base-station results, however, in high computational complexity for data detection, which requires low-complexity algorithms and efficient hardware designs. Descent search (DS) algorithms have been proposed to reduce complexity of data detection and enable efficient hardware implementations. However, their error-rate performance is not always satisfactory for channels that exhibit correlation or for systems with small base-station to user antenna ratios. In this paper, we propose a linear inequality constraint quadratic programming (LICQP) model, which enables the design of a constrained DS (CDS) detector that outperforms existing DS algorithms. To further improve the performance of CDS in the presence of challenging channel conditions, we propose a universal pre-conditioner.

Adequate metrics and methodology are provided for the assessment of such scenarios. The impact of different multi-antenna geometries and MIMO architectures in both vehicle and BS is modeled based on a numerical simulation of a realistic urban area. We compare several massive hybrid BS configurations with distinct multi-antenna vehicular rooftop solutions. This paper studies the channel eigenvalues and capacities for sub-6 GHz (3.6 GHz) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) (26 GHz) bands under different propagation conditions. The results suggest that the use of hybrid massive configurations increase the channel capacity by subdividing the massive BS into two or four logical radio channels. It is also shown that the greater available bandwidth at mmWave band can compensate the larger attenuation of radio channels in small size cells. The use of adequate metrics to measure the temporal coherence of the channel is also discussed for the beam switching update.},

Nonetheless, having the ability to emulate massive MIMO channels is critical for the development and testing of next-generation cellular protocols and algorithms. To achieve such scale for massive MIMO channel emulation solutions, in this paper, we study the tradeoff in channel emulation fidelity versus the hardware resources consumed using both analytical modeling and FPGA-based implementations. To reduce the memory footprint of our design, we optimize our channel emulation using an iterative structure to generate geometry-based channels at scale. In addition, the effects of varying the channel update rate and word length selection are evaluated in the paper and can significantly improve the implementation efficiency on an FPGA.},

In these systems, the information of each vehicle&#39;s position and its relative distances with respect to its neighbours plays a crucial role to achieve the desired group performance. When getting deception attacks on such important information, it will result in severe consequences including collision. In order to detect and estimate deception attacks, a longitudinal dynamic model of vehicle platoons with modelling uncertainties, measurement noises and piece-wise constant deception attacks on sensors is first presented. With the consideration of the practical issue that a local vehicle is not able to access to global information, a distributed Kalman filter is proposed to estimate the state information using local output information. Based on the residuals obtained by the distributed Kalman filter, a modified generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) algorithm is proposed to detect and estimate the sensor deception attacks. Finally, simulations with the help of standard Carsim software are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Fair comparisons between the proposed method and the standard $\chi ^2$ detector are also presented in order to provide insights for engineering practitioners.},

In this correspondence paper, we extend our Markov chain model (A. Ahmed, H. Shan, and A. Huang, 2019) to analyze the impact of both node mobility and multiple concurrent transmissions in a cluster based mobile caching network. To unearth the impact of the former factor, we derive the steady-state probability of nodes in different clusters under the Markov mobility model. To reveal the impact of the latter factor, the per-node collision-free transmission chance in each active cluster is tunable by building the network with spatial reuse time division multiple access (STDMA) and the receiver based code division multiple access (R-CDMA) codes. Diverse network performance metrics are derived from the analytical framework. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the analysis and examine the impact of system parameters.},

Specifically, the UAV receives the confidential information from a ground source and meanwhile sends jamming signals to interfere with a potential ground eavesdropper. As the UAV has limited on-board energy in practice, we aim to maximize the EE for its secrecy communication, by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and the source/UAV transmit/jamming powers over a finite flight period. Although the formulated problem is difficult to be optimally solved due to its non-convexity, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to obtain its high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that significant EE improvements can be achieved via joint optimization and the EE gains highly depend on the capability of the self-interference cancelation at the UAV.},

Recently, it has been demonstrated that deep learning (DL)-based AMC method effectively works in the single-input single-output (SISO) systems, but DL-based AMC method is scarcely explored in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this correspondence, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based cooperative AMC (Co-AMC) method for the MIMO systems, where the receiver, equipped with multiple antennas, cooperatively recognizes the modulation types. Specifically, each received antenna gives their recognition sub-results via the CNN, respectively. Then, the decision maker identifies the modulation types, based on these sub-results and cooperative decision rules, such as direct voting (DV), weighty voting (WV), direct averaging (DA) and weighty averaging (WA). The simulation results demonstrate that the Co-AMC method, based on the CNN and WA, has the highest correct classification probability in the four cooperative decision rules. In addition, the CNN-based Co-AMC method also performs better than the high order cumulants (HOC)-based traditional AMC methods, which shows the effective feature extraction and powerful classification capabilities of the CNN.},

Considering the communication throughput requirement, peak transmit power, energy consumption, UAV flight speed, collision avoidance, and turning angle constraints, the joint UAV flight path planning and transmit power control problem is formulated as a non-convex optimization. Different from majority of prior studies that separately optimize the UAV flight path and transmit power, we develop a successive convex approximation based time minimization algorithm that simultaneously updates the UAV path and transmit power. We further prove that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge. In addition, an initialization scheme is designed to start the proposed time minimization algorithm by solving an energy minimization problem.

To maximize the sum rate, we propose a hybrid beamforming scheme where the continuous digital beamforming and discrete RIS-based analog beamforming are performed at the BS and the RIS, respectively. An iterative algorithm is designed for beamforming and theoretical analysis is provided to evaluate how the size of RIS influences the achievable rate.

We solve the problem in two steps by optimizing the receive BF and PA for a fixed TA and subsequently optimizing the TA. An iterative algorithm and its suboptimal approach are proposed for the BF and PA while a quasiconcave optimization method is adopted for the TA problem by showing its quasiconcave property.

In DSSK system, the receiver relies on the received blocks at two consecutive time slots to decode the message and arbitrary number of transmit antennas can be deployed that are not necessarily power of two. Besides, at each time instant only single transmit antenna is active to eliminate inter-channel interference (ICI) and facilitates the use of single RF-chain transmitter. Yet, the spectral efficiency of DSSK scheme is lower than its counterpart coherent SSK system and decays further for larger number of transmit antennas. As well, the receiver computational complexity grows exponentially with the transmitted block size and optimum detection gets impractical for large configurations. Hence, this paper aims at proposing reduced complexity, but yet efficient, receivers for DSSK system utilizing the inherent sparsity structure of DSSK.

However, the hardware impairments, which are usually omitted in the low-rate systems, have a detrimental impact on the THz communication link. These hardware imperfections, including in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance, phase noise and nonlinearities of the power amplifier, can be approximately modelled as complex-Gaussian distortions at both the transmitter and the receiver. In this paper, the channel estimator and signal detector (CE/SD) design of the THz-band spatial modulation (THz-SM) system is investigated, where the counterparts for classical low-rate SM are no longer applicable. More specifically, a dual-stage maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimator is proposed containing two phases of candidate acquirement and exhaustive search. Then a novel low-complexity mean-least-squares (MLS) channel estimator is developed by considering the hardware impairments in an averaging manner. Besides, the optimal detector for THz-SM is designed by taking hardware impairments into account. Simulation results validate that the proposed CE/SD design is capable of attaining reliable data transmission in THz-SM with hardware imperfections.},

Some previously proposed BA RS schemes can be viewed as special cases of the proposed scheme, such as the max-link scheme and the scheme with reduced packet delay.

  abstract     = {This paper presents the secrecy performance of a user and antenna selection at transmitter (i.e., combined scheme) over channel estimation inaccuracy in wiretap channels with multiple antennas. This paper develops the precise formulations of the combined system for the secrecy outage probability and the probability of the non-zero secrecy capacity. This work develops the diversity order for the secrecy outage probability in the presence and absence of channel inaccuracy at the combined system and eavesdropper. This work provides various numerical evaluations, showing that, the diversity order of the combined system is changed only by combined system‘s channel inaccuracy not by eavesdropper&#39;s channel inaccuracy. Also, the channel inaccuracy of the eavesdropper acts on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) gain of the combined system.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a random access system with uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where users transmit their packets by using the space-time line code (STLC) to fully exploit the spatial diversity without channel state information at the receiver. More specifically, users with a single antenna estimate channel gain from the base station (BS) with two antennas, encode the information using the STLC, and then transmit it using transmit power control so that the received power of their packets at the BS can be one of the predetermined values. The BS decodes the received packets via STLC decoding and the successive interference cancellation technique. Owing to spatial diversity, we show that the proposed scheme improves energy efficiency in comparison to the conventional system with a single antenna BS.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the coexistence of multi radio access technology (RAT) using Ultra High Frequency (UHF) small base station (SBS) and millimeter Wave (mmWave) SBS tier in a heterogeneous network (HetNet). To support large number of users, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is used in the SBS tier. For NOMA, the SBS needs to obtain users&#39; channel state information (CSI) to determine their ordering. Acquiring CSI at the SBS is a challenging task due to the massively increased number of users. The existing literature uses limited feedback from the users as a potential solution to assist the SBS in user ordering, when perfect CSI is not known at the base station. The limited feedback from the users in the existing literature is used only for user ordering. However, in the proposed work, unlike using limited feedback only for user ordering, the usage of limited feedback from the users is twofold. The first one is for the user ordering and the second is for the RAT selection. The impact of the proposed feedback system is analyzed in a NOMA enabled hybrid UHF/mmWave downlink HetNet. Numerical results show that the proposed feedback system achieves significant improvement in the outage probability.},

The optimal solution of this problem can be determined by exhaustive search. However, the complexity of this approach becomes prohibitive in practice when the sample space is large, which is usually the case in massive MIMO systems. Our algorithm overcomes this drawback by converting the original problem into a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization problem, and solving it through a related dynamical system via a stochastic gradient descent method. Using this approach, we improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of the system by performing joint antenna splitting and user scheduling. Additionally, numerical results show that the SE curves obtained with our proposed algorithm overlap with the curves achieved by exhaustive search for user scheduling.},

All nodes are configured with multiple antennas and antenna selection is adopted by the base station and relay to enhance the security performance. The exact and asymptotic closed-form SOP expressions are derived, which incorporate the impact of imperfect channel state information and apply to general cases considering the quality of service of the far and near users, whether or not the wiretap channel is known, and the location of the eavesdropper. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate the analysis and the superiority of the proposed system over the single-antenna system and the one without antenna selection.

In such cases, the conventional detector requires to estimate the joint distribution of the interfering signals, which imposes a huge computational complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose the joint use of a maximum likelihood detector (MLD) and a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), where MLD is used to produce an initial detection result and DCNN improves the detection by exploiting the local correlation to suppress the interference. Furthermore, the improved DCNN is enhanced by devising the loss function through the cross-entropy of the detection, which can help to suppress the interfering signals and simultaneously force the residual interference to approach the Gaussian distribution. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed detector compared to the conventional one.

Recently, deep learning based schemes have been proposed to deal with the memory effects. Although these schemes are powerful in constructing complex nonlinear structures, they are still direct learning-based and are relatively static. In this paper, we propose an adaptive deep learning aided digital predistortion (DL-DPD) model by optimizing a deep regression neural network. Thanks to the sequence structure of the proposed DL-DPD, we then make the linearization architecture more adaptive by using multiple sub-DPD modules and an ensemble predicting process. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive DL-DPD, and reveals that the online system handovers the sub-DPD modules more frequently than expected.},

In particular, we provide an integrated framework for partial offloading and interference management using orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) scheme. Accordingly, we formulate total latency minimization as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem by considering desired energy consumption, partial offloading, and resource allocation constraints. We use decomposition approach to solve our problem and propose a novel scheme named Joint Partial Offloading and Resource Allocation (JPORA). With aim to reduce the task execution latency, JPORA iteratively adjusts data segmentation and solves the underlying problem of quality of service (QoS)-aware communication resource allocation to the cellular links, and interference-aware communication resource allocation to D2D links. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that JPORA achieves the lowest latency as compared to the other baseline schemes, meanwhile limiting the local energy consumption of user devices.},

With the goal of improving the quality of video services while providing fairness amongst the users despite the random nature of both energy harvesting and the channel quality, we formulate our Scalable Video Coding (SVC) design as a Constrained Utility Function Maximization (CUFM) problem. The proportional fairness and playback smoothness of our design is guaranteed by maximizing the log-sum of the users&#39; video qualities, while satisfying the battery fullness constraint and video layer (quality) fluctuation constraint. By invoking the classical Lyapunov drift based optimization technique, we further decompose the CUFM problem into two parallel subproblems, i.e., a dynamic transmission power allocation problem and a dynamic layer selection problem. By solving these two subproblems, we derive a joint power allocation and video layer selection strategy for multi-user SVC video transmission. The theoretical performance bound of the proposed solution is also presented. Numerical simulations are conducted with real H.264 SVC video traces and the experimental results demonstrate the reduced playback interruption rate and layer switching rate compared to a heuristic algorithm ProNTO. The results also illustrate a tradeoff between the system&#39;s utility function and the playback smoothness experienced by the users.},

Specifically, we first exploit the PAPSO (poisoning attack with particle swarm optimization) which focuses on the training process of the deep learning algorithms in the traffic sign recognition system, i.e., the attacker injects crafted samples into the training dataset, causing a reduction in classification accuracy of the traffic sign recognition system. Then, we also explore the EAPSO (evasion attack with particle swarm optimization) which on the other hand focuses on the interference process of the deep learning algorithms, i.e., the attacker adds some hardly perceptible perturbations to the targeted test sample, leading to a misclassification on it. Extensive experiments are conducted to shed light on the effectiveness of our attacks, and some corresponding defense strategies are also presented.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed growing interests in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) topology. Existing works assume that the networks generated at each time are independent. In these works, the VANET topologies are formed based on simple traffic and communication models such as unit disk graph model. Interestingly, some works find that VANETs are scale-free ones characterized by strong connectivity and survivability, while some argue that they are not. This study analyzes VANETs in more realistic settings, trying to find the answer to the paradox. Specifically, in this paper we propose a Dynamically Evolving Networking (DEN) model and take as input realistic vehicular traces to make the research and results more practical. We consider the effect of node addition, node deletion and link loss due to node mobility and keep the network evolving by including preferential attachment and link compensation mechanisms. We find that the evolved VANET exhibits a scale-invariant feature under certain conditions. We also find that the emergence of such phenomenon has no relation to communication range if the range is large. Furthermore, we apply complex network theory to capture the dynamics of the VANET. Theoretically for the first time we show that VANET would evolve into the scale-free topology when the probability of node addition is relatively large or the probability of link compensation is properly set, the presence of which would help establish a strongly connected VANET topology.},

Different from previous works, the uncertainty caused by the channel measurements is taken into account in this paper, which yields a robust offloading strategy against realistic channel estimation errors. For this system, we design an energy-efficient computation offloading strategy, while satisfying the delay constraint. By using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) framework, the original offloading problem is transformed into a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, which is complicated and very challenging to solve. To overcome this issue, we apply Benders decomposition to find the optimal offloading solution. Numerical results show that proposed offloading strategy efficiently achieves obtain the optimal solution of the MINLP problem, and is robust to channel estimation errors.},

  abstract     = {Security is a critical element to the existing Internet of Things (IoT) deployment, where any user may actively or passively attack the content sharing of others reusing the same channel. As most smart devices are carried by human, we may leverage their owners&#39; social trust to avoid being intercepted by untrusted users, which conforms to the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm. In this paper, we propose a secure content sharing (SCS) scheme to strike the trade-off between security and quality of experience (QoE) by exploring the social trust. Firstly, to dynamically extract the social trust, the random walk strategy is employed for prediction based on the proposed “User-Content-Social Group” graph which models users&#39; preference over time. Given the social trust value, we propose a hierarchical game model to decouple the optimization problem into two sub-problems: user pairing and channel selection. More specifically, the user pairing sub-problem is formulated as a matching sub-game with peer effect, and the embedded rotation-swap matching algorithm can accommodate the dynamics caused by mutual interference. The second sub-problem can be formulated as a secure channel selection sub-game with the directed hypergraph being game space, which is proved to be an exact potential game. Then, we design an uncoupled-user concurrent learning algorithm (UUCL) to search for the optimal pure Nash equilibrium, and thereby the global optimum of this sub-game is achieved. Finally, simulation results generated on realistic social dataset verify that our proposed scheme can notably enhance the security without sacrificing users&#39; QoE.},

Though F-RANs are promising to support these enabling technologies by leveraging edge caching and edge computing, delay performance is still straightforward and should be optimized. A latency optimization problem for F-RANs is formulated, and to solve the problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based joint proactive cache placement and power allocation strategy is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, to enhance the content serving capability at the edge, we rigorously consider that a set of F-RAN nodes cooperatively serve the content request. The user&#39;s demand can be adaptively satisfied either through fog access point mode at the network edge or by centralized cloud computing mode at the cloud tier. The key idea of the proposal is to learn the user&#39;s demand and make an intelligent decision for caching appropriate content and allocating a significant amount of power resources.

In this article, we propose a heterogeneous multi-layer mobile edge computing (HetMEC), where different devices, ranging from edge devices (EDs), i.e., the mobile devices that generate raw data of computing tasks in the radio access networks, to the cloud center (CC), are inherently involved different layers of the network and collaborate for data processing. To support a low-latency service, a reinforcement learning-based framework is constructed to adapt to the unstable wireless environments as well as the dynamically varying data generation speed of each ED. Under this framework, key research issues and solutions including task offloading, cognitive radio based spectrum access, pricing scheme design, and network congestion control are presented. Some further research directions and opening issues are also discussed in the perception of network planning and optimization, network control, and application-specific issues.},

Specifically, IoT devices periodically detect wireless channel quality between IoT devices and BS, as well as that among IoT devices. Based on the wireless channel quality, we propose a distributed user cluster (UC) algorithm to cluster IoT devices as multiple UCs. One IoT device in a UC, which is named cluster head (CH), is selected to connect to the BS and gather uplink signals of IoT devices. If the wireless channel quality between CH and BS is good, a direct connection between CH and the BS can be built. Otherwise, UAVs are divided into multiple UAV cooperative relay clusters (CRCs). The UAVs in a CRC are located between a specific CH and BS to relay uplink signals. We then formulate a system optimization model to minimize system power consumption, where UAV deployment and transmission power of UAV are jointly optimized. We solve this optimization problem by dual decomposition method. By extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {In status update scenarios, the freshness of information is measured in terms of age-of-information (AoI), which essentially reflects the timeliness for real-time applications to transmit status update messages to a remote controller. For some applications, computational expensive and time consuming data processing is inevitable for status information of messages to be displayed. Mobile edge servers are equipped with adequate computation resources and they are placed close to users. Thus, mobile edge computing (MEC) can be a promising technology to reduce AoI for computation-intensive messages. In this paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive messages with MEC, and consider three computing schemes: local computing, remote computing at the MEC server, and partial computing, i.e., some part of computing tasks are performed locally, and the rest is executed at the MEC server. Zero-wait policy is adopted in all three schemes. Specifically, in local computing, a new message is generated immediately after the previous one is revealed by computing. While in remote computing and partial computing, a new message is generated once the previous one is received by the remote MEC server. With infinite queue size and exponentially distributed transmission time, closed-form average AoI for exponentially distributed computing time is derived for the three computing schemes. For deterministic computing time, the average AoI is analyzed numerically. Simulation results show that by carefully partitioning the computing tasks, the average AoI in partial computing is the smallest compared to local computing and remote computing. The results also indicate numerically the conditions on which remote computing attains smaller average AoI compared with local computing.},

  abstract     = {In the field of indoor pedestrian navigation (IPN), the orientation information of a pedestrian is often obtained by means of strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS). To deal with the problem of divergence in SINS based orientation estimates, additional orientation sensors, such as a camera, are needed to provide external orientation observations, resulting in increased cost and complexity of system. Although a low-cost magnetometer (or compass) can be used, it is significantly affected by geomagnetic disturbances indoors. Besides, the magnetometer can only give the heading observation which is insufficient to correct orientation errors in all three directions. In this paper, we propose a novel IPN method based on shoe-mounted micro-electro-mechanical systems inertial measurement unit and ultra-wideband. The biggest advantage of this method is able to obtain high-precision position and orientation estimates at low cost. In addition, in the proposed method, the data fusion is implemented by a quaternion Kalman filter which does not involve any complex linearization and hence the system complexity is reduced. Experimental results show that a decimeter level position accuracy is achieved and the orientation drifts can be limited to 0.066 radians in indoor environments.},

To minimize self-interference and inter-node interference due to the deployment of full-duplex radio, users have to feed back their measurements of interference to allow the base station to effectively allocate resources and form transmission pairs. Considering that the interference measurements are private information, users may not report the true values and may try to gain their own benefits. To solve this problem, we propose a strategy-proof resource allocation mechanism for full-duplex cellular networks. The proposed scheme, which is based on auction and matching theories, guarantees that users report true values of their channel quality and utilities, and therefore guarantees the correctness of feedback information and the efficiency of resource allocation. Moreover, the proposed matching-based mechanism is theoretically proved to be stable and Pareto efficient. Simulation results confirm that, compared to a centralized scheme with non-truthful information from users, the proposed scheme can achieve an 11% gain.},

Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) has recently gained the attention of the research community as an efficient method to solve a variety of optimization problems. As an alternative to the existing methods, our main goal in this article is to study the applicability of WOA to solve resource allocation problems in wireless networks. First, we present the fundamental backgrounds and the binary version of the WOA as well as introducing a penalty method to handle optimization constraints. Then, we demonstrate three examples of WOA to resource allocation in wireless networks, including power allocation for energy-and-spectral efficiency tradeoff in wireless interference networks, power allocation for secure throughput maximization, and mobile edge computation offloading. Lastly, we present the adoption of WOA to solve a variety of potential resource allocation problems in 5G wireless networks and beyond.},

  abstract     = {By computation offloading, fog radio access network (RAN) can support delay-constrained applications, since such a hierarchical network architecture enables parallel computing at local computing layer (LCL), edge computing layer (ECL), and cloud computing layer (CCL). Comparing to processing applications exclusively at the LCL, the assistance of processing at the ECL and the CCL can reduce computation latency, while introduce extra communication latency. These two latency are not only influenced by the hierarchical offloading decision but also by the available communication and computational resources at multiple computing layers. In this regard, this paper aims to jointly provision communication and computational resources for a powerful hierarchical offloading mechanism in fog RAN to complete delay-constrained applications with high-efficiency resource utilization. Specifically, we formulate a deadline-constrained energy minimization problem, which is followed by feasibility analysis, effective solution, and application extension.

  abstract     = {Compared with traditional Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in highways or suburban areas, maintaining network connectivity and stability is an important challenge for IoV in an urban scene, which has complex road conditions. Most existing studies focus on connectivity probability and whole network connectivity analysis. They analyze end-to-end connectivity probability under a certain node distribution model, and reveal the relationship between whole network connectivity and node density. Most of their results are not applicable to IoV in an urban scene. This work presents a concept of an IoV backbone net for IoV in an urban scene, called IoVB-net for short, to realize interconnections among nodes, and formulates an accessibility model based on IoVB-net, and proposes a routing method. The experimental results demonstrate that the trend of the accessibility&#39;s theoretical value is in accordance with that of data packet delivery rate, and the proposed routing method based on accessibility can also realize higher delivery rate and lower end-to-end latency than the improved greedy traffic aware routing and greedy perimeter stateless routing.},

Constructing a trajectory for the UAV to traverse all SNs with the cheapest cost is an important issue in UAV-aided WRSN. Although some exact algorithms and heuristic methods have been proposed, they cannot achieve a superb result for the large-scale scene within the tolerable time. In this paper, we study the UAV`s trajectory optimization problem from a novel viewpoint that the designed trajectory should maximize the UAV&#39;s energy utilization efficiency. The maximum UAV&#39;s energy utilization efficiency problem is decomposed as integer programming and non-convex optimization problems. For the problem that UAV`s charging position is fixed, we have speeded the algorithm&#39;s performance by limiting the search direction, the initial search position, and the search space. In the other case, where the power transfer efficiency is unchangeable within a certain distance, a polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (PRAS) is presented to find the approximate minimum number of hovering locations. We have presented TPA-FCP and TPA-ERC to solve the above problems, respectively. The numerical results verify that our proposed algorithms effectively reduce the length of optimal trajectory and the time complexity. Besides, the energy carried by the UAV for the specified task is predictable, which provides valuable information for arranging the UAV&#39;s flight task.},

  abstract     = {To reduce the average file delivery time under limited backhaul bandwidth and cache storage, we propose a fractional dynamic caching scheme, that coordinates the utilization of the backhaul and the cache storage. In the proposed scheme, only part of each file is pre-fetched and stored in the static storage segment of small base stations (SBSs), while remaining part of the file will be fetched into the dynamic storage segment when requested by users. We aim to minimize the average file delivery time by investigating the optimal prefetching policy, i.e., the size of the pre-fetched part of each file and the size of the dynamic storage. We formulate the file delivery time minimization problem as a convex optimization formulation. We compute the closed-form of the optimal pre-fetching policy when the wireless rate is constant. Then, a heuristic pre-fetching policy is derived, using the conditional average wireless rate. To overcome the issue that file popularity may be unknown or time-varying, we further provide an approximation of the heuristic pre-fetching policy which is irrelevant to the file popularity. We also discuss on the potential application of the proposed caching scheme in scenarios with heterogeneous file sizes. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can substantially improve the backhaul utilization efficiency, and reduce the average file delivery time. The heuristic pre-fetching policy has similar performance with the optimal pre-fetching policy yet with much lower complexity.},

The lack of predictable interference control in existing vehicular communication mechanisms, however, makes them incapable of ensuring predictable communication reliability. To address the gap, we propose the Cyber-Physical Scheduling (CPS) framework that leverages the PRK interference model and addresses the challenges of vehicle mobility and broadcast to PRK-based scheduling. To address vehicle mobility, CPS leverages the physical locations of vehicles to define the gPRK interference model, a geometric approximation of the PRK model, for lightweight control signaling and effective interference relation estimation, and CPS leverages cyber-physical structures of vehicle traffic flows for effective instantiation and use of the gPRK model. To support predictable broadcast, CPS controls the interactions between gPRK model adaptations of the links of the same sender to ensure predictable broadcast reliability in the presence of vehicle mobility. Through experimental analysis with high-fidelity ns-3 and SUMO simulation, we observe that CPS enables predictable reliability while achieving high throughput and low delay in communication. To the best of our knowledge, CPS is the first field-deployable method that ensures predictable interference control and thus reliability in inter-vehicle communications.},

  abstract     = {Data sharing and content offloading among vehicles is an imperative part of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). A peer-to-peer connection among vehicles in a distributed manner is a highly promising solution for fast communication among vehicles. To ensure security and data tracking, existing studies use blockchain as a solution. The Blockchain-enabled Internet of Vehicles (BIoV) requires high computation power for the miners to mine the blocks and let the chain grow. Over and above, the blockchain consensus is probabilistic and the block generated today can be eventually declared as a fork and can be pruned from the chain. This reduces the overall efficiency of the protocol because the correct work done initially is eventually not used if it becomes a fork. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Directed Acyclic Graph enabled IoV (DAGIoV) framework. We make use of a tangle data structure where each node acts as a miner and eventually the network achieves consensus among the nodes. A game-theoretic approach is used to model the interactions between the vehicles providing and consuming offloading services. The proposed model is proven to be highly scalable and well suited for microtransactions or frequent data transfer among the nodes in the vehicular network.},

In this paper, we propose a scheme, WiZoom, that can perform accurate multipath profiling using single-band CSI from commodity WiFi devices. In order to achieve accurate multipath profiling with limited bandwidth, WiZoom first incorporates the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm with CSI to estimate ToAs of multipath components, and then combines multiple antenna to improve the resolution of ToA estimation. WiZoom further estimates attenuations and phase shifts for multipath components using the ToAs. So far, multipath components are fully characterized, and all these estimated parameters form the multipath profile. We evaluate the performance of WiZoom using commodity WiFi devices in real environment, and results show that WiZoom achieves high accuracy in multipath profiling.},

However, most studies on coexistence only consider the issues about downlink performance and fairness between WiFi network and LTE network. In this paper, we take a comprehensive consideration of both the performance of WiFi and LTE, to propose a downlink/uplink decoupling (DUDe) scheme for the fairness of the coexistence system. Through the process of modeling construction, problem formulation with reformulation, solution and simulations, we illustrate that DUDe can achieve proportional fairness in terms of sum throughput and load balancing between uplink and downlink. In our decoupling model for coexistence between WiFi and LTE, resource allocation is under adaptive spectrum partitioning and users can access each network of WiFi and LTE. Moreover, to make our proposal more realistic, we adopt support vector machine (SVM) to predict the total number of users in WiFi and LTE coexistence system, where the predictive simulation shows its high prediction accuracy with low complexity. We further apply the prediction results to the optimization problem of DUDe. Simulation results manifest that the proposed DUDe scheme has better performance in terms of sum throughput. The sum throughput of DUDe scheme can come up to almost twice more than that of coupled association scheme. The result shows that DUDe can also achieve load balance between uplink and downlink in the coexistence system.},

In such dense heterogeneous networks (HetNets), especially in the high-rise building 3-D environment, the users need to determine which BS to be associated with before communication. Different user association schemes lead to different system performance. In this paper, a maximum instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (MISINR) user association scheme is studied in the dense urban environment. A general 3-D model is utilized to model the dense urban HetNets deployed in the high-rise buildings. The coverage probability and average user rate are theoretically derived by using stochastic geometry in a general case and an interference-limited case, respectively. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate that the MISINR user association scheme has the best performance compared with other two association schemes in 3-D HetNets. From the results, it is interesting to observe that the expressions of coverage probability and average user rate can be simplified to closed-forms in the interference-limited case.},

Hence, it has attracted increasing attention from researchers of wireless communication community. In this paper 1 , the information secrecy issue for MBM is investigated, and a secure single-input-multiple-output MBM (SIMO-MBM) system is proposed utilizing physical-layer security techniques. By considering the time-division duplexing (TDD) mode with channel reciprocity property, the legitimate channel state information (CSI) is applied to secure the data transmission of SIMO-MBM. More specifically, on one hand, adaptive phase rotation is imposed on the transmitted signals, where the rotation angle is determined by the phase of legitimate CSI; on the other hand, the mapping rule between the mirror activation pattern and binary bits is changed according to the amplitude of legitimate CSI. The BER performance of the eavesdropper is investigated via theoretical derivations, and the system secrecy mutual information is also derived, based on which the optimal design of the adaptive phase rotation strategy is provided. Theoretical and simulative results demonstrate that the proposed secure SIMO-MBM system is capable of enhancing the data confidentiality whilst keeping reliable data transmission.},

  abstract     = {Multi-frame track-before-detect (MF-TBD) is a model-based batch processing method. Assuming a particular model for the evolution of target states (e.g. a constant velocity model) within a batch processing time, MF-TBD integrates the target energy by taking advantage of the space-time correlations between a number of consecutive frames. Its performance is known to be heavily dependent on the accuracy of the motion model, and to substantially degrade when target maneuvers occur and motions do not follow the presumed model. We make two contributions towards addressing this problem. Firstly, we analyze and summarize the direct strategies to incorporate the effect of target maneuvers into MF-TBD. Our analysis shows that although these strategies are straightforward to implement, they either suffer from considerable performance loss or are computationally expensive. Motivated by the analysis, we propose a general measurement-directed (MD) strategy to address target maneuvers. It carries out an on-line study of target dynamics from the observations, and is capable of achieving both low computational complexity and high adaptability to different target maneuvers. Secondly, as the proposed MD strategy is a general framework without any particular model assumptions, we further derive its detailed implementation equations for linear motion and measurement models. Simulation results for various tracking scenarios are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MD strategy.},

  abstract     = {One of the main objectives of 5G is to ensure very high spectral efficiency. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is one of the promising techniques to address this issue. Generally, NOMA uses criteria based on distance difference between users or power allocation to pair the users. However, when the distance difference becomes small, the interference caused by users proximity can seriously affect the system performance. Many users would thus apply the former Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) rather than NOMA. Therefore, it is thus crucial to adopt a good pairing policy in NOMA systems. In this paper, we investigate the minimum pairing distance which separates the far and near users in order to promote massive connectivity. We provide an analytical expression of the pairing distance threshold assuming a fixed power allocation. Then, we propose a new user pairing scheme called Minimum Distance-NOMA (MD-NOMA) which is based on the resolved pairing distance threshold. In the second phase, we extend our study by a joint power control scheme which considers the channel gain. As Compared to the performances of other algorithms Conventional-NOMA, Uniform Channel Gain Difference-NOMA and OMA, simulation results showed that MD-NOMA achieves a significant gain in terms of number of paired users and total achieved throughput.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, software defined radio and digital signal processing have been widely used in communication and radar. As a result, the hardware and RF front-end for radar and wireless communication tends to be similar. Thus, using the same RF and hardware platform for joint radar-communication becomes viable. Joint radar-communication would bring more efficient plan and usage for the radio spectral resource. Furthermore, it could enable new applications that require information exchange and precise localization at the same time. In this paper, cyclic prefixed single carrier (CP-SC) and its variations are chosen as the waveforms for joint radar-communication. CP-SC waveform and its variations are popular in wireless communication and have been chosen by a few standards like IEEE 802.11ad and LTE-advanced. Efficient algorithms are proposed to use such waveforms for range and speed detection/estimation of targets. The proposed algorithms are derived from the maximum likelihood (ML) principle and have low computational complexity. Simulations show that the estimation performance of the proposed method is almost the same as that of ML and is much better than that of the channel estimation based method.},

The proposed structure employs antenna subset selection per radio frequency (RF) chain based on active/inactive switches and uses constant phase shifters (CPS) to control the phases of signals in the RF circuit. In this scheme, for each RF chain, a subset of receive antennas that contribute more to the desired signal power than the interference power is chosen for signal combining in the analog domain, whereas other receive antennas are excluded from signal combining, thereby enhancing sum-rates. Simultaneously, the proposed structure reduces power consumption in the RF circuit by exclusively activating switches that correspond to the antennas selected for each RF chain. We also develop three low-complexity algorithms for per-RF chain antenna subset selection. Finally, through numerical simulation, we show that the proposed structure provides higher spectral efficiency and higher energy efficiency than conventional hybrid analog and digital combining schemes for mmWave MU-MIMO systems.},

TVWS channels can be classified into two types, i.e., free TVWS channels (FTCs) and high-priority TVWS channels (HPCs). However, the development of this system encounters many challenges because of the time-varying TVWS available status, dynamic HPC spectrum leasing price, fluctuated data size of group of pictures, and diverse user requirements. To address the above issues, we first build a video data model and a TVWS model. Then, we formulate two optimization problems i) expenditure minimization subject to video quality requirement and target delay, and ii) delay minimization subject to video quality requirement and limited total budget, both of which are linear integer programming problems. Next, we develop online and offline algorithms for these two optimization problems. Finally, we implement a TVWS-based Video Delivery System (TVDS) based on a cognitive wireless network, which can use FTCs or lease HPCs to provide point-to-point (P2P) video data delivery service. The proposed algorithms are implemented in the TVDS, and extensive simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under different conditions.},

In the systems, each transmitter has M antennas, and each receiver has N antennas. We consider that each transmitter intends to send secure messages to the corresponding receiver, and another receiver can receive the messages but cannot decode them, which ensures that the messages are confidential. Comparing with previous studies on two-user broadcast channel and interference channel, we explore the case that channel matrices are rank-deficient, and the rank of channel matrices can take arbitrary value, D ≤ min(M, N). For the two rank-deficient channels, BCCM and ICCM, we divide the problem into several regimes according to the different configurations of the rank of channel matrices and the number of antennas at each node. The outer bound of rank-deficient BCCM is inferred from information theoretic methods and the achievable schemes are given by zero forcing techniques. We derive the outer bound of rank-deficient ICCM by taking the minimum region of the three outer bounds, where the first outer bound is the result of rank-deficient interference channel model without secrecy constraints, the second outer bound is obtained by considering secrecy constraints, and the third outer bound is achieved by transmitters cooperation. Then we present the achievable schemes by combining zero-forcing, real interference alignment, and spatial alignment. Finally, we determine the exact SDoF of the rank-deficient BCCM and the rank-deficient ICCM.},

Periodic orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFMD) sounding signals using Zadoff-Chu sequences have been specially designed for this purpose. The collected data has been post-processed to estimate the time-variant impulse and frequency responses and relevant parameters for system design like the time coherence, bandwidth coherence, delay spread and Doppler bandwidth. The statistical behavior of the channel gain random fluctuation has also been analyzed. This information has been extracted for both the global channel and each path separately. The wide bandwidth of the measurements have allowed the characterization of the channel in a scarcely explored ultrasonic band with an accuracy that is far beyond what is reported in previous works.},

  abstract     = {For the prominent superiorities in energy and spectrum efficiency, Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has become a hot topic among the 5th generation (5G) technologies. However, the widely adopted mode that one or more D2D links reuse one cellular user`s uplink spectrum may lead to severe limitation on D2D communication rate, especially when cellular user&#39;s uplink spectrum is very limited. In this paper, we will face the high rate requirements of D2D pairs (DPs), with the help of carrier aggregation technology, each DP can reuse the uplink spectrum of multiple cellular users when needed. More practically, we consider that only statistical channel state information (CSI) of certain communication links is available here. Then, we formulate the problem to minimize the total power consumption of the mobile devices to obtain an energy-efficient resource allocation result, including spectrum and power allocation. Meanwhile, the quality of service (QoS) requirements of cellular and high-rate D2D communications are both ensured. The formulated problem is mathematically a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is NP-hard. To solve it, we first tighten the constraints and deploy transformation methods on it to make it convex. Then, we propose a two-layer algorithm, the independent-power greedy-based outer approximation (IPGOA), to solve the transformed problem. Besides, to handle the involved uniform power allocation circumstance in the carrier aggregation process, a uniform-power GOA (UPGOA) algorithm, which can be regarded as a simplified version of IPGOA, is also proposed. The simulation results show that in different scenarios, our proposed scheme is approximately optimal.},

In this paper, we propose two schemes to guarantee the secure transmission in UAV-NOMA networks. When only one user requires secure transmission, we derive the hovering position for the UAV and the power allocation to meet rate threshold of the secure user while maximizing the sum rate of remaining users. This disrupts the eavesdropping towards the secure user effectively. When multiple users require secure transmission, we further take the advantage of beamforming via multiple antennas at the UAV to guarantee their secure transmission. Due to the non-convexity of this problem, we convert it into a convex one for an iterative solution by using the second order cone programming.

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based ABS and network-assisted ABS can improve users&#39; QoE through resource utilization efficiency enhancement. However, limited network capacity is still the bottleneck of QoE improvement. Considering the potential capacity gain of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), we study network-assisted ABS in NOMA networks. Based on a synchronous video streaming model and the knowledge of channel state information for next segment, a joint optimization problem of resource allocation and bitrate adaptation is formulated to maximize users&#39; QoE and minimize energy consumption. The original problem is NP-hard and intractable due to the interference coordination problem introduced by NOMA and the multi-slot sum rate constraint. We decompose the original problem into the subproblem of joint subchannel assignment and power allocation (JSAPA), and the subproblem of bitrate adaptation (BA) with Lagrange relaxation method. A joint resource allocation and bitrate adaptation (JRABA) algorithm is further proposed to solve the JSAPA and BA subproblems iteratively. Specifically, the JSAPA subproblem is solved by an extended Gale-Shapley matching algorithm and differ of convex (DC) programming method iteratively. For the BA subproblem, appropriate video bitrate is explored with subgradient method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and reveal that network-assisted ABS in NOMA networks benefits users in achieving higher QoE with less energy consumption, especially when radio resources are insufficient or with large segment size.},

Nevertheless, due to the high time consumption of beam alignments and the high mobility of trains, significant angle offsets will be induced during the initial access (IA) processes, which may completely invalidate the final determined beam pair. To solve this problem, in this paper we take advantage of the periodicity and regularity of trains&#39; trajectory and propose a fast IA scheme, in which the beam training set is reduced by learning from historical beam training results and further adjusted during the IA process to compensate the angle offsets due to movements of trains. To guarantee the whole network robustness, in this study a dual-band HSR network by integrating both legacy sub-6 GHz bands and mmWave bands is considered, under which the standby omnidirectional sub-6 GHz link can help facilitate the IA process of the mmWave communication part.

However, the jitter feature of UAV platform due to the absence of fixed infrastructure, the inherent randomness of airflow, and the body vibration introduces non-negligible impact on establishing robust and energy-efficient secure communication links. In this paper, we investigate energy-saving and secure transmission in a downlink A2G wiretap system considering the impact of UAV jitter. Particularly, in order to minimize the total transmission power of UAV-mounted base station, a joint beamforming optimization of confidential signal and artificial noise signal is formulated with the constraints for secrecy performance of the worst scenario. Specifically, considering the impact of UAV jittering on the antenna array response, the worst scenario indicates the A2G wiretap system with the minimum legitimate data rate and the maximum eavesdropping data rate. The non-convex problem is then reformulated with linear approximation for the channel variations and linear matrix inequality alternation for the constraints. Then, semidefinite programming relaxation is adopted to obtain the optimal solutions for the reformulated problem. Furthermore, the problem and solution are extended to the multiuser downlink wiretap system. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the impact of key system parameters on power saving under the secure transmission constraints and the UAV jitter.},

  abstract     = {As an essential part of vehicle networks, the Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) needs the support of millimeter wave and massive MIMO technologies to enable high data rate applications, such as automated driving, real-time high-quality multimedia services and so on. As the scale of the antenna array increases, the complexity of the beamforming and channel estimation algorithms under high mobility conditions also increases significantly. In particular, highly robust beamforming methods need to cope with fast changing transmission environments. In this paper, we adopt a biological inspired self-adaptive selection algorithm called attractor selection algorithm (ASA) to support uplink beamforming. The ASA requires only a little feedback information from the Road Side Infrastructure (RSI) to perform fast beam training, hence making the transmission link more stable. The simulation results indicate that the proposed ASA-assisted algorithm can significantly reduce the time required to achieve a timely beam training, which would be essential for V2I high communications under high mobility conditions.},

  abstract     = {The application of high directional beam in millimeter wave leads to a new downlink inter-cell interference (ICI) characteristic that the ICI is high only if the beam of a neighboring cell points towards a user in local cell. This characteristic indicates that the ICI can be avoided if the beams in the network are scheduled coordinately. In this paper, we investigate the time-domain beam scheduling problem for downlink ICI avoidance by modeling the entire network as a graph, where the number of time slots occupied by each beam is considered as a constraint to guarantee service quality. The beams in each cell are classified according to the neighboring cells they may interfere with. If two adjacent cells simultaneously use the beam which may interfere with each other, beam collision occurs, leading to strong ICI. Based on graph theory, we propose a least beam collision (LBC) algorithm to minimize the number of beam collisions, and we prove that this LBC algorithm is capable of acquiring the global minimum beam collision solution. Our simulation results verify that the strong ICI between two neighboring cells can be efficiently eliminated, which benefits the transmission reliability and the network&#39;s sum rate.},

First, based on quaternion theory, a novel algorithm named quaternion noncircular MUSIC (QNC-MUSIC) is proposed, and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is achieved for circular and noncircular signals. Then, a dimension reduction procedure is performed for the parameter search by employing the partial derivative of the spectrum function with respect to the noncircular phase; thus, a novel dimensional reduction noncircular MUSIC (DRNC-MUSIC) algorithm with a low computational complexity is proposed for DOA and polarization estimation of circular signals and noncircular signals.

As a mean of solving it, system energy efficiency is formulated by determining the closed-form ergodic energy-harvested and ergodic capacity of D2D and cellular users in reuse, dedicated, and cellular communication modes with the time switching and power splitting architectures of SWIPT. We then leverage the derived results, along with the energy efficiency to design an energy-efficient mode selection mechanism.

  abstract     = {A number of methods have been proposed for the response-time analysis (RTA) of controller area networks (CANs), which are the industry standard for in-vehicle network protocols. However, most of these methods are unsuitable for analyzing nonperiodically transmitted messages because they assume a constant transmission period for each message. Moreover, the calculated evaluation criteria are limited and comprise many over-pessimistic estimations, such as the worst-case response time (WCRT). To tackle these problems, this paper proposes an RTA method for CANs with randomly occurring messages, which replaces the constant transmission period with the average number of transmission instances per unit time. This approach finds the approximate probability distribution of the response time to any message in a CAN, providing a more general measure than the WCRT. To this end, a mathematical model based on M/G/1 queueing theory is developed. The model accurately emulates the behavior of nonperiodic CAN messages and enables RTA with minimal pessimistic estimations. When tested against the benchmarks, the proposed method accurately obtained response time distributions within several seconds to several tens of seconds.},

Traditionally, wireless video is fetched from remote Internet server. However, wireless video streaming from Internet server faces challenges such as congestion and long latency. ABR streaming and video transcoding at the radio access network (RAN) edge have shown the potential to overcome such problem and provided better video streaming service. In the paper, we consider joint computation and communication for ABR streaming based on mobile edge computing (MEC) under time-varying wireless channels. We propose a joint video transcoding and quality adaptation framework for ABR streaming by enabling RAN with computing capability. By modeling the wireless channel as a finite state Markov channel, we formulate the optimization problem as a stochastic optimization problem of joint computational resource assignment and video quality adaptation for maximizing the average reward, which is defined as the tradeoff between user perceived quality of experience and the cost of performing transcoding at edge server. By using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, we develop an automatic algorithm to perform the computational resource assignment and video quality adaptation without any prior knowledge of channel statistics. Simulation results using Tensorflow show the effectiveness of the designed MEC-enabled ABR streaming system and DRL algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The emerging orbital angular momentum (OAM) based wireless communication is expected to be a high spectrum-efficiency communication paradigm to solve the growing transmission data rate and limited bandwidth problem. Academic researchers mainly concentrate on the OAM-based line-of-sight (LoS) communications. However, there exist some surroundings around the transceiver in most practical wireless communication scenarios, thus forming multipath transmission. In this paper, a hybrid orthogonal division multiplexing (HODM) scheme by using OAM multiplexing and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in conjunction is proposed to achieve high-capacity wireless communications in sparse multipath environments, where the scatterers are sparse. We first build the OAM-based wireless channel in a LoS path and several reflection paths combined sparse multipath environments. We concentrate on less than or equal to three-time reflection paths because of the severe energy attenuation. The phase difference among the channel amplitude gains of the LoS and reflection paths, which is caused by the reflection paths, makes it difficult to decompose the OAM signals. We propose the phase difference compensation to handle this problem and then calculate the corresponding capacity in radio vortex wireless communications. Numerical results illustrate that the capacity of wireless communications by using our proposed HODM scheme can be drastically increased in sparse multipath environments.},

This FIO is designed using a linear time-invariant quarter-car model. While quarter-car models have the form of a bilinear system, in this study the authors convert this bilinear model to a linear model with model uncertainty based on the assumption that the control input is limited. Therefore, the proposed FIO can be used regardless of the type of damper or controller. Furthermore, the SVM based residual evaluator without empirically set thresholds is used to evaluate the generated residuals. The proposed fault diagnosis algorithm is expected to reduce the effort required in the design procedure and it can also detect a small amount of sensor fault that cannot be detected by traditional limit-checking method. The proposed fault diagnosis algorithm is verified using low cost production accelerometers and a quarter-car test rig. Consequently, the fault diagnosis algorithm proposed in this paper can detect the faults of a sprung mass accelerometer and an unsprung mass accelerometer independently, and this algorithm can reduce the effort required in designing the diagnosis algorithm greatly.},

Due to the fact that run-to-run bias is a kind of stochastic parameter, it has to be measured by utilizing online methods. Utilizing a novel, fast and efficient vision-based rotation estimation algorithm for ground vehicles, we have developed a visual gyroscope that is used in our sensor fusion system, in order to estimate run-to-run bias of the MEMS gyroscope, accurately. Comparing with similar approaches that use GPS, odometer, accelerometer or magnetometer, the most important advantage of the proposed vision-based sensor-fusion framework is its accuracy in accelerated motions. Moreover, it can be used at environments that have a magnetic field, such as urban environments, without depending on external signals. We have evaluated the efficiency of the proposed system using real datasets, recorded from a car moving in urban areas. According to our experimental results, the proposed algorithm is capable of estimating bias of gyroscope after a convergence time of about 6 seconds and improving the accuracy of the MEMS gyroscope, which provides the possibility of using cheaper sensors for high-accuracy demands.},

The proposed method is divided into two procedures, which are coarse alignment procedure and fine alignment procedure. In the coarse alignment procedure, an apparent velocity modeling method is investigated. Building upon this model, a robust Kalman filter (RKF) is designed for parameter estimation, then an optimal observation vector, in which the outliers of the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) outputs are eliminated, is reconstructed. As compared with the existing method, in the proposed method, the robustness of coarse alignment procedure is enhanced. To improve the accuracy of the coarse alignment method, a fine alignment method is designed. Different from the traditional fine alignment method, the error model of the proposed fine alignment method is constructed in n 0-frame. With this advantage, the time-varying error attitude estimation for the traditional method has transformed into a time-invariant error attitude estimation. Thus, the raw data and intermediate data, which are collected in the coarse alignment procedure, can be reused in the fine alignment procedure. Take advantage of the high performance of the navigational computer, the forward-forward data processing can be carried on repeatedly, the one cycle of the forward-forward procedure consumes about 0.3 s in the real-time system. Simulation and field tests showed that the proposed method can obtain a high-accuracy initial alignment results and suppress the interference of the outliers of the DVL outputs.},

An observer is constructed to estimate the actual sideslip angle of the vehicle with the consideration of uncertainties and disturbances of the system. Then, with conditions of bounded uncertainties and disturbances, composite super-twisting (ST) controllers combined with a velocity controller are designed to generate the total torque, the differential torque, and the rear-wheel-steering angle. On this basis, the proposed controllers have been verified to lead good robustness for maintaining the stable velocity and approaching the ideal reference model by using an optimal torque allocation controller at a lower layer. In comparison with conventional yaw moment controllers without the rear-wheel-steering control, the proposed controllers are shown to be more effective.},

The general topologies and newly presented ICs are reviewed firstly, and three main problems are concluded. Then, the proposed two-stage IC is presented, and all winding selections are thoroughly investigated by theoretical analysis, finite-element analysis (FEA) and experiments. In the proposed topology, the existing problems are all solved by employing this multi-phase system, making the reasonable winding selection, and reconfiguring the field winding. After that, a control method for charge mode and two current balance control methods are developed. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control methods. Finally, based on a 5-kW five-phase HEFS prototype machine and two sets of the 3-phase generic motor controller, an experiment platform is built. The experiment results agree well with the simulation results. Therefore, the feasibility of a two-stage integrated on-board charger that can operate at any voltage level is confirmed, where only the hybrid-exciting machine and its own driving system are used without any additional power devices.},

  abstract     = {The hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which is composed of battery and ultracapacitor, is established to enhance the performance of an electric vehicle (EV). Moreover, several studies highlight the gains of split the traction power demand among electric motors (EMs) with different characteristics and drivetrain configurations, allowing these to operate at higher efficiency. In this paper, we unite the advantages of the multi EM drive train with the HESS power split and propose a novel two HESS system, in which each HESS is in charge of one of the drivetrain configurations (front and rear system). The EV is driven by two in-wheel EM at the front wheels and a single EM assembled with a differential transmission that moves the rear wheels. In this paper, a multiobjective optimization, based on a genetic algorithm (GA), is formulated to minimize the HESS sizing and maximize the driving range of the vehicle. Also employing the fuzzy control, this strategy is responsible to split the power between the front and rear wheels systems in a more reasonable way to satisfy the demands of better performance. The complete strategy has been developed under the FTP-75 (urban), HWFET (highway) and the US06 (high speed and required acceleration) driving cycles using the MATLAB/Simulink software environment. As compared to a similar EV with a single HESS system, the proposed dual-HESS configuration was able to improve the driving range in 145.15 km also decreasing 23.93% of the HESS mass.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a compact reconfigurable on-board power converter for low voltage electric vehicle. The proposed converter serves the purpose of a battery charger as well as a 3-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) to drive the traction motor. The 3-phase VSI is the backbone of this converter that can be either reconfigured to a propulsion unit or to a battery charger by adding few more power electronics components. During charging mode, the topology is reconfigured to form a front-end boost power factor correction rectifier which is cascaded by a DC-DC converter through a DC link. The same power stage is reconfigured to operate as a 3-phase VSI to drive the traction motor during propulsion mode. Thus, it reduces the switch count by eliminating the requirement of a separate inverter stage. Simultaneously the weight, volume, and cost of the overall system are reduced. Unified control technique is implemented which is capable to achieve near-unity power factor operation of front-end boost rectifier as well as optimal battery charging without sensing the DC link voltage. This control scheme implements a single control loop for both stages by eliminating the need of two separate control loop for each stage of the charger. A 470 W scaled-down prototype is developed and its performance is validated with Constant Current-Constant Voltage charging of a 24 V, 30Ah battery pack in charging mode and with a 400W BLDC motor in propulsion mode.},

To achieve its universality and reconfigurability, we introduce a hierarchical (two-layer) control system. Namely, the high layer formulates a model predictive control (MPC) tracking problem to generate corrective Center of Gravity (C.G.) forces/moment. The lower-level controller is formulated as Control Allocation (CA) algorithm to regulate steering or torque (brake) at each wheel optimally and reconfigurable as to meet high-level calculations. Real-time constraints, i.e. actuator limits, tire capacity, and actuator failure are discussed.

Firstly, construct the SINS/USBL calibration mechanism, where the transponder&#39;s position, level-arm and misalignment angle are estimated simultaneously utilizing the slant range, inclination angles of USBL and depth information from depthometer. Second, to mitigate the decreasing calibration accuracy caused by the single filtering parameter under the complex underwater environment, an IMM-UKF algorithm is presented to support the proposed calibration mechanism.

To deal with the high-order resonant tank, the reduced-order methodology is applied throughout the paper, with which the behavior of resonant tank is investigated under multiple scales. Using the reduced-order time-domain model, the resonant waveform within switching period is accurately described with only one cycle&#39;s numerical computation. A novel parameter design principle for realizing ZVS condition and high averaged efficiency within full load range is then proposed and serves as parametric basis. Next, the low-order linear frequency-domain model is deduced using Extended Describing Function (EDF). It is found that six-order LCL-type system behaves as second-order underdamped system within frequency range of interest. Compared to existing models, the proposed reduced-order model features much more simplicity as it provides intuitive understanding into both steady and dynamic characteristic of the converter while facilitating the parameter and controller design. Through above work, the overall design consideration towards a single-stage LCL IPT system is elaborated.

We employ the stochastic geometry method to characterize the randomness of vehicles and hence radars in both two-lane and multi-lane scenarios, and derive closed-form expressions for the mean interference by approximating the radiation pattern by Gaussian waveforms. Simulation results are shown to match the analytical results very well, and insights are obtained for the impact of radar parameters on interference. Based on the interference analysis, we aim to minimize the total transmission power of each vehicle with constraints on the required signal to interference and noise ratio.

To make matters more challenging, it is assumed that the velocities (linear and angular) are unavailable. In this condition, the UUV motion model in the horizontal plane has a high relative degree, thus increasing the design complexity. In contrast to observer-based FTC schemes, we introduce a dynamic compensator, which produces an augmented error system whose dynamics is minimum phase and relative degree one. An adaptive learning observer is then introduced to address the composite uncertainties arising from actuator faults, uncertain nonlinearities, actuator saturation and disturbances. We show that the proposed scheme can ensure that the trajectory tracking errors converge to a small neighbourhood around zero.

However, the extraction of taxi hotspot is generally influenced by multiple sources of dependence, which has not been well recognized in the existing literature. This study aims to investigate how the integration of clustering models and deep learning approaches can learn and extract the network-wide taxi hotspots in both temporal and spatial dimensions. A density based spatiotemporal clustering algorithm with noise (DBSTCAN) was established to extract the historical taxi hotspots, which changed with time. A conditional generative adversarial network with long short-term memory structure (LSTM-CGAN) model was proposed for taxi hotspot prediction, which is capable of capturing the spatial and temporal variations of taxi hotspots simultaneously. Specifically, the DBSTCAN was applied to process the large-scaled geo-coded taxi pickup data into time-varying historical hotspot information. The proposed LSTM-CGAN model was then trained by the network-wide hotspot data. As illustrated in the numerical tests, it was found that the proposed LSTM-CGAN model provided comparable results with different model layouts and model with 4 LSTM layers in both generator and discriminator performed best. Moreover, four typical prediction approaches were selected to compare with the proposed LSTM-CGAN model. The comparative analyses showed that the proposed LSTM-CGAN model reduced the false positive rate from 5.20% to 0.56% and the false negative rate from 63.50% to 39.93%, and improved the section consistency from 41.78% to 73.43% and the area under the curve from 0.670 to 0.969. The comparison results indicated that the proposed LSTM-CGAN model outperformed all these benchmark methods and demonstrated great potential to enable many shared mobility applications.},

The proposed TV algorithm aims to distribute the in-wheel motor (IWM) torques to the left and right wheels assisting the vehicle in following the driver&#39;s intended trajectories. The proposed TV algorithm first included a yaw rate controller reference for neutral-steering which leads to the improvement of vehicle cornering agility. Thereafter, in-vehicle sensors and a standalone global positioning system (GPS) combined with a smooth sliding mode controller (SMC) were used based on a vehicle bicycle model to generate desired yaw moment values to track the reference. Finally, a novel torque distribution algorithm using the Daisy-chaining allocation, which is suitable for redundant actuator configuration, was utilized. Noteworthy, the Daisy-chaining allocation algorithm takes into account a torque operation area with the characteristics of IWM. In this manner, based on the vehicle bicycle model and using the CARSIM interface, the simulations, evaluation and verifications of the proposed control technique were done. Thereafter, considering a real-car based experiments with various driving scenarios, the effectiveness of the proposed TV algorithm was evaluated. It was confirmed that some evaluation factors in terms of the cornering performance were improved. The following main contributions makes the proposed TV algorithm be a meaningful solution to enhance the cornering performance of e-4WD vehicles: 1) improvement of both smoothness and convergence rate of control action, 2) a practical and intuitive way to distribute IWM torques, and 3) high applicability to mass-produced vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Satellite-based systems are the most widespread solution for outdoor localization. However, they present well-known limitations in multipath environments and non-line-of-sight satellite conditions, e.g. tunnels, underground, urban canyons, and multilevel roads, being frequently combined with dead reckoning techniques. Inertial sensors present cumulative errors, and geomagnetic-field information is often distorted by strong local magnetic fields caused by road infrastructure. We turn this magnetic weakness into strength by proposing MagLand, an approach with detection and matching steps to leverage these anomalies as signatures for localization purposes. For anomaly detection, we adopt a window-based technique and apply supervised binary classification, choosing a random forest. We select one nearest centroid algorithm with dynamic time warping to match input data streams to reference signatures, providing guidelines to define and collect them. Real data experiments with off-the-shelf devices in challenging road scenarios show MagLand&#39;s feasibility with anomaly detection accuracy of 91% and matching with lane distinction of up to 93%. Magnetic landmarks can be extremely useful to address limitations of current localization systems and improve their performance, e.g. by providing an alternative in GPS limited areas, anchors for integrity monitoring, or resetting dead reckoning cumulative errors.},

  abstract     = {The optimization of train trajectory and timetable offers two effective methods of energy-efficient operations. Most traditional research optimizes them separately and thus the global optimality cannot be achieved. Previous work has mainly concentrated on minimizing the mechanical energy consumption of trains, not the electrical energy. This paper aims to develop an integrated model to optimize the integrated timetable, which includes both the timetable and the train trajectory achieve the minimum electrical energy consumption. The AC power supply system model is first proposed to calculate the parameters of the AC power supply network. Then, a model is developed to calculate various energy consumptions using power flow calculation. Furthermore, an integrated timetable optimization model for minimum total energy consumption of AC railway system is proposed and the optimal integrated timetable is obtained by the proposed hybrid GA-PSO algorithm. Finally, 5 real-world case studies based on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang high-speed railway are presented. The results show that the proposed integrated model can achieve a reduction in total energy consumption for the entire line up to 14.3% compared with the previous optimization model. The hybrid GA-PSO algorithm achieves the best results compared with the results achieved by the GA and PSO algorithms applied along.},

  abstract     = {On the way to fully automated driving, Level 3 automated driving systems (ADS) seem to be a more realistic choice in the short term. Within operational design domain (ODD), although the driver is not required to monitor the vehicle all the time, it is expected that the driver is ready to intervene in the ADS whenever certain risks are encountered. Hence, timely identification of driver intervention in the vehicle lays the foundation for safe switching from the ADS to the driver. Although many researches have been conducted on driver torque estimation in the last decade, most of them are based on electric power steering (EPS) systems, therefore are not quite suitable for application in steer-by-wire (SBW) systems, which shall be the next generation&#39;s steering systems. In view of this, the SBW system parameters with uncertainties are first identified through experiments. Then, a PID controller and a robust observer considering Coulomb friction are designed and analyzed for the SBW systems, so that the system is asymptotically stable and the driver torque can be identified irrespective of parameter uncertainties and system noises. Detailed experimental results on a hardware-in-the-loop test bench verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which shall also be implementable in a real vehicle.},

Vehicle logo detection (VLD) technology can effectively extract vehicle information. Due to the complex traffic environment, existing methods have difficulty to accurately detect the vehicle logo, especially when the vehicle logo has motion blur. To alleviate these problems, a new approach is proposed to detect vehicle logo under motion blur with the combination of Filter-DeblurGAN and VL-YOLO. Filter-DeblurGAN possesses a judgment mechanism, which can determine whether the image needs to be deblurred based on the degree of blur of each image. It can also deblur images with arbitrary resolution. Filter-DeblurGAN solves the defect that DeblurGAN lacks the judgment mechanism and is too harsh on resolution. It can be directly applied to the deblurring process of VLD. We also propose a method using VL-YOLO and Eliminate Outliers Cluster (EOC) algorithm to further improve the detection accuracy. VL-YOLO achieves accurate detection of the vehicle logo by constructing a deeper multi-scale detection network and using the initial candidate boxes provided by EOC algorithm. The EOC algorithm is not affected by outliers. In order to further promote the research of VLD, we have labeled a new vehicle logo dataset named LOGO-17, which contains 17 different categories of vehicle logos. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good detection accuracy in the environment of motion blur, and outperforms existing methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an active fault diagnosis (AFD) method with reduced excitation for detection and identification of sensor faults of vehicles in a platoon formation. By introducing a probing signal into the platooning, it will allow an active excitation of the system, reveling a residual component, with the same frequency, that can be explored to obtain a fault identification of specific system faults. A supervisor is introduced to monitor the platoon behavior and activate the auxiliary input whenever the system natural excitation is insufficient for a clear fault diagnosis. This solution will allow the fault diagnosis to behave as active or passive through the adaptive signal provided by the supervisor. A dual Youla-Jabr-Bongiorno-Kucera (YJBK) matrix transfer function, also known as fault signature matrix (FSM) is investigated to get a fault diagnosis. In order to obtain an online identification of specific faults in the system, a Taylor approximation of the FSM is pursued. Computational simulations with a high-fidelity full-vehicle model, provided by CarSim, are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active approach. A direct comparison between an active and a passive behavior in the same scenario shows that the active fault diagnosis method outperforms the passive approach whenever the dynamic behavior does not provide sufficient excitation. Furthermore, the excitation supervisor is able to significantly reduce the amount of artificial excitation introduced into the system ensuring a more energy efficient active fault diagnosis.},

Considering the demand of cloud radio access network (C-RAN) in 5G system, the low-latency software polar decoder is studied in this paper. Two novel algorithms are proposed to reduce the latency of the successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding, including the segmented list-pruning (SLP) algorithm and the modified distributed sorting (MDS) algorithm.

Secondly, for each link, we investigate the large-scale fading effect on V2I channels, including the path loss exponent and shadowing components. Subsequently, we validate the empirical path loss model using extensive measurements and two classical channel models. The results show a good fit with a near-zero mean and tolerable standard deviation of the estimation error. Finally, we analyze the small-scale fading effects, including fading depth and distance-dependent Ricean K -Factor, which are very important for accurately predicting the required fading margin and link budget. Through the analysis and simulations, this work provides a reference of the V2I channel characteristics for the test, design, and performance analysis of V2I communication systems.},

An analytical model is first derived to analyze the average uplink local delay of a vehicle on a highway for sending a packet to an edge node along the highway. In deriving the model, the spatial distributions of vehicles and edge nodes are modeled as an independent one-dimensional (1-D) homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). The edge node for accommodating the service request of a vehicle node is determined based on a nearest-receiver model. Moreover, a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) mechanism is considered for channel access in the derived local delay model. The derived analytical model is validated through simulation results and the impacts of major parameters on the average uplink local delay are investigated. The derived model can be used to provide a basis for parameter settings in the deployment of edge nodes.},

  abstract     = {Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) has emerged as an alternative deployment for conventional cellular massive MIMO networks. As revealed by its name, this topology considers no cells, while a large number of multi-antenna access points (APs) serves simultaneously a smaller number of users over the same time/frequency resources through time-division duplex (TDD) operation. Prior works relied on the strong assumption (quite idealized) that the APs are uniformly distributed, and actually, this randomness was considered during the simulation and not in the analysis. However, in practice, ongoing and future networks become denser and increasingly irregular. Having this in mind, we consider that the AP locations are modeled by means of a Poisson point process (PPP) which is a more realistic model for the spatial randomness than a grid or uniform deployment. In particular, by virtue of stochastic geometry tools, we derive both the downlink coverage probability and achievable rate. Notably, this is the only work providing the coverage probability and shedding light on this aspect of CF massive MIMO systems. Focusing on the extraction of interesting insights, we consider small-cells (SCs) as a benchmark for comparison. Among the findings, CF massive MIMO systems achieve both higher coverage and rate with comparison to SCs due to the properties of favorable propagation, channel hardening, and interference suppression. Especially, we showed for both architectures that increasing the AP density results in a higher coverage which saturates after a certain value and increasing the number of users decreases the achievable rate but CF massive MIMO systems take advantage of the aforementioned properties, and thus, outperform SCs. In general, the performance gap between CF massive MIMO systems and SCs is enhanced by increasing the AP density. Another interesting observation concerns that a higher path-loss exponent decreases the rate while the users closer to the APs affect more the performance in terms of the rate.},

In the past few years, multimedia services have seen an enormous growth and it is expected to increase as more devices will utilize infotainment services in the future i.e. vehicular devices. Therefore, it is important to focus on user centric measures i.e. quality-of-experience (QoE) such as video quality (resolution) and fluctuations therein. In this paper, a novel joint video quality selection and resource allocation technique is proposed for increasing the QoE of vehicular devices. The proposed approach exploits the queuing dynamics and channel states of vehicular devices, to maximize the QoE while ensuring seamless video playback at the end users with high probability. The network wide QoE maximization problem is decoupled into two subparts. First, a network slicing based clustering algorithm is applied to partition the vehicles into multiple logical networks. Secondly, vehicle scheduling and quality selection is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem which is solved using the Lyapunov drift plus penalty method. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm ensures high video quality experience compared to the baseline. Simulation results also show that the proposed technique achieves low latency and high-reliability communication.},

The dynamic topology structure induced by mobility can be modeled as a dynamic graph in which the existence of an edge (interference relationship) between two vertices (multicast clusters) is dynamically changing. As such, the channel selection problem can be transformed into a dynamic graph coloring problem in which the graph structure evolves in continuous time slots and the previous coloring strategy becomes valid.

To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we first design an iterative algorithm based on a typical optimization technique, and then, propose a learning algorithm based on a neural network with a proper loss function. Simulation results show that the proposed learning algorithm can achieve a near-optimal energy efficiency with reducing the computational complexity, compared to an iterative algorithm with a suboptimal performance.},

Then we apply it online to recover the real-time transmitted data symbols. Numerical results demonstrate that the deep-learning based receiver can efficiently learn such joint effect in the presence of MUI and ISI, leading to much better bit error rate (BER) performance than conventional correlation receiver and other existing receivers.},

Recently, deep learning (DL) based AMC methods have been proposed with outstanding performances. However, both high computing cost and large model sizes are the biggest hinders for deployment of the conventional DL based methods, particularly in the application of internet-of-things (IoT) networks and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided systems. In this correspondence, a novel DL based lightweight AMC (LightAMC) method is proposed with smaller model sizes and faster computational speed. We first introduce a scaling factor for each neuron in convolutional neural network (CNN) and enforce scaling factors sparsity via compressive sensing. It can give an assist to screen out redundant neurons and then these neurons are pruned. Experimental results show that the proposed LightAMC method can effectively reduce model sizes and accelerate computation with the slight performance loss.},

In this paper, we study cache-enabled ultra-dense networks with the wireless fronthaul, in which edge nodes (ENs) have the capability of caching and signal processing. Under such a setup, by exploiting the feature that users requesting the same content form a multicast group and can be served by a cluster of ENs, we first formulate a problem to optimize the cloud and edge multicast beamforming design for maximizing the minimum rate among the user groups. Due to the coupling of transmit and receive beamforming and the non-convex constraints of delivery rate, the formulated problem is difficult to be directly solved. To this end, we propose to use the weighted sum mean-square error minimization approaches and certain transformation techniques to convert the original problem into a convex one. An optimal solution is then obtained by using bisection search and second order cone (SOC) transformation. The results indicate that the performance of the proposed precoding scheme with wireless frothauling will close to that of the wired fronthauling.},

Due to the stochastic nature of the problem, we exploit the classic drift-plus-penalty function and subsequently simplify the problem into a difference of convex functions.

Meanwhile, the signal for the first user is also decoded at the second user from the superimposed signal due to its high transmit power. In the second time slot, the relay forwards the signal to the second user while the BS retransmits the signal for the first user as interference to disrupt the eavesdropping. Due to the fact that the second user has obtained the signal for the first user in the first slot, the interference can be eliminated at the second user. To measure the performance of the proposed cooperative NOMA scheme, the outage probability for the first user and the secrecy outage probability for the second user are analyzed.

In previous researches (Lin et al., 2013), it was proved that the generalized AN scheme which allows some portion of AN signal to be injected to the legitimate receiver&#39;s channel is the optimal precoding scheme for MISO wiretap channels. However, the optimality is valid only under some ideal assumptions such as perfect channel estimation and spatially uncorrelated channels. To break through this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based secure precoding scheme, called the deep AN scheme. To the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, the deep AN scheme is the first secure precoding scheme which exploits a DNN to jointly design and optimize the precoders for the information signal and the AN signal. From the numerical experiments, it is demonstrated that the proposed deep AN scheme outperforms the generalized AN scheme under various practical wireless environments.},

Under such conditions, the power domain multiplexing in NOMA is expected to render the system particularly sensitive to this additional impulsive noise. Therefore, in this article, we quantify the effects of impulsive noise on the outage performance of uplink NOMA systems. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations as well as offered analytical results demonstrate the vulnerability of the involved NOMA users to this type of noise.

The unreachable space increases the complexity of the antenna deployment. To find the best antenna position and orientation (PO) of the relay achieving the higher data rate, this paper formulates the optimization problem of the relay MI antenna PO with tunnel constraints. To solve the problem more quickly, we propose to use geometric modeling to eliminate the tunnel constraints and develop a random-search algorithm achieving a fast convergence and excellent global search ability.

In this case, reflection and diffraction from ground objects are critical to maintain links, and hence accurate propagation models for this must be considered.

The study is based on measurements made at frequencies of 1, 4, 12, and 24 GHz with a UAV flying in a suburban environment. Measurements have been used to model NLOS propagation below 4 GHz, where the dominant mechanism is diffraction, and above 4 GHz where multipath is the dominant propagation mechanism.

Given the service requirements of users, we aim to maximize UAV energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, the user transmit power, and computation load allocation. The resulting optimization problem corresponds to nonconvex fractional programming, and the Dinkelbach algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique are adopted to solve it. Furthermore, we decompose the problem into multiple subproblems for distributed and parallel problem solving. To cope with the case when the knowledge of user mobility is limited, we adopt a spatial distribution estimation technique to predict the location of ground users so that the proposed approach can still be applied.

  abstract     = {In this work, we use the acoustic ray model to study passive source localization problems using a single hydrophone for shallow water waveguides. It has been found that conventional matched field processing, which requires a multi-hydrophone array, is no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce matched feature localization to achieve passive source localization using a single hydrophone. The eigenray that contains the arrival structure is the core of the acoustic ray model; however, it is difficult to estimate the relative arrival delay of the eigenray for passive localization, especially in shallow water. Therefore, we propose a novel peak extraction passive source localization method based on the autocorrelation function, which does not require estimation of the relative arrival delay of the eigenray. According to a computer simulation, the proposed method can achieve good performance using only one hydrophone. Further, its performance is validated using wideband data collected on a vertical line array during the Shallow Water 2006 experiment.},

This situation can arise in 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) when the number of reported cells of the mobile station is reduced to a minimum in order to minimize the signaling costs and to support a large number of devices. The studied problem corresponds geometrically to computing the intersection of a circle with a hyperbola, both with measurement uncertainty, which generally has two equally likely solutions. We derive an analytical representation of these two solutions that fits a filter bank framework that can keep track of different hypothesis until potential ambiguities have been resolved. Further, a performance bound for the filter bank is derived. The proposed filter bank is first evaluated in a simulated scenario, where the set of serving and neighbor base stations is changing in a challenging way. The filter bank is then evaluated on real data from a field test, where the result shows a precision better than 40 m 95% of the time.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is considered as a novel paradigm to enhance the safety of automated vehicles and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The computation offloading strategies are the key point of VEC, and the effect of time-varying channels cannot be ignored during the task transmission period. This paper investigates the utility maximization problem with task delay requirement constraints, in which the influence of time-varying channel on the task offloading strategies during the task offloading period is considered. The time-varying fading channel leads to the time-varying spectrum efficiency (SE), so the previous offloading strategies are questionable when the additional uncertain allocated bandwidth is taken into account. To deal with it, we first propose a linearization based Branch and Bound (LBB) algorithm to solve the fixed SE problem without considering the time-varying channel characteristics. Considering the complexity of the LBB algorithm, a closest rounding integer (CRI) algorithm is proposed to solve the fixed SE problem. Then, based on the resource allocation strategies of the fixed SE problem, we propose the LBB based computation offloading (LBBCO) algorithm and the CRI based computation offloading (CRICO) algorithm to solve the original problem for both the static tasks and dynamic tasks. The proposed LBBCO/CRICO algorithms are also applicable to multi-vehicle and multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of small-scale fading on the proposed offloading strategies. The simulation results show that the average utilities of LBBCO and CRICO algorithms have a small gap by 3.93% and 6.13% only to the upper bound, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed LBBCO and CRICO algorithms can outperform the previous state-of-the-art solution by 4.52% and 2.38%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Load imbalance among small and macro cells is a major challenge that undermines the gains of emerging ultradense heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Existing load balancing (LB) schemes have one common caveat which is operating in reactive mode i.e., cell parameters are tweaked reactively in accordance with the dynamics of cell loads. The inherent reactiveness of these LB schemes hinder in achieving promising quality of experience (QoE) gains from 5G and beyond. To cope with this issue, in this paper we propose a novel proactive load balancing framework “OPERA” empowered by mobility prediction paradigm for future ultra dense networks (UDNs). The pro-activeness of OPERA stems from its novel capability that instead of passively waiting for congestion indicators to be observed and then reacting to them, OPERA predicts future cell loads and then proactively optimizes key antenna parameters and cell individual offsets (CIOs) to preempt congestion before it happens. OPERA also incorporates capacity and coverage constraints and load aware association strategy for ensuring conflict free operation of LB and coverage and capacity optimization (CCO) self-organizing network (SON) functions. Simulation results show that compared to real network deployments settings and published state-of-the-art reactive schemes, OPERA can yield significant gain in terms of fairness in load distribution and percentage of satisfied users. Superior performance of OPERA on several fronts compared to current schemes stems from its following features: 1) It preempts congestion instead of reacting to it; 2) it actuates more parameters than any current LB schemes thereby increasing system level capacity instead of just shifting it among cells; 3) while performing LB OPERA simultaneously maximizes residual capacity while incorporating throughput and coverage constraints; 4) it incorporates a load aware association strategy for ensuring conflict free operation of LB and CCO SON functions; 5) the ahead of time estimation of cell loads allows ample time for heuristics search algorithms to find LB solutions with high gain.},

  abstract     = {Mobile video traffic has experienced exponential growth in recent years due to increasing prevalence of mobile devices and continuous advancement of wireless communications. However, network fluctuations often occur when transmitting video data, which greatly impact the quality of experience (QoE) of mobile users. Buffering technique has been widely adopted to mitigate the effect of network fluctuations on QoE for mobile users by prefetching certain video data to mobile devices in advance. However, mobile users often abort video watching before the videos are fully watched and such early departure behavior can result in considerable wastage of buffered video data. In this paper, we study buffer-aware resource allocation for multiuser mobile video streaming system by jointly considering video users early departure behavior and wireless channel fluctuation property. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem in which the objective is to reduce both the amount of wasted buffered data and the video re-buffering time. The problem is then transformed into a series of deterministic per-slot problems by using Lyapunov optimization theory. We propose an online buffer-aware resource allocation algorithm to solve the per-slot optimization problems. After proving the convexity of the per-slot optimization problem, we further design a fast-convergent iterative algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to perform each of the per-slot resource allocations. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has very low running time, near optimal performance, and is able to achieve a good trade-off between QoE improvement and data wastage reduction.},

In this paper, we investigate the problem of offloading decision and resource allocation among multiple users served by one base station to achieve the optimal system-wide user utility, which is defined as a trade-off between task latency and energy consumption. Mobility in the process of task offloading is considered in the optimization. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and propose a heuristic mobility-aware offloading algorithm (HMAOA) to obtain the approximate optimal offloading scheme. The original global optimization problem is converted into multiple local optimization problems. Each local optimization problem is then decomposed into two subproblems: a convex computation allocation subproblem and a non-linear integer programming (NLIP) offloading decision subproblem. The convex subproblem is solved with a numerical method to obtain the optimal computation allocation among multiple offloading users, and a partial order based heuristic approach is designed for the NLIP subproblem to determine the approximate optimal offloading decision. The proposed HMAOA is with polynomial complexity. Extensive simulation experiments and comprehensive comparison with six baseline algorithms demonstrate its excellent performance.},

To extend battery life of all devices, this paper develops a Channel-Dependent Charge (CDC) scheduling algorithm to control receivers&#39; charging power, order and duration. Each receiver is assigned a dynamic scheduling coefficient, which is the product of the battery&#39;s remaining energy and the energy transmission channel. The resultant optimal charging order is to charge the receiver with the minimum scheduling coefficient first per equal unit-length time slot. It is shown analytically and experimentally that the CDC algorithm achieves higher charging performance than other scheduling algorithms including the Round-Robin Charge (RRC) scheduling algorithms.

For a multi-user network in which its users periodically compute their tasks with the help of an edge cloud, we investigate the network lifetime maximization problem based on present user task information. We pursue this objective via a minimum energy efficiency maximization (MEEM) strategy that jointly optimizes the fraction of user task computations offloaded to the cloud and the respective allocation of edge computing and network communication resources across the users. We also investigate the network lifetime maximization problem for the case when the user task information is available for all future time slots, as well. This setting represents an upper bound for the MEEM strategy. Optimal solutions for both investigated strategies are formulated via feasibility testing and geometric programming. We show that MEEM can achieve a 70% lifetime improvement over the state-of-the-art and 460% lifetime improvement over the case of local user task computation only. We also show that for a high value of the maximum tolerable delay for completing the computation tasks of the users, MEEM achieves the globally optimal network lifetime performance. Finally, we show that MEEM achieves a significant reduction (3X) in variation of enabled network lifetime over diverse network topologies, relative to the state-of-the-art.},

However, frequent real-time information update caused by vehicles high mobility is liable to aggravate the delay. Meanwhile, the task migration between different vehicular edge computing (VEC) servers results in an amount of delay if the computing cannot be completed before the vehicle moves out of the coverage of the current VEC server. In this paper, the problem is concluded as when and to whom to offload the task for VEC, which is formulated as a finite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) to minimize the delay with respect to the communication, computing, handover and migration. Through characterizing the time-space correlation of vehicles mobility, the curse of dimensionality problem in MDP is resolved. Meanwhile, a general expression of the transition probabilities is derived. On this basis, the specific results of highway, 2-D street and real-data scenarios are provided as well. For practical implementation considerations, the transition probabilities are commonly uncertain primarily due to random driver behavior, inaccurate sample data and complex path environment. Under this uncertain environment,a robust time-aware MDP-based task offloading algorithm (RTMDP) is proposed, which has been proved to perform well even under the high uncertain transition probabilities by simulation results.},

As one of the promising technologies, mobile edge computing (MEC) technology can be deployed on UAVs to support computation-intensive and latency-critical applications. Therefore, a joint communication and computation optimization model is established for a MEC enabled UAV network, which includes a centralized MEC enabled top-UAV and a swarm of distributed bottom-UAVs. Using stochastic geometry, the successful transmission probability results for a single link and a group of links are derived based on the three-dimensional distribution of UAV swarm. Moreover, the optimal response delay is theoretically achieved with the closed-form solutions by using stochastic geometry and queueing theory. In contrast to the conventional UAVs without MEC capabilities, the optimal response delay is achieved by using our proposed joint communication and computation optimization algorithm in the MEC enabled UAV swarm scenario. The performances of the proposed algorithm are evaluated based on the results from the simulation system and the hardware testbed.},

To this end, this paper proposes a security-aware content delivery scheme in vehicular networks when the vehicles request contents from roadside units (RSUs). Specifically, we first establish a novel trust evaluation scheme for both the vehicles and RSUs by exploiting other vehicles to monitor the actions during the process of content delivery. Then, a bargaining game based pricing model is proposed to motivate the vehicles and RSUs to act more positively in the content delivery in vehicular networks. Next, to achieve the secure content delivery and optimize the players&#39; utilities, we apply the backward induction method to analyze the proposed model in a two-round game and an M-round game, respectively.

  abstract     = {As data traffic in terrestrial-satellite systems surges, the integration of power allocation for caching, computing, and communication (3C) has attracted much research attention. However, previous works on 3C power allocation in terrestrial-satellite systems mostly focus on maximizing the overall system throughput. In this paper, we aim to guarantee both throughput fairness and data security in terrestrial-satellite systems. Specifically, we first divide the system implementation into three steps, i.e., data accumulation, blockchain computing, and wireless transmission. Then, we model and analyze the delay and power consumption in each step by proposing several theorems and lemmas regarding 3C power allocation. Based on the theorems and lemmas, we further formulate the problem of 3C power allocation as a Nash bargaining game and construct an optimization model for the game. Last, we solve the optimization problem using dual decomposition and obtain the optimal period of the satellite serving the ground stations as well as the optimal 3C power allocation solution. The optimal solution can provide guidelines for parameter configuration in terrestrial-satellite systems. The performance of the proposed terrestrial-satellite architecture is verified by extensive simulations.},

Furthermore, taking the pulse shaping filter for the data signal into account, the power of the adjacent channel interference (ACI) to the primary users (PUs) caused by the spectral regrowth of the relay output signal is analytically calculated. Moreover, two compensation techniques are proposed which are implemented at the destination receiver to deal with the in-band nonlinear interference. The first technique is based on the calculation of the distorted signal constellation to enhance the performance of the demodulator. The second technique is feedforward compensation at the receiver. The bit error rate (BER) expressions for both techniques are presented. The ACI resulting from the spectral regrowth due to the relay NLPA is investigated by the simulation and numerical studies, and then, the BER performance degradation at the destination node and the performance improvement resulting from the proposed compensation methods are evaluated. Since the ACI confines the transmit power due to the interference power constraint of the PU, the achievable BER of the secondary user (SU) is studied. The simulation results show that the feedforward compensation technique has better BER performance than the modified constellation based approach.},

  abstract     = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a key enabler for low-latency services in the cellular network. It enables service requests to be served at the edge without reaching the Internet. However, this service model allows data traffic to bypass conventional security functions deployed at the core network, and may pose security threats. To examine its security impact, we analyze current security functions that span authentication, authorization, accounting (AAA), and access control, and then identify two major issues. First, conventional user authentication methods prevent MEC applications from achieving low-latency service offering. Second, current cellular authorization, accounting, and access control mechanisms hardly secure MEC traffic. We thus propose a transparent security design called MECsec to secure the MEC with low latency in the cellular network. It contains three main components: cellular-based OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, bitmap-based authorization/accounting, and two-tier hash-based access control. Especially, its transparent design does not need any changes on current cellular operations, and is standard-compliant. We implement and evaluate the MECsec prototype on an MEC-integrated LTE network architecture developed based on the OpenAirInterface (OAI) cellular platform. Our results show that the cellular-based OIDC can reduce delays of current authentication methods by up to 88.3%, and the other components can successfully defend against possible threats with negligible overhead.},

In this paper, an interference aware data transmission protocol based on cellular clustering architecture is proposed. The protocol involves two steps. The first one is an inter-cell time division multiple access (TDMA) scheduling, which reduces acoustic interference by restricting simultaneous data transmission via adjacent routing paths; and the second one is an intra-cell hierarchical routing, which targets efficient data collection in the submarine and reliable data transmission from the seabed to the surface. Moreover, a novel Ekman spiral-based low-cost location prediction method and a void hole recovery scheme are adopted in each step to support the practicability of proposed protocol. Theoretical analysis and simulations indicate that the proposed protocol has advantages related to the quality of service (QoS) of UASNs because the signal interference is significantly mitigated.},

  abstract     = {To support the rising number of user equipments (UEs), LTE-A allows some UEs directly talking with each other to facilitate spectrum reuse, which is known as device-to-device (D2D) communication. Since D2D UEs (DUEs) consume resources and bring out interference, how to allocate resources and power is important. Existing studies seek to make more DUEs reuse resources of cellular UEs (CUEs, which are the UEs talking with the eNB) to increase throughput. However, it is inefficient for some CUEs (e.g., those near cell edge) to share resources with others due to high interference. Thus, a new sharing paradigm, called the pure D2D model, is proposed to allow DUEs sharing resources without involving CUEs for flexibility. This new model is helpful to IoT (Internet of Things) applications, where the overwhelming majority of devices are usually DUEs. The paper defines an optimization problem to maximize links supported in the network, and proposes a D2D resource allocation and power control (DRAPC) framework. By vertex coloring, DRAPC gives a preliminary grouping of UEs for resource allocation. Then, each group is carefully reformed by exchanging members and adding new ones, so as to increase signal quality and degree of resource sharing. Simulation results show that DRAPC not only improves network performance but also guarantees fairness among links.},

  abstract     = {Although mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has become a new paradigm of collecting, analyzing, and exploiting massive amounts of sensory data, how to effectively incentivize users’ active participation and high quality data contribution in MCS has become a critical issue. Existing offline incentive mechanisms are inefficient to be applied to the online scenario, where a large number of heterogeneous users arrive and leave dynamically in a random manner, meanwhile the MCS platform has to make an irrevocable immediate decision on whether to accept or reject users’ requests, and how much a user should be paid under a strict budget constraint without knowing future information. Although there are a few online incentive mechanisms, these efforts tend to focus on achieving some desirable properties without addressing the issues of online incentive as a whole, and are not effective to motivate users’ active participation and high-quality sensory data contribution simultaneously. In this paper, we integrate the quality of sensing, rating update, user selection, and payment determination to develop the first online rating protocol for practical MCS to deal with adverse selection and moral hazard simultaneously. First, we design an endogenous learning approach to quantify the users’ ratings based on their historical contributions. Second, we exploit an incremental learning approach to compute the density threshold based on users’ historical information. Third, we theoretically prove that our online rating protocol achieves the desirable properties of computationally efficiency , budgetary feasibility , individual rationality , truthfulness , constant competitiveness , rating coverage , and incentive effectiveness . Finally, extensive evaluation results support the performance of our protocol and validate the theoretical properties derived in this paper.},

The algorithm is divided into two stages: mobile prediction and node location. In the node location phase, a TOA (time of arrival)-based ranging strategy is first proposed to reduce communication overhead and energy consumption. Then, after dimension reduction processing, the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is used to find the optimal location of the secondary nodes with low location accuracy. Finally, the node location is obtained and the node movement prediction stage is entered. In coastal areas, the tidal phenomenon is the main factor leading to node movement; thus, a more practical node movement model is constructed by combining the tidal model with node stress. Therefore, in the movement prediction stage, the velocity and position of each time point in the prediction window are predicted according to the node movement model, and underwater location is then completed. Finally, the proposed MPL algorithm is simulated and analyzed; the simulation results show that the proposed MPL algorithm has higher localization performance compared with the LSLS, SLMP, and GA-SLMP algorithms. Additionally, the proposed MPL algorithm not only effectively reduces the network communication overhead and energy consumption, but also improves the network location coverage and node location accuracy.},

To realize this, accurate road map data must be downloaded in real time to these intelligent vehicles for navigation and localization purposes. Besides, the cloud must be updated with dynamic changes that happened in the road network. These involve the transmissions of high-definition 3D road map data for accurately representing the physical environments. In this work, we propose solutions under the fog computing architecture in a heterogeneous vehicular network to optimize data exchange among intelligent vehicles, the roadside infrastructure, as well as regional databases. Specifically, the efficiency of 3D road map data dissemination at roadside fog nodes is achieved by exploiting index coding techniques to reduce the overall data load, while opportunistic scheduling of heterogeneous transmissions can be done to judiciously manage network resources and minimize operating cost. In addition, 3D point cloud coding and hashing techniques are applied to expedite the updates of various dynamic changes in the network. We empirically evaluate the proposed solutions based on real-world mobility traces of vehicles and 3D LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data of city streets. The proposed system is also implemented in a multi-robotic testbed for practical evaluation.},

Firstly, nodes are assigned into groups according to their remaining lifetime, which ensures that only the ones with lower residual energy are recharged in each time slot. Then, to balance energy consumption among multiple MWCs, the moving distance as well as the power cost of the MWC are taken as constraints to get the optimal trajectory allocation scheme. Moreover, by further adjusting the amount of energy being replenished to some sensor nodes, it ensures that the MWC have enough energy to fulfill the recharging task and return back to the base station. Experiment results show that, compared with the Periodic recharging strategy and the Cluster based Multiple Charges Coordination algorithm (C-MCC), the proposed method can improve the recharging efficiency of MWCs by about 48.22% and 43.35%, and the average waiting time of nodes is also reduced by about 55.72% and 30.7%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Both Device-to-device (D2D) and full-duplex (FD) have been widely recognized as spectral efficient techniques in the fifth-generation wireless communications systems. By enabling FD mode in D2D communications, the attainable spectrum efficiency can be (in theory) up to twice as high as that of conventional half-duplex (HD) mode D2D technology, provided that the self-interference signal in the former can be sufficiently suppressed. Considering the fact that FD technology does not always outperform the HD technology in arbitrary channel condition, we will delve into the FD gain as well as its preconditions for acquisition in this paper. In particular, the performance of D2D-aided underlaying cellular networks is investigated by assuming that the D2D users are capable of operating at both HD and FD modes. Under a given user workload, the sum throughput in each DU is shown to be always improved by activating D2D links despite an extra DU-induced interference could be imposed on its co-spectrum cellular users. Numerical results show that the FD-D2D mode exhibits its superiority in terms of sum throughput than the HD-D2D mode in a light-workload scenario even if a non-ideal SI cancellation has been implemented in the former, but the latter pulls back a game in a heavy-workload scenario. Furthermore, to maximize the sum throughput, an appropriate mode-selection scheme (i.e., by choosing either FD or HD mode in the current time-slot for each individual D2D user) should be implemented for sufficiently exploiting the FD gain according to the instantaneous radio frequency environment.},

We assume that each base station (BS) can only obtain statistical channel state information (CSI), so as to reduce the CSI required at each BS. We propose a fractional-frequency-reuse(FFR) scheme for multi-cell FD-MIMO systems, in which all the cell-center users occupy the same frequency band, while all the cell-edge users use the rest of the frequency band. Based on this FFR scheme, two joint three-dimensional (3D) beamforming interference coordination strategies, i.e., the full-cooperative strategy, and a more energy-efficient partial-cooperative strategy, are proposed to alleviate the inter-cell interference for the cell-edge users. Moreover, tractable approximations of the ergodic rate for both cell-center and cell-edge users are derived. Simulations show that the proposed interference coordination strategies can significantly improve the cell-edge performance, while maintain relatively high total throughput.

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising paradigm to connect massive number of devices in future wireless communications while satisfying various quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we consider a QoS-constrained IoT system operating with finite blocklength (FBL) codes to support low latency communications. Two data arrival models are considered, namely, constant-rate arrival and ON-OFF discrete-time Markov arrival. The throughput performance is studied for both arrival models under statistical queuing constraints and deadline limits. For the scenario with instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we derive the QoS-constrained throughput expressions for both arrival models. Subsequently, an instantaneous-CSI-driven optimal power control algorithm is proposed to maximize the throughput, while guaranteeing a certain reliability target. In addition, we consider a scenario with only average CSI being available at the transmitter and propose to apply hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) schemes to improve the FBL performance. The decoding error probability and the outage probability are first characterized, following which the distribution of transmission period is derived. Furthermore, the throughput expressions are provided for both types of arrivals. Via numerical analysis, the impact of error probability, fixed transmission rate, coding blocklength, and QoS constraints on the throughput is studied.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a novel interleave-division multiple access (IDMA) system based on cyclic shift keying (CSK) modulation, named CSK-IDMA, for multiuser underwater acoustic (UWA) communications. The CSK modulation uses a circular cyclic shift of the spreading sequence to represent the information, which can be viewed as a special M-ary spread spectrum modulation. Compared with conventional direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technique, CSK overcomes the spreading gain versus data rate limitations. The proposed scheme adopts the IDMA technique to reduce the cochannel interference. At the receiver, we employ passive time reversal (PTR) technique to compress the channels and improve the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) at first. In order to perfectly incorporate with the IDMA receive structure, we propose a soft CSK demodulation which can iteratively exchange extrinsic information with a soft channel decoder to form a turbo equalization. Simulation results show the proposed CSK-IDMA scheme can offer significantly improved performance. The data processing results from a lake experiment show that the proposed scheme can support 8 users and 10 users with zero error bits for 2.3 km transmission and 2.7 km transmission, respectively. The corresponding bit error rate (BER) for 16 users are 8.4 × 10 -4 and 9.7 × 10 -4 , respectively. The data rate is 62.5 bit/s per user within 4 kHz bandwidth and spreading sequences of 256 chips. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which can support more than 8 users for multiuser UWA communications with a high bandwidth efficiency.},

By applying transfer learning to save the learning time and applies deep learning to further improve the authentication performance, this scheme enables mobile devices in VANETs to optimize their authentication modes and parameters without being aware of the VANET channel model, the packet generation model, and the spoofing model. We provide the convergence bound such as the mobile device utility, evaluate the computational complexity of the physical authentication scheme, and verify the analysis results via simulations.

In this paper, we consider a massive MIMO system where the number of available orthogonal pilot sequences is less than the number of users. In order to optimize the long-term performance in estimating the uplink (UL) channels, the base station (BS) needs to judiciously decide the allocation of the available pilot sequences to different users in each training phase. In this paper, the pilot allocation problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process with an exploitation-exploration tradeoff under the Gauss-Markov fading channels. We then investigate this problem within the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) framework and put forward a low-complexity method to derive the Whittle&#39;s index approximately. A simple index policy is then proposed to allocate the orthogonal pilots in a massive MIMO system. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed index policy.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based heterogeneous cellular network consisting of a macro cell and a small cell, where a macro-cell base station (MBS) and a small-cell base station (SBS) communicate with respective macro-cell user (MU) and small-cell user (SU) with the existence of a common eavesdropper across different OFDM subcarriers. In order to make full use of the mutual interference between MBS and SBS against eavesdropping, an artificially designed signal is emitted at MBS to cancel out the interference received at MU as well as to interfere with the common eavesdropper at each subcarriers. For the purpose of further improving the secrecy performance, a sum secrecy rate (SSR) of OFDM-based heterogeneous cellular networks is maximized by optimizing the power allocation between MBS and SBS across different OFDM subcarriers when the eavesdropper owns the global instantaneous channel state information (ICSI), thus called ICSI based SSR maximization (ICSI-SSRM). As for the case when the ICSI of wiretap channels is unknown, we propose a statistical CSI based SSR maximization (SCSI-SSRM) scheme, where the statistical characteristics of channels from MBS and SBS to eavesdropper are employed to optimally allocate powers of MBS and SBS across different subcarriers under the constraint of MBS&#39;s total transmit power. The formulated ICSI-SSRM and SCSI-SSRM problems are all non-convex due to form of the difference between two-convex (D.C.) functions. Thus, we utilize the D.C. approximation approach to respectively convert original optimization problems into convex problems. Moreover, iterative optimal power allocation algorithms for ICSI-SSRM and SCSI-SSRM schemes are also presented to obtain their respective SSR values. Simulation results illustrate that the ICSI-SSRM and SCSI-SSRM algorithms can converge to their optimal values, which confirms the correctness and validation of the proposed algorithms. In addition, numerical results are also given to show that the ICSI-SSRM and SCSI-SSRM schemes outperform conventional power allocation methods in terms of their SSR performance.},

In order to solve the proposed nonconvex optimization problem, we provide an efficient method using semidefinite relaxation. Moreover, for the first time, we characterize the optimal beamforming in a closed form with quasi-degradation condition, which is proven to achieve the same performance as dirty-paper coding (DPC). For the special case with two users, we further show that the original nonconvex TPM problem can be equivalently transferred into a convex optimization problem and easily solved via standard optimization tools. In addition, the optimal beamforming is also characterized in a closed form and we show that it achieves the same performance as the DPC. In the simulation, we show that our proposed optimal NOMA beamforming outperforms OMA schemes and can even achieve the same performance as DPC. Our solutions dramatically simplifies the problem of beamforming design in the downlink MISO NOMA systems and improve the system performance.},

  abstract     = {In this work, two efficient low complexity Antenna Selection (AS) algorithms are proposed for downlink Multi-User (MU) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (M-MIMO) systems with Matched Filter (MF) precoding. Both algorithms avoid vector multiplications during the iterative selection procedure to reduce complexity. Considering a system with N antennas at the Base Station (BS) serving K single-antenna users in the same time-frequency resources, the first algorithm divides the available antennas into K groups, with the kth group containing the N/K antennas that have the maximum channel norms for the kth user. Therefore, the Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) for the kth user can be maximized by selecting a subset of the antennas from only the kth group, thereby resulting in a search space reduction by a factor of K. The second algorithm is a semiblind interference rejection method that relies only on the signs of the interference terms, and at each iteration the antenna that rejects the maximum number of interference terms will be selected. The performance of our proposed methods is evaluated under perfect and imperfect Channel State Information (CSI) and compared with other low complexity AS schemes in terms of the achievable sum rate as well as the energy efficiency. In particular, when the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is 10 dB, and for a system with 20 MHz of bandwidth, the proposed methods outperform the case where all the antennas are employed by 108.8 and 49.2 Mbps for the first and second proposed algorithms, respectively, given that the BS has perfect CSI knowledge and is equipped with 256 antennas, out of which 64 are selected to serve 8 single-antenna users.},

  abstract     = {Due to its high speed and low latency, D2D communication plays an important role in providing proximity data services in 5G systems, which may contain privacy sensitive data. Covert communication is useful to protect the privacy of user data against adversaries. In a D2D underlaying cellular network, an antenna array can be used at a base station (BS) to transmit artificial noise to confuse adversaries that try to detect D2D covert signals. Based on the numbers of antennas at BS, two covert schemes are presented in this work and their performances are evaluated in terms of D2D covert throughput, i.e., maximum achievable D2D data rate with the given covertness requirements. As only channel distribution information (CDI) of adversary links is known to the BS, the average minimum error probability (AMEP) is used as a metric to measure the covertness performance. In the proposed schemes, closed-form expressions of the minimum AMEP and achievable D2D data rate are derived. It is shown that the derivation of minimum AMEP can be simplified if either one or massive antennas are allocated for sending artificial noise. The analytical results are compared to Monte-Carlo simulation results to verify the feasibility of the proposed schemes. It is also revealed that covert throughput can be further improved by setting system parameters properly, e.g., the number of antennas at BS and artificial noise transmit power.},

The primary challenge of LTE-U is to successfully coexist with the incumbent systems (e.g., WiFi networks) in the unlicensed bands, while still maintaining the quality-of-service (QoS) for LTE-A users. This paper proposes a new framework for implementing LTE-U standard based on deployed LTE-A infrastructure and cognitive radio (CR) technology to sense radio environment and construct a spectrum map, based on which the LTE-U system can perform joint power and channel allocation to maximize the overall system throughput. We introduce a spectrum map construction scheme and evaluate the Cramer-Rao bound of the scheme. It is shown that the original NP-hard joint power and channel allocation problem can be transformed into a linear programming problem for its solution. Simulation results verify that the proposed LTE-U scheme helps improve system throughput via access collision avoidance.},

  abstract     = {Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) has been proposed for the newest generation of communication systems, considering overloaded non-orthogonal multiple access. To deal with the overload, SCMA exploits the sparsity feature with the aid of receivers based on the messsage-passing algorithm (MPA). In this paper, we review a low-complexity MPA receiver based on edge selection and gaussian approximation (ESGA). We improve this receiver by proposing a threshold-based criterion for the edge selection (TB-ESGA). With the threshold, the number of interfering neighbors considered in the calculation of each message of the MPA becomes a random variable. We derive the probability of selecting a given number of edges in our strategy and also an expression for the average complexity order, as a function of the threshold. We also show that the proposed threshold results in a better trade-off between complexity and error-rate performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers hybrid beamforming by combining an analog beamformer with a new regularized zero forcing baseband one, for multi-user millimeter-wave networks under a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Three popular scenarios are examined: i) the number of users is up to the number of RF chains in a single-cell network, ii) the number of users is up to twice the number of RF chains in a single-cell network, and iii) the number of users is up to twice the number of RF chains in each cell of a two-cell network. In the second and third scenarios, we group the users into two categories of cell-center users as well as cell-edge users and serve them in two different time fractions. In the third scenario, we propose to suppress the inter-cell interference by serving the cell-center and cell-edge users in alternate fractional-time slots. In all the three scenarios, we determine the optimal power allocation maximizing the users&#39; minimum rate. Finally, low-complexity path-following algorithms having rapid convergence are developed for the computation of the optimal power. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve a clear performance gain over the existing benchmarkers.},

We first derive the performance bounds for estimating angular-domain channel parameters, including the angles-of-arrival (AoA), angles-of-departure (AoD) and the associated path gains. Specifically, we derive 1) the deterministic Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) when all of the angular-domain channel parameters are treated as deterministic unknowns; 2) the hybrid CRB when some parameters have known prior probability density functions (pdfs) while the rest are assumed to be deterministic unknowns; 3) the Bayesian CRB when all of them have known prior pdfs. We also consider using the maximum likelihood (ML) method for channel estimation and a computationally efficient relaxation based cyclic algorithm (referred to as 1bRELAX) to obtain the ML estimates. When the prior information is available, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) and joint ML-MAP (JML-MAP) estimators are derived. We also use the one-bit Bayesian information criterion (1bBIC) to determine the number of scattering paths. Numerical examples are provided to verify the derived performance bounds with different thresholding schemes and demonstrate the performance of the proposed channel estimation algorithms.},

In light of the delay analysis of user traffic, the delay-aware resource control of SDN controller is established as a multi-objective stochastic optimization problem to guarantee the statistical QoS provisioning. Secondly, the multi-objective stochastic optimization problem is transformed into a weighted single-objective optimization and relaxed by the Lagrangian relaxation. Then, the Lyapunov optimization theory is utilized to solve the relaxed stochastic optimization for optimal resource control.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an uplink multiuser-multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) cooperative retransmission control scheme for the reliable and efficient communication of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e., flight communication and drone-to-drone communication). This scheme is a key element in the design of a drone-based ad-hoc network. Because drone relay transmission operates in the air, flexible wireless relay networks over large areas can be achieved without interference from multipath signals caused by buildings and obstacles in ground-based communication. However, two main challenges exist. First, the relay transmission system occupies bandwidth every time the drone relays information. Therefore, because the radio channel is shared by multiple relay stations, the throughput is greatly reduced. To improve throughput, it is better to transmit using the minimum number of relay stations. Ultimately, long-distance direct transmission is the best. The other issue is a direct result of the first issues solution: the propagation loss increase when relaying information directly over a long distance. Moreover, because the frequency of interference waves from the ground increases, transmission signal errors are an important issue. To solve this issue, a transmission scheme to reduce errors is required. The scheme proposed in this study achieves high transmission reliability and efficiency even under high transmission error conditions. The results of a computer simulation reveal that the proposed method achieves a direct transmission throughput that is 1.5 times better than that of a conventional scheme. It is also shown that the proposed scheme requires only about three stations to achieve acceptable results.},

  abstract     = {Resource allocation and spectrum management are two major challenges in the massive scale deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication. Furthermore, the large number of devices per unit area in IoT networks also leads to congestion, network overload, and deterioration of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). To address these problems, efficient resource allocation play a pivotal role in optimizing the throughput, delay, and power management of IoT networks. To this end, most of the existing resource allocation mechanisms are centralized and do not gracefully support the heterogeneous and dynamic IoT networks. Therefore, distributed and Machine Learning (ML)-based approaches are essential. However, distributed resource allocation techniques also have scalability problem with large number of devices whereas the ML-based approaches are currently scarce in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new distributed block-based Q-learning algorithm for slot scheduling in the smart devices and Machine Type Communication Devices (MTCDs) participating in clustered IoT networks. We furthermore, propose various reward schemes for the evolution of Q-values in the proposed scheme and, discuss and evaluate their effect on the distributed model. Our goal is to avoid inter- and intra-cluster interference, and to improve the Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) by employing frequency diversity in a multi-channel system. Through extensive simulations, we analyze the effects of the distributed slot-assignment (with respect to varying SIR) on the convergence rate and the convergence probability. Our theoretical analysis and simulations validate the effectiveness of our proposed method where, (i) a suitable slot with acceptable SIR levels is allocated to each MTCD, and (ii) IoT network can efficiently converge to a collision-free transmission causing minimum intra-cluster interference. The network convergence is achieved through each MTCD&#39;s learning ability during the distributed slot allocation.},

  abstract     = {A traditional direct sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA) system works based on spreading codes, which should have good auto-correlation and cross-correlation properties to eliminate multiple access interference (MAI) and multipath interference (MI). However, to find a large number of good spreading codes is extremely difficult, and thus the capacity of a DS-CDMA system is limited strictly by the number of available spreading codes. This work proposes a downlink DS-CDMA design to enable multiple access using only one spreading code, namely identical code cyclic shift (ICCS) code, where in-phase and quadrature channels are used to transmit data and pilot, respectively. In particular, the ICCS code is used at a transmitter to perform DS modulation for user data, which is then sent to the in-phase channel. At the same time, the pilots are sent over the quadrature channel in a time-division multiplex (TDM) mode to construct a correlation matrix of ICCS code. At a receiver, MAI is removed by so-designed pilots plus a matched filter-bank. Simulation results show that the proposed ICCS multiple access (ICCSMA) can achieve a better performance than a traditional DS-CDMA system in a high signal to noise ratio region. ICCSMA serves as a bridge to turn CDMA to NOMA to enable massive connectivity in 5 G and beyond communications.},

In order to solve the mentioned problem, this paper proposes a downlink multi-user multi-weight opportunistic beamforming non-orthogonal multiple access (MW-OBF-NOMA) system. An objective function is formulated to maximize the sum spectrum efficiency (SE) of the proposed system, however, it is a non-convex issue and intractable to derive an optimal solution. To solve this non-convex issue, we divide it into two sub-optimal issues and solve them one-by-one. Based on the solutions of the two sub-optimal issues, a joint iterative resource allocation algorithm is presented. Moreover, we discuss the influences of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation, and deduce a closed-form expression of bit error ratio (BER). Numerical results show that our proposed system can simultaneously serve multiple users without extra resources, and achieve an improved sum SE with a low complexity.},

The noise in the practical communication scenario usually exhibits impulse characteristics in the statistical sense, which could be modeled as the α-stable distribution. This would make the secondor higher-order statistics of the received signal vanish, and thus the performances of the conventional AMC algorithms designed for Gaussian noise significantly deteriorate when directly employed in the α-stable noise. In our proposed framework, the fractional lower-order cyclic spectrum (FLOCS) analysis is first invoked to acquire the polyspectra of the signal corrupted by the α-stable noise. Then, the graph-based AMC mechanism is systematically established upon the graph representation of the FLOCS to identify the modulation type according to the discrepancies between the graph features derived from the training and test data. The performance of our proposed new algorithm is theoretically analyzed, and the correct classification probability Pcc over the modulation candidate set is formulated analytically. The remarkable scalability and efficiency of our proposed approach for the modulation candidate set variation are also theoretically investigated in detail. Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed AMC scheme.},

Due to the fact that FD adopted multiple cognitive users (CUs) suffer not only self-interference (SI) and primary-user interference (PUI) but also multi-user interference (MUI) from the other CUs, the DoF metric is constrained by various interference factors and shows scale invariance properties with respect to the temporal, frequency and spatial dimensions. In this regard, the average DoF is characterized in both spatio and temporal dimensions using limitation calculation (LC) and interference alignment (IA) methods, under interweave, underlay, overlay and hybrid CR patterns. Due to the multi-user specified impacts, the achievable DoF of CU is constrained by the maximum transmit power of the other CUs, and the HD and FD tradeoff for multi-user CR is determined by both MUI and time-antenna splitting. Theoretical analysis indicates that the secondary user power and secondary user number only inflict impacts on LC and IA based average DoF respectively. Moreover, because of distributed CR processing, the average DoF for MU CR is upper-bounded by that of single-user CR. Simulation results validate the effects of MUI, SI, PUI and user number on the average DoF. It shows that IA achieves higher DoF than that of LC for multi-user CR, indicating that the DoF loss due to MUI can be reduced if interference mitigation is available.},

Detailed discussions are given, from which MRC appears to outperform selection combining diversity under generalised-oCSI conditions. Trade-off between key parameters is identified, and explained. Monte Carlo simulation is given, which is shown to match the proposed theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {The study of the effects of Nakagami-m fading channels with both integer and non-integer m plays an important role in the design of practical wireless systems. In this paper, we investigate a dual-hop cooperative communication system, where source node communicates with destination node through direct and relaying paths. Partial relay selection (PRS) scheme is used to select the best relay among N relays which are capable of harvesting energy from radio frequency (RF) signals. At the destination, selection combining (SC) technique is employed to combine the signals of the direct path and the relaying path. We consider two relaying protocols, i.e. amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). For both AF and DF protocols, we derive the tight lower-bound closed-form approximate expression and the exact closed-form expression of the outage probability (OP) over Nakagami-m fading channels with both integer and non-integer m. Moreover, the optimal energy harvesting duration which minimizes the OP is also determined. Numerical results show that, the OP of DF protocol and its minimum value is lower than those of AF protocol for the same parameter settings. Moreover, the time switching ratio which gives the smallest OP in the case without direct path is larger than the case with direct path.},

  abstract     = {Resource Allocation (RA) is one of the important factors in network function virtualization (NFV) deployment. As physical (PHY) layer resources are limited, e.g., transmitted energy and channel uses, the RA problem at the PHY layer for NFV deployment has become a fast-growing problem, especially for supporting ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). Moreover, different nodes in NFV have different requirements for end-to-end communication, e.g., a controller has more stringent reliability requirements than does a logical node. There is a need for efficient and robust RA algorithms at the PHY layer for NFV deployment. To illustrate these challenges, we consider an up-link (UL) transmission protocol for NFV deployment, in which wireless transmissions with short packets are considered, and both the packet length and the transmission power are adjustable. Then, for three NFV deployment scenarios, we formulate three RA problems as three optimization problems to obtain the optimal parameters. Since these optimization problems are highly non-convex and they include excessive constraint conditions, the global optimal solutions are hard to obtain and are even infeasible for the conventional heuristic algorithms due to their low convergence efficiency. To address these problems, in this paper, the intelligent scheme of the modified shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (MSFLA) based on improved extremal optimization (EO) is applied to design RA algorithms. Three RA algorithms are designed for three NFV deployment scenarios to evaluate the quality of the solutions produced by the MSFLA-EO scheme. We perform simulations of three proposed RA algorithms in terms of various performance parameters. The experimental results are encouraging and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed RA algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Consider multicell heterogeneous networks (HetNets), where each cell consists of a number of small (micro/pico) base stations (SBSs) and the SBSs perform coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission/reception to serve a number of downlink/uplink (DL/UL) users over the same frequency band. The SBSs work in full-duplex (FD) mode and the DL/UL users are half-duplex (HD). Due to co-channel transmissions, the DL and the UL are mutually interfered. This motivates us to consider a joint DL/UL beamformer design for maximizing the system sum rate. Different from the conventional sum rate maximization (SRM), where the user&#39;s rate is allowed to be any nonnegative real number, herein we focus on the discrete-rate case - each user&#39;s rate is constrained to a prescribed discrete-rate set. This discrete-rate constraint is motivated by the fact that practical communication systems are designed for a finite number of transmission rates, owing to the finite number of modulation and coding schemes (MCS). In view of this, our SRM problem is coined as discrete SRM (DSRM). The DSRM problem is essentially a mixed-integer nonlinear program, and NP-hard. To tackle it, two different approaches are proposed. The first approach is built upon the simplex reformulation of the discrete rate and the mirror descent (MD) algorithm. The second approach exploits the correspondence between the rate and minimum mean-square error (MMSE), and employs the block-coordinate descent (BCD) method to find an approximate solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superior rate performance of the proposed designs as compared with the weighted MMSE (WMMSE) design with naive rate quantization.},

In this paper, we first investigate the robust rate-maximization problem in the VFDM system. In the condition of imperfect channel state information (CSI), the precoder is optimized to satisfy both non-interference to LTE system and rate-maximization in the NR system. To tackle the challenge in solving such a non-convex problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD) methods.

  abstract     = {Quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) was recently proposed to increase the spectral efficiency of spatial modulation. In QSM, the real and imaginary parts of a symbol are transmitted independently from different antennas. A new spatial modulation technique, termed signed quadrature spatial modulation (SQSM), is introduced in this paper. Unlike QSM, SQSM creates four-dimensional spatial constellation, and hence results in higher system throughput. This technique extends the traditional spatial-constellation dimension into &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\pm$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; in-phase and quadrature-phase dimensions. The ensuing constellation consists of four antenna indices, which are chosen independently in order to transmit the real and imaginary parts of the modulated symbols and their inverse. The performance of the proposed technique is compared to the most-recent SM techniques, namely, QSM, double SM, and improved QSM (IQSM). Numerical results demonstrate that SQSM provides significant performance gains (3–7 dB), particularly when a large number of transmit antennas is used. This comes with a marginal increase in computational complexity compared to QSM and SM. Also, while IQSM can be competitive with SQSM in some cases, SQSM has a much lower computational complexity, e.g., 46% reduction in complexity in case of 16 transmit antennas and 16 bps/Hz.},

First, for the perfect CSI scenario, we formulate the secrecy rate optimization problem, and an equivalent monotonically decreasing objective function is established to make the problem suitable for efficient BAB search. In each search, we propose using the weighted mean squared error minimization (WMMSE) method to tackle the optimization problem. Then, we generalize the framework to the imperfect CSI case, and the robust problem is designed to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate, the problem is challenging to solve due to the channel uncertainties. A cutting-set method is devised to solve this non-convex problem by updating the worst-case secrecy rate and channel uncertainties alternately. To reduce the design complexity, we also present an antenna selection based on the alternating optimization (AO) method.

However, to establish communication links, a beam training procedure is indispensable. How to accelerate the beam training process is one of the key challenges towards realizing mmWave communications in practice. In this study, we first propose a novel low-cost digital beamforming (DBF) module assisted hybrid (DAhybrid) architecture, by exploiting both the capabilities of analog and digital modules. To make this topology practical, we deploy coarse radio frequency (RF) chains and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters in the low-cost DBF module to reduce cost and power consumption. Second, we design a fast beam training method (named DAH-BT) by utilizing the proposed DA-hybrid architecture and leveraging the sparse nature of mmWave channels, in which an internal calibration method is adapted to obtain the parameters of the RF impairments and the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is utilized to estimate beams. We also prove that the developed measurement matrices satisfy the restricted isometry property. Extensive simulation results show that the DA-hybrid architecture can not only provide close to 100% beam matching accuracy, but also dramatically reduce the system power consumption and cost. In addition, the proposed DAH-BT scheme consumes the shortest time for beam training over the state-of-art methods with comparable spectral efficiency.},

To improve the network performance, we propose two user scheduling schemes, namely dual-hop scheduling (DHS) and best-path scheduling (BPS) schemes. We then investigate the performance of the proposed scheduling schemes in terms of outage probability and outage floor. Through numerical results, we show that BPS scheme significantly outperforms DHS scheme, which in turns outperforms the state-of-the-art solution. Moreover, the advantages and drawbacks of each scheme are analyzed and discussed comprehensively.

The delay sensitivity factor is designed in the dynamic RNA configuration scheme to classify UEs into two categories: delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant. In order to satisfy the delay requirement for various UEs, the parallel and the sequential paging schemes are adopted to the delay-sensitive and the delay-tolerant UEs respectively. The proposed dynamic RNA configuration scheme consists of two steps: online decision making and offline RNA optimization. In the online decision making step, the optimal RNA list will be assigned to UEs according to the activities of UEs while in the offline RNA optimization step, the optimal RNA list is generated to minimize the overall signaling messages. Additionally, we further extensively investigate the dynamic RNA configuration update process in both the theoretical and the practical manner. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated and the results demonstrate the efficiency in achieving the design goals, which could obtain a considerable performance improvement compared to the related schemes in previous literatures.},

  abstract     = {In typical urban or suburban environments, multipath poses a serious threat to the accuracy of position determined by a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver. In this paper, a novel multipath mitigation technique is proposed for general multipath scenarios encountered in the urban settings. In the proposed technique, a double differentiated correlation function based histogram output is used to estimate the code delay. It is shown that the proposed technique provides significant improvements over the current state of the art techniques like high resolution correlator/double delta correlator and narrow correlator. The results hold for general multipath models for the mobile-satellite channels. The performance guarantees include closed form expressions for the probability of correct delay estimate and simulation results for the average range error variation with respect to carrier to noise ratio (CNR), signal bandwidth and different channel settings.},

  abstract     = {Selective mapping (SLM) and partial transmit sequence (PTS) are attractive schemes for mitigating the high peak power inherent in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. However, the high computational complexity and redundant side information (SI) bits have been identified as the main limitations for such techniques. The high computational complexity is mainly due to the need to perform several inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFTs), and phase optimization process at the transmitter side. Therefore, this paper presents new SLM and PTS designs using a low complexity T-transform rather than IFFT. The use of the T-transform with SLM achieves a considerable computational complexity and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction. Furthermore, we apply the T-transform to PTS and derive two different configurations that compromise the SI requirements and PAPR reduction. All the proposed schemes do not affect the original power spectrum of OFDM signals. The complexity analysis show that the proposed schemes have much lower complexity as compared to conventional schemes. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes are resilient to dispersion arising from multipath propagation, which is due to the frequency diversity introduced by the T-transform.},

By contrast, we design a fuel minimization controller through solving constraint nonlinear optimization problems, whose cost function is the total fuel consumption and constraints are the vehicle&#39;s physical limits. To achieve high computational efficiency and sufficient accuracy, the optimization problem is solved by iterative convex quadratic programming and quasilinearization.

  abstract     = {To improve the maneuverability and stability of a vehicle and fully leverage the advantages of torque vectoring technology in vehicle dynamics control, a finite-time yaw rate and sideslip angle tracking controller is proposed by combining a second-order sliding mode (SOSM) controller with the backstepping method in this paper. However, existing research indicates that first-order sliding mode (FOSM) control suffers from the chattering problem, while the traditional SOSM controller requires knowing the bound of the uncertain term in advance to obtain the switching gain, which is difficult in practice. To address these problems, this paper proposes an adaptive second-order sliding mode (ASOSM) controller based on the backstepping method by adding the high-frequency switching term to the first derivative of the sliding mode variable, which implies that the actual control can be acquired after an integration process. The switching gain in the ASOSM controller is obtained by an adaptive algorithm without knowing any information of the uncertainty. The proposed algorithm is compared with FOSM and SOSM in different scenarios to demonstrate its applicability and robustness. Simulation results show that the bandwidth of the vehicle transient response can be improved by 21%. In addition, ASOSM and SOSM controllers are insensitive to vehicle mass and tire type, implying their robustness to such disturbances. Furthermore, ASOSM requires less control action because of the adaptive law when it performs similarly with SOSM and FOSM.},

Although wayside ESS are widely used, because of the influence of no-load voltage, and so on, a wayside ESS cannot absorb all the regenerative braking energy in some special cases, and the brake resistor is still activated, which leading to the wasting of energy. In order to completely replace the on-board brake resistor, this paper configures a certain on-board super-capacitor, and based on a DC-side series super-capacitor topology, proposes a hierarchical optimization energy management strategy (EMS). The EMS is divided into three layers: Firstly, the strategy can increase the inverter-side voltage in a short time without changing the traction network voltage, and improve the train braking characteristic curve by utilizing the short-time overvoltage capability of the inverter and the motor; Secondly, by coordinated control with a wayside supercapacitor, the residual regenerative braking energy can be absorbed even in special cases; Finally, based on loss calculation and current prediction, this strategy can effectively reduce the system loss by adjusting the DC voltage on the inverter-side. The proposed control strategy is validated through RT-LAB experiment, and the experimental results agree well with the theory.},

  abstract     = {Success of electric mobility and connected future depends on advanced high capacity Lithium-ion batteries and a tailored battery management system that keeps track of battery health and safety to optimize the performance. The drive for advanced batteries is being pursued on one front via the development of novel chemistry, for example, blended composite cathodes to achieve enhanced performance and life. On the other front, the need for optimal battery performance via operational control viz. a robust Battery Management System (BMS) that accurately predicts state-of-charge (SOC), state-of-power (SOP) and state-of-health (SOH) in a computationally efficient way, has been lacking in many ways due to the reliance on simple and fast-to-compute models such as equivalent circuit models (ECM) that lack the accuracy needed for large battery packs. This paper reports an on-board reduced-order electrochemical thermal model (ROTM) based SOC and voltage estimation for a 12S1P configuration composite-cathode battery pack and demonstrates its practicality by implementing it on four different micro-controller units (MCU) (ATmega:2560&amp;328, Infineon:TC275&amp;TC297). We show that on-board ROTM based SOC and voltage prediction have better accuracy compared to the conventional ECM based methods under both static and dynamic load conditions.},

A chain Gaussian process approach is employed to estimate the probability distribution of future increments of vehicle number over a look-ahead horizon from vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure information. The future motion of preceding vehicles could be predicted by the evolution of the traffic density model and velocity tracking model. The above problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem with predicted disturbance input and dynamic constraints. Optimal solutions are derived through Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle.

However, much of energy consumption of clutch actuator reduces fuel efficiency of DCT-equipped vehicles. In order to reduce energy consumption of these actuators, a method of modifying mechanism and a method of improving it through control have been studied. However, the results of each study still use more energy or make the actuator less controllable. Thus, in this manuscript, we propose a ball-ramp DCT (BR-DCT) with a clutch actuator that changes mechanism to reduce power consumed by engagement and improve controllability. DCT is designed using the proposed structure and design parameter constraint selection method, and energy efficiency improvement effect of BR-DCT is verified through simulation. We also demonstrate effect of BR-DCT prototype on actuator energy saving through test bench experiment. As a result, clutch actuator of BR-DCT uses 84% less energy than conventional DCT and can improve vehicle fuel efficiency by 0.5%. In addition, since it has same characteristics as conventional DCT, it verifies that it can fully utilize controller developed previously.},

Moreover, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for automatic feature learning and classification without human intervention. The effectiveness and efficiency are validated by dataset of rolling element bearings obtained in lab and real-use case. Three features can be highlighted. First of all, the proposed model showed a good adaptability and high efficiency under various working condition by taking full use of the multi-sensor data. It has powerful ability in accuracy and convergence speed. Secondly, it is not as sensitive to data quantity as other deep learning algorithms do. Such superior characteristic made the model more suitable for practical application, because of the insufficient failure data.

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection is an important issue in trajectory data mining. Various approaches have been proposed to address this issue. However, most previous studies focus only on outlier detection but rarely on pattern mining of anomalous trajectories. Mining patterns of anomalous trajectories can reveal the underlying mechanisms of these outliers. This paper studies four distinct patterns of anomalous trajectories, and proposes a method to detect and classify them. First, we present the difference and intersection set (DIS) distance metric to evaluate the similarity between any two trajectories. Based on this distance, we design an anomaly score function to quantify the differences between different types of anomalous trajectories and normal trajectories. We further propose an anomalous trajectory detection and classification (ATDC) method to find anomalies in different anomalous patterns. Finally, we evaluate the proposed ATDC method through extensive experiments on real cab trajectory data. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods by a significant margin.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle type recognition (VTR) from surveillance data has recently received increasing attention in both intelligent transportation and computer vision field. The deep learning techniques, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have provided great progress in tasks with the large-scale labeled data. However, in real-world applications, manually labeling from large-scale surveillance data is time-consuming and tedious, which strongly obstructs the application of a CNN-based VTR. The existing works on VTR studied samples selection for manual annotation. Here, a VTR framework based on deep active learning that releases the burden of large-scale labeling is presented. The framework selects the most worthy samples to the manually selected, and then retrains the network with the annotated samples incrementally. Besides, the framework simultaneously takes advantage of both auto-labeled and manually-labeled data using the strategy of bi-direction entropy threshold. The proposed framework is validated on the public dataset Comprehensive Cars, and experimental results demonstrated that, with the incremental query strategy, the proposed framework could reduce annotation cost dramatically compared with random selection.},

  abstract     = {In the near future, multi-sensor fusion will be the core component to navigate the autonomous driving platforms. This paper proposes new strategies to cope with the integration of an inertial navigation system (INS), a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) to achieve simultaneous localization and mapping (INS/GNSS/LiDAR SLAM) especially in GNSS challenging environments where GNSS signals are blocked or contaminated with reflected signals. The proposed strategies implement a high level of integration with various information received from multiple sensors to collectively compensate for the specific drawbacks of those sensors included in the integrated system. The first strategy is to solve the divergence and drift problems of SLAM using the initial pose information from INS and the proposed refreshing process using an INS/GNSS integrated system. In addition, an updated mechanization is designed to qualify those received measurements based on cross validation of separate types of data. This mechanization is to ensure all measurements are reliable for the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) update process. Moreover, the SLAM-derived information plays a major role to recognize the vehicle movement which assists the system to accurately apply those appropriate vehicle motion constraint models. The preliminary results presented in this study illustrate that proposed algorithm performs superior than the traditional INS/GNSS integration scheme and provides absolute navigation accuracy of 2 meters and 0.6% of distance traveled in GNSS-denied as well as 1.2 meters in GNSS-hostile environments, respectively.},

To evaluate the trade-off between component cost and operational cost, an optimisation problem, which integrates type selection, sizing, energy management and different installation configurations of the SESSs, is introduced and formulated in terms of an annual cost. Disciplined convex modelling is applied to obtain a computationally tractable solution for a case study on an existing line in China.

A cooperative guidance control method based on the back-stepping approach is proposed to rapidly form the desired formation and reach the multi-UAV steady state. The UAV formation system consists of four UAVs, forming a regular triangle formation. One of the UAVs is a virtual leader and is located at the center of the triangle; the other three UAVs are located at the vertices of the triangle. The forward speed of leader is used as the forward direction of the formation, and the followers follow the leader in a formation flight. The error dynamics model of each follower is established by using the leader guidance mechanism, and the communication mode between any two UAVs is established based on graph theory. In addition, the guidance control law is obtained via the back-stepping approach. We reasonably construct the Lyapunov function to prove the stability of the proposed cooperative guidance control law in formation aggregation and keeping. Moreover, the proposed method is compared with the model prediction method (MPC) and the Lyapunov method to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation results show that each UAV can converge to the desired motion trajectory and fly in the desired formation with fast convergence speed and small steady-state error.},

Existing methods based on the probability tail model to solve the SSP problem, seek for the path that minimizes the probability of delay occurrence, which is equal to maximizing the probability of reaching the destination before a deadline (i.e., arriving on time). However, they suffer from low accuracy or high computational cost. Therefore, we design a novel and practical Q-learning approach where the converged Q-values have the practical meaning as the actual probabilities of arriving on time so as to improve the accuracy of finding the real optimal path. By further adopting dynamic neural networks to learn the value function, our approach can scale well to large road networks with arbitrary deadlines. Moreover, our approach is flexible to implement in a time dependent manner, which further improves the performance of returned path. Experimental results on some road networks with real mobility data, such as Beijing, Munich and Singapore, demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed approach over other methods.},

This could put these parking spots owners into some unnecessary inconveniences, such as identity theft. Existing private parking spot sharing schemes either do not consider privacy issues. Or, when privacy is taken into account, they assume the existence of a trusted third party. To address these issues, we propose a privacy-enhanced private parking spot sharing scheme without trusted third parties. Specifically, we use market design method to share parking spots. We achieve enhanced privacy with decentralized anonymous credentials and confidential anonymous payment with a variant Monero.

  abstract     = {Virtual powertrain analysis is widely applied in the automotive industry to cope with the increasing complexity and variance of future vehicle propulsion technologies. Since the vehicle-usage behavior has a strong impact on component loads, realistic computation results require accurate assumptions about these boundaries. In this context, driving cycles (DCs) are used to represent the system boundaries in vehicle operation. The aim of this article is to identify multiple characteristic driving cycles (CDCs) from extensive vehicle measurement data which represent the full variety of possible real-driving scenarios. Vehicle measurements are segmented and consumption-relevant features are extracted from each segment. These features are then used to apply clustering and classification techniques to identify characteristic groups that are consequently assigned to different driving environments and driving styles. In order to obtain even more realistic driving scenarios, a data-fusion approach is used to incorporate a road slope signal from a NASA digital elevation model for each segment. Lastly, a genetic mixed-integer optimization algorithm is proposed to efficiently generate representative DCs for each characteristic group of driving segments. The main contribution of this article is a data-driven identification of the parameter space of real-driving scenarios from extensive vehicle measurements including the implementation of road slope information. The scenarios are represented via a constrained number of compact CDCs which enables comprehensive investigations of new powertrain technologies under average as well as extreme real-driving conditions to develop efficiency-robust powertrain systems.},

Beam steering between ±45° is achieved with low side lobe levels. Practical design considerations for the integration of the arrays in handset to obtain full-coverage in horizontal plane are investigated.

  abstract     = {In this article, a dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay communication system is studied. With a splitting (PS) protocol, the relay node harvests the radio frequency (RF) energy in the signals sent by the source node and utilizes the harvested energy to forward signals from the source node to the destination node. We aim at maximizing the source-destination mutual information (MI) through a joint design of the source matrix, the relay matrix, and the PS ratios under the source node power constraint and the relay node harvested energy constraint. We consider a general sum energy constraint at the relay node with different PS ratios across relay antennas, which includes existing works based on uniform PS or per data stream energy constraint as special cases. Moreover, a practical nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) model is adopted, where the harvested energy is bounded as the incident RF signal power increases. We establish the structure of the source matrix and the relay matrix, which simplifies the complicated transceiver design problem with matrix variables to a power distribution problem with scalar variables. Three approaches are proposed to efficiently solve the optimal power distribution problem. In particular, the first proposed algorithm solves the original nonconvex power allocation problem using the sequential quadratic programming, while the other two algorithms convert the original problem to convex problems by exploiting a tight upper bound and a tight lower bound of the objective function, respectively. Numerical simulations demonstrate that when the EH circuit works in the linear region, the proposed algorithms have a larger system MI than existing PS and TS based MIMO AF relay systems. The peak harvest power constraint plays an important role in choosing the location of the relay node.},

However, detailed knowledge about the wireless propagation channel is needed for the development and realistic assessment of V2V communication systems. We present a novel geometry-based stochastic MIMO channel model with support for frequencies in the band of 5.2-6.2 GHz. The model is based on extensive high-resolution measurements at different road intersections in the city of Berlin, Germany. We extend existing models, by including the effects of various obstructions, higher order interactions, and by introducing an angular gain function for the scatterers. Scatterer locations have been identified and mapped to measured multi-path trajectories using a measurement-based ray tracing method and a subsequent RANSAC algorithm. The developed model is parameterized, and using the measured propagation paths that have been mapped to scatterer locations, model parameters are estimated. The time variant power fading of individual multi-path components is found to be best modeled by a Gamma process with an exponential autocorrelation. The path coherence distance is estimated to be in the range of 0-2 m. The model is also validated against measurement data, showing that the developed model accurately captures the behavior of the measured channel gain, Doppler spread, and delay spread. This is also the case for intersections that have not been used when estimating model parameters.},

  abstract     = {The 3.5 GHz and 28 GHz bands are both very important for the fifth-generation (5 G) wireless communication system. To model their propagation characteristics and study their channel properties, we conduct measurements at these two bands in indoor and outdoor scenarios. The measured bandwidths at 3.5 and 28 GHz are 100 and 400 MHz, respectively. To make a fair comparison, the measurement results at 28 GHz are divided into four groups with bandwidths from 100 to 400 MHz. This is also helpful to study the effect of bandwidth on the channel properties, especially numbers of clusters and their growth rate. We choose the Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) model to analyze the wireless channel. Its cluster-based property is very suitable to describe the power delay profiles (PDPs) in our measurement. To maintain the time continuity of multipath components (MPCs) during the clustering, we propose a new heuristic cluster algorithm. Based on the clustering results, we obtain the channel parameters, i.e., the number of clusters, inter-cluster interval, intra-cluster root mean square (RMS) delay spread, cluster decay factor, and ray decay factor. From the comparative study, we can find that the rays suffer a larger attenuation at 28 GHz than at 3.5 GHz. Increasing bandwidth can increase the ray decay factor. But the effects of frequency on the cluster decay rate are different in indoor and outdoor scenarios. The cluster decay rate is smaller at 28 GHz in the indoor scenario.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an anti-eavesdropping strategy is proposed for secure precoding-aided spatial modulation networks, under the assumption that the rough channel state information of eavesdropper can be obtained at the transmitter. Traditionally, artificial noise (AN) can be always projected into the null-space of the legitimate channel, however it may lead to some security loss since this strategy dispenses with a holistic consideration for secure transmissions. To reduce the computational complexity of our optimization problem, we derive a closed-form expression that is a loose bound of the approximate rate over the illegitimate channel. Then a concave maximization problem is formulated for optimizing the covariance matrix of AN. Simulation results show that our proposed low-complexity scheme performs closely to the method which directly maximizes the approximate secrecy rate expression, and harvests significant secrecy rate gains compared with the traditional null-space projection benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Channel estimation (CE) for millimeter-wave (mmWave) lens-array suffers from prohibitive training overhead, whereas the state-of-the-art solutions require an extra complicated radio frequency phase shift network. By contrast, lens-array using antenna switching network (ASN) simplifies the hardware, but the associated CE is a challenging task due to the constraint imposed by ASN. This paper proposes a compressive sensing (CS)-based CE solution for full-dimensional (FD) lens-array, where the mmWave channel sparsity is exploited. Specifically, we first propose an approach of pilot training under the more severe haraware constraint imposed by ASN, and formulate the associated CE of lens-array as a CS problem. Then, a redundant dictionary is tailored for FD lens-array to combat the power leakage caused by the continuous angles of multipath components. Further, we design the baseband pilot signals to minimize the total mutual coherence of the measurement matrix based on CS theory for more reliable CE performance. Our solution provides a framework for applying CS techniques to lens-array using simple and practical ASN. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

This is motivated by the fact that the PR mode can harvest power from the radio frequency (RF) source to support “green communication”, while the AR mode can provide the stable power supply. Besides, opportunistic successive interference cancellation (SIC) is exploited to mitigate the direct link interference (DLI), which is in contrast to previous works assuming ideal SIC. Two adaptive mode selection (AMS) schemes are proposed, i.e., power maximization (PM)-oriented AMS and outage minimization (OM)-oriented AMS. Since exact closed-form expressions for the outage performance of proposed schemes are not attainable, lower bounds are obtained to facilitate our analysis. For comparison, benchmark schemes including the PR and the AR modes are investigated. Simulation results demonstrate the correctness and the tightness of our analysis, and show that significant performance gain can be achieved in the proposed OM-oriented AMS scheme.},

Hence, in order to quantify the impact of CCI for the energy harvesting system, a closed-form and asymptotic expression of the system outage performance is derived for the power splitting (PS) based relay. Moreover, with the aid of the approximated outage analysis, we obtain a simple expression for the optimal PS ratio. Simulation results are provided to validate the accuracy of our analysis.},

  abstract     = {With the prevalence of commercial WiFi devices and the development of Internet of Things (IoT), researchers have extended the usage of WiFi from communication to sensing. Recently, device-free human activity recognition has been applied to support WiFi based remote control and human-computer interaction. However, prior works usually recognize each individual activity by extracting the feature of corresponding WiFi signals, and hence distinguishing differences between human activities. Once the activity has multiple variations of different body parts (such as head, arm and leg), distinguishing such sub-activities is extremely difficult. In this paper, we propose a Multi-variations Activity Recognition (MAR) system to identify multiple-variations of body parts. Our work is based on an observation that the Channel State Information (CSI) is sensitive to the activities of body parts. Firstly, CANDECOMP/ PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) are applied to recognize multi-variations activities. Secondly, we theoretically analyse the uniqueness of CP decomposition. Then, we design specific experiment to verify the reliability and stability of uniqueness. Finally, we apply MAR in gaits recognition of multiple volunteers to evaluate the accuracy performance. The experiment results demonstrate that MAR achieves average 95% accuracy in gaits recognition.},

  abstract     = {Resource allocation algorithms are conceived for minimizing the energy consumption of multiuser mobile edge computing (MEC) systems operating in the face of interference channels, and where mobile users can offload their latency-sensitive tasks to the mobile edge server via a base station (BS). Latency-sensitive applications that benefit from MEC services can be divided into two major classes: 1) applications requiring uninterrupted execution and that cannot be fragmented and therefore require full offloading (FO); 2) applications which can benefit from fractional or partial offloading (PO). For each class of applications, we first formulate a joint optimization problem where the aim is to minimize the overall energy consumption across the sub-network subject to latency, transmission quality, computational budget and transmit power constraints. The proposed optimization problems are nonconvex, tightly coupled, and consequently challenging to solve. By exploiting binary relaxation, smooth approximation and auxiliary variables, we convert these problems into more tractable forms and subsequently develop novel algorithms based on the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) to solve them. Furthermore, by incorporating a measure of user priority, a reduced-complexity solution is proposed for the FO scheme. The benefits of our energy-efficient resource allocation algorithms for latency-sensitive MEC are demonstrated through simulations.},

Finding a complete series of mobile-to-mobile contacts and forwarding data toward targets within a designated deadline is even more difficult. We leverage unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as message ferries to travel over highly probable rendezvous points for over-the-air delivery to target users. We propose Rendezvous, an opportunistic yet disciplined data delivery scheme based on trajectory prediction of users and UAV path planning. During the offline learning phase, we identify both temporal and spatial regularities of mobile users from real-world trajectories using sequence-wise clustering, and construct a compact yet well-summarized cluster signature that enables efficient search. In the data delivery phase, given recent movement history of users, UAVs perform their own distributed path planning collaboratively over time. Each UAV finds a chronological sequence of future visiting points where it can make consecutive data delivery efforts to users to overcome the uncertainty in mobility and ensure timely delivery. Real-world trace-driven simulation experiments demonstrate that Rendezvous achieves reliable and punctual data delivery using only few UAVs compared with existing algorithms.},

In these attempts, a masquerade attack impersonating some safety-critical electronic control units (ECUs) is usually performed to control a vehicle. In the last decade, several message authentication protocols for controller area network (CAN) have been proposed to protect vehicles from masquerade attacks. However, some message authentication protocols are not enough to protect a vehicle from masquerade attacks by compromised ECUs. Other protocols that are secure against masquerade attacks fill the network capacity of CAN up to 100% or require hardware modifications of the CAN-controller, dedicated hardware used for CAN communications. In this paper, we propose a new authentication protocol, MAuth-CAN, that is secure against masquerade attacks. MAuth-CAN neither fills up to 100% of the network capacity nor requires hardware modifications of a CAN-controller. In addition, we propose a technique that protects ECUs from bus-off attacks, and apply the technique to MAuth-CAN for handling bus-off attacks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on a downlink cellular network, where multiple UAVs serve as aerial basestations to provide wireless connectivity to ground users through frequency division multi-access (FDMA) scheme. The UAVs are exclusively powered by a wireless charging station located on the ground following save-then-transmit protocol. In such a UAV-assisted cellular network, joint optimization for user association, resource allocation and basesation placement are investigated to maximize the downlink sum rate. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer optimization problem and is thus challenging to solve. We propose an efficient solution based on alternating optimization, by iteratively solving one of the three subproblems (i.e., user association, resource allocation and basesation placement) with the other two fixed. Specificly, user association is solved as a standard linear programming problem by relaxing the binary association indicators into continuous variables. For basestation placement and resource allocation, we resort to successive convex optimization technique, which iteratively solves a lower-bound problem. After iteratively solving the three subproblems, we further propose an algorithm based on penalty method and successive convex optimization to make the association indicators feasibly binary. We conduct comprehensive experiments for the optimal solution to the three subproblems with insightful results. We also show that the optimal downlink sum rate cannot be always enhanced by deploying more UAVs due to non-negligible tradeoff between energy/communication sources and co-channel interference. Moreover, the proposed solution outperforms a baseline strategy leveraged from an existing work, especially with favorable channel condition and sufficient frequency resources.},

  abstract     = {For the 360-degree virtual reality (VR) videos, to achieve the same user-perceived playout quality with traditional video, the overall video bitrate has to be much higher, which significantly increases the bandwidth requirement. To overcome this issue, most of rate adaptation schemes are proposed based on the users&#39; Field of View (FoV), since users only view part of the entire videos when watching 360-degree videos. However, the FoV prediction is only valid in short terms which incurs low robustness against network dynamics and results in frozen screen events. Since the playback buffer can effectively avoid re-buffering by storing videos in advance, we propose a two-layered hierarchical buffer-based rate adaptation scheme for 360-degree VR videos in this paper. The tiles will be updated to enhance the video quality in the short buffer layer based on FoV prediction, meanwhile the long buffer layer takes charge of downloading new chunks to guarantee the buffer occupancy. To better improve the quality of experience (QoE), we jointly consider the users&#39; FoV, channel conditions and buffer status. Our method achieves a good trade-off between video quality and buffer occupancy. Besides, the maximum buffer level selection is optimized to further improve the performance. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme and algorithms outperform other methods by about 5%-30% of QoE improvement.},

In contrast to long-packet communications in conventional wireless systems, SPC suffers from a transmission rate degradation and an unavoidable decoding error rate. Thus conventional resource allocation based on the Shannon capacity assuming infinite blocklength is no longer optimal. In this paper, we propose to use the effective-throughput as the performance metric to evaluate the tradeoff between the transmission rate and the decoding error rate. Building on that, we jointly optimize the subcarrier assignment, transmission power allocation, and transmission rate adaptation of each user to maximize the total weighted effective-throughput subject to transmission reliability and various practical constraints. Since the formulated problem belongs to a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we develop an efficient algorithm based on the dynamic programming (DP) recursion framework to obtain its optimal solutions. We further propose a low-complexity algorithm based on the principles of block coordinate descent (BCD) and concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity algorithm can achieve similar performance as that of the optimal solution and outperform the other baseline schemes significantly.},

The introduction of Mobile Relay Node (MRN) can improve the link quality and decrease the handover overheads. However, MRNs still suffer from several protocol attacks and frequent handovers and thus, the introduction of MRNs deteriorates the handover success rate and handover performance. At the same time, considering the diversity of future 5G high-speed rail networks, in this paper, we propose two fixed-trajectory group pre-handover authentication schemes for MRN: the first proposed scheme FTGPHA1 which establishes most of the important security properties and costs low handover overheads, and the second proposed scheme FTGPHA2 which furnishes better security properties than the first one. In these two schemes, since all of the MRNs in the same train and the next base station can accomplish the handover authentication with the help of the donor software defined networking controller before the MRN arrives, the handover delay can be ignored and thus, uninterrupted services can be provided for UEs on board. The security and performance evaluations demonstrate that the two proposed schemes outperform other related schemes.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, Vehicular Ad Hoc NETworks (VANETs) become actually the main force to disseminate and deliver position-related contents such as road-safety information, so it is significant to improve content delivery efficiency. Usually, users employ the address-centric mechanism to upload/download contents to/from servers located in backbone networks, which leads to considerable content delivery latency and costs. This paper proposes a Content Delivery solution based on Vehicular Cloud (CDVC) and aims to take advantage of the vehicular cloud and name-based mechanism to reduce the content delivery cost and latency. In CDVC, vehicular cloud members store and provide the content locally so that vehicles can rapidly retrieve the content from the nearest member. Moreover, the hierarchical name-based mechanism is proposed to achieve the request aggregation so that vehicles can share the content via one content delivery process. Finally, CDVC is evaluated, and the experimental data show that CDVC effectively reduces the content delivery cost and latency.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the rapid advance of vehicular networks has led to the emergence of diverse delay-sensitive vehicular applications such as automatic driving, auto navigation. Note that existing resource-constrained vehicles cannot adequately meet these demands on low / ultra-low latency. By offloading parts of the vehicles&#39; compute-intensive tasks to the edge servers in proximity, mobile edge computing is envisioned as a promising paradigm, giving rise to the vehicular edge computing networks (VECNs). However, most existing works on task offloading in VECNs did not take the load balancing of the computation resources at the edge servers into account. To address these issues and given the high dynamics of vehicular networks, we introduce fiber-wireless (FiWi) technology to enhance VECNs, due to its advantages on centralized network management and supporting multiple communication techniques. Aiming to minimize the processing delay of the vehicles&#39; computation tasks, we propose a software-defined networking (SDN) based load-balancing task offloading scheme in FiWi enhanced VECNs, where SDN is introduced to provide supports for the centralized network and vehicle information management. Extensive analysis and numerical results corroborate that our proposed load-balancing scheme can achieve superior performance on processing delay reduction by utilizing the edge servers&#39; computation resources more efficiently.},

  abstract     = {Slicing is a key technology in 5G networks to provide scalability and flexibility in allocating computing and communication resources among multiple tenants. Typically, 5G networks have a 2-tier architecture consisting of a central office and transport network in the upper tier and a multi-access edge and radio access network in the lower tier. The tenants which share the 2-tier architecture typically have different service-dependent resource requirements. This study proposes an algorithm, designated as Upper-tier First with Latency-bounded Over-provisioning Prevention (UFLOP), to adjust the capacity and traffic allocation in such a way as to minimize the “over-provisioning ratio” while still satisfying the latency constraints and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) of the tenants. The performance of UFLOP is evaluated experimentally with a real testbed on an end-to-end slicing framework using three typical 5G services, namely Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency (URLLC), and massive Machine Type Connection (mMTC). It is shown that UFLOP successfully determines the critical traffic allocation ratio between the central office and the edge which achieves an over-provisioning ratio close to zero while still meeting the latency requirements. The results suggest optimal resource allocation ratios of 10:0, 1.5:8.5 and 7.8:2.2 for the eMBB, URLLC and mMTC applications, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that the computing resource behaves as a bottleneck for the eMBB and mMTC services, while the communication resource serves as a bottleneck for the URLLC service.},

The proposed scheme consists of two phases - fog node selection and task offloading. In the first phase, we formulate an integer linear program (ILP), and solve the problem to get optimal number of fog nodes required for a given network. In the task offloading phase, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize overall delay in task computation, while considering associated constraints. As finding optimal solution to the problem is NP-hard, we propose a greedy heuristic approach in two phases - task offloading and computed task downloading - to solve it in polynomial time. The greedy solution for offloading takes into account network delay, flow-rule capacity, and link utilization. On the other hand, the solution for computed task downloading considers vehicle&#39;s mobility in addition to the parameters associated with the offloading decisions. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme, Soft-VAN, is capable of enhancing the performance approximately by 30%, 45%, and 50% in terms of delay compared to state-of-the-art schemes - Detour, DAGP, and SD2O, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Forthcoming 5G New Radio (NR) systems will be asked to handle a huge number of devices accessing or delivering “resource-hungry” and high-quality services. In view of this, the new 5G Radio Access Technology (RAT) aims to support, in next releases, Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) to enable the simultaneous delivery of the same content to a set of users covered by different cells. According to MBSFN, all cells belonging to the same MBSFN Area are synchronized in time and the MBSFN transmission occurs over the same radio resources. In such a way, the same content flow is delivered by several cells to all the receivers in the MBSFN Area. A further means to enhance the network coverage and provide high data rate and low latency in future 5G-enabled MBSFN networks is Device-to-Device (D2D) connectivity. Along these lines, in this paper we propose a D2D-aided MBSFN Area Formation (D2D-MAF) algorithm to dynamically create MBSFN Areas with the aim to improve the system aggregate data rate while satisfying all user requests. The proposed D2D-MAF foresees that users could receive the service through either MBSFN, or D2D, or unicast transmissions. Performance evaluation results, carried out under a wide range of conditions, testify to the high effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

This paper deals with the performance evaluation of a MEC system providing computational capabilities to users within a limited area, according to the software as a service (SaaS) paradigm. In particular, a Markov multi-server queuing system model with requests reneging is proposed in order to accomplish the performance evaluation of the MEC system and derive the minimum number of processors to be allocated in order to fulfill specific service requirements in terms of resulting requests dropping probability. Finally, the pertinence of the proposed Markov queueing model is validated by comparing the obtained analytical predictions with numerical results derived by resorting to extensive computer simulations carried out under the assumption of realistic operating conditions.},

Distributed k-anonymity, as one of the most popular privacy protection methods, fails to take the trustworthiness of participants into account, resulting in malicious tracing of vehicles, which further leads to the sensitive information leakage, and even the safety threat of personal property. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain enabled trust-based location privacy protection scheme in VANET. Specifically, by analyzing the different requirements of the request vehicle and the cooperative vehicle during the process of constructing the anonymous cloaking region, as well as combining the characteristics of these two roles, we devise the trust management method based on Dirichlet distribution, such that both the requester and the cooperator will only cooperate with the vehicles they trust. Moreover, by employing blockchain, we also proposed the data structure to record the trustworthiness of vehicles on publicly available blocks timely, so that any vehicle can access the historical trust information of counterparties whenever necessary. Finally, the construction process of anonymous cloaking region is presented. Security analysis and extensive experiments indicate that the proposal is resilient to various trust model attacks, it can effectively detect the malicious vehicles, and preserve the location privacy of vehicles in the anonymous cloaking region construction, while the required time delay is limited.},

Unfortunately, in practice, the network topology may be irregular, which makes the estimated distances inaccurate. In this paper, by analyzing the distribution characteristics of nodes, we propose a novel scheme called Accurate Analytical-based Multi-hop Localization (AAML), which can greatly enhance estimation accuracy with requiring less communication and lower energy consumption. We first develop a new method that uses the common numbers of neighbors to estimate the distances between pairs of directly connected nodes during the network initialization phase. We then employ an optimal weighted matrix and hyperbolic estimation to reduce the effect of cumulative error. Finally, we utilize the weighted Taylor series to further improve the estimation accuracy; and utilize the geometric constraint to rectify the inaccurate estimated location, based on the relationship between the estimated locations and the anchor node locations. The proposed AAML method has been validated through analysis and experiments over different irregular networks and parameters, and AAML is demonstrated to be superior to existing methods in terms of estimated accuracy and energy consumption.

However, the CQI feedback messages induced by the adaptive multicast IPTV incur additional signaling overhead. Thus, a novel CQI feedback scheme was proposed in this paper to effectively decrease the amount of CQI feedback messages while preserving the system performance. Additionally, the CQI feedback rates of various CQI feedback schemes were theoretically analyzed based on the multi-dimensional Markovian model. Numerical results show that the proposed CQI feedback mechanism significantly reduces the CQI feedback rate without sacrificing the system performance and outperforms other existing CQI feedback schemes. Moreover, the analytical results almost coincide with simulation results, demonstrating that the theoretic analyses are accurate.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic network topology can pose important challenges to communication and control protocols in networks of autonomous vehicles. For instance, maintaining connectivity is a key challenge in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. However, tracking and computational resources of the observer module might not be sufficient for constant monitoring of all surrounding nodes in large-scale networks. In this article, we propose an optimal measurement policy for network topology monitoring under constrained resources. To this end, We formulate the localization of multiple objects in terms of linear networked systems and solve it using Kalman filtering with intermittent observation. The proposed policy includes two sequential steps. We first find optimal measurement attempt probabilities for each target using numerical optimization methods to assign the limited number of resources among targets. The optimal resource allocation follows a waterfall-like solution to assign more resources to targets with lower measurement success probability. This provides a 10% to 60% gain in prediction accuracy. The second step is finding optimal on-off patterns for measurement attempts for each target over time. We show that a regular measurement pattern that evenly distributed resources over time outperforms the two extreme cases of using all measurement resources either in the beginning or at the end of the measurement cycle. Our proof is based on characterizing the fixed-point solution of the error covariance matrix for regular patterns. Extensive simulation results confirm the optimality of the most alternating pattern with up to 10-fold prediction improvement for different scenarios. These two guidelines define a general policy for target tracking under constrained resources with applications to network topology prediction of autonomous systems.},

To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we analytically derive the exact-closed form expressions of the packet loss probability, the age of information and the update interval metric statistics considering both constant-rate and random energy arrival processes and taking into account both the time and energy costs of sensing, transmitting and estimating the channel state. We asymptotically obtain the necessary conditions under which estimating the channel state before transmitting, despite the associated time and energy costs, allow to efficiently manage the harvested energy by avoiding erroneous transmissions and performs strictly better than transmitting without estimating the channel state. Numerical results demonstrate that in most cases, estimating the channel state before transmitting significantly reduces the packet loss probability, the age of information and the update interval of node-sink transmission.},

  abstract     = {The key idea of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is to serve multiple users in the same frequency band to improve the spectral efficiency. Whereas a security flaw emerges in the presence of untrusted users or low security clearance users who can access the messages of trusted users due to the spectrum sharing and may work as eavesdroppers. To achieve reliable and secure communications of NOMA systems under untrusted users, we in this paper propose two relay selection (RS) schemes termed decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols based optimal relay selection (i.e., DORS and AORS) schemes, respectively. To explicitly reveal the benefits of the DORS and AORS schemes, we derive the exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and positive secrecy capacity probability (PSCP) achieved by the two schemes, and analyze the optimality of the two schemes. Analysis and simulation results indicate that both the DORS and AORS schemes significantly outperform the benchmark schemes, in addition to achieving the same SOP and desirable PSCP at high SNR.},

For path planning subproblem, the optimal visiting order is obtained by using the dual method and the trajectory is optimized via the successive convex approximation technique.

Assuming that accurate legitimate channel information and statistical illegitimate channel information are available with an independent transmitter side and a highly correlated receiver side, we propose a correlation-based cooperative jamming approach to reduce the secrecy loss due to receiver-side correlation. In particular, the correlation is considered to be a resource for acquiring more knowledge about illegitimate channels, based on which the statistical distribution of illegitimate channels is described more precisely. Then, the power of artificial noise in the null space of the legitimate channel from the jammer to the destination is placed more reasonably rather than as a simple uniform distribution. Additionally, a correlation-based beamformer is designed for transmitting the information-bearing signal. Finally, the achievable secrecy rate under a secrecy outage constraint is computed. The numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme achieves a performance improvement in terms of secrecy rate under a secrecy outage constraint when the receiver side is highly correlated.},

Most prior work on windowing assume additional extensions reserved for windowing, which does not comply with standards. Whether windowing should be applied at the transmitter or the receiver was not questioned. In this work, we propose two independent algorithms that are implemented at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. These algorithms estimate the transmitter and receiver windowing duration of each resource element (RE) with an aim to improve fair proportional network throughput. While doing so, we solely utilize the available extension that was defined in the standard and present standard-compliant algorithms that also do not require any modifications on the counterparts or control signaling. Furthermore, computationally efficient techniques to apply per-RE transmitter and receiver windowing to signals synthesized and analyzed using conventional cyclic prefix-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing are derived and their computational complexities are analyzed. The spectrotemporal relations between optimum window durations at either side, as well as functions of the excess signal-to-noise ratios, the subcarrier spacings and the throughput gains provided over previous similar techniques are numerically verified.},

Due to the doubly selective nature of wireless channels, OFDMA based wireless systems are vulnerable to inter-carrier interference (ICI). The proposed speed adaptive power allocation can combat ICI to a great extent compared to the non-adaptive power allocation schemes. Moreover, the proposed JSPA ensures a critical issue of fairness in QoE among users.

The energy-constrained relay exploits a power splitting (PS) protocol to simultaneously harvest energy and decode information from the received signal from the source, and then forwards the confidential signal to the full-duplex (FD) destination while it simultaneously transmits artificial noise (AN) to confuse the passive eavesdropper. This robust beamforming design is developed by maximizing the secrecy rate under the constraints of energy harvesting (EH) requirement at the relay and AN transmit power at the destination. Specifically, we formulate the joint relay beamforming and PS ratio as well as the AN power optimization as a non-convex quadratically-constrained problem. In order to circumvent this non-convexity issue, we decompose the original problem into three subproblems which can be determined by the proposed semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex optimization methods. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal solutions of each subproblem. Finally, the original non-convex problem can be solved through a convergence guaranteed iterative algorithm. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed robust design compared with the benchmark schemes.},

While existing distributed schemes requires frequent information exchange among D2D users and cannot achieve global optimization. In this paper, a distributed spectrum allocation framework based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is proposed, named multi-agent actor critic (MAAC). MAAC shares global historical states, actions and policies during centralized training, requires no signal interaction during execution and utilizes cooperation among users to further optimize system performance.

Spatial parameters of the mmWave propagation channel, especially angle distributions of multi-path components are vital in assessing the loss in achievable capacity due to imperfect beam alignment in such systems. In this paper, we present a tractable approach to quantify the achievable SE of beamformed Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) links in mmWave fading channels with intra-cluster angular spread. We derive the expression for achievable SE of a point-to-point mmWave NLoS link after accounting for random beam misalignment errors at the transmitter as well as receiver end. Using analytic approximations, we consider the impact of antenna beam pattern parameters, and use a comprehensive mmWave channel model for performance evaluation. The analysis provides realistic bounds on achievable SE since the intra-cluster angular spread of rays at both ends is taken into account. We provide insights into the interplay between antenna half power beam width, the degree of misalignment, channel fading coefficient, channel coherence parameter and the angular spread of rays to demonstrate the decisive impact of intra-cluster spread on the performance of mmWave point-to-point NLoS links.},

An EH-based single antenna source sends information to a single-antenna destination via a cooperative half-duplex multi-antenna relay, wherein the relay applies power splitting (PS) technique for obtaining energy to forward information to the destination. It is also assumed that, the receiving nodes are subject to a peak temperature constraint. Two transmission scenarios are considered; Single time slot, and multiple ones. For both scenarios, achievable rate/throughput of the system is derived and optimal resource allocations, i.e. transmission powers of the source and the relay and the optimal PS ratios at the relay, are obtained. First the multiple time slots scenario is presented, and non-convexity of the optimization problem is tackled by proposing an iterative algorithm based on closed form expressions. Then, for the single time slot one, globally optimal resource allocations are obtained. For both scenarios, some special cases are considered to better reflect the performance characteristics of the system. Finally, numerical results are presented to highlight the effect of optimal resource allocation on system performance.},

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is an effective way to improve the spectrum efficiency of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where this advancement can be fully exploited by employing a proper user selection strategy in the multiuser MIMO system. However, for multiuser scenarios, information-theoretic throughput may not be properly used as the performance indicator since the constraints at the receiver (e.g., suboptimal detectors) are not taken into consideration. In this paper, we adopt the error probability (EP) as the performance metric, which is equivalent to the practical throughput efficiency and can take the critical constraints into consideration. We analyze the pair-wise error probability (PEP) performance of different detectors and propose two kinds of user selection methods to minimize the PEP. To facilitate the detection performance evaluation, we further investigate the multiuser diversity of the proposed selection methods and derive a tight lower PEP bound for the case with randomly selected users. From the analytical and numerical results, we demonstrate that the proposed multiuser selection methods can suppress the inter-user interference effectively and achieve better performance than that of the state-of-the-art method.},

In the CTSN, the satellite and terrestrial base stations are connected to a cloud-computing based centralized processor (CP), where joint user scheduling and multicast beamforming are performed based on realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI). Specifically, pilot-assisted channel estimation is assumed. Then, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm for generating the beamforming vectors at the CP, where specific quality of service (QoS) constraints are considered. In the proposed algorithm, the beamforming vectors are obtained by iteratively solving a convex optimization problem subject to tight convex constraints. We demonstrate that feasible solutions can be obtained by our algorithm, even for the case when the system&#39;s dimension is large. Both analytical and numerical results are provided for characterizing the performance of the CTSN. Our results qualify the tradeoff between the cooperation-aided multiantenna gain and the pilot overhead imposed by training the beamformers.

Thanks to this low-complexity channel estimation, EGC introduces itself as a competitor to MRC. Low-complexity channel estimation techniques are of interest for numerous small battery-operated nodes which are expected to be present in the platform of 5G. We derive the probability distribution of SNR at the output of EGC combiner, the outage probability and the Symbol Error Rate (SER) for the class of phase modulations.

Especially, in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) where energy consumption of sensors in data transmission is the most conspicuous feature, data collection by UAV provides a promising solution. To address this issue, we consider a UAV-enabled WSN, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from sensors distributed in networks. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the minimum residual energy of sensors after data transmission for energy-efficient UAV routing subject to data collection and UAV traveling distance constraints. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we first derive a feasible solution, i.e., the shortest UAV route that guarantees data collection at all the sensors, where a Voronoi diagram is modified to find a set of UAV hovering locations. The proposed algorithm preferentially determines each UAV hovering location at Voronoi vertex so that UAV can collect data from as many adjacent sensors as possible. Then with an initial shortest UAV route, a UAV route is proposed by adjusting each UAV hovering location sequentially based on sensor energy status, which is easily accomplished by the properties of Voronoi diagram. Lastly, to find the proposed solution more quickly, we propose a sensor-energy based initial UAV route determination method. Simulation results are provided to validate the performance of our proposed algorithm, and to compare with other UAV route determination schemes.},

Inspired by the tensor technique in signal processing and machine learning, we reformulate the desired waveforms as a higher-order tensors, of which the modes correspond to various modulation parameters such as coding chips, frequency and antennas. Beside the waveform design model, we further propose a new semi-blind receiver for the new model. Due the uniqueness of the applied tensor decomposition, we proved that the proposed receiver can jointly estimate the user symbols and channel state information without the aid of pilot sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in various communication scenes and outperforms the baseline systems. approximately 3 dB compared with the ideal receiver.},

An I-shape configuration is employed for the resonant unit cell structure, featuring high compatibility with DC bias voltage network. In addition, double-sided FSS is employed on the top and bottom faces for polarization-selective beamforming. The FSS comprise of a dielectric with near zero thickness (λ/250 of 2.40 GHz) resulting in intentionally high mutual coupling between the layers. The devised unit cell is designed using an equivalent circuit model analysis and optimized using finite element solver, achieving over 30 dB impedance switching. The proposed unit cell is experimentally confirmed in both vertical and horizontal polarizations. By configuring the DC voltage bias lines, the unit cells of the FSS are transformed into electrically-driven impedance zones formulating alternating and repetitive gratings.

  abstract     = {Network function virtualization (NFV) has emerged as a new technology to reduce the cost of hardware deployment. It is an architecture that using virtualized functions run on the virtual machine to achieve services instead of using specific hardware. Although NFV brings more opportunities to enhance the flexibility and efficiency of the network, resource allocation problems should be well taken into consideration. In this paper, we investigate the virtual network function (VNF) resource allocation problem to minimize the network operation cost for different services. Both setting the VNF instances for each virtual machine and allocating the traffic volume in the network are considered. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. Although it can be solved in a centralized fashion which requires a central controller to collect information from all virtual machines, it is not practical for large-scale networks. Thus, we propose a distributed iteration algorithm to achieve the optimal solution. The proposed algorithm framework is developed based on the joint Benders decomposition and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which allows us to deal with integer variables and decompose the original problem into multiple subproblems for each virtual machine. Furthermore, we describe the detail implementation of our algorithm to run on a computer cluster using the Hadoop MapReduce software framework.

  abstract     = {Wi-Fi fingerprinting is widely used in indoor localization due to the ubiquitous availability of Wi-Fi infrastructure in indoor environments. The basic assumption of fingerprinting localization is that the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) distance is consistent with the location distance. However, due to the fluctuation of Wi-Fi signals in indoor environments, the nearest neighbors selected using the RSSI distance may not be those whose corresponding locations are nearest to the target, which could lead to a large localization error. In this paper, we propose a novel fingerprinting method for indoor localization by transforming raw RSSI into features with a learned non-linear mapping function. To learn such mapping function, we design a triple loss function that measures the difference between the rank of RSSI distance and that of location distance. By minimizing the loss function iteratively, we can learn the non-linear mapping function with the gradient boosting regression forest (GBRF) method. Experiments have been conducted in a complex environment and experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

The proposed system exploits the superposition coding principle on the reference signal and the information-bearing signal to achieve multi-user simultaneous information transmission for the downlink scenario, thus significantly improving the energy efficiency and transmission rate. Furthermore, the analytical expression for the error performance and the throughput of the proposed system are precisely derived over additive white Gaussian noise and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation results not only verify the accuracy of the analytical method but also illustrate the proposed transmission scheme in achieving significant performance gain compared with the time-sharing-based PPM-DCSK and multiresolution DCSK systems.

According to the relationship between the QoS and MMF problems, we only focus on the transmit covariance optimizations under the latter criterion. We show that when the uniform linear array is equipped at the BS, the eigenvectors of the optimal transmit covariance are given by columns of the discrete Fourier transform matrix, which reveals the optimality of the beam domain transmission in massive MIMO multicasting. A dual algorithm together with stochastic programming is proposed to specify the eigenvalues of the transmit covariance. To reduce the complexity involved in stochastic programming, we further formulate two simplified MMF problems by using the deterministic equivalents and upper bound to approximate the ergodic achievable rate, respectively. We show that the optimality of the beam domain transmission still holds for the two simplified MMF problems. Then we present two low-complexity transmit designs.

  abstract     = {Considering the high cost and complexity of multiple-channel blind source separation, single-channel solutions have elicited a significant amount of interest in source separation. Joint maximum likelihood sequence estimation implemented by the Viterbi algorithm (VA) is a seemingly ultimate solution to the problem of data transmission over dispersive channels. However, both joint reduced-state sequence estimation (JRSSE) and joint delayed-decision feedback sequence estimation (JDDFSE) have numerous shortcomings when applied to single-channel blind signal separation. Hence, joint double-direction DDFSE (JDD-DDFSE) is proposed in this article. JDD-DDFSE employs joint VA (JVA) of the low-order channel twice. The estimated symbols from the initial JVA are utilized to equalize the causal and non-causal taps of the channel beyond the trellis state in the second JVA. A method that can derive the log likelihood ratio of the estimated symbols is provided; the complexity of this method is considerably lower than that of soft-output VA or the BCJR algorithm. Hence, the entire computation complexity of the iterative separation structure basically remains unchanged compared with that of the no-iteration structure. For the non-causal channel, the proposed algorithm has the lowest computation complexity and demonstrates a separation performance similar to that of conventional JVA, JRSSE, and JDDFSE algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a technical hotspot in physical layer with numerous applications in wireless communications, radars, sonars, and well beyond. In this paper, we focus on the multi-dimensional angle estimation problem in a bistatic electromagnetic vector sensors (EMVS) MIMO system. Namely, we need to simultaneously estimate two-dimensional (2D) direction-of-arrival (DOA), 2D direction-of-departure (DOD), 2D receive polarization angle (RPA) and 2D transmit polarization angle (TPA). To tackle this issue, a parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis-based estimator is proposed. Firstly, a third-order PARAFAC analysis data model is established, which can efficiently exploit the tensor structure of the array measurement. After performing PARAFAC decomposition on the tensor measurement, the factor matrices are achieved. By combining the estimation method of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT) with the vector cross-product method, joint estimates of 2D-DOD, 2D-DOA, 2D-TPA and 2D-RPA are obtained without further pairing calculation. Compared with the state-of-the-art ESPRIT-Like approach, the proposed method can achieve better performance by enforcing the third-order structure information, and it is suitable for arbitrary array manifolds. Theoretical analyses are given and numerical results corroborate our analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new beam allocation strategy aiming to maximize the average successful tracking probability (ASTP) of a single user time-varying millimeter-wave MIMO system. In contrast to most existing works that employ one transmitting-receiving (Tx-Rx) beam pair once only, we investigate a more general framework, where the Tx-Rx beam pairs are allowed to be used repeatedly in each beam training period to improve the received signal powers in specific directions. In the case of orthogonal Tx-Rx beam pairs, a power-based estimator is employed to track the time-varying AoA and AoD of the channel, and the resulting training beam pair sequence design problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear programming (I-NLP) problem. By dividing the feasible region into a set of subregions, the formulated I-NLP is decomposed into a series of concave sub I-NLPs, which can be solved by recursively invoking a nonlinear branch-and-bound algorithm. To reduce the computational cost, we relax the integer constraints of each sub I-NLP and obtain a low-complexity solution via solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of their relaxed problems. For the case when the Tx-Rx beam pairs are overlapped in the angular space, we estimate the updated AoA and AoD via an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Moreover, since no explicit expression for the ASTP exists for the OMP-based estimator, we derive a closed-form lower bound of the ASTP, based on which a favorable beam pair allocation strategy can be obtained. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed beam allocation strategy over existing benchmarks.},

This paper proposes an MEC-assisted computing and relaying scheme to enhance the throughput of uncompressed data for mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) communications. We assume that the target data has a dynamic compression rate during the transmission from one mobile device to another through a relay node with MEC. In order to obtain the optimal transmission and compression strategy for the mobile devices and the relay node, a cost function that defines the tradeoff between energy consumption and latency time is investigated first. Then a closed-form solution is derived by minimizing the cost function with respect to practical constraints. Compared with conventional P2P communications without MEC, the proposed model breaks the bottleneck of P2P communications by decoupling the data compression rates at the two sides of MEC server. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

However, most of these studies addressed the clustering problem using conventional performance metrics while spectrum shortage, and the combination of spectrum trading and VANET architecture have not been tackled so far. Thus, this paper presents a new fuzzy logic based clustering control scheme to support scalability, enhance the stability of the network topology, motivate spectrum owners to share spectrum and provide efficient and cost-effective use of spectrum. Unlike existing studies, our context-aware scheme is based on multi-criteria decision making where fuzzy logic is adopted to rank the multi-attribute candidate nodes for optimizing the selection of cluster heads (CH)s. Criteria related to each candidate node include: received signal strength, speed of vehicle, vehicle location, spectrum price, reachability, and stability of node. Our model performs efficiently, exhibits faster recovery in response to topology changes and enhances the network efficiency life time.},

We study the end-to-end cooperative throughput maximization problem by optimizing the UAV&#39;s decision profile, power profile and trajectory for both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols. The problem is decomposed into three optimization subproblems for decision profile, power profile and trajectory, and solved through alternating optimization, by which each of the subproblems is solved with the other two fixed. A binarization algorithm is further proposed to make the decision profile feasible. We show that the proposed solution outperforms not only two SWIPT-based strategies, but also a similar solution from an existing work without consideration for SWIPT. In addition, results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs efficiently in both optimality and convergence.},

Because the decoding procedure of LD codes traditionally requires the entire code to be received and decoded simultaneously, complexity increases proportional to the square of the MIMO array size. In this paper, we leverage the increased number of spatial and temporal layers at the decoder to dynamically reduce the complexity of a BLAST optimum ordering and successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector based on the instantaneous system capacity and data rate. The novel approach proposed in this paper is channel code and modulation agnostic, meaning the underlying constellation can be HEX or QAM and there is no feedback from a forward error correction (FEC) decoder, which makes the design useful in a wide range of MIMO systems employing LD codes with linear detectors. We investigate the method&#39;s bit error rate (BER) using MIMO dimensions up to 8 × 8 and bits per channel use (BPCU) up to 32. We analyze the system&#39;s run-time complexity and BER performance in software and implement perfect coding along with the novel method presented here in a custom MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system and test it over-the-air using an Ettus Research X310 software-defined radio (SDR) testbed.},

A method realizing mutual inductance and load identification without affecting load operation is proposed in this paper. Two inverters and two matching transformers are applied in transmitting side. One is called main inverter operating in resonant state and another is called auxiliary inverter in non resonant state. Two matching transformers are connected in series. The operating state of the system can be divided into mode 1 and mode 2 according to the non-operation or operation of the auxiliary inverter. Theoretical derivation shows that the transmitting coil current peak is enveloped when system operates in mode 2. Then the mutual inductance and load parameter can be determined according to the maximum and minimum values of the envelope. By designing the operating frequency of the auxiliary inverter and its current, the load voltage of mode 2 is basically the same as that of mode 1. The identification of mutual inductance and load are carried out under different condition. The results show that proposed method of the mutual inductance and load identification is feasible without affecting the load operation and the identification errors of mutual inductance and load are less than 6%.},

In this paper, a new efficient mode transition control method with adaptive dual-loop control framework is proposed for the clutch engagement in a parallel HEV. Firstly, the expected clutch engaging speed can be calculated by two approaches, optimization method via particle swarm optimization algorithm, and practical method by compromising the transient vehicle jerk and the clutch slipping power, respectively. Utilizing the integral transformation, the demand clutch position trajectory for the inner loop can be obtained. Considering the uncertainties and the backlash in the clutch actuator system, an adaptive state feedback controller is designed in the inner loop. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control method can effectively improve the HEV drivability while taking clutch actuator uncertainties into consideration. Furthermore, compared with the control method commonly used in practice, the time of mode transition process can be shortened and vehicle jerk can be controlled within an acceptable range using the proposed method.},

Extensive research has shown that good performance can be obtained on public datasets by various state-of-the-art approaches, especially the deep learning methods. However, those methods are mostly two-stage approaches which inevitably require extensive computing resources and are hard to be deployed on an embedded computing platform with real-time computing performance. We introduce a single-stage vehicle detector which can work in real-time on NVIDIA DrivePX2 platform. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. We propose a detection scheme which includes multi-scale features and multi-anchor boxes to improve the accuracy of a single-stage detector. Secondly, a new data augmentation strategy is proposed to systematically generate a lot of vehicle training images whose appearances are randomly truncated, so our detector is trained to detect partially-seen vehicles better. Thirdly, we present a multi-stage image-based online hard example mining (MSI-OHEM) framework specifically designed for single-stage detectors. MSI-OHEM performs fine-tuning on hard examples and the ones with slightly-insufficient IOU that are considered true positives. Compared to other classical object detectors, the proposed detector achieves very competitive result in terms of average precision (AP) and computational speed. For the newly-defined vehicle class (car+bus) on VOC2007 test, our detector, using MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, Inception-v2 and ResNet-50 as basenets, achieves 85.35%/85.62%/86.49%/87.81% AP and runs at 64/58/48/28 FPS on NVIDIA DrivePX2, respectively.},

Drift and misalignment of the constructed map are corrected using ICP under the assumption that the vehicle continuously travels the same track. The final map is obtained using SGD optimization, which enforces curvature matching.

The CAN bus does not implement a security protocol that can protect the vehicle against the increasing cyber and physical attacks. To address this risk, we introduce a novel algorithm to extract the real-time model parameters of the CAN bus and develop SAIDuCANT, a specification-based intrusion detection system (IDS) using anomaly-based supervised learning with the real-time model as input. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAIDuCANT with real CAN logs collected from two passenger cars and on an open-source CAN dataset collected from real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that SAIDuCANT can effectively detect data injection attacks with low false positive rates. Over four real attack scenarios from the open-source dataset, SAIDuCANT observes at most one false positive before detecting an attack whereas other detection approaches using CAN timing features detect on average more than a hundred false positives before a real attack occurs.},

  abstract     = {The fuel economy of hybrid electric vehicles is very closely associated with the energy management strategy (EMS). In this paper, a practicality-oriented adaptive EMS for a parallel hybrid electric bus is presented, which combines the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). Considering the regular and fixed route of the city bus, the optimal control trajectories can be attained by the dynamic programming in advance. Using the rolling optimization method, a group of optimal equivalent factors is extracted from aforementioned control trajectories and used as the training samples. Then, a trained ANFIS model that produces the optimal equivalent factor online is constructed, showcasing striking superiority in self-learning and inference. By applying the derived equivalent factor in the framework of the ECMS, an adaptive energy management controller is available to achieve desirable power distribution online. Finally, the simulation and hardware in the loop (HIL) tests are used to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the controller. The results demonstrate that, compared with other strategies, the fuel economy with the proposed strategy can be effectively improved.},

Different dual-stator designs are investigated and compared against each other in terms of the performance and manufacturability. Comparison between the proposed dual-stator 6/4 FPSM machine and a commonly seen 12/10 FSPM machine is done at 10 kW, 15000 rpm condition. Due to the 60% reduction of the fundamental frequency, a significant reduction in iron loss and magnet eddy current loss is observed, which leads to higher efficiency. A prototype dual-stator 6/4 FSPM motor is built and tested on a dynamometer set up to verify the analytical calculation and finite element analysis results. A comparison is made between measured data and simulation results, and good agreements are achieved.},

  abstract     = {In battery-electric vehicles, an accurate knowledge of the current state of charge (SOC) of the battery is crucial for safe and efficient operation. Offset-free SOC estimation for Lithium-ion batteries (LIB) during operation still is a challenging problem, due to the uncertain output nonlinearity present in battery models. In battery management systems employed in such vehicles, the age- and cycle-dependent relationship between the open circuit voltage (OCV) and the state of charge of each cell (SOC) can be kept track of using lookup tables. Between the scattered data points, linear interpolation is often used. Another common approach is to switch between models, each with a different piecewise polynomial fit of low order. In this contribution, a single polynomial fit of a higher order with state-dependent coefficients for the whole SOC-OCV range is proposed, so as to avoid switching and facilitate usage of Taylor-based linearization algorithms like in the extended Kalman filter. While the polynomial order is high, the number of parameters is only three; the parameters are estimated and updated by the Kalman filter itself. This augmentation of the observer&#39;s state vector with said polynomial parameters is inspired by the idea of an increased “stochastization,” introducing redundancy that aids to achieve a more accurate SOC estimation. In this sense, the algorithm can be described as a model-adaptive extended Kalman estimator. Two variants of a polynomial EKF are investigated: polynomial EKF with output and with state nonlinearity models. Their performances are compared in real experiments using a dedicated test bench based on a Samsung ICR18650-26F cell, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithms. The variant that includes the terminal voltage in the state vector, i.e. the state nonlinearity variant of the EKF, shows better result, also compared to the existing literature.},

Then, a simple damping resistor connected on one part in parallel and the other part can be integrated into the transformer. Using damping split inductor, significant regulation improvements could be achieved under light-load conditions with not any change in control strategy and almost zero hardware cost. In addition, based on impedance analysis of the resonant tank, the effects of the proposed method are analyzed including voltage gain, soft switching characteristics, suppression of high frequency interference components, and system power loss. Moreover, the detailed design process and optimization conditions of the damping split inductor parameters are carefully illustrated. Eventually, the experimental results demonstrate the characteristics mentioned above for the 96 W prototype at the expense of a maximum increase in device loss of 0.85 W.},

  abstract     = {Despite the increased interest in battery electric vehicles (BEV), limited range abilities unsettle customers, which is often related to range anxiety. A better understanding of energy consumption and the possibility to accurately predict the remaining battery energy along an upcoming route may help to reduce this stress perception by means of advanced in-vehicle information systems. Addressing the trend towards vehicles with on-board cloud communication and information systems, the present research focuses on electric powertrain consumption and speed profile forecasts. A meaningful prediction of a speed profile for a given route is a basic prerequisite for an accurate consumption forecast. This study proposes a methodology to derive such a speed profile from real-time traffic data obtained from HERE Technologies while considering individual driving style characteristics. Given the predicted speed profile, a detailed BEV consumption model which accounts for BEV specific energy management strategies and environmental factors is used to obtain a consumption forecast. Prediction uncertainties are analyzed and parameter sensitivities with respect to energy consumption are derived as a function of the route dependent mean vehicle speed. Within a field study with Mercedes Benz EQC experimental vehicles, covering thirty-two test cycles, it is shown that the proposed methodology can accurately predict energy consumption for long look-ahead horizons and significantly reduces the variance in prediction compared to a typical baseline strategy.},

Such control action alters the load transfer distribution, which in turn provokes a lateral tire force variation. With respect to the extensive set of papers from the literature discussing yaw rate tracking through active suspension control, this study presents: i) A detailed analysis of the effect of the load transfer on the lateral axle force and cornering stiffness; ii) A novel linearized single-track vehicle model formulation for control system design, based on the results in i); and iii) An optimization-based routine for the design of the non-linear feedforward contribution of the control action. The resulting feedforward-feedback controller is assessed through: a) Simulations with an experimentally validated model of a vehicle with active anti-roll bars (case study 1); and b) Experimental tests on a vehicle prototype with an active suspension system (case study 2).},

Most researchers have employed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms wherein each agent shares a holistic traffic state and cooperates with other agents to reach a common goal. However, MARL algorithms cannot guarantee a global optimal solution unless the actions of all agents are fully coordinated. The present study employs a RL algorithm that recognizes an entire traffic state and jointly controls all the traffic signals of multiple intersections. With this approach, a deep Q-network (DQN) that depends solely on traffic images is extended to overcome the curse of dimensionality that is associated with a large state and action space. Several front layers in a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to approximate the true Q-function are shared by each intersection approach. Weight parameters connecting the last hidden layer to the output layer are fixed. The proposed methodology outperforms a fixed-signal operation, a fully actuated signal operation, a multi-agent RL control without coordination, and a multi-agent RL control with partial coordination.},

Distributed acoustic signals from an arbitrary point can be detected and located through DAS technology which can provide fully distributed acoustic information along the entire fiber link. This technology utilizes sensing fiber in the form of distributed sensors to collect traffic vibration signals and then extracts several features from the signals to estimate the vehicle count and identify vehicle categories. According to the vehicle vibration signal characteristics, the wavelet-denoising algorithm and dual-threshold algorithm are improved. The improved algorithm is used to reconstruct the signal for feature extraction, and the vehicle count and speed are obtained. When all features have been extracted, the classification of vehicle types is implemented by a support vector machine classifier.

  abstract     = {Motion prediction for the leading vehicle is a critical task for connected autonomous vehicles. It provides a method to model the leading-following vehicle behavior and analysis their interactions. In this study, a joint time-series modeling approach for leading vehicle trajectory prediction considering different driving styles is proposed. The proposed method enables a precise and personalized trajectory prediction for the leading vehicle based on limited inter-vehicle communication signals, such as the vehicle speed and acceleration of the front vehicles. Three different driving styles are first recognized based on an unsupervised clustering algorithm, namely, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The GMM generates a specific driving style for each vehicle based on the speed, acceleration, jerk, time, and space headway features of the leading vehicle. The feature importance of driving style recognition is also evaluated based on the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) algorithm. Then, a personalized joint time series modeling (JTSM) method based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network model (RNN) is proposed to predict the front vehicle trajectories. The JTSM contains a common LSTM layer and different fully connected regression layers for different driving styles. The proposed method is tested with the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data on the US101, and I-80 highway dataset. The JTSM is tested for making predictions one to five seconds ahead. Results indicate that the proposed personalized JTSM approach shows a significant advantage over the baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multi-robot navigation is a challenging task, especially for many robots, since individual gains may more often than not adversely affect the global gain. This paper investigates the problem of multiple robots moving towards individual goals within a common workspace whereas the motion of every individual robot is deduced by a novel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) tuned Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN). Motion coordination among the robots is implemented using a cooperative coordination algorithm that identifies critical robots and maintains cooperation count while actuating deviation in select robots. The contribution of this paper is twofold; firstly in hybridizing the Artificial Neural Network(ANN) by employing PSO, an evolutionary algorithm, to find optimal values of deviation for every critical robot using velocity and acceleration constraints, secondly ensuing the convergence of the PSO by carrying first and second order stability analysis. Experiments have been carried out to evaluate and validate the efficacy of the proposed coordination schemes by changing the number of robots under hundred different scenarios each, and the founded results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed schemes.},

Thanks to widely equipped sensors in high-speed trains and the technical development of advanced data analysis techniques, real-time fault detection (FD) using only online data is an inevitable trend to improve safety and reliability of high-speed trains. In this paper, an edge computing-aided FD framework for traction systems in high-speed trains is proposed; the superior advantages include: 1) its implementation can be easily carried out without system information such as accurate mathematical models of traction systems; 2) it has the well-deserved expansibility without being redesigned for the control structure of traction systems; 3) it nearly does not occupy resource of traction control units, and it does not overburden the information transmission systems. This highly intelligent FD framework using edge computing is firstly speculated in details, and its core theory is then applied to a dSPACE platform of high-speed trains for verification.},

The key technique is optimization in a collision-free lane-changing trajectory cluster. To achieve this cluster, a tuning factor is first derived by optimizing a cubic polynomial. Then, a feasible trajectory cluster is generated by adjusting the tuning factor in a stable handling envelope defined from vehicle dynamics limits. Furthermore, considering the motions of surrounding vehicles, a collision avoidance algorithm is employed in the feasible cluster to select the collision-free trajectory cluster. To extract the optimal trajectory from this cluster, the TOPSIS algorithm is utilized to solve a multiobjective optimization problem that is subject to lane change performance indices, i.e., trajectory following, comfort, lateral slip and lane-changing efficiency. In this way, the collision risk is eliminated, and the lane change performance is improved. Simulation results show that the strategy is able to plan suitable lane-changing trajectories while avoiding collisions in complex environments.},

  abstract     = {The Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) applications have been proposed in recent years, targeting a round-trip end-to-end latency less than 1 ms with high reliability. Therefore, an order of magnitude improvements are needed in all layers of the wireless communication stack. This is a particular challenge for the physical layer, where typically a processing time of the order of microseconds is required for the computationally intensive demodulation and error correction processing, among other operations. Conventionally, the reception of signals, the demodulation processing and the error correction processing are performed consecutively at the receiver. However, this approach is associated with processing times on the order of hundreds of microseconds, preventing URLLC. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel processing architecture, which is capable of performing reception, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) demodulation and turbo decoding concurrently, rather than consecutively, hence significantly reducing the processing time. In order to achieve concurrent operation, the OFDM demodulation is performed using a novel cumulative Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which produces successively more reliable estimates of all transmitted symbols in each successive clock cycle. At the same time, a Fully-Parallel Turbo Decoder (FPTD) is used to recover successively more reliable estimates of all bits in each successive clock cycle.},

DNN MIMO detectors are then proposed based on modified MPDs including damped belief propagation (BP), max-sum (MS) BP, and simplified channel hardening-exploiting message passing (CHEMP). The correction factors are optimized via deep learning for better performance. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art (SOA) detectors including minimum mean-squared error (MMSE), BP, and CHEMP, the proposed DNN detectors can achieve better bit-error-rate (BER) and improve robustness against various antenna and channel conditions with similar complexity. The DNN is required to be trained only once and can be reused for multiple detections, which assures its high efficiency. The corresponding hardware architecture is also proposed. Implementation results with 65 nm CMOS technology approve the efficiency and flexibility of the proposed DNN framework.},

Besides the main decoding algorithms like successive cancellation (SC) decoding and CRC-aid SC list (CA-SCL) decoding, sphere decoder (SD) and list SD (LSD) are the alternatives for short codes with less required memory bits. Existing SD and LSD attain high calculation complexity, for SD requires a back-tracking process and LSD needs a large list size L to achieve satisfying performance. To reduce complexity, an efficient software stack sphere decoder (ESSD) based on the synchronous determination is firstly proposed in this article. With the dynamic set-by-set decoding in the stack structure, it achieves the lowest complexity in SD-based decoders (SD/LSD/ESSD) while sharing the same performance on low-rate codes and high-rate codes. Compared with the CA-SCL decoder, the complexity and latency of the proposed ESSD are also competitive at high signal-to-noise-ratio on the displayed codes. Implemented on C++, the proposed ESSD reduces 44.77% latency compared with CA-SCL-32 for P(128, 120) at the BER of 10 -5 with E b /N 0 = 7 dB.},

  abstract     = {Compressed sensing (CS) is becoming a hot topic in recent years for its advantages such as low-power consumption, low memory requirement, and low sampling frequency. However, high-dimensional nonlinear signals will inevitably introduce notable complexity and low efficiency in signal recovery. Generalized turbo signal recovery (G-Turbo-SR) is a cutting-edge method, which efficiently reduces complexity with a partial discrete Fourier transform (DFT) sensing matrix. However, in practical applications, G-Turbo-SR still suffers from high complexity for probability computations and matrix multiplications. This article optimizes the algorithm of G-Turbo-SR in scheduling to reduce the matrix multiplications by half. High-precision numerical approximation method is proposed to replace the complex integral calculation, which efficiently reduces the hardware cost with acceptable performance degradation. Based on the data-flow graph (DFG) analysis, detailed hardware architecture is proposed with module designs. Proper quantization scheme is selected according to the mean square error (MSE) performance. Pipelining, folding, and variable precision quantization (VPQ) scheme are employed for higher hardware efficiency. FPGA implementation on Xilinx 7k325tffg900-2 shows a higher throughput and hardware efficiency compared to existing recovery methods for CS.},

We quantify the impact of the car blockage and study the alternative propagation paths, which can be used for establishing a data link. Based on the obtained results, we report that besides the low-loss (3.4 dB) reflection from the wall, a radio link through the blocking car may potentially be established for data sharing. Specifically, the attenuation through clear windows is 2 dB, while the attenuation caused by sun protective film is 15 dB. Diffraction over the car and propagation in foliage reduce the multipath power drastically by 21-24 dB and 16-19 dB, respectively, and cannot be associated with reliable links. Finally, measurement results were compared with the ray-based simulation data, which demonstrate agreement to within ± 4.3 dB of measured losses.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications have recently drawn great attention. To analyze and optimize the UAV communication systems, accurate and efficient UAV channel models are essential. Most existing UAV channel models are based on the assumption that both transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) have fixed velocity and moving direction. However, in the realistic communication scenarios, the Tx and Rx of UAV may experience changes in both speeds and trajectories. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) is proposed for air-to-air (A2A) channels in UAV communication scenarios. A 3D Markov mobility model is used to characterize the movements of the UAV in both horizontal and vertical directions. The mobility model enables to adjust the degree of mobility randomness and covers different UAV mobility trajectories, which makes it more realistic and suitable for simulating various scenarios. In addition, some important statistical properties such as time-frequency correlation function and Doppler power spectrum are derived and analyzed. The numerical results show that the impact of vertical movement of the UAV on the time correlation function under constant-speed is larger than that of horizontal movement, however, the above phenomenon is mitigated and the non-stationarity properties of the channel are significantly affected when randomness of the mobility model is introduced. Furthermore, it is found that the movement properties of the UAV only lead to non-stationarity in the time domain. The results are useful for A2A non-stationary channel simulation and UAV communication system evaluation.},

With the growth of the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) service, the need for vehicular communication testing is expected to increase significantly. The so-called multi-probe anechoic chamber (MPAC) setup is standardized for MIMO OTA testing. Typically, a test zone of 0.85 wavelength in diameter can be achieved with an 8-probe MPAC setup, which can encompass device-under-test (DUT) of small form factors. However, a test zone of this size may not be large enough to encompass DUTs such as cars. In this article, the sufficient number of OTA probes for the MPAC setup for car testing is investigated with respect to the emulation accuracy. Our investigation shows that the effective antenna distance of the DUT is more critical than its physical dimensions to determine the required number of OTA probes. In addition, throughput measurements are performed under the standard SCME UMa and UMi channel models with the 8-probe MPAC setup and the wireless cable setup, i.e. another standardized testing setup. The results show reasonably good agreement between the two setups for MIMO OTA testing with cars under the standard channel models.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) employs intervehicle wireless communications to safely drive at short intervehicle distances, which improves road throughput. The underlying technical requirement to achieve this benefit is formulated by the notion of string stability, requiring the attenuation of the effects of disturbances in upstream direction. The wireless communication delay, however, significantly compromises string stability. In order to compensate for time delays and thus reduce the minimum string-stable time gap, a Smith predictor can be applied. For application of a Smith predictor, the time delay needs to be in a series connection with the plant to be controlled, which is realized by introducing a master-slave architecture for CACC. As a result, information exchange appears to become bidirectional, while the control scheme still follows the one-vehicle look-ahead strategy. Feasibility of both the master-slave CACC strategy and the Smith predictor is explicitly analyzed. With the proposed control scheme, the minimum string-stable time gap can be significantly decreased, even considering communication delay uncertainty. The results are validated using simulations with a platoon of CACC-equipped vehicles.},

We consider a practical power consumption model, where the decoding power of each user device is a nonlinear function of the data rate. We assume each user device is powered by a battery with limited capacity. The power consumption of the user device determines the expected battery lifetime which conforms to Peukert&#39;s law. Two non-convex optimization problems are considered based on two criteria: maximizing the minimum of user throughputs (MaxMin) and maximizing the weighted sum of user throughputs (MaxSum), during the battery lifetime. For the MaxMin problem, we solve it by using a bisection search algorithm. For the MaxSum problem, we propose an algorithm based on the successive convex approximation, which can find a stable point that approximates the optimum solution. Numerical simulations verify that the expected data throughput of the multiuser system can be greatly improved by properly choosing the beamforming strategies using the proposed algorithms.},

This strategy requires high computational complexity, especially in large MIMO systems with high-order modulation schemes such as 16- and 64-QAM signaling. This paper proposes a novel reduced-complexity TS detection algorithm called neighbor-grouped TS (NG-TS), which divides the neighbors into groups and finds the best neighbor by using a simplified cost function. Furthermore, based on the complexity analysis of NG-TS, we propose a channel ordering scheme that further reduces its complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed NG-TS with channel ordering can achieve up to 85% complexity reduction with respect to the conventional TS algorithm with no performance loss in both low- and higher-order modulation schemes.},

  abstract     = {A dual-band dual-circularly polarized (CP) all-metal antenna is proposed in this paper for vehicular communications to realize large signal coverage and high isolation over two bands. On the one hand, by combining two rings of three-dimensional (3-D) L-shaped stubs and a circular patch, opposite CP radiations, i.e., right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) and left-hand circular polarization (LHCP), can be achieved in lower and higher working frequency bands respectively, thus ensuring the isolation between different channels. On the other hand, both radiation patterns of two bands are conical-beam, i.e., omnidirectional, so as to realize large signal coverage, which is beneficial for vehicular communication especially when the car is moving or located on nonplanar plane. Besides, the proposed antenna is all-metal and can be easily manufactured by computer numerical control (CNC) machining technology. As such, it is expected to have higher power capacity than the conventional printed circuit board (PCB) structure. A prototype operating at 2.6 and 2.98 GHz is fabricated and measured, indicating that small frequency ratio between two operating bands can be realized. The proposed antenna is promisingly useful for application on vehicle to ensure simultaneous communications between different links without crosstalk, such as vehicle-to-satellite and vehicle-to-basestation communications.},

However, the current UAV navigation schemes are unable to capture the UAV motion and select the best UAV-ground links in real-time, and these weaknesses overwhelm the UAV navigation performance. To tackle these fundamental limitations, in this paper, we merge the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning with the UAV navigation through massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technique. To be specific, we carefully design a deep Q-network (DQN) for optimizing the UAV navigation by selecting the optimal policy, and then we propose a learning mechanism for processing the DQN. The DQN is trained so that the agent is capable of making decisions based on the received signal strengths for navigating the UAVs with the aid of the powerful Q-learning. Simulation results are provided to corroborate the superiority of the proposed schemes in terms of the coverage and convergence compared with those of the other schemes.},

  abstract     = {Potential adversary and maliciously-behaved vehicles may cause traffic chaos or even lead to traffic accidents (particularly on traffic congestion crossroads). To address this issue, a novel security scheme is proposed for facilitating an efficient vehicular communication by employing a quantum secret sharing method. In the proposed scheme, the traffic control information is broadcasted regularly and shared among vehicles to reduce traffic congestion, and thus avoiding traffic accidents. Finally, we also demonstrate the superiority performance of our proposed scheme through theoretical and numerical simulation analysis.},

In the first hop, terrestrial base stations (TBSs) transmit RF energy and data to the aerial base stations (ABSs) and in the second hop, ABSs forward the data to the user. Numerical results show that the energy harvesting and coverage probabilities can be maximized at almost the same altitude of the ABSs with respect to the TBSs height for low TBSs densities. However, as the density of the backhaul nodes and the energy harvesting sub-timeslot increases, energy harvesting probability improves while coverage probability monotonically decreases by increasing the ABSs height.},

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then designed to identify different devices using DCTF features. Compared to the existing CNN-based RFF identification methods, the proposed DCTF-CNN possesses the merits of high identification accuracy, zero prior information and low complexity. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed DCTF-CNN can achieve an identification accuracy as high as 99.1% and 93.8% under SNR levels of 30 dB and 15 dB, respectively, when classifying 54 target ZigBee devices, which significantly outperforms the existing RFF identification methods.},

We jointly optimize the UAV&#39;s trajectory and the power of the charging station to maximize the overall power transmission efficiency. To attain this goal, we formulate a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem and then decouple the problem into three sub-problems, which can be iteratively solved by utilizing the inexact block coordinate descent.

We also utilize the Pinsker&#39;s inequality and Kullback-Leibler divergence to yield low-complex approximation for the detection error probability, based on which we obtain some significant insights on the detection performance. Our numerical results show that there exists an optimal number of sectors that can minimize the detection error probability in some scenarios (e.g., when the number of measurements is limited).

While previous studies on low-resolution DAC MIMO have focused on optimizing precoding for massive MIMO, this approach faces the limitation that the coarse resolution at the transmitter makes it difficult to construct a transmit signal close enough to the desired one when a small scale MIMO transmitter is considered as in IoT networks. To address this problem, we propose a new transmission framework that jointly performs modulation and beamforming. With the proposed scheme, a message symbol is directly mapped into a feasible transmit vector.

Among existing design criterions, sum rate maximization (SRM) under a total power constraint is a challenge due to its nonconvexity. Existing techniques for the SRM problem only obtain local optimal solutions but require huge amount of computation due to their complex matrix operations and iterations. Unlike these conventional methods, we propose a deep learning based fast beamforming design method without complex operations and iterations. Specifically, we first derive a heuristic solution structure of the downlink beamforming through the virtual equivalent uplink channel based on optimum MMSE receiver which separates the problem into power allocation and virtual uplink beamforming (VUB) design. Next, beamforming prediction network (BPNet) is designed to perform the joint optimization of power allocation and VUB design. Moreover, the BPNet is trained offline using two-step training strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method is fast while obtains the comparable performance to the state-of-the-art method.},

Most existing approaches, which are lack of evolving coordinations and rely on precise channel state information, tend to be inefficient in the context of dense SCNs with uncertainties. To improve the performance, by introducing a reliable metric of successful transmission probability to characterize the individual utility, we adopt a correlated equilibrium (CE)-based game to formulate spectrum reuse, and propose a distributed regret-matching learning algorithm to achieve the CE solutions. Eliminating the dependence on definite information and with general CE points consideration, our new scheme is feasible under the varying environment and can obtain more promising solutions than the state-of-art reinforcement learning methods by encouraging players to coordinate their strategies.

  abstract     = {To efficiently support safety-related vehicular applications, the ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) concept has become an indispensable component of vehicular networks (VNETs). Due to the high mobility of VNETs, exchanging near-instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and making reliable resource allocation decisions based on such short-term CSI evaluations are not practical. In this paper, we consider the downlink of a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) system conceived for URLLC based on idealized perfect and realistic imperfect CSI. By exploiting the benefits of the massive MIMO concept, a two-stage radio resource allocation problem is formulated based on a novel twin-timescale perspective for avoiding the frequent exchange of near-instantaneous CSI. Specifically, based on the prevalent road-traffic density, Stage 1 is constructed for minimizing the worst-case transmission latency on a long-term timescale. In Stage 2, the base station allocates the total power at a short-term timescale according to the large-scale fading CSI encountered for minimizing the maximum transmission latency across all vehicular users. Then, a primary algorithm and a secondary algorithm are conceived for our V2I URLLC system to find the optimal solution of the twin-timescale resource allocation problem, with special emphasis on the complexity imposed. Finally, our simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation scheme significantly reduces the maximum transmission latency, and it is not sensitive to the fluctuation of road-traffic density.},

Specifically, the intermediate EH nodes first harvest and accumulate energy from the source&#39;s signal and then forward the confidential signal or emit jamming signal to interfere the eavesdropper according to actual requirements. In order to exploit the intermediate EH nodes for secure improvement, considering both energy storage status and channel gains, three relay-and-jammer selection schemes at the intermediate nodes are proposed, namely: energy threshold based best-relay and random-jammer (ETBR), energy threshold based random-relay and best-jammer (ETRB), and energy threshold based best-relay and best-jammer (ETBB). For understanding the impact of critical parameters on the secrecy performance, we first capture the evolution of the EH nodes’ storages using finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) and then derive the analytical expressions for hybrid outage probability (HOP) and secrecy throughput (ST). Furthermore, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed selection schemes outperform the existing schemes (bR-rJ, rR-bJ, bR-bJ) due to the consideration of energy accumulation and storage status. In addition, there is a suitable value of the energy threshold for each proposed scheme to achieve the optimal secrecy performance.},

Mobile health has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving people&#39;s work and life in the future. However, high mobility of mobile devices and limited resources pose challenges for users to deal with the applications in mobile health that require large amount of computational resources. In this paper, a novel computation offloading mechanism is proposed in the environments combining of the Internet of Vehicles and Multi-Access Edge Computing. Through the proposed mechanism, mobile health applications are divided into several parts and can be offloaded to appropriate nearby vehicles while meeting the requirements of application completion time, energy consumption, and resource utilization. A particle swarm optimization based approach is proposed to optimize the the aforementioned computation offloading problem in a specific medical application. Evaluations of the proposed algorithms against local computing method serves as baseline method are conducted via extensive simulations. The average task completion time saved by our proposed task allocation scheme increases continually compared with the local solution. Specially, the global resource utilization rate increased from 71.8% to 94.5% compared with the local execution time.},

In this paper, we investigate a novel model-driven deep reinforcement learning assisted resource allocation method. We first design a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based optimization framework consisting of a series of Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) iterative procedures, which makes the CSI as the learned weights. Then a novel channel information absent Q-learning resource allocation (CIAQ) algorithm is proposed to train the DNN-based optimization framework without massive labeling data, where the SE, the EE, and the fairness can be jointly optimized by adjusting discount factor. Our simulation results show that, the proposed CIAQ with rapid convergence speed not only well characterizes the extent of optimization objective with partial CSI, but alsoconcave programming significantly outperforms the current random initialization method of neural network and the other existing resource allocation algorithms in term of the tradeoff among the SE, EE and fairness.},

Some bio-inspired intelligent routing protocols are effective in transmitting emergency data. However, their computational complexity and convergence speed may result in large delays. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that parked vehicles may be used as relay nodes and thus facilitate data packet transmission in VANET. In this paper, we propose a parking-area-assisted spider-web routing protocol (PASRP) for emergency data in urban VANET. In PASRP, a spider-web transmission model is established based on the parking area by using a geographic information system and a digital map. Two control messages, request-spider and confirm-spider, are sent to obtain the transmission path from the source vehicle to the destination vehicle, and the path with the least delay is selected as the transmission path. Then, the emergency data are forwarded on the selected path using a multi-mode greedy algorithm and are prioritized by a dynamic multi-priority scheduling mechanism. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PASRP outperforms the existing greedy perimeter stateless routing and transmission mechanism for emergency data protocols.},

  abstract     = {Resource allocation in wireless networks, such as device-to-device (D2D) communications, is usually formulated as mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems, which are generally NP-hard and difficult to get the optimal solutions. Traditional methods to solve these MINLP problems are all based on mathematical optimization techniques, such as the branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) algorithm that converges slowly and has forbidding complexity for real-time implementation. Therefore, machine leaning (ML) has been used recently to address the MINLP problems in wireless communications. In this paper, we use imitation learning method to accelerate the B&amp;B algorithm. With invariant problem-independent features and appropriate problem-dependent feature selection for D2D communications, a good auxiliary prune policy can be learned in a supervised manner to speed up the most time-consuming branch process of the B&amp;B algorithm. Moreover, we develop a mixed training strategy to further reinforce the generalization ability and a deep neural network (DNN) with a novel loss function to achieve better dynamic control over optimality and computational complexity. Extensive simulation demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve good optimality and reduce computational complexity simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Customer churn as a common but extremely harmful phenomenon haunts service operators in telecommunications industry for a long time. Discriminating customers prone to churning in the early stage and taking precaution measures can mitigate customer churn effectively. Unlike previous works which mainly considered the inter-operator customer churn, we focus on a new problem of intra-operator customer churn, that is, customers abandon their fourth generation (4G) mobile communication services and switch to third generation/second generation (3G/2G). Due to quite different mechanisms and causes, previous studies cannot tackle this new problem well. In this paper, we propose a novel profit maximizing framework to solve this special customer churn problem. Specifically, we first build a profit maximizing classifier to predict whether a customer is prone to churn or not, in which profitable customers have more probability to be classified correctly. Then, we describe and quantify the switching behaviors of 4G customers by introducing a notion of switching score. Finally, we investigate relations between operators and customers, finding that some features of 4G service plans provided by operators indeed affect switching behaviors of 4G customers remarkably. This provides insight into reasonable design of 4G service plans for operators in the future. Our framework uncovers the root causes of intra-operator customer churn and solve the problem well. Experimental results based on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.},

Furthermore, the performance of UDCN is highly sensitive to the dynamics of user demand. To overcome such difficulties, we propose a distributed caching algorithm under a stochastic geometric network model, as well as a spatio-temporal user demand model that characterizes the content popularity dynamics. By leveraging mean-field game (MFG) theory, the complexity of the proposed UDCN caching algorithm becomes independent of the number of SBSs. Numerical evaluations validate this consistent complexity of the proposed algorithm with respect to the number of SBSs. Also, it shows that the proposed caching algorithm reduces not only the long run average cost of the network but also the redundant cached data respectively by 24% and 42%, compared to a baseline caching algorithm. Additionally, the simulation results show that the proposed caching algorithm is robust to imperfect popularity information while ensuring a low computational complexity.},

In this paper, we propose a wireless powered spatial crowdsourcing framework which consists of two mutually dependent phases: task allocation phase and data crowdsourcing phase. In the task allocation phase, we propose a Stackelberg game based mechanism for the spatial crowdsourcing platform to efficiently allocate spatial tasks and wireless charging power to each worker. In the data crowdsourcing phase, the workers may have an incentive to misreport its real working location to improve its utility, which causes adverse effects to the spatial crowdsourcing platform. To address this issue, we present three strategyproof deployment mechanisms for the spatial crowdsourcing platform to place a mobile base station, e.g., vehicle or robot, which is responsible for transferring the wireless power and collecting the crowdsourced data. As the benchmark, we first apply the classical median mechanism and evaluate its worst-case performance. Then, we design a conventional strategyproof deployment mechanism to improve the expected utility of the spatial crowdsourcing platform under the condition that the workers&#39; locations follow a known geographical distribution. For a more general case with only the historical location data available, we propose a deep learning based strategyproof deployment mechanism to maximize the spatial crowdsourcing platform&#39;s utility.

  abstract     = {The energy consumption of wireless interface is critical to power-constrained mobile devices. To improve energy efficiency for WLAN stations, power saving mode (PSM) is proposed, to manage the time spent in idle listening (IL) state. The hurdle is that the receiver has no knowledge about when the pending data will arrive under end-to-end communication protocols (TCP/IP), making each station spend enormous time in IL to wait for the pending data. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a named data networking (NDN) enabled PSM, namely, NDN-PSM, which leverages NDN communication architecture to cut down unnecessary IL time. In particular, we devise two new power states in NDN-PSM, i.e., light doze and deep doze, to precisely map to the underlying data arriving states. The inherent receiver-driven pattern of NDN can effectively drive the stations to the deep doze state for power saving, and to light doze state for timely data reception. Considering the IL time waste during channel contention, we further design a channel contention control mechanism in NDN-PSM, in which stations will switch to the light doze state if the channel is perceived to be busy. The power consumption model of the proposed NDN-PSM is theoretically analyzed and verified via numerical results. At last, we implement NDN-PSM in NS-3 by adopting the ndnSIM module and conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of NDN-PSM. Specifically, compared to the existing PSM mechanism, NDN-PSM reduces 56% power consumption by cutting down unnecessary IL time, and meanwhile enables low-delay transmission.},

As a result, the continuous increment in the number of user terminals (UT) and their expectation leads to the importance of managing and updating the networks as per the expectation of users. In this paper, the concept of self-tuning is used for adjusting the service priority factor in the scheduling algorithms to allocate the resource blocks (RBs) in order to give the appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) based on Quality of Experience (QoE). To access QoE-aware, a QoE model is created by using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm to estimate the QoE score by using the QoS parameters. We propose the Particle Genetic Algorithm (PGA) to find the optimal parameter of service priority factors, and the proposed algorithm works efficiently by increasing the average QoE of the network along with maintaining the QoE threshold for each of the multi-service. The detailed comparison is presented between the proposed and reference algorithms to highlight the significance of the proposed algorithm and the simulation and analytical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing ones in terms of improving the allocation of resources under the environment of limited resources.},

  abstract     = {Resource management plays a crucial role in improving sum rate of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. However, the traditional resource management methods have considerable complexity, creating a huge challenge in computational efficiency. To handle this challenge, a resource management method is proposed based on a deep neural network (DNN). The key advantage of the method is that the DNN can perform in almost real-time resource allocation because it requires a very simple operation. In this paper, the resource management problem of the NOMA system adopting imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) technology at the receivers is studied, including the power allocation stage and the user scheduling stage. For power allocation stage, the generic fully-connected DNN is trained to approximate the power allocation of interior point method (IPM), which not only greatly improves the computational efficiency but also increases the sum rate of the system. Based on the allocated power, the user scheduling algorithm is performed to further increase the system sum rate. Finally, simulation results verify some performances of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Network slicing in future 5G systems enables the provision of multitenant networks in which a network infrastructure owned by an operator is shared among different tenants, such as mobile virtual operators, over-the-top providers or vertical market players. The support of network slicing within the radio access network requires the introduction of appropriate radio resource management functions to ensure that each tenant gets the required radio resources in accordance with the expected service level agreement (SLA). This paper addresses radio admission control (RAC) functionality in multiservice and multitenant scenarios as a mechanism for regulating the acceptance of new guaranteed bit rate service requests of different tenants. This paper proposes an optimization framework that models the RAC as a semi-Markov decision process and, as a result, derives an optimal decision-making policy that maximizes an average long-term function representing the desired optimization target. A reward function is proposed to capture the degree of tenant satisfaction with the received service in relation to the expected SLA, accounting for both the provision of excess capacity beyond the SLA and the cost associated with sporadic SLA breaches. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of simulations, and its superiority to other reference schemes in terms of reward and other key performance indicators is analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsensing has been recognized as a promising data collection paradigm, in which a platform outsources sensing tasks to a large number of users. However, requesting users to report raw data may give rise to many practical concerns, such as a significant overhead of communication and central processing, besides users&#39; privacy concerns. In many scenarios (e.g, advertising and recommendation), the data collector directly benefits from statistical aggregation of raw data. Thus motivated, we consider the data collection problem based on user&#39;s local histograms, which is intimately related to the fundamental trade-off between the platform&#39;s accuracy and users&#39; privacy. Because of users&#39; social relationship, their data are often correlated, indicating that users&#39; privacy may be leaked from others&#39; data. To tackle this challenge, we first utilize Gaussian Markov random fields to model the correlation structure embedded in users&#39; data. The data collection is modeled as a Stackelberg game where the platform decides its reward policy and users decide their noise levels while taking into account the social coupling among users. For the reward policy design, we first establish the relationship between users&#39; Nash equilibrium and the payment mechanism, and then optimize the platform&#39;s accuracy under a budget constraint. Further, since the noise levels are users&#39; private information, they may use falsified noise levels to achieve higher payoffs, which in turn impairs the crowdsensing performance. It turns out that with the insight into the correlation structure among users&#39; data, the information asymmetry can be overcome based on peer prediction. We revisit the payment mechanism to guarantee dominant truthfulness of each user&#39;s strategy. Theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The next frontier for automotive revolution will be connected vehicles and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) that will transform a vehicle into a much more than a smartphone on wheels. The fifth-generation (5G) networks are expected to meet various communication requirements for vehicles. This will enable the creation of a large market of services with the exploitation of the generated data from in-vehicle sensors. The “cloudification” of vehicular network resources through Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new network paradigm. A critical part of SDN is the transport of control plane. Therefore, it is crucial for SDN-based On-Board Units, i.e., SDN switches, to keep a robust connection with the SDN controller. In the literature, several works propose SDN-based architectures for vehicular communication. However, nearly all performance evaluations are based on theory or simulation results. This paper proposes a design of a complete Software Defined Vehicular Network prototype. At first, the SDN-based backbone is tested in real hardware composed of OpenFlow switches. Next, the SDN-based Radio Access is tested based on WiFi Access Points that support Click Modular Router and OpenvSwitch/OpenFlow. Finally, a Single Board Computer is used as On-Board Unit (OBU) in which are implemented OpenFlow switch functionalities. Several SDN controllers are used to implement routing algorithms to transport vehicles control plane through the backbone, to process information received from vehicles to predict topology and compute routing path for V2V and V2I communication, and finally to manage mobility schemes. Communication quality is evaluated by measuring throughput, delay, processing time, handoff latency and packet loss.},

However, D2D communication is more vulnerable to security and privacy threats due to direct wireless connection between the proximity devices. In this paper, we exploit blockchain technology to propose a new distributed and secure data sharing framework named D2D blockchain, where we deploy a set of Access Points (APs) to verify end users&#39; transactions. Besides, in order to enable the end users to receive the required data on time in the D2D blockchain, we propose two new schemes for the transaction confirmation procedure including a relay-assisted transaction relaying scheme and a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) based lightweight block verification scheme. Furthermore, to incentivize the relay devices to help in relaying transactions in congested areas, and to encourage the verifiers to contribute their resources in block verification, we design a two-stage contract theory based joint optimization scheme. To measure the quality of the relayed transaction and the verified block, we formulate two models: value of transaction relaying (VoTR) and value of block verification (VoBV), and then design the optimal contract for each relay device and each verifier. Security analysis and numerical results illustrate that the proposed D2D blockchain and the designed joint optimization scheme are secure and efficient for data sharing among end users.},

  abstract     = {Coded caching is an effective technique to reduce peak network traffic load by exploiting coded multicasting opportunities among users with all possible requests. However, most existing works on coded caching design assume identical file sizes. In this paper, to fully exploit the coded multicasting opportunities in decentralized coded caching system with heterogenous file sizes, a file partitioning and grouping (FPG) scheme is proposed. In the FPG scheme, every file is divided into multiple subfiles, so that the subfiles of the same size from different files can be grouped into subfile groups. Based on the proposed FPG scheme, we formulate a placement optimized design problem to minimize the worst-case transmission load, in which we address how to allocate the limited cache sizes at users to different subfile groups. The optimal placement is found to be dependent on all file sizes and the cache size, as well as the number of subfile groups. The numerical results show that, the FPG scheme outperforms the existing decentralized coded caching schemes in the literature. Moreover, it can even approach the performance of the optimized centralized coded caching scheme when the number of files is smaller than the number of users.},

Traffic data aggregation in the vehicular cloud, which can aggregate traffic data from vehicles for further processing and sharing, is very important. Incorrect traffic data feedback may affect traffic safety; therefore, the security of traffic data aggregation should be ensured. In this paper, by using the property of data recovery in the message recovery signature (MRS), we propose a secure real-time traffic data aggregation scheme for vehicular cloud in VANETs. In the proposed scheme, the validity of vehicles&#39; signatures are verified, and then the original traffic data is recovered from signatures. Moreover, the proposed scheme supports batch verification for multiple vehicles&#39; signatures. Due to advantages of the MRS, security features such as data confidentiality, privacy preservation and reply attack resistance are preserved. In addition, the comparison and simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme is superior in comparison to previous schemes with respect to the communication and computational cost.},

Therefore, efficient mobility management solution that mitigates the challenges of vehicles&#39; mobility is needed. In this paper, we present an adaptive mobility management protocol for predictive hierarchical mobile IPv6 in vehicular networks. We develop a dynamic Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) discovery and selection scheme that adjusts the network topology structure to fit the vehicles&#39; mobility environment better. Moreover, the predictive handover scheme is based on a multi-observation hidden Markov model, which utilizes the vehicles&#39; movement projections to estimate the subsequent point of access. The performance of our proposed protocol has been tested using NS-2 and several real and synthetic mobility traces. The results indicate that our protocol exhibits better performance results when compared to well-known handover protocols in reducing the handover latency and packet loss.},

By establishing the sparse signal recovery model applied to DOA estimation of 4-D linear arrays, it is found that the time sequences have great influence on sparse signal recovery. Thus mutual coherence and covariance matrix of noise are introduced to evaluate its influence quantificationally. The differential evolutionary (DE) algorithm is then used for the optimization of time sequences such that the capability of sparse signal recovery is improved and the noise after time modulation is close to Gaussian white noise. It can be found that the unidirectional phase center motion (UPCM) scheme is an excellent candidate by the optimization of an 8-element 4-D linear array. By comparison with the previous methods, simulated results demonstrate that the proposed method has distinct advantages over other methods in probability of resolution and estimation accuracy, especially for the cases where the number of snapshots is small and the SNR is low.

This paper studies the case of multiple concurrent data streams, each with multiple transmitters and multiple receivers, in self-organizing wireless networks. A distributed optimization solution based on joint network formation and beamforming is developed for coherent group communications in a network of nodes that need to communicate over long distances. This solution significantly improves the power gain for a single data stream and the signal-to-interference-ratio for multiple data streams compared to point-to-point communications. These gains are in turn translated to improvements in communication range, power efficiency, reliability, and throughput. In this multi-layer network optimization solution, nodes coordinate with each other in a distributed manner to form transmitter and receiver groups, and communicate with each other coherently over long distances. The coherent beamforming protocol is optimized for given transmitter and receiver groups, whereas the network formation protocol is optimized to determine these groups. By using single-antenna communication nodes, the proposed optimization solution provides a major gain in network communications and outperforms other benchmark combinations of beamforming and network formation protocols.},

In MTC, devices equipped with sensing, computation, and communication capabilities connect to the Internet providing what is known as Internet-of-Things (IoT). A dense network would provide an all-in-one solution where scalable connectivity, high capacity, and uniform deep coverage are byproducts. To account for short link distances, the path loss is modeled as stretched exponential path loss (SEPL). Moreover, the fading is modeled as a general (α - μ) channel, where tractable and insightful results are derived for the Rayleigh fading special case. We consider the direct MTC access mode where mMTC nodes connect directly to the small cell. The analytical results disclose the impact of the system parameters and propagation environment parameters on the network performance. In particular, our results reveal that significant coverage enhancements and high uplink capacity are achievable at moderate cell densities, low transmission power, and moderate bandwidth. Moreover, the uplink network performance is independent of the maximum transmission power in the considered dense network scenario, allowing for longer battery lifetime of future IoT devices. The accuracy of the derived analytical results is assessed via extensive simulations.},

The proposed design of waveforms optimizes the anti-jamming (AJ) performance of TH SS systems by minimizing the correlation between the template and STJ signals, in which the problem of waveform optimization is simplified by employing a finite number of rectangular pulses. The simplification eventually makes the design of waveforms be converted into a problem of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. Simulation results show that the waveforms designed by the proposed scheme provide us with performance superior not only to the conventional waveforms but also to the clipper receiver in the mitigation of STJ. The waveforms from the proposed design also exhibit a desirable AJ capability even when the estimated frequency of the STJ is not perfect.},

To fully focus on the RF impairment issue, we study the simple configuration of single uplink user and single downlink user. They both are half-duplex wireless. In the uplink, we study analog and digital self-interference (SI) cancellation and propose a complementary SI suppression method. Desired signal and residual SI powers and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) are derived in closed form. Similarly, in the downlink, we derive desired signal power, co-channel interference signal power caused by the uplink user and SIR. The RF impairments degrade the efficiency of SI cancellation and affect GFDM more negatively than full-duplex orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Hence, we propose full-duplex GFDM receiver filters for maximizing the SIR for both uplink and downlink transmissions. Finally, the uplink and downlink rates and the uplink-downlink rate region are derived. Significantly, the optimal-filter based GFDM outperforms full-duplex OFDM by 25 dB higher SIR and an uplink rate increase of 500%.},

However, fully achieving its benefits requires the accurate estimation of channel. In this article, we propose a low-overhead characteristic learning, tracking, and monitoring mechanism for the time-varying massive MIMO channels. Specially, we exploit the common spatial sparsity and temporal correlation of the channels. Firstly, using the virtual channel representation and modeling the temporal correlation as an autoregressive process, we formulate the time-varying massive MIMO channel as a sparse signal model. Then, a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) scheme based on the expectation maximization (EM) is proposed to determine the model parameters of the channel. To achieve the posteriors of different model parameters, the approximate message passing (AMP) is used in the expectation step. Furthermore, the Kalman filtering (KF) with a reduced dimension is used to track the downlink (DL) channel. To observe the change of model parameters and start the relearning process, a monitoring scheme based on the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB) is also developed. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Contemporary receiver windowed-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (RW-OFDM) algorithms have limited adjacent channel interference (ACI) rejection capability under high delay spread and small fast Fourier transformation (FFT) sizes. Cyclic prefix (CP) is designed to be longer than the maximum excess delay (MED) of the channel to accommodate such algorithms in current standards. The robustness of these algorithms can only be improved against these conditions by adopting additional extensions in a new backward incompatible standard. Such extensions would deteriorate the performance of high mobility vehicular communication systems in particular. In this paper, we present a low-complexity Hann RW-OFDM scheme that provides resistance against ACI without requiring any intersymbol interference (ISI)-free redundancies. While this scheme is backward compatible with current and legacy standards and requires no changes to the conventionally transmitted signals, it also paves the way towards future spectrotemporally localized and efficient schemes suitable for higher mobility vehicular communications. A Hann window effectively rejects unstructured ACI at the expense of structured and limited inter-carrier interference (ICI) across data carriers. A simple maximum ratio combining (MRC)-successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver is therefore proposed to resolve this induced ICI and receive symbols transmitted by standard transmitters currently in use. The computational complexity of the proposed scheme is comparable to that of contemporary RW-OFDM algorithms, while ACI rejection and bit-error rate (BER) performance is superior in both long and short delay spreads. Channel estimation using Hann RW-OFDM symbols is also discussed.},

  abstract     = {In order to cope with the rapid increase in power consumption of heterogeneous cellular networks, this article proposes a new efficient transmission technique for heterogeneous networks with massive MIMO wireless backhaul with the objective of minimizing power consumption cost. We assume that transmissions on the backhaul link and the access link occur simultaneously on the same frequency band (in-band) thanks to MIMO spatial multiplexing. On the other hand, we consider that uplink and downlink transmissions are separated in time. In order to prevent multi-user and inter-tier interference, block diagonalization beamforming is considered at the macro base station (MBS) and the signal from the small base station (SBS) to the MBS is transmitted orthogonally to the channel of the SBS&#39;s users. The problem of minimizing the transmit power of base stations under users&#39; minimum-rate constraints is formulated. We first derive analytically the optimal time splitting parameter and the allocated transmit power considering that the inter-SBS interference is generated by fixed power. Next, we solve the power allocation problem when the generated inter-SBS interference is no longer considered fixed by proposing an efficient iterative power allocation algorithm. A heuristic user scheduling algorithm is devised in order to deal with the feasibility problem. Finally, simulations validate our analysis and show that the proposed transmission technique outperforms the conventional reverse time division duplex with bandwidth splitting (out-band) in terms of total power consumption.},

We formulate the minimum average rate maximization problem and the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the trajectory, velocity, and acceleration of the UAV and the uplink transmit power at the GNs. As these problems are non-convex in general, the successive convex approximation (SCA) scheme is employed. To utilize this technique, the non-convex constraints are turned into proper convex approximations, and iterative algorithms are proposed which converge to a local optimal point. From the numerical results, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms outperform baseline schemes for both problems. Especially for the EE maximization problem, the proposed algorithm exhibits about 109% gain over the baseline scheme.},

  abstract     = {Pre-caching popular videos at base stations (BSs) is a cost-effective way to significantly alleviate the backhaul pressure. With the video caching, the cache placement and the transmission strategy are intertwined with each other and jointly affect the system performance. Furthermore, the cache placement is updated in a much longer timescale than the transmission strategy. In this paper, the long-term transmission-aware cache placement and the short-term transmission strategy are designed to enhance the quality of experience (QoE) for the video streaming in cloud radio access networks (cloud-RANs). Specifically, consider a cache-enabled cloud-RAN, video contents are cached at BSs, and user requests are cooperatively satisfied by multiple BSs via the cooperative beamforming. To improve the weighted sum of users&#39; QoE, the long-term transmission-aware caching problem in the caching stage and the short-term transmission problem in the delivery stage are respectively formulated, taking into account the backhaul capacity constraint, the transmission power constraint, and the storage size constraint. For the caching problem, the sample average approach is first used to approximate the long-term average QoE value. Then, cache placement strategies are devised in both centralized and distributed manner. For the transmission problem, the full-cooperative beamforming scheme is studied with the optimized cache placement, and an iterative algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that our proposed transmission-aware cache placement and transmission strategies can achieve higher QoE performance than other cache placement and transmission strategies.},

The system performance is characterized in terms of both the outage probability and the ergodic capacity, for which, exact analytical expressions are derived in integral form. In addition, to reduce the computational complexity of the obtained analytical results, closed-form expressions are derived from lower-bound, approximate, and asymptotic analyses. From these analytical expressions, the impact on the system performance of the number of relays, the power allocation factor between the NOMA destinations, and the residual self-interference at full-duplex relays is assessed. The correctness of our analyses is validated by Monte Carlo simulations, and a comparison with the half-duplex relay-aided NOMA system counterpart is also provided.},

The automatic alignment of directional antennas allows the transmission energy to focus in certain direction and significantly extends the communication range and rejects interference. Robust automatic alignment of directional antennas is not easy to achieve, considering practical issues such as the limited on-board sensing devices due to the physical constraints of UAV payload and power supplies, uncertain and varying UAV movement patterns, and unstable GPS and unknown communication environments. In this paper, we develop reinforcement learning (RL)-based online antenna control solutions for the ACDA system to conquer these challenges. The control solution adopts an uncertain UAV mobility modeling and intention estimation framework to capture and predict the uncertain intentions of UAV maneuvers and hence permit robust tracking. To account for an unstable GPS environment, the control solution features a learning of communication channel models to provide additional measurement signals in GPS-denied settings. A novel stochastic optimal control solution for nonlinear random switching dynamics is developed that integrates RL, an effective uncertainty evaluation method called multivariate probabilistic collocation method (MPCM), and unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate and validate the proposed solutions.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently been envisaged as an enabling technology of 5G. UAVs act as an intermediate relay node to facilitate uninterrupted, high quality communication between information sources and their destination. However, UAV energy management has been a major issue of consideration due to limited power supply, affecting flight duration. Thus, we introduce in this paper a unified energy management framework by resorting to wireless power transfer (WPT), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and self-interference (SI) energy harvesting (EH) schemes, in cooperative relay communications. In our new technique, UAVs are deployed as relays equipped with a decode and forward protocol and EH capability operating in a full-duplex (FD) mode. The UAV assists information transmission between a terrestrial base station and a user. The UAV&#39;s transmission capability is powered exclusively by the energy harvested from WPT, radio frequency signal transmitted from the source via time-switching SWIPT protocol and SI exploitation. We improve the overall system throughput by the use of FD based UAV-assisted cooperative system. In this proposed system, we formulate two optimization problems to minimize end-to-end outage probability, subject to UAV&#39;s power profile and trajectory for a DF relay scheme, respectively. The KKT conditions have been used to obtain closed-form solutions for the two formulated problems. Numerical simulation results validate all the theoretical results. We demonstrate that the performance of our proposed unified EH scheme outperforms that of existing techniques in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Recently, classifying the modulation schemes of signals using deep neural network has received much attention. In this paper, we introduce a general model of deep neural network (DNN)-based modulation classifiers for single-input single-output (SISO) systems. Its feasibility is analyzed using maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion and its robustness to uncertain noise conditions is compared to that of the conventional maximum likelihood (ML)-based classifiers. To reduce the design and training cost of DNN classifiers, a simple but effective pre-processing method is introduced and adopted. Furthermore, featuring multiple recurrent neural network (RNN) layers, the DNN modulation classifier is realized. Simulation results show that the proposed RNN-based classifier is robust to the uncertain noise conditions, and the performance of it approaches to that of the ideal ML classifier with perfect channel and noise information. Moreover, with a much lower complexity, it outperforms the existing ML-based classifiers, specifically, expectation maximization (EM) and expectation conditional maximization (ECM) classifiers which iteratively estimate channel and noise parameters. In addition, the proposed classifier is shown to be invariant to the signal distortion such as frequency offset. Furthermore, the adopted pre-processing method is shown to accelerate the training process of our proposed classifier, thus reducing the training cost. Lastly, the computational complexity of our proposed classifier is analyzed and compared to other traditional ones, which further demonstrates its overall advantage.},

  abstract     = {In multi-user millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, hybrid precoding is a crucial task to lower the complexity and cost while achieving a sufficient sum-rate. Previous works on hybrid precoding were usually based on optimization or greedy approaches. These methods either provide higher complexity or have sub-optimum performance. Moreover, the performance of these methods mostly relies on the quality of the channel data. In this work, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework to improve the performance and provide less computation time as compared to conventional techniques. In fact, we design a convolutional neural network for MIMO (CNN-MIMO) that accepts as input an imperfect channel matrix and gives the analog precoder and combiners at the output. The procedure includes two main stages. First, we develop an exhaustive search algorithm to select the analog precoder and combiners from a predefined codebook maximizing the achievable sum-rate. Then, the selected precoder and combiners are used as output labels in the training stage of CNN-MIMO where the input-output pairs are obtained. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method through numerous and extensive simulations and show that the proposed DL framework outperforms conventional techniques. Overall, CNN-MIMO provides a robust hybrid precoding scheme in the presence of imperfections regarding the channel matrix. On top of this, the proposed approach exhibits less computation time with comparison to the optimization and codebook based approaches.},

  abstract     = {Space shift keying (SSK) is a single radio frequency (RF) chain multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme that uses the index of transmit antennas for information transmission. Time successive SSK-M-ary modulation (TSSM) and multi RF chain TSSM (MRF-TSSM) are recent MIMO techniques that achieve second order transmit diversity. We propose two cooperative relaying systems to attain distributed diversity in addition to transmit diversity of TSSM and MRF-TSSM. Cooperative-TSSM-1 (Coop-TSSM-1) uses multibranch relaying where TSSMis used in orthogonal time slots during the cooperative phase. Coop-TSSM-2 maps symbols to lower order constellations at multiple relays for simultaneous transmission of information using MRF-TSSM. We consider Decode-and-forward (DF) relaying where relays that correctly detect symbols forward it. We analyze the average number of relays that participate in cooperation, the end-to-end performance using a tight upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) and the asymptotic BER expressions to analyze diversity orders of both cooperative systems. We validate all analyzes using simulation results. From the analysis and results we show that Coop-TSSM-1 achieves better diversity order compared to Coop-TSSM-2 at the cost of higher number of time slots for completing the cooperative phase. Further in Coop-TSSM-2, results indicate that different constellation mappings used in MRF-TSSM during cooperative phase impact the BER performance. By applying spatial modulation based transmit diversity and M-ary Modulation systems in the cooperative setups of Coop-TSSM schemes, performance comparison is given which highlights the significance of Coop-TSSM schemes.},

The Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) is considered as a figure of merit to maximize and multiple restrictions on STTC are forced at the design stage, i.e., similarity and modulus constraints as well as a uniform power requirement among the transmit antennas. To deal with the resulting non-convex design problem, a novel polynomial-time iterative procedure based on Successive Greedy Optimization (SGO) framework ensuring that SINR monotonically increases and converges to a finite value, is developed. Each iteration of the proposed algorithm involves the generalized eigenvalue decomposition to design STRF and a nested iterative technique involving Dinkelbach&#39;s procedure and an Alternating Direction Penalty Method (ADPM) to obtain STTC. Numerical results are provided to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm against some counterparts in terms of the optimized SINR value and computational complexity.},

However, the high accuracy is acquired at the cost of employing the additional resources in the domains of frequency, space or time, which requires complex processing and hinders the practical application. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of RcLoc, which takes full advantages of the flexible array orientations and receiver positions, based on limited resources. Particularly, RcLoc devises a receiver configuration scheme for guiding the system deployment. Optimized array orientation could effectively improve the AoA estimation accuracy and well-designed receiver positions contribute to the Cramer-Rao lower bound of localization error. In the stage of system realization, we further devise an array calibration method to calibrate the actual array and develop an improved AoA estimation algorithm, which make RcLoc robust to the array arrangement. We prototype RcLoc on commodity Wi-Fi devices without manual intervention. Comprehensive experiments in a multipath-rich indoor environment show that RcLoc achieves a median localization accuracy of 0.4 m, which provides useful insights for receiver deployment.},

Since multiple active devices may transmit signals in the same RB or channel, the collision caused by the presence of multiple signals is inevitable and the detection of collision becomes important. Furthermore, if the arrival time and the number of multiple signals can be estimated, successive interference cancellation (SIC) can be employed in time domain to improve the throughput. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of round-trip delays (RTD) of multiple signals in non-orthogonal random access (NORA) based on the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. Since the computational complexity of the ML approach is high, we propose a low-complexity approach based on variational inference, which is widely used in machine learning.

  abstract     = {Nowadays unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely applied to a wealth of civil and military applications. Robust and high-throughput wireless communication is the crux of these UAV applications. Yet, air-to-ground links suffer from time-varying channels induced by the agile mobility and dynamic environments. Rate adaptation algorithms are generally used to choose the optimal data rate based on the current channel conditions. State-of-the-art approaches leverage physical layer information for rate adaptation, and they work well under certain conditions. However, the above protocols still have limitation under constantly changing flight states and environments for air-to-ground links. To solve this problem, we propose StateRate, a state-optimized rate adaptation algorithm that fully exploits the characteristics of UAV systems using a hybrid deep learning model. The key observation is that the rate adaptation strategy needs to be adjusted according to motion-dependent channel models, which can be reflected by flight states. In this work, the rate adaptation protocol is enhanced with the help of the on-board sensors in UAVs. To make full use of the sensor data, we introduce a learning-based prediction module by leveraging the internal state and an online learning algorithm by employing the pre-trained model that adapts the rate adaptation algorithm to different environments. We implement our algorithm on a commercial UAV platform and evaluate it in various environments. The results demonstrate that our system outperforms the best-known rate adaptation algorithm up to 53% in terms of throughput when the velocity is 2-6 m/s.},

This paper focuses on characterizing the asymptotic scaling law of the outage probability of HARQ-aided NOMA systems with respect to the transmit power, i.e., diversity order. The analysis of diversity order is carried out for three basic types of HARQ-aided downlink NOMA systems, including Type I HARQ, HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC) and HARQ with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR). The diversity orders of three HARQ-aided downlink NOMA systems are derived in closed-form, where an integration domain partition trick is developed to obtain the bounds of the outage probability specially for HARQ-CC and HARQ-IR-aided NOMA systems. The analytical results show that the diversity order is a decreasing step function of transmission rate, and full time diversity can only be achieved under a sufficiently low transmission rate. It is also revealed that HARQ-IR-aided NOMA systems have the largest diversity order, followed by HARQ-CC-aided and then Type I HARQ-aided NOMA systems. Additionally, the users&#39; diversity orders follow a descending order according to their respective average channel gains. Furthermore, we expand discussions on the cases of power-efficient transmissions and imperfect channel state information (CSI). Monte Carlo simulations finally confirm our analysis.},

  abstract     = {Known interference (KI) is commonly used in many scenarios, where the original interference data is known to the receiver in advance. Unfortunately, due to the impacts of hardware imperfections and propagation environment, the received KI may suffer frequency offset, phase noise, and multi-path propagation with different time delays and channel gains. However, perfect time-frequency synchronization and channel estimation are hard to implement in practice, making it challenging to cancel the KI completely. In this paper, the comprehensive effects of synchronization and channel impairments on KI cancellation are investigated. First, the normalized time synchronization error is modeled as the inter-symbol interference (ISI), and the frequency synchronization error and phase noise are modeled as the inter-frequency interference (IFI). Subsequently, the closed-form expression of KI cancellation ratio (KICR) is derived for the multi-path block fading channel, by jointly considering imperfect time-frequency synchronization and channel estimation, as well as phase noise. Furthermore, assuming the channel and synchronization parameters estimation reach their corresponding Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs), the upper bound of KICR and the lower bound of channel capacity loss are analyzed for the single-path channel. Simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis that the KICR is more sensitive to phase noise compared to time-frequency synchronization and channel estimation errors. In addition, it is also proved that lower KI power is less sensitive to the implementation imperfections.},

We consider two different versions of DeepChannel; the first and second versions use LSTM and GRU as their basic cell structure, respectively. In contrast to prior work that is primarily focused on designing models for particular network settings, DeepChannel is highly adaptable and can predict future channel conditions for different networks, sampling rates, mobility patterns, and communication standards. We compare the performance (i.e., the root mean squared error, mean absolute error and relative error of future predictions) of DeepChannel with respect to two baselines-i) linear regression, and ii) ARIMA for multiple networks and communication standards. In particular, we consider 4G LTE, WiFi, WiMAX, an industrial network operating in the 5.8 GHz range, and Zigbee networks operating under varying levels of user mobility and observe that DeepChannel provides significantly superior performance.

We prove that the effective AR is a convex function of each UL power allocation factor, when all the other factors are given. The globally optimal UL pilot-data power allocation that maximizes the system&#39;s effective AR can easily be obtained using an iterative procedure, by solving an univariate convex optimization with the golden section method for individual UL power allocation factors one by one in each iteration.

Building on previous work on a simulation framework for Multiple-antenna terminals in 5G massive MIMO systems, this paper presents simulated performance results for various transmission schemes. The results are calibrated to reflect a real communication situation in a large auditorium. Emulating the measurement set-up, we show that the framework can be tuned to generate channel distributions that match measured data. Under generalized conditions, we perform simulations for different terminal transmission-strategies, both related to single stream and multiple streams. All evaluations are based on terminals with four antennas integrated into real Sony Xperia smartphone-chassis, tuned to 3.7 GHz. The measurements are conducted by using the Lund University Massive MIMO testbed with its 100 antennas. The results clearly show the advantage of increasing the antenna-count also at the terminal side in massive MIMO systems.},

  abstract     = {Pilot contamination has been recognized as one of the main limiting factors in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) since it damages the acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI) at base stations. In this work, we propose a novel pilot decontamination approach in a massive MIMO network where the time division duplex operation is assumed. In our proposed approach, user equipments are allowed to use superimposed (SP) pilots in combination with time-multiplexed (TM) pilots to estimate the CSI prior to downlink data transmission. Specifically, the contaminated channel estimates obtained by TM pilots are used to reduce the amount of interference caused by transmitting pilots together with uplink data, which is a typical problem in SP pilots-based channel estimation. Through numerical results, we show that the interference that emerges from transmitting pilots with data is substantially reduced by our proposed approach. This reduction, in combination with the reduced overhead in TM pilots transmission, leads to an improved spectral efficiency achieved in massive MIMO networks.},

  abstract     = {As a typical example of bandwidth-efficient techniques, bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) provides desirable spectral efficiencies in various wireless communication scenarios. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive investigation on tail-biting (TB) spatially coupled protograph (SC-P) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in BICM-ID systems. Specifically, we first develop a two-step design method to formulate a novel type of constellation mappers, referred to as labeling-bit-partial-match (LBPM) constellation mappers, for SC-P-based BICM-ID systems. The LBPM constellation mappers can be seamlessly combined with high-order modulations, such as M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Furthermore, we conceive a new bit-level interleaving scheme, referred to as variable node matched mapping (VNMM) scheme, which can substantially exploit the structure feature of SC-P codes and the unequal protection-degree property of labeling bits to trigger the wave-like convergence for TB-SC-P codes. In addition, we propose a hierarchical extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) algorithm to predict the convergence performance (i.e., decoding thresholds) of the proposed SC-P-based BICM-ID systems. Theoretical analyses and simulation results illustrate that the LBPM-mapped SC-P-based BICM-ID systems are remarkably superior to the state-of-the-art mapped counterparts. Moreover, the proposed SC-P-based BICM-ID systems can achieve even better error performance with the aid of the VNMM scheme. As a consequence, the proposed LBPM constellation mappers and VNMM scheme make the SC-P-based BICM-ID systems a favorable choice for the future-generation wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid analog-digital (HAD) beamforming architectures have been proposed to facilitate the practical implementation of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by reducing the number of employed radio frequency chains. While most prior studies have aimed to maximize spectral efficiency (SE), the present paper proposes a two-stage HAD beamforming design for multi-user MIMO systems that can be used to maximize either the system&#39;s overall energy efficiency (EE) or SE. This problem is nonconvex and NP-hard due to the joint optimization between the analog and digital domains and the constant modulus constraints required by the analog domain. To address this problem, we propose a decoupled two-stage design wherein the first stage, the analog beamforming parts are updated, which are then taken into account in the second stage to design the digital beamforming parts to maximize the system&#39;s EE or SE. We consider two widely-used HAD beamforming techniques that utilize either fully-connected (FC) or partially-connected (PC) architectures employing variable phase-shifters. Using the most recently available data for the circuitry power consumption of the components, we compare the performance of these two HAD architectures with that of the fully-digital (FD) architecture in terms of the total circuitry power consumption, and achieved SE and EE. We find that there is a certain number of users above which the FC architecture has higher circuitry power consumption than the FD counterpart, in contrast to the PC architecture that always has lower circuitry power consumption. More importantly, our results reveal, contrary to the common opinion, that depending on the circuitry parameters the FD architecture may achieve not only higher SE, but also higher EE than the HAD architectures.},

  abstract     = {We consider a 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO system with subconnected hybrid structure, where each transceiver unit (TXRU) is connected to a subarray at the transmitter (TX) or the receiver (RX). Beam training is the first step for codebook-based beamforming in the absence of ideal channel state information (CSI). The complexity of the optimal exhaustive search beam training is exponentially increased with the number of TXRUs (or subarrays) at the TX and the RX, which is infeasible in practice. The conventional beam training schemes are mainly based on the idea of mathematical search algorithms and novel beam codebook designs. In this study, we explore a novel low-complexity beam training scheme by fully exploiting the sparse nature of the mmWave channel and the strong correlations of large-scale antenna arrays. Specifically, we propose a training scheme to reduce beam search space for 5G mmWave system, which consists of the following two key stages: 1) a beam subset optimization method from the perspective of array gain for capturing the energy of dominant channel propagation paths, and 2) a class of linear iterative beam search algorithms within the optimized beam subset utilizing the idea of limiting the degrees of freedom of the subarray indices during beam training. The range of the optimized beam subset size and linear search condition are also given. The performances of the proposed two algorithms, beam subset optimization-single subarray linear search and beam subset optimization-subarray pair linear search, are evaluated in a 5G mmWave system. Analysis has shown that the complexity of the proposed scheme is linear with the number of channel propagation paths, which can considerably reduce the complexity of conventional schemes. Simulation results have verified the near-optimal performance of the proposed schemes when compared with exhaustive search as well as other existing training methods.},

  abstract     = {Faced with explosive growth of data traffic and shortage of licensed spectrum, licensed-assisted access (LAA) to unlicensed spectrum has been proposed to boost system capacity. To ensure fair coexistence with WiFi systems, listen-before-talk mechanism has been standardized under LAA framework. However, in densely deployed urban networks, the system performance could severely deteriorate due to high collision probability. In this paper, we propose cooperative LAA (CLAA), where multiple LAA small base stations form a cluster and construct a virtual multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO)/multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system to transmit data cooperatively. CLAA can effectively reduce the number of contending nodes, thereby alleviating transmission collisions. A closed-form expression for the upper bound sum rate of the cluster is derived. Markov analysis is employed to derive the system collision probability and throughput for WiFi and LTE. Our analytical results point to an adequate cluster sizes, where the highest system throughput can be achieved. Extensive simulations confirm the validity of the proposed approach, and demonstrate that CLAA can increase by up to 27% the overall system throughput, and improve by 30% in fairness.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning is regarded as a potential method to be applied in automated vehicles, but the stability and efficiency of algorithms are concerns. To improve them, the deterministic promotion reinforcement learning method is put forward, which can promote the policy determinately. Correspondingly, the policy evaluation in critic and the exploration in actor are improved, which combines a normalization-based evaluation and a model-free search guide. The aim is finding the right action exploration direction by critic, then the direction is used to update and guide action exploration in actor. The modified method decreases the dependencies of exploring a good action for promotional updating and only makes deterministic promotion in policy. Consequently, the efficiency of the algorithm is improved without loss in stability. More notably, it can relieve the cold-start and circumvent the limitations in learning with constrained physical systems. To verify the proposed method, the longitudinal velocity control problem for automated vehicles is considered, which contains car-following and non-car-following conditions in a unitized form. The learning system is established in Carsim. Furthermore, some different reinforcement learning technologies are used to accelerate learning. Real-vehicle experiments for validation are also given. The results indicate that the proposed method can achieve permissible learning performance in the longitudinal velocity continuous control problem.},

The main design feature is that the rotors of the designed motor will be transparent to the magnetic fluxes from both sets of stator windings. With this structure, the axial attractive force is eliminated thus the mechanical bearing loss is reduced. In addition, the motor will have lighter weight and less volume thus save more materials.

In case of the drive system suffering from inter-turn short-circuit (ITSC) fault, it is necessary to avoid the aggravation of the fault and ensure the normal output performance, this paper proposed a torque ripple minimization control strategy for ITSC fault based on the open-winding (OW) five phase fault tolerant fractional slot concentrated winding interior permanent magnet (FTFSCW-IPM) motor drive system with common DC bus. Once the ITSC fault is detected, the fault phase is active open-circuit (OC) (null the current of the normal part in the fault phase) and connected to a voltage sensor. In this way, the torque ripple minimization control strategy can deal with the OC fault and ITSC fault. For the OC fault, the equal amplitude phase current modulation strategy is adopted based on the carrier-based pulse width modulation (CPWM). For the ITSC fault, this paper proposed a feedforward compensation approach to eliminate the influence of the short-circuit loop current. The novelty of the proposed method is that the compensation can be real-time estimated using the zero-sequence voltage (ZSV) and zero-sequence current (ZSC), even the ITSC level changes. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.},

When applying phase coding into FMCW radar systems for interference mitigation or joint communication, preservation of this benefit is not possible, due to the nature of this process. This paper proposes a new phase coded FMCW system as well as a processing strategy based on a group-delay filter to deal with unaligned phase-coded radar return signals. Moreover, this paper proposes an improved interference mitigation method based on a phase-coded linear- frequency-modulated (LFM) continuous waveform and points out the improvements in the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). In the proposed mitigation technique, unlike the traditional approach where RF spectrum spreads, the beat frequency spectrum of the FMCW radar spreads, thus the bandwidth of RF hardware stays the same as a classical LFM continuous wave radar. The success of the proposed phase coded frequency-modulated continuous-wave (PC-FMCW) radar is illustrated in simulations and increased interference mitigation performance is validated by experiments.},

  abstract     = {The battery pack accounts for a large share of an electric vehicle cost. In this context, making sure that the battery pack life matches the lifetime of the vehicle is critical. The present work proposes a battery aging management framework which is capable of controlling the battery capacity degradation while guaranteeing acceptable vehicle performance in terms of driving range, recharge time, and drivability. The strategy acts on the maximum battery current, and on the depth of discharge. The formalization of the battery management issue leads to a multi-objective, multi-input optimization problem for which we propose an online solution. The algorithm, given the current battery residual capacity and a prediction of the driver&#39;s behavior, iteratively selects the best control variables over a suitable control discretization step. We show that the best aging strategy depends on the driving style. The strategy is thus made adaptive by including a self-learnt, Markov-chain-based driving style model in the optimization routine. Extensive simulations demonstrate the advantages of the proposed strategy against a trivial strategy and an offline benchmark policy over a life of 200 000 (km).},

The paper deals with design of E-clutch open-loop torque control strategy which includes compensation of clutch thermal expansion effects. A series of experiments have been conducted by using a custom-designed E-clutch test rig, in order to characterize influence of thermal effects on clutch control performance. A comprehensive analysis of test data reveal a strong correlation of clutch torque reduction and E-clutch slave cylinder (CSC) position increase caused by clutch pack thermal expansion. The determined dependence, where CSC position measurement serves for quantification of thermal effects, is incorporated within the clutch torque control strategy for the sake of thermal effects compensation. Furthermore, it is found out that the CSC position can be effectively estimated based on clutch temperature inputs, thus implying that the CSC position sensor can be omitted, while still keeping the possibility of effective thermal expansion compensation. The proposed clutch control strategy is examined based on experimental data acquired for two clutch friction plates/materials.},

In addition, this procedure is applied to a selection of five different models available in the literature for electric vehicle applications, obtaining a comparative study between them.

  abstract     = {This paper aims at designing an online energy management strategy (EMS) for a multi-stack fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV) to enhance the fuel economy as well as the fuel cell stacks (FCSs) lifetime. In this respect, a two-layer strategy is proposed to share the power among four FCSs and a battery pack. The first layer (local to each FCS) is held solely responsible for constantly determining the real maximum power and efficiency of each stack since the operating conditions variation and ageing noticeably influence stacks&#39; performance. This layer is composed of a FCS semi-empirical model and a Kalman filter. The utilized filter updates the FCS model parameters to compensate for the FCSs&#39; performance drifts. The second layer (global management) is held accountable for splitting the power among components. This layer uses two inputs per each FCS, updated maximum power and efficiency, as well as the battery state of charge (SOC) and powertrain demanded power to perform the power sharing. The proposed EMS, called adaptive state machine strategy, employs the first two inputs to sort the FCSs out and the other inputs to do the power allocation. The ultimate results of the suggested strategy are compared with two commonly used power sharing methods, namely Daisy Chain and Equal Distribution. The results of the suggested EMS indicate promising improvement in the overall performance of the system. The performance validation is conducted on a developed test bench by means of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) technique.},

However, with the trend of electrification, the connections between the seaport and ships are no longer limited in the logistic-side, but also expanded to the electric-side, which makes the future maritime transportation management as a complex transportation-power multi-microgrid coordination problem. In land-based applications, multi-microgrid coordination is a relatively mature technology and already brings enormous economic and environmental benefits, but there still exists some gaps before those land-based technologies being integrated into maritime applications.

Based on the deduced actual powertrain dynamics, the aim is to develop a short-term energy economy optimization strategy to fit the frequent transient operations of the HEV. The effort is paid to design a controller that is not the high-level control for long-term optimization with constraint of the battery state of charge (SoC). Taking the real-time driver demand as constraint, a hierarchical control scheme that guarantees the asymptotic tracking for the references of the powertrain status in terms of vehicle speed and engine speed is proposed by using the framework of Lyapunov stability theory. Under this precondition, an optimal torque distribution solution that minimizes the instantaneous energy consumption defined as the total cost on both of the fuel and electricity is found. The performance of the control system is validated by closed-loop simulations with a full-scale prototype HEV simulator. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed strategy in terms of energy economy and in tracking the references of the powertrain status.},

However, together with the increased flexibility, it comes with greater difficulty in defining an effective control strategy, both in terms of predicted fuel consumption and computational cost. To overcome the limits of the most diffused energy management strategies, slope-weighted energy-based rapid control analysis (SERCA) has been recently proposed. Nevertheless, so far, the algorithm has been applied to powertrains characterized by two operative modes solely. In this paper, we first present the inconsistency of SERCA applied to the whole set of multimode power-split arrangements. Subsequently, after correlating this divergence to the mode selection process, to overcome this draft, we introduce a novel strategy called SERCA + . This algorithm is proven to be robust and to achieve results close to the optimum benchmark with an insignificant increase in computational cost. Therefore, SERCA + could potentially find application in design methodologies for multimode power-split HEVs to accelerate the overall vehicle design process.},

  abstract     = {Driver identification faces various challenges in real-time applications. These challenges include high dimensional input data, moderate accuracy, scalability issues and need for custom-built in-vehicle sensors. The conventional biometric solutions are either less accurate, unscalable, or costly for practical application. In those solutions, high accuracy comes at the cost of the preservation of privacy. Similarly, scalability and cost-effectiveness are inversely proportional to one another. This paper proposes a driver identification scheme to pare these challenges. The scheme uses data from the global positioning system (GPS) to learn an individual&#39;s driving pattern, which is commonly deployed in in-car navigation systems and can also be found in general-purpose hand-held devices in the prevailing market. The proposed scheme is innovative in terms of providing a single solution for the existing challenges. It is more practical and scalable with large numbers of the drivers also being cost-effective and accurate, which makes it applicable in real-time applications with the least overhead costs for different resources. The consequent analysis and empirical results show that the scheme could identify drivers with significant accuracy given only GPS data. To assess the scheme in-depth, we perform experiments both on the collected data and the real-world open datasets. The average accuracy approximates above 96% for up to 25 drivers.},

  abstract     = {The technology for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been well investigated with the rising interest in autonomous driving. Visual odometry (VO) is a variation of SLAM without global consistency for estimating the position and orientation of the moving object through analyzing the image sequences captured by associated cameras. However, in the real-world applications, we are inevitably to experience drift error problem in the VO process due to the frame-by-frame pose estimation. The drift can be more severe for monocular VO compared with stereo matching. By jointly refining the camera poses via several local keyframes and the coordinate of 3D map points triangulated from extracted features, bundle adjustment (BA) can mitigate the drift error problem only to some extent. To further improve the performance, we introduce a traffic sign feature-based joint BA module to eliminate and relieve the incrementally accumulated pose errors. The continuously extracted traffic sign feature with standard size and planar information will provide powerful additional constraints for improving the VO estimation accuracy through BA. Our framework can collaborate well with existing VO systems, e.g., ORB-SLAM2, and the traffic sign feature can also be replaced with feature extracted from other size-known planar objects. Experimental results by applying our traffic sign feature-based BA module show an improved vehicular localization accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art baseline VO method.},

  abstract     = {Due to the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) and technological advancements of EV electronics, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technique, which utilizes EVs to provide ancillary services for the power grid, stimulates new ideas in current smart grid research. Since EVs are selfish individuals owned by different parties, how to motivate them to provide ancillary services becomes an issue. In this paper, game theoretic approaches using non-cooperative and cooperative game are proposed to motivate EVs to provide frequency regulation services for the power grid. In a non-cooperative V2G system, the interaction between the EV aggregator and EVs is formulated as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game. The EV aggregator as the leader decides the electricity trading price, and EVs as the followers determine their charging/discharging strategies. In a cooperative V2G system, a potential game is formulated to achieve the optimal social welfare of the V2G system. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium of these two games are validated. Our simulation results show that the proposed game theoretic approaches can motivate EVs to smooth out the power fluctuations from the grid while EVs schedule their charging/discharging activities to maximize their utilities. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the use of the V2G game in providing regulation services to the grid. Through cooperation and extra information exchange, the social welfare of EVs and the EV aggregator can be improved to the global optimum and the V2G regulation services can also achieve near-optimal performance.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and stable short-term traffic flow prediction is an indispensable part in current intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, a novel short-term traffic flow forecasting model termed as EnLSTM-WPEO is proposed based on ensemble learning of long short term memory neural network (LSTM), no negative constraint theory (NNCT) weight integration and population extremal optimization (PEO) algorithm. In the first stage, a cluster of LSTMs is constructed to separately forecast with different time lag, which is a significant element to affect the prediction performance. In the second stage, the PEO-based NNCT weight integration strategy is introduced to determine the weight coefficients of the ensemble model. The simulation results for six different datasets from highways of Seattle have testified the superiority of the proposed EnLSTM-WPEO to other six popular traffic flow forecasting models in terms of two commonly used performance indices and three statistical tests.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) has tiny environmental impact and will constitute a major mean of urban transportation in the future. Shared EV is quickly becoming a new business model under the sharing economy initiatives, providing easy access for commuters who possess no private cars. In this paper, we consider a carsharing company that owns EVs and some parking lots. Passengers can hire an EV at one parking lot and drive it to another one and pay for the service at a certain price determined by the company. A dedicated EV mobility model is proposed to capture the spatial transportation of energy without tracking every single vehicle. Price elasticity is described by a linear demand-price function. The company schedules the aggregated charging of unoccupied EVs in each parking lot, aiming at maximizing the total profit. Parking lots possess relatively large capacity and have to participate in a distribution power market; energy consumption is paid at the locational marginal price. The decision-making problem of the company is formulated as a bilevel program. The lower level simulates the distribution market clearing, and the upper level represents the pricing and charging scheduling problem faced by the company. Starting from a global polyhedral approximation of the power flow model, we develop an equivalent mixed-integer program based on primal-dual optimality condition and integer algebra technique, together with a warm-start strategy which accelerates computation remarkably. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed business model can reshape the load profile by shaving the peaking and filling the valley without harming the profit of the company.},

  abstract     = {Path-tracking control of a wheeled robot is a complex dynamical problem due to the system nonlinearities, external disturbances, and modeled and unstructured uncertainties. The problem is profoundly exacerbated for the robot traversing deformable terrains. This paper mainly addresses this problem by the following contributions: i) path-tracking control of terrain-based robots considering deformable soil dynamics for deriving tractive forces and moments arising from wheel-terrain interactions; ii) a novel modified moving integral sliding surface, where the dynamics of the sliding surface is regulated by an adaptive inverse neural network; and iii) path-tracking controller synthesis considering the terrain-induced uncertainties. For this purpose, a novel adaptive indirect controller is proposed to address the path-tracking control of a wheeled robot in the presence of external disturbances and wheel slippage using an integrated modified Integral Sliding Mode Control (ISMC) and adaptive neural networks (NNs). A compensating controller term is introduced to minimize abrupt variations in control demand that may arise from uncertainties related to terrain properties and the resulting wheel slippage and motion resistance. The adaptive rules are formulated considering the ISMC based control dynamics, while the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured via Lyapunov stability theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated considering a typical sandy loam soil for linear and curved trajectories. It is inferred that the proposed adaptive indirect ISMC-NN robust controller has the capacity to reach a satisfactory path-tracking control performance in the presence of disturbance and uncertainties arising from robots interactions with the deformable terrain.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel local motion planning framework in a hierarchical manner for autonomous vehicles to follow a trajectory and agilely avoid obstacles. In the upper layer, a new path-planning method based on the resistance network is applied to plan behaviors (e.g. lane keeping or changing), where the human-like factors can be included to simulate different driver styles, such as the aggressive, moderate, and conservative. The planned results (i.e. the lane-change command and the local planned path) will guide the lower-layer planner to decide the local motion. In the lower layer, for the sake of simplicity and alleviation of the computational burden, two separate model predictive controllers (MPC) based on a point-mass kinematic model are utilized for both longitudinal and lateral motion planning. Finally, a super-twisting sliding mode controller (STSMC) based motion tracker is designed to show the feasibility of the proposed decoupled planning method and decide the desired control actions of autonomous vehicles. Several scenarios are defined to comprehensively test and demonstrate the effectiveness and the real-time applicability of the new motion-planning framework. The results show that the proposed method performs very well in the planning and tracking process and takes less than 25 ms for the whole planning process, which can be easily implemented in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection in driving scenes is an important module for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. In recent years, many sophisticated lane detection methods have been proposed. However, most methods focus on detecting the lane from one single image, and often lead to unsatisfactory performance in handling some extremely-bad situations such as heavy shadow, severe mark degradation, serious vehicle occlusion, and so on. In fact, lanes are continuous line structures on the road. Consequently, the lane that cannot be accurately detected in one current frame may potentially be inferred out by incorporating information of previous frames. To this end, we investigate lane detection by using multiple frames of a continuous driving scene, and propose a hybrid deep architecture by combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN). Specifically, information of each frame is abstracted by a CNN block, and the CNN features of multiple continuous frames, holding the property of time-series, are then fed into the RNN block for feature learning and lane prediction. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method outperforms the competing methods in lane detection, especially in handling difficult situations.},

  abstract     = {5G wireless communication technologies aim at simultaneously achieving energy efficiency and spectral efficiency. 5G also demands high communication reliability. In this context, fine-grained temporal characterization of wireless channel can be used to enhance both. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware characterization of the temporally-varying wireless channel. Our characterization of temporal variation of the channel is based on the method of finite mixture of Gaussian distributions. However, unlike the classical Gaussian mixture model, the proposed characterization does not use an iterative algorithm for its parameter estimation; it depends on the current channel state and its statistics. Based on this characterization we estimate the quantity of data that can be transferred over the channel in a time interval without knowing the actual channel state in that duration. We propose an application context dependent upper bound on the time interval over which this estimation can be made. Our numerical results demonstrate that the present channel state plays a crucial role. When the proposed characterization is used in the context of channel adaptive communication, energy efficiency obtained is as high as 3.15 times over its nearest approach. A nontrivial trade-off between energy efficiency and precision of the proposed characterization is also investigated.},

Orthogonality of the waveforms in case of moving targets is analyzed. The implications of the code properties for the Range-Doppler map, as well as the Range-Angular map, are pointed out. Doppler frequency shift impact on such performance indicators as the target peak power and range sidelobe levels in the range-Doppler plane, as well as the range and azimuth sidelobe behavior, and the angular error in the azimuthal plane have been comprehensively studied for the first time. It is shown that the time-staggered transmit scheme with autocorrelation properties only (while introducing azimuthal errors) results in improved performance compared to code division multiplexing with auto- and cross-correlation properties.},

  abstract     = {In the radio channels of cellular networks, signals generally propagate through multiple paths in scattering environments. Multipath Components (MPCs) are shown to be distributed in different groups, known as clusters, in Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs). Clustering MPCs is a critical step in channel measurement and modeling. Many clustering algorithms have been proposed but few of them are able to handle noise effectively. In this paper, we propose a de-noising MPC-clustering framework based on a new Space-Transformed Fuzzy c-Means (ST-FCM) algorithm and the fusion of channel measurement snapshots. ST-FCM solves the issue that the Multipath Component Distance that quantifies the similarity among MPCs cannot be adopted in the conventional FCM algorithm. Then we apply the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to fuse the clustering results of multiple snapshots, which can detect and remove noise by making a full use of all the measurement data. Furthermore, we design a censoring process for hard partition and a validation process to determine the optimal number of clusters. We have performed extensive simulations on MPC clustering using the CIRs generated by the Third Generation Partnership Project 3-dimensional channel models. We also have developed a space-time channel sounder and have performed experiments in a typical rural macrocell scenario. The simulation and experiment results have shown that the proposed framework has a better performance in clustering accuracy than the current methods.},
