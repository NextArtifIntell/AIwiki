  abstract     = {In this article, we propose distributed continuous-time algorithms to solve the optimal resource allocation problem with certain time-varying quadratic cost functions for multiagent systems. The objective is to allocate a quantity of resources while optimizing the sum of all the local time-varying cost functions. Here, the optimal solutions are trajectories rather than some fixed points. We consider a large number of agents that are connected through a network, and our algorithms can be implemented using only local information. By making use of the prediction-correction method and the nonsmooth consensus idea, we first design two distributed algorithms to deal with the case when the time-varying cost functions have identical Hessians. We further propose an estimator-based algorithm which uses distributed average tracking theory to estimate certain global information. With the help of the estimated global information, the case of nonidentical constant Hessians is addressed. In each case, it is proved that the solutions of the proposed dynamical systems with certain initial conditions asymptotically converge to the optimal trajectories. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed continuous-time optimal resource allocation algorithms through simulations.},

  abstract     = {Asynchrony widely exists in microgrids (MGs), such as nonidentical sampling rates and communication delays, which challenges the MG control. This article addresses the asynchronous distributed power control problem of hybrid microgrids, considering different kinds of asynchrony, such as nonidentical sampling rates, and random time delays. To this end, we first formulate the economic dispatch problem of MGs, and devise a synchronous algorithm. Then, we analyze the impact of asynchrony, and propose an asynchronous iteration algorithm based on the synchronous version. By introducing a random clock at each iteration, different types of asynchrony are fitted into a unified framework, where the asynchronous algorithm is converted into a fixed-point iteration problem with a nonexpansive operator, leading to a convergence proof. We further provide an upper bound estimation of the time delay. Moreover, the real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in both ac and dc MGs is introduced. By measuring the frequency/voltage, the controller is simplified by reducing one order, and adapting to the fast varying load demand. Finally, simulations on a benchmark MG, and experiments are utilized to verify the effectiveness, and advantages of the proposed algorithm.},

Toward this goal, resilient containment control is investigated in this work. We propose secure protocols for both first-order and second-order systems, where each normal follower ignores the most extreme values in its neighborhood and modifies its state based on the remaining ones. Assuming that the number of malicious agents is locally upper bounded, sufficient conditions on the network topology are derived to guarantee the achievement of resilient containment.

  abstract     = {We consider ride-sharing networks served by human-driven vehicles (HVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). We propose a model for ride-sharing in this mixed autonomy setting for a multilocation equidistant network, in which a ride-sharing platform sets prices for riders, compensations for drivers of HVs, and operates AVs for a fixed price with the goal of maximizing profits. When there are more vehicles than riders at a location, we consider three vehicle-to-rider assignment possibilities: 1) rides are assigned to HVs first; 2) rides are assigned to AVs first; and 3) rides are assigned in proportion to the number of available HVs and AVs. Next, for each of these priority possibilities, we establish a nonconvex optimization problem characterizing the optimal profits for a network operating at a steady-state equilibrium. We then provide a convex problem which we show to have the same optimal profits, allowing for efficient computation of equilibria, and we show that all three priority possibilities result in the same maximum profits for the platform. Next, we show that, in some cases, there is a regime, for which the platform will choose to mix HVs and AVs in order to maximize its profit, while, in other cases, the platform will use only HVs or only AVs, depending on the relative cost of AVs. For a specific class of networks, we fully characterize these thresholds analytically and demonstrate our results on an example.},

This article introduces the causal dynamic graph (CDG) model, which defines this structure explicitly. We provide a data-driven method for recovering the input/output structure of a CDG when every process is measured.

In particular, the satisfaction of each of these signal temporal logic tasks depends on the behavior of a distinct set of agents. Instead of abstracting the agent dynamics and the temporal logic tasks into a discrete domain and solving the problem therein or using optimization-based methods, we derive collaborative feedback control laws.These control laws are based on a decentralized control barrier function condition that results in discontinuous control laws, as opposed to a centralized condition resembling the single-agent case. The benefits of our approach are inherent robustness properties typically present in feedback control as well as satisfaction guarantees for continuous-time multiagent systems. More specifically, time-varying control barrier functions are used that account for the semantics of the signal temporal logic tasks at hand. For a certain fragment of signal temporal logic tasks, we further propose a systematic way to construct such control barrier functions. Finally, we show the efficacy and robustness of our framework in an experiment, including a group of three omnidirectional robots.},

  abstract     = {Networked control system (NCS) refers to a set of control loops that are closed over a communication network. In this article, the joint operation of control and networking for NCS is investigated wherein the network serves the sensor-to-controller communication links for multiple stochastic linear time-invariant (LTI) subsystems. The sensors sample packets based on the observed plant state, which they send over a shared multihop network. The network has limited communication resources, which need to be assigned to competing links to support proper control loop operation. In this setup, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the weighted-sum linear-quadratic-Gaussian cost of all loops, taking into account the admissible sampling, control, congestion control (CC), and scheduling policies. Under some mild assumptions on the sampling frequencies of the control loops and the communication network, we find the joint optimal solution to be given by a certainty equivalence control with a threshold-based sampling policy, as well as a back-pressure-type scheduler with a simple pass-through CC. The interface between network and control loops is identified to be the buffer state of the sensor node, which can be interpreted as network price for sampling a packet from the control perspective. We validate our theoretical claims by simulating NCSs comprised of multiple LTI stochastic control loops communicating over a two-hop cellular network.},

In particular, for any given number of nodes N and diameter D, we identify networks that are maximally robust using the notion of Kirchhoff&#39;s index and then analyze their strong structural controllability. For this, we compute the minimum number of leaders, which are the nodes directly receiving external control inputs, needed to make such networks controllable under all feasible coupling weights between agents. Then, for any N and D, we obtain a sharp upper bound on the minimum number of leaders needed to design strong structurally controllable networks with N nodes and D diameter. We also discuss that the bound is best possible for arbitrary N and D. Moreover, we construct a family of graphs for any N and D such that the graphs have maximal edge sets (maximal robustness) while being strong structurally controllable with the number of leaders in the proposed sharp bound. We then analyze the robustness of this graph family. The results suggest that optimizing robustness increases the number of leaders needed for strong structural controllability. Our analysis is based on graph-theoretic methods and can be applied to exploit network structure to co-optimize robustness and controllability in networks.},

Using the insights obtained for the sensor placement problem, we provide an optimal strategy (computed in polynomial time) to attack the placed sensors.

The resilient sensor placement problem is to find a sensor placement strategy to minimize the trace of the steady-state error covariance of the Kalman filter corresponding to the sensors that survive the attack.

It is worth mentioning that the 2-D index model has the ability to characterize the instantaneousness of ideal impulses and describe complicated impulsive behaviors. To avoid Zeno phenomenon, the judging conditions for forward completeness are derived. Subsequently, an algorithm is designed to obtain the largest sampled point control invariant set (SPCIS) of a given set in the hybrid domain, and its validity is further authenticated. Accordingly, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the set stabilization of IBCNs in the hybrid domain, and all time-optimal sampled-data state feedback controllers are designed. The similar results are also obtained for IBCNs in the time domain. Compared with set stabilization in the time domain, set stabilization in the hybrid domain not only focuses on the dynamics at each time instant but also concerns every jumping state. It results in that every SPCIS in the hybrid domain is a subset of a certain SPCIS in the time domain. Eventually, the λ switch with impulsive disturbances is modeled as a reduced IBCN, which is presented to demonstrate the obtained results.},

This article proposes a framework for decentralized nonconvex optimization via bi-level distribution of the augmented Lagrangian alternating direction inexact Newton (ALADIN) algorithm. Bi-level distribution means that the outer ALADIN structure is combined with an inner distribution/decentralization level solving a condensed variant of ALADIN&#39;s convex coordination quadratic program (QP) by decentralized algorithms. We provide sufficient conditions for local convergence while allowing for inexact decentralized/distributed solutions of the coordination QP. Moreover, we show how decentralized variants of conjugate gradient and alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM) can be employed at the inner level.

For sparsity constraints, the approach of SI goes beyond the notion of quadratic invariance (QI): 1) the SI approach always yields a convex restriction and 2) the solution via the SI approach is guaranteed to be globally optimal when QI holds and performs at least, considering the nearest QI subset. Moreover, the notion of SI naturally applies to designing structured static controllers, while QI is not utilizable. Numerical examples show that even for non-QI cases, SI can recover solutions that are: 1) globally optimal and 2) strictly more performing than previous methods.},

  abstract     = {Many games have undesirable Nash equilibria. In such games, a designer&#39;s goal is to avoid “bad” equilibria. In this article, we focus on which players to control and how to control them so that the emerging outcome of learning dynamics is desirable. In particular, we consider best-response-type learning dynamics for an anticoordination network game. The designer&#39;s goal is to achieve maximum anticoordination with the fewest number of players to control at each round. Our analysis shows that despite the incentive to anticoordinate with neighbors, selfish agents may fail to do so. Accordingly, we relate optimal policies for obtaining maximum anticoordination to the set of Nash equilibria. Noting the combinatorial problem of optimally selecting players in benchmark networks, we develop suboptimal solutions via solving a minimum vertex-cover problem, and by greedily selecting players based on their potential to induce cascading effects. Numerical experiments on random networks show that the cascade-based greedy algorithm can lower the control effort significantly compared to random public advertising policies. Moreover, its control effort is no more than twice the optimal control effort in the worst case.},

In this article, we propose a theoretical motion planning control framework for a team of networked mobile robots to accomplish high-level spatial and temporal motion specifications while optimizing communication QoS. Desired motion specifications are formulated as signal temporal logic (STL), whereas the communication QoS to be optimized is captured by spatial temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) formulas. Both the STL and STREL specifications are encoded as mixed integer linear constraints posed on the system and environment state variables of the mobile robot network, where satisfactory control strategies can be computed by exploiting a distributed model predictive control (MPC) approach. A two-layer hierarchical MPC procedure is proposed to efficiently solve the co-optimization problem, whose recursive feasibility is formally ensured. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by simulation.},

In the outer loop, the cooperative algorithm is designed based on auxiliary systems, to let all agents go toward desired positions. Based on an extraction algorithm, the desired quaternion-based attitude is extracted. In the inner loop, the inherent passivity property is applied to compensate for the desired but unextracted angular velocity, which makes the hierarchical control procedure more separate. Combined with the inherent passivity property, the quaternion-based attitude and the proposed bump-like functions, a hybrid formalism is established for the attitude loop containing a hybrid control strategy. In this case, the global attitude control can be realized via determining the torque orientation and overcoming the topological constraint on SO(3). The effectiveness of the hierarchical control strategy is verified by the position-based formation of six miniature quadrotors.},

To do this, we exploit the concept of output controllability and of output controllability Gramian that permits to analyze the properties of the system, both in single-output and multioutput cases. Based on a projection method, we show that it is possible to obtain an approximated model that makes the computation of the Gramian and its interpretation much easier.

Considering the output robustness of PBCNs, the traditional approaches in the preceding literature are disabled. To this end, we use the strongly connected components to characterize the invariant subset. The salient advantage of this approach is that the obtained invariant subset is equipped with a minute structure. Then, a component digraph is constructed. Based on it, two necessary and sufficient criteria are, respectively, derived for finite-time and asymptotic output tracking of PBCNs. Moreover, one-bit perturbation is classified into three categories with respect to different influence on the output tracking.

This vulnerability stems from a coupling effect induced by hidden nodes. Cascading DoS attacks can congest an entire network and do not require the adversary to violate any protocol. We demonstrate the feasibility of such attacks through experiments with real Wi-Fi cards, theoretical analysis, and ns-3 simulations. The experiment shows that an attacker can cause the throughput of a node outside its communication range to vanish. To gain insight into the root causes of the attack, we model the network as a dynamical system and analyze its limiting behavior and stability. The model predicts that a phase transition (and hence a cascading attack) is possible in linear networks when the retry limit parameter of Wi-Fi is greater or equal to 7, and also characterizes the phase transition region in terms of the system parameters.},

The access to the limited communication resources is determined by a scheduler that decides which sensor measurement to transmit based on both observations. The scheduler has an energy-harvesting battery of limited capacity, which couples the decision-making problem in time. Despite the overall lack of convexity of this problem, it is shown that this system admits a globally optimal scheduling and estimation strategy pair under the assumption that the distributions of the random variables at the sensors are symmetric and unimodal.

We use the maximum entropy principle to solve the resulting optimization problem. In the dynamic setting, nodes and destinations are dynamic. We design an appropriate control Lyapunov function to determine the time evolution of facilities and paths such that the transportation cost at each time instant is minimized. Our framework enables quantifying attributes of the facilities and transportation links in terms of the decision variables.

In the literature, conservative global conditions guaranteeing the almost sure convergence toward the desired trajectory of a virtual node, the pinner, have been derived. In this article, we identify the minimal conditions on the individual dynamics, interconnection topology, and noise intensities, so that the network exponentially converges onto the pinner&#39;s trajectory. Specifically, we broaden the master stability function approach to deal with networks of coupled stochastic differential equations, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for local exponential pinning controllability of networks of stochastic systems. Interestingly, our analyses show that noise can be either beneficial or detrimental for pinning controllability, depending on how it diffuses in each node. Our analytical findings are illustrated with representative numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Stealthy attacks have become a major threat to cybersecurity. Previous works in this direction fail to capture the practical resource constraints and mainly focus on one-node settings. In this article, we propose a two-player game-theoretic model, including a system of multiple independent nodes, a stealthy attacker, and an observable defender. In our model, the attacker can fully observe the defender&#39;s behavior and the system state, whereas the defender has zero feedback information. Furthermore, a strict resource constraint is introduced to limit the frequency of the attacks/defenses for both players. We characterize the best responses for both attacker and defender under both nonadaptive and adaptive strategies. We then study the sequential game where the defender first announces its strategy and the attacker then responds accordingly. We have designed an algorithm that finds a nearly optimal strategy for the defender and provides a full analysis of its complexity and performance guarantee.},

In network routing problems, if network traffic is composed of many individual agents, it is known that self-interested behavior among the agents can lead to suboptimal network congestion. We study situations in which a system planner charges monetary tolls for the use of network links in an effort to incentivize efficient routing choices by the users, but in which the users&#39; sensitivity to tolls is heterogeneous and unknown. We seek locally computed tolls that are guaranteed not to incentivize worse network routing than in the uninfluenced case. Our main result is to show that if networks are sufficiently complex and populations sufficiently diverse, perverse incentives cannot be systematically avoided: Any taxation mechanism that improves outcomes on one network must necessarily degrade them on another. Nonetheless, for the simple class of parallel networks, nonperverse taxes do exist; we fully characterize all such taxation mechanisms, showing that they are a generalized version of traditional marginal-cost tolls.},

The main contribution of this article is a novel re-engineered delay aligning data flow controller, where a new static decoupling matrix is introduced. The intention is to obtain a multiple single loop control architecture that allows global robust $\mathcal {L}_2$-stability to be proven. The algorithm is suitable to regulate $n+1$ end-to-end roundtrip delays of a 5-G multiconnectivity connection toward zero pair-wise delay differences. The new stability result is decisive for massive deployment, since weaker results would increase the need for supervision and raise operating costs significantly.

The existing secure state observers, which estimate system state from sparsely corrupted measurements, often need to run combinatorial subestimators such that they demand tremendous memory occupation. To this end, this article proposes two adaptive observer structures with the low memory cost. First, a purely adaptive structure is developed under the constraint called P-problem, which allows the observer to automatically search the attack model and update the observer gain matrices. To remove the P-problem constraint, an event-triggered algorithm is further developed by trading off the estimation performance. These two strategies substantially reduce the memory occupation by online updating observer gain matrices rather than offline calculations. Another advantage of these schemes is the use of saturated output injection to mitigate the transient performance degradation in the search phase of the attack model.},

The goal of such algorithms is to optimize a global function that is the average of local functions using only local computations and communications. Several different algorithms have been proposed that achieve linear convergence to the global optimum when the local functions are strongly convex. We provide a unified analysis that yields the worst-case linear convergence rate as a function of the condition number of the local functions, the spectral gap of the graph, and the parameters of the algorithm. The framework requires solving a small semidefinite program whose size is fixed; it does not depend on the number of local functions or the dimension of their domain. The result is a computationally efficient method for distributed algorithm analysis that enables the rapid comparison, selection, and tuning of algorithms. Finally, we propose a new algorithm, which we call SVL, that is easily implementable and achieves a faster worst-case convergence rate than all other known algorithms.},

The interdependencies between the assets are captured by an attack graph, where an edge from one asset to another indicates that if the former asset is compromised, an attack can be launched on the latter asset. Each edge has an associated probability of successful attack, which can be reduced via security investments by the defenders. In such scenarios, we investigate the security investments that arise under certain features of human decision making that have been identified in behavioral economics. In particular, humans have been shown to perceive probabilities in a nonlinear manner, typically overweighting low probabilities and underweighting high probabilities. We show that suboptimal investments can arise under such weighting in certain network topologies. We also show that pure strategy Nash equilibria exist in settings with multiple (behavioral) defenders, and study the inefficiency of the equilibrium investments by behavioral defenders compared to a centralized socially optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the rigidity recovery problem of a formation controlled over an undirected sensing framework after a link is broken. In the formation control problem, mobile agents are controlled individually such that all interagent distances remain unchanged. The control law used by each agent is designed based on the relative positions of that agent to its neighbors, sensed in its local coordinate system. When the sensing graph is rigid, it has been shown that one can design a distributed control law to guarantee the stability of the formation. However, obtaining sensing measurements is a challenge in the formation control, since these systems are always subjected to sensing constraints, such as line-of-sight requirements and power limitations. This clearly affects the rigidity of the sensing graph, thus affecting the formation. This article proposes an online distributed algorithm based on the lattice of configurations to recover the distance-based controlled formation when a failure in a sensing link causes the network to lose its rigidity. The approach is to recover the rigidity of subframeworks of the formation, i.e., the subframework established by each node and its neighbors within the sensing range, by adding new sensing links locally so as to ensure a rigid formation. This article also proposes a multilayer rigidity recovery technique using a combination of sensing and communication networks, when the lattice of configurations fails due to a lack of neighbors for an agent. An upper bound is established on the delay in this indirect distance-measuring approach, which guarantees the tolerance of the formation against link failures. Simulations on a sample formation support the theoretical results.},

In most existing works about the control problems of k-valued logical systems, the controllers are injected to all the nodes or some randomly selected nodes. As a consequence, the control objectives, such as controllability and stabilization, can only be achieved when the logical system satisfies certain conditions. Motivated by this, in this article, a pinning controller design algorithm, including a constructive method to select the pinning nodes and Boolean sequence controller design, is proposed such that for any given k-valued logical system, it is controllable. First, an algorithm for reconstructing the transition matrix for a k-valued logical system is given such that it is controllable with the designed transition matrix. The selection of pinning nodes is considered according to the designed transition matrix and the properties of k-valued logical systems. The logical relationship between the control input nodes and the system nodes is given by solving some logical matrix equations. The control sequence design algorithm is also provided.

  abstract     = {We consider a scenario consisting of a set of heterogeneous mobile agents and a set of tasks dispersed over a geographic area. The agents are partitioned into different types. The tasks are partitioned into specialized tasks that can only be done by agents of a certain type, and generic tasks that can be done by any agent. Given this scenario, we address the problem of allocating these tasks among the available agents (subject to type compatibility constraints) while minimizing the maximum travel cost for any agent. We first look at the heterogeneous agent cycle problem where agents start at a common depot and need to tour the set of tasks allocated to them before returning to the depot. We provide a 5-approximation algorithm to solve this problem, regardless of the total number of agents and the number of agents of each type. We then consider the heterogeneous agent path problem (HAPP) where agents can start from arbitrary locations and are not constrained to return to their start location. We consider two approaches to solve HAPP. The first approach yields a 15-approximation factor, while the second yields a factor of 16.},

  abstract     = {We study an abstract myopic electricity market subject to general nonconvex power flow models and convex generator models (without discrete commitment variables) in a setting where there may be no market equilibrium that guarantees revenue adequacy of the independent system operator. A generalized version of convex hull prices (CHPs) are proposed and are defined to solve a novel multiobjective minimum uplift problem that captures the tradeoff between generator side-payments and potential congestion revenue shortfall (PCRS). A convex primal counterpart of this multiobjective minimum uplift problem, called the primal CHP problem, is formulated in terms of the convex hull of the set of feasible net power injections. Indeed the term convex hull price derives from the result that the CHPs are equivalent to the optimal Lagrange multipliers of the primal CHP problem. However, depending on the chosen model of the transmission network, the convex hull of the feasible set of net power injections may be intractable to evaluate. In this case, CHPs are approximated using state-of-the-art convex relaxations that are efficiently solvable. This is the first proposed method of approximating CHPs in polynomial-time that is general enough to accommodate the nonlinear transmission constraints in the AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem. In our abstract myopic market setting, we show that tight relaxations of the AC OPF problem can be used to effectively approximate CHPs that decrease potential congestion revenue shortfall significantly with little effect to side-payments.},

In order to prevent data collisions and reduce the energy cost, the weighted try-once-discard (WTOD) scheduling, which allows only a sensor unit to send its measurement data at each transmission instant, is considered to govern the disseminated information between the sensor units and a filter. The aim of the presented problem is to propose a novel fault detection method to determine whether there exist faults in discrete time-varying networked systems. To this end, in the presence of the WTOD protocol, two ellipsoids are obtained, which include all possible prediction states and measurement updated states. Then, the sensor fault occurs when there is no intersection between the prediction set and the update set. Furthermore, two recursive optimization methods are scheduled to look for minimal ellipsoids in order to improve fault detection performance. At last, the effectiveness and the applicability of our proposed fault detection method are demonstrated via a practical example.},

We develop a bilayered control strategy for a subset of buses that simultaneously guarantees transient frequency safety of each individual bus and asymptotic stability of the entire network. The bottom layer is a model predictive controller that, based on periodically sampled system information, optimizes control resources to have transient frequency evolve close to a safe desired interval. The top layer is a real-time controller assisting the bottom-layer controller to guarantee that transient frequency safety is actually achieved. We show that control signals at both layers are Lipschitz in the state and do not jeopardize network stability. Furthermore, we carefully characterize the information requirements at each bus necessary to implement the controller and employ saddle-point dynamics to introduce a distributed implementation that only requires information exchange with up to two-hop neighbors in the power network. Simulations on the IEEE 39-bus power network illustrate our results.},

We quantify system performance by its coherence, an H 2 norm that captures the steady-state variance of the deviation from consensus. We pose the problem of how to connect the subgraphs, by selecting a single connecting node in each subgraph, so that the resulting network of networks has optimal coherence. We then show that this problem can be solved by identifying the connecting node in each subgraph independently of the other nodes and subgraphs. Thus, the problem can be solved in polynomial time in the order of the largest subgraph. We prove that when the connecting topology is a tree, this solution is optimal even under a more general model that allows for multiple connecting nodes per subgraph. We also derive bounds on the best and worst coherence for a general network of networks with all-positive edge weights.

The MHSTs are modeled as a leader-following multiagent system and each train exchanges their states with its neighboring trains through a communication network. Then, an event-triggered scheme is designed to determine when the states of a train are transmitted to its local controller and neighboring trains. With this strategy fused into the dynamic model of MHSTs, a robust coordinated control scheme consisting of an event-triggered processor and a control protocol is presented. By utilizing Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory, a sufficient condition is achieved to guarantee MHST system stability and the safety requirements under communication delays and input constraints. A co-design algorithm for obtaining the controller gain and the event-triggered weighting matrix is proposed. Finally, numerical examples are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop online multistage decisions for procuring and dispatching generators with diverse capabilities to provably ensure reliability of power grid operations under high renewable uncertainty. We jointly consider both the day-ahead reliability assessment commitment (RAC) and the real-time dispatch problems. We first focus on the real-time dispatch problem and define “maximally robust algorithms,” in the sense that they are not dominated by any other algorithm in terms of reliability. We characterize a class of maximally robust algorithms using the concept of “safe dispatch set,” which also provides conditions for verifying grid reliability for RAC. However, in general, such safe dispatch sets may be difficult to compute. We then develop efficient computational algorithms for characterizing the safe dispatch sets. Specifically, for a simpler single-bus two-generator case, we show that the safe dispatch sets can be exactly characterized by a polynomial number of convex constraints. Then, based on this two-generator characterization, we develop a new solution for the multibus multigenerator case using the idea of virtual demand splitting (VDS), which can effectively compute a suitable subset of the safe dispatch set. A distinct advantage of our proposed approach is that it intelligently exploits the complementary capabilities of generators with different ramping capabilities, and thus leads to a larger safe dispatch set than existing approaches in the literature based purely on affine policies. Our numerical results on an IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that a VDS-based solution outperforms the standard approaches in the literature in terms of reliability, without sacrificing economy.},

This article studies the problems of topology and parameter estimation in radial balanced distribution grids where measurements are restricted to only the leaf nodes and all intermediate nodes are unobserved/hidden. To this end, we propose two exact learning algorithms that use balanced voltage and injection measured only at the end users. The first algorithm requires time-stamped voltage samples, statistics of nodal power injections, and permissible line impedances to recover the true topology. The second and improved algorithm requires only time-stamped voltage and complex power samples to recover both the true topology and impedances without any additional input (e.g., number of grid nodes, statistics of injections at hidden nodes, and permissible line impedances). We prove the correctness of both learning algorithms for grids where unobserved buses/nodes have a degree greater than three and discuss extensions to regimes where that assumption doesn&#39;t hold. Further, we present computational and, more important, the sample complexity of our proposed algorithm for joint topology and impedance estimation. We illustrate the performance of the designed algorithms through numerical experiments on the IEEE and custom power distribution models.},

One important class of localization schemes exploits the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) of a signal emitted by the target and detected by multiple sensors. In this article, we propose a fully distributed approach to TDOA-based localization and tracking of a moving target in 3-D space by a group of mobile robots. We utilize a networked extended Kalman filter to estimate the target&#39;s location in a distributed manner, and guarantee successful localization under fixed and time-varying undirected communication topologies if every agent is part of a network with a minimum of four connected, noncoplanar agents. Since localization performance under TDOA-based schemes degrades as the target moves away from the convex hull formed by the agents, it is important for the network to track the target as it moves in space. We thus further propose a movement control strategy based on the norm of the estimation covariance matrices, with a tuning parameter to balance the tradeoff between estimation performance and the total distance traveled by the robots. A numerical example involving robots with simplified 3-D dynamics is provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.},

In both cases, the edge-tuning problem can be stated as a feasibility problem involving bilinear matrix equalities, which we approach using a sequence of convex relaxations. Furthermore, we also address a design problem consisting of finding edge weights able to satisfy the aforementioned controllability constraints while seeking to minimize a cost function of the edge weights, which we assume to be convex.

  abstract     = {This article considers the optimal control and stabilization problems for networked control systems (NCSs) with asymmetric information. In this NCSs model, the remote controller can receive packet-dropout states of the plant, and the available information for the embedded controller are observations of states and packet-dropout states sent from the remote controller. The two controllers operate the plant simultaneously to make the quadratic performance minimized and stabilize the linear plant. For the finite-horizon case, since states of the plant cannot be obtained perfectly, we develop the optimal estimators for the embedded and remote controllers based on asymmetric information, respectively. Then we give the necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal control based on the solution to the forward-backward stochastic difference equations. For the infinite-horizon case, it is shown that the system is bounded in the mean-square sense if and only if there exist the solutions to the two coupled algebraic Riccati equations and the packet-dropout probability satisfies certain condition. Numerical examples on the unmanned underwater vehicle are presented to show the effectiveness of the given algorithm.},

Each UAV in the network is capable of sensing signals, performing computational tasks, and exchanging information with its immediate neighbors. Based on the limited local measurement and exchanged information only from neighbors, we aim to propose a fully distributed algorithm to integrate information from various measurements of individual UAVs. As an important building block of the distributed data fusion algorithm, a novel sum consensus scheme is also developed with only assuming row-stochastic weight matrices. Consequently, through the proposed distributed algorithm, each UAV is able to obtain a more reliable fused sensing result with higher accuracy, compared to the local measurement collected by the UAV itself. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic framework is validated by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.},

By using the dwell time technique and the Lyapunov stability theory, the observer error system is shown to be exponentially stable even under the influence of DoS attacks. Then, an algorithm is proposed to determine observer parameters with the aim of maximizing the ability to resist attacks. Besides, a novel fault-tolerant controller without causing chattering behaviors is designed to compensate for actuator faults. Moreover, it is proved that the developed controller solves the cooperative fault-tolerant output regulation problem by using a newly derived lemma.

  abstract     = {The vast infrastructure development, gas flow (GF) dynamics, and complex interdependence of gas with electric power networks call for advanced computational tools. Solving the equations relating gas injections to pressures and pipeline flows lies at the heart of natural gas network (NGN) operation, yet existing solvers that require careful initialization and uniqueness has been an open question. In this context, this article considers the nonlinear steady-state version of the GF problem. It first establishes that the solution to the GF problem is unique under arbitrary NGN topologies, compressor types, and sets of specifications. For GF setups where pressure is specified on a single (reference) node and compressors do not appear in cycles, the GF task is posed as n convex minimization. To handle more general setups, a GF solver relying on a mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic program (MI-QCQP) is also devised. This solver can be used for any GF setup at any NGN. It introduces binary variables to capture flow directions, relaxes the pressure drop equations to quadratic inequality constraints, and uses a carefully selected objective to promote the exactness of this relaxation. The relaxation is probably exact in NGNs with nonoverlapping cycles and a single fixed-pressure node. The solver handles efficiently the involved bilinear terms through McCormick linearization. Numerical tests validate our claims, demonstrate that the MI-QCQP solver scales well, and that the relaxation is exact even when the sufficient conditions are violated, such as in NGNs with overlapping cycles and multiple fixed-pressure nodes.},

Model-based control protocol is used to avoid continuous communication between neighboring agents. With the proposed hybrid ETM, the closed-loop MAS contains both flow dynamics and jumping dynamics, which cannot be described by the existing MAS models. By means of hybrid system framework and auxiliary variables, a hybrid model of the MAS is constructed to describe the flow dynamics and jumping dynamics. Based on this model, the Lypuanov-based consensus analysis and hybrid ETM design are developed, and the finite-gain L 2 stability property is guaranteed.

This type of noise is generated by a class of random measures with heavy-tailed probability distributions. We define a cumulative-scale parameter over the output variables, as a measure of aggregate fluctuation. We show that this class of measures can be characterized implicitly, because finding its explicit form in terms of network parameters is, in general, almost impossible. To this end, we offer several tractable upper bounds in terms of Laplacian spectrum and statistics of the input noise. Our results suggest that relying on Gaussian-based optimal design algorithms will result in nonoptimal solutions for dynamical networks that operate in the face of non-Gaussian noise.},

By utilizing the lifting technique, the 1-D delayed Markovian jump system and controller governing equations are converted into a stochastic and closed-loop 2-D delayed model to describe the control and learning actions. Utilizing a stochastic Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions in terms of matrix inequalities are derived such that the closed-loop system is mean-square stable and achieves the specified (W 1 , W 2 , W 3 ) -γ-dissipative performance. Under the assumption that the input matrix is full column rank in all modes of operation, a set of feasible sufficient conditions described by linear matrix inequalities is established by making use of the Schur complement.

At each time step, only a portion of the sensors are allowed to transmit data to the remote estimator and the packet might be lost due to unreliability of the wireless channels. Our goal is to find a scheduling policy that coordinates the sensors in a centralized manner to minimize the total expected estimation error of the remote estimator and the communication costs. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process. We develop an algorithm to check whether there exists a deterministic stationary optimal policy. We show the optimality of monotone policies, which saves the computational effort of finding an optimal policy and facilitates practical implementation. Nevertheless, obtaining an exact optimal policy still suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the number of processes is large. We further provide an index-based heuristic to avoid brute-force computation. We derive analytic expressions of the indices and show that this heuristic is asymptotically optimal. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The offset optimization problem seeks to coordinate and synchronize the timing of traffic signals throughout a network in order to enhance traffic flow and reduce stops and delays. Recently, offset optimization was formulated into a continuous optimization problem without integer variables by modeling traffic flow as sinusoidal. In this article, we present a novel algorithm to solve this new formulation to near-global optimality on a large scale. Specifically, we solve a convex relaxation of the nonconvex problem using a tree decomposition reduction, and use randomized rounding to recover a near-global solution. We prove that the algorithm always delivers solutions of expected value at least 0.785 times the globally optimal value. Moreover, assuming that the topology of the traffic network is “tree-like,” we prove that the algorithm has near-linear time complexity with respect to the number of intersections. These theoretical guarantees are experimentally validated on the Berkeley, Manhattan, and Los Angeles traffic networks. In our numerical results, the empirical time complexity of the algorithm is linear, and the solutions have objectives within 0.99 times the globally optimal value.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with structural controllability of a linear time invariant (LTI) composite system consisting of several circuits/subsystems. We consider subsystems with structurally similar state matrices, i.e., the zero/nonzero pattern of the state matrices of the subsystems are the same, but dynamics can be different due to different numerical values. Structurally similar subsystems arise in large circuits implemented using many similar smaller circuits and agent-based networks consisting of homogeneous agents. The subsystems may not be structurally controllable individually; however, structural controllability of the composite system can be achieved by sharing state information. Sharing of information among subsystems incurs cost and our aim is to design a structurally controllable composite system with minimum information sharing. Minimizing information sharing is the same as minimizing the number of interaction links between subsystems, referred to as interconnections. An optimal network topology is one with a minimum number of interconnections. This article presents a closed-form expression for the minimum number of interconnections for structural controllability and derives a polynomial time algorithm to find an optimal network topology. The algorithm is based on a minimum weight perfect matching algorithm and a so-called edge reconstruction process. The minimum number of interconnections required is formulated in terms of two indices we define in the article: maximum commonality index (α, N ) and dilation index (β I ). Loosely speaking, more connectedness of subsystems leads to a lower total value of α, N and β I . Further, α, N decreases if the subsystems have fewer numbers of connected components. We apply and verify our general result to special cases that arise in control, where the minimum number can be more directly obtained. The special cases considered are structurally cyclic subsystems, irreducible subsystems, and subsystems in controller canonical form.},

  abstract     = {Optimal, network-driven control of water distribution networks (WDNs) is very difficult: valve and pump models form nontrivial, combinatorial logic; hydraulic models are nonconvex; water demand patterns are uncertain; and WDNs are naturally of large scale. Prior research on control of WDN addressed major research challenges, yet either i) adopted simplified hydraulic models, WDN topologies, and rudimentary valve/pump modeling or ii) used mixed-integer, nonconvex optimization to solve WDN control problems. The objective of this article is to develop tractable computational algorithms to manage WDN operation, while considering arbitrary topology, flow direction, an abundance of valve types, control objectives, hydraulic models, and operational constraints-all while only using convex, continuous optimization. Specifically, we propose new geometric programming (GP)-based model predictive control (MPC) algorithms, designed to solve the water flow equations and obtain WDN controls, i.e., pump/valve schedules alongside heads and flows. The proposed approach amounts to solving a series of convex optimization problems that graciously scale to large networks. The proposed approach is tested using a 126-node network with many valves and pumps and is shown to outperform traditional, rule-based control. The developed GP-based MPC algorithms, as well as the numerical test results, are all included on Github.},

  abstract     = {Input saturation is a quite common phenomenon when implementing a controller. Failing to deal with the effect of input saturation may cause failure of the control tasks. This article develops fully distributed adaptive protocol design approaches for consensus of multiagent systems subject to input saturation with local output information. By introducing an extra internal state as the antiwindup compensator for each agent, two types of fully distributed adaptive protocols are presented, namely, edge-based distributed adaptive antiwindup protocol and node-based distributed adaptive antiwindup protocol. For the case with absolute output information, to further reduce the order of the protocols, the local observer as well as the integrated distributed antiwindup observer are designed, based on which a fully distributed edge-based adaptive antiwindup protocol is presented. Such an integrated observer suitable for the node-based protocol is also proposed, and the corresponding fully distributed node-based adaptive antiwindup protocol is then given. The discussions on the difference among the protocols designed in this article are also elaborated. The main feature of the presented protocols is that an extra term is introduced in the controller as the compensator, which plays a fundamental role in effectively tackling input saturation. The protocols given in this article depend only on local output information of each agent, without any use of eigenvalue information of the Laplacian matrix associated with communication topologies, and thus, are all fully distributed.},

We prove the existence of the solutions and solve the optimal control problems by the Pontryagin maximum principle and the forward-backward sweep method.

However, few results consider decentralized heading control when the speed of heading adjustment is restricted. In this article, we propose a simple hybrid-dynamical model based on pulse-coupled oscillators for decentralized heading control in mobile robots while accounting for the constraint on the rate of heading change. The pulse-coupled oscillator model is effective in coordinating the phase of oscillator networks and, hence, is promising for robotic heading coordination given that both phase and heading evolve on the same 1-D torus. However, existing pulse-coupled oscillator results require the phase adjustment to be instantaneous, which cannot hold for robot heading adjustment due to physical limitations. We propose a generalization to the standard pulse-coupled oscillator model to allow for the phase to adjust at a finite rate, yet still have the oscillator network converge to the desired state, making our approach applicable to robotic heading coordination under rate constraints. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs for the achievement of both synchronized and desynchronized heading relationships and experimentally verify the results using extensive tests on a multi-robot platform.},

We first linearize the synchronization error dynamics at identity, and show that the proposed controller achieves local exponential synchronization on any Lie group.

The agents are required to meet at a tunable desired point, which is unknown to all agents. To achieve this objective, we choose the cyclic pursuit strategy, which requires the minimum number of communication links. It is shown that the rendezvous can be achieved with at most one zero or negative gain in the presence of delay. A negative controller gain implies an antagonistic interaction of the agent with its neighbor, whereby it moves away from the neighbor. We find the bound on the negative gain such that rendezvous among all agents is possible. The margin on the negative gain decreases due to the presence of delay. An analytical expression has been obtained for the reachable rendezvous points in terms of an initial configuration of the agents, controller gains, and the delay. For fixed controller gains and increasing delay, the rendezvous point lies along the line joining the weighted centroid and the centroid of the initial configuration with the asymptotic nature toward the centroid when all gains are positive, while away from it when one gain is negative. For finite controller gains, the reachable set remains unchanged even in the presence of any finite delay. Numerical examples illustrate the presented results.},

In this article, we establish a games-in-games framework to capture the uncoordinated nature of decision making under adversarial environment at different layers. Specifically, each network operator controls the mobile agents in his own subnetwork and designs a secure strategy to maximize the global network connectivity by considering the behavior of jamming attackers that aim to disconnect the network. The solution concept of metaequilibrium is proposed to characterize the system-of-systems behavior of the autonomous agents. For online implementation of the control, we design a resilient algorithm that improves the network algebraic connectivity iteratively. We show that the designed algorithm converges to a metaequilibrium asymptotically. Finally, we use case studies of a two-layer MAS network to corroborate the security and agile resilience of the network controlled by the proposed strategy.},

Two challenges related to SNL are to find conditions leading to a uniquely localizable network and develop effective and efficient methods to solve SNL problems. This work first proves that infinitesimal rigidity, together with some mild conditions, is sufficient for unique localizability of a network considering additional relationships between nonadjacent sensors. On the other hand, solving an SNL problem is generally NP-hard due to its nonconvex constraints. Instead of ignoring the rank constraint used in existing relaxation methods, we convert the rank constraint in the SNL problem into its equivalent constraints and solve it alternatively by proposing the alternating rank minimization algorithm (ARMA). We start with the centralized ARMA to solve the exact SNL problem. Next, to improve the scalability for solving large-scale SNL problems, ARMA is extended in a distributed manner by decomposing the original problem into a group of subproblems, which can be solved independently. Finally, simulation cases are provided for both centralized and distributed ARMA to validate the improved localization accuracy, efficiency, and robustness by being compared to the state-of-the-art localization methods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, differential games with incomplete information, or Bayesian games, are formulated for multiagent continuous-time dynamical systems in a communication graph. These new Bayesian graphical games model the situation where the agents are uncertain about their actual payoff functions and must employ the evidence observed from the behavior of other agents to improve their estimation of the real setting of their environment. Two different solutions are proposed for the game. First, the agents play their best response strategies with respect to the policies of their neighbors; then, the agents prepare themselves for the worst-case neighbor policies. A tight relationship between the beliefs of an agent and its distributed control policy is established. Two belief update methodologies are proposed for the agents to review their strategies using information obtained from the graph topology.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, secure, remote estimation of a linear Gaussian process via observations at multiple sensors is considered. Such a framework is relevant to many cyber-physical systems and Internet-of-things applications. Sensors make sequential measurements that are shared with a fusion center; the fusion center applies a filtering algorithm to make its estimates. The challenge is the presence of a few unknown malicious sensors which can inject anomalous observations to skew the estimates at the fusion center. The set of malicious sensors may be time varying. The problems of malicious sensor detection and secure estimation are considered. First, an algorithm for secure estimation is proposed. The proposed estimation scheme uses a novel filtering and learning algorithm, where an optimal filter is learned over time by using the sensor observations in order to filter out malicious sensor observations while retaining other sensor measurements. Next, a novel detector to detect injection attacks on an unknown sensor subset is developed. Numerical results demonstrate up to 3-dB gain in the mean-squared error and up to 75% higher attack detection probability under a small false alarm rate constraint, against a competing algorithm that requires additional side information.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the design of an optimization-based cooperative path-following control law for multiple robotic vehicles that optimally balances the transient tradeoff between coordination and path-following errors. To this end, we formulate a more general multiagent framework where each agent is associated with a continuous-time dynamical model, which governs the evolution of its state, and an output equation that is a function of both the state of the agent and a coordination vector. According to a given network topology, each agent can access its state and coordination vector, as well as the coordination vectors of the neighboring agents. In this setup, the goal is to design a distributed control law that steers the output signals to the origin, while simultaneously driving the coordination vectors of the agents of the network to consensus. To solve this, we propose a model predictive control scheme that builds on a pre-existing auxiliary consensus control law to design a performance index that combines the output regulation objective with the consensus objective. Convergence guarantees under which one can solve this coordinated output regulation problem are provided. Numerical simulations display the effectiveness of the proposed scheme applied to a cooperative path following the control problem of a network of 3-D nonholonomic robotic vehicles.},

Unlike most of the existing literature investigating multi-UAV formation flying problems, which mainly focus on planner/controller design in order to achieve desired configurations, this paper aims at providing a quantitative description of the UAV formation maneuverability, which can serve as a metric for evaluating formation trajectory plans. Three common formations, namely perfect rigid formation, semiperfect rigid formation, and flexible formation are considered in this paper. Motion capabilities of these formations are analyzed in terms of turning performance. In particular, the feasible set of the formation heading rate is employed as the evaluation metric, based on which the relationships among these three formations are discussed. It has been proven that perfect rigid formation suffers from a rather limited mobility, while flexible formation has the largest feasible set of the formation heading rate in some situations. An interesting finding of this paper is that flexible formation is not necessarily more agile than semiperfect rigid formation with the same formation width, due to the special stall speed constraint of fixed-wing UAVs. Besides rigorous mathematical derivations, simulations have also been performed to further support the theoretical analyses.},

Sufficient conditions in terms of the solvability of some matrix equations are derived for the existence of the two protocols. Furthermore, a tractable algorithm is constructed for designing the protocol gains.

It remains a great challenge to systematically trace the source of cascading failures in power systems. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to describe the cascading outages of transmission lines in power networks. In particular, the direct current power-flow equation is employed to calculate the power flow on the branches. By regarding the disturbances on branches as the control inputs, the problem of identifying the initial disruptive disturbances is formulated with optimal control theory, which provides a systematic approach to explore the most disruptive disturbances that give rise to changes of branch admittance in addition to direct branch outages. Moreover, an iterative search algorithm is proposed to look for the optimal solution leading to the worst-case cascading failures. Theoretical analysis guarantees the asymptotic convergence of the iterative search algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out on the IEEE test systems to validate the proposed approach.},

In this paper, we use a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model to capture the virus spreading process and develop a virus-resistant weight adaptation scheme to mitigate the spreading over the network. We propose a differential game framework to provide a theoretic underpinning for decentralized mitigation in which nodes of the network cannot fully coordinate, and each node determines its own control policy based on local interactions with neighboring nodes. We characterize and examine the structure of the Nash equilibrium, and discuss the inefficiency of the Nash equilibrium in terms of minimizing the total cost of the whole network. A mechanism design through a penalty scheme is proposed to reduce the inefficiency of the Nash equilibrium and allow the decentralized policy to achieve social welfare for the whole network. We corroborate our results using numerical experiments and show that virus resistance can be achieved by a distributed weight adaptation scheme.},

Submodular functions are a discrete analog of convex functions and are extensively used in large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. While there has been a significant interest in the distributed formulations of convex optimization problems, distributed minimization of submodular functions has received relatively little research attention. Our framework relies on an equivalent convex reformulation of a submodular minimization problem, which is efficiently computable. We then use this relaxation to exploit methods for the distributed optimization of convex functions. The proposed framework is applicable to submodular set functions as well as to a wider class of submodular functions defined over certain lattices. We also propose an approach for solving distributed motion-planning problems in discrete state space based on submodular function minimization. We establish through a challenging setup of the capture the flag game that submodular functions over lattices can be used to design artificial potential fields for multiagent systems with discrete inputs. These potential fields are designed such that their minima correspond to desired behaviors, that is, agents are attracted toward their goals and are repulsed from obstacles and from each other for collision avoidance. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed distributed framework can be employed effectively for generating feasible trajectories in such motion coordination problems.},

By carefully embedding historical measurements into equilibrium conditions, we design an integrated estimation-control scheme to achieve the relative docking asymptotically. It is rigorously proved that the robot will converge to the desired docking position asymptotically provided that control gains are chosen to satisfy certain conditions. This scheme is further extended to multirobot systems to consider an integrated relative localization and formation control problem. Unlike widely used spatial cooperation in the existing literature, we propose to exploit both spatial and temporal cooperations for achieving formation control. It is proved that multirobot formation can be achieved with zero error for directed acyclic graphs. Several simulation examples are provided to validate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The ac optimal power flow (OPF) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in power systems engineering. For the past few decades, researchers have been relying on unproven heuristics to tackle OPF. The hardness of OPF stems from two issues: 1) nonconvexity and 2) combinatorial constraints (e.g., discrete power extraction constraints). The recent advances in providing sufficient conditions on the exactness of convex relaxation of OPF can address the issue of nonconvexity. To complete the understanding of OPF, this article presents a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to solve the convex-relaxed OPF with discrete demands as combinatorial constraints, which has a provably small parameterized approximation ratio (also known as polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) algorithm). Together with the sufficient conditions on the exactness of the convex relaxation, we provide an efficient approximation algorithm to solve OPF with discrete demands, when the underlying network is radial with a fixed size and one feeder. The running time of the PTAS is O(n 4m / ϵ T), where T is the time required to solve a convex relaxation of the problem, and m and ϵ are fixed constants. Based on prior hardness results of OPF, our PTAS is among the best achievable in theory. Simulations show that our algorithm can produce close-to-optimal solutions in practice.},

  abstract     = {The problem of self-coordination of a network of dynamical systems toward a common state is often referred to as the consensus problem. In view of its wide range of applications, the consensus problem has been extensively studied in the past few decades. However, most of the available results focus on static networks, challenging our mathematical understanding of coordination in temporal networks. In this article, we study discrete-time stochastic consensus over temporal networks, modeled as activity-driven networks. In this paradigm, each node has a specific tendency to create links in the network, measured through an activity potential. Differences in the activity potential of nodes favor the evolution of heterogeneous networks, in which some nodes are more involved in the process of information sharing than others. Through stochastic stability theory, we characterize the expected consensus state, which is found to be dominated by low-activity nodes. By further leveraging eigenvalue perturbation techniques, we derive a closed-form expression for the convergence rate in a mean-square sense, which points at a detrimental effect of moderate levels of heterogeneity for large networks. Simulations are conducted to support and illustrate our analytical findings.},

  abstract     = {Recently, controllability of linear systems has been studied for various applications in large networks in biology, physics, and engineering. To address scale and lack of precise knowledge of the network parameters issues, tools from structured system theory are well indicated for such study. Precisely, generic properties, i.e., properties that are true for almost all values of the parameters, can be stated. While most existing results concern networks of single integrators, in this article, we show that generic controllability of a network of identical single-input-single-output controllable and observable systems is ensured if and only if the structural controllability conditions are satisfied for the graph representing the network. This result constitutes an important generalization of the famous Lin&#39;s theorem stated in the 1970s. It is even the broadest generalization of this theorem.},

The primary objective is to search for controllability criteria beyond those already known for networks with homogeneous dynamics. The focus is on the effects of the network topology, node dynamics, external control inputs, as well as the inner interactions on the network controllability. It is found that a network of heterogeneous systems can be controllable even if the underlying network topology is uncontrollable. The finding, thus, unravels another fundamental property that affects the network controllability-the heterogeneity of the node dynamics. A necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the controllability of networked MIMO LTI systems with heterogeneous dynamics. For some typical cases, necessary and/or sufficient controllability conditions are specified and presented on the node dynamics, inner interactions, as well as the network topology.

Suppose the cell graph is Laplacian controllable by an input connected to some special vertex called the composite vertex. The composite graph is constructed by interconnecting several identical cell graphs through the composite vertices such that connecting these composite vertices alone forms the structure graph. We prove that the structure graph is SILC by an input connected to some vertex of the graph if and only if the composite graph is SILC by the same input connected to the same vertex. The second part of this article generalizes the path structure by viewing it as a serial interconnection of two-vertex antiregular graphs, with or without appending a terminal one-vertex path. We show that its SILC property is preserved if we increase the number of vertices of the antiregular graphs and/or that of the terminal path.

Here, the agents are described by second-order systems with different velocity damping terms, and the uncertainty of the network is characterized by two unknown nonzero parameters for each agent. Thus, the considered multiagent system can be employed to model the agent network with four kinds of relationships among agents: cooperative relationship and three different competitive relationships. To achieve the desired collective behaviors, a novel distributed Nussbaum-type adaptive controller is designed for each agent. With the help of Barbalat&#39;s lemma, it is proved that bipartite consensus can be asymptotically achieved, provided that the weighted network is structurally balanced and connected and that the velocity damping coefficients are chosen appropriately. It is further shown that distributed stabilization can also be asymptotically achieved for the case that the positive weighted subnetwork is connected and some suitable conditions are satisfied. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived analytical results.},

In the context of networked control systems, a new implementation method for ESC inspired by the well-known Luus-Jaakola algorithm is proposed. The main motivation is to minimize the communication burden associated with the search phase of ESC. In the proposed method, the controller only requires a notification of a change registered at the sensor, rather than the full information available at the sensor. This event-based approach leads to sporadic packet transmission. In addition, the proposed method is able to directly account for constraints while seeking the desired extremum. The constraints may be of the inequality or equality type. The algorithm&#39;s behavior is illustrated on a networked water pump control system.},

For the stealthiness constraint, we adopt the Kullback-Leibler divergence between attacked and nonattacked residual sequences. Two impact metrics are considered: the probability that some of the critical states leave a safety region and the expected value of the infinity norm of the critical states. For the first metric, we prove that the optimal value of the impact estimation problem can be calculated by solving a set of convex problems. For the second, we derive efficiency to calculate lower and upper bounds. Finally, we show compatibility of our framework with a number of attack strategies proposed in the literature and demonstrate how it can be used for risk assessment in an example.},

Various behaviors of the connected agents, mainly on undirected graphs, are achieved by well-designed couplings where consensus, formation, and deployment are some examples of the achievable behaviors. Composite behaviors stored in a behavioral bank can be selected by a suitable behavior selection mechanism that is controlled directly by the agent embedded artificial intelligence or indirectly through a mission planning utility. The detailed structure of the framework is provided, where the integration of first integral and nonlinear eigenvalue approaches constitute its core is presented. The nonlinear protocols can be converted into their equivalent linear-like protocols by applying a simple transformation. However, the needed conditions will be the same in both cases. Consensus protocols-both linear like and nonlinear-to achieve arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means are covered. A generalization using the mean-of-order-p is also provided. Stability and convergence issues are mainly handled using properties of M-matrices and Lasalle&#39;s principle. The use of state-dependent parameterization to control behaviors is presented. The multitude of primitive behaviors is used to build a more sophisticated behavioral bank that resides in each agent such that an agent can choose or follow the recently active behavior.},

  abstract     = {With dynamic electricity pricing, the operation of water distribution systems (WDS) is expected to become more variable. The pumps moving water from reservoirs to tanks and consumers can serve as energy storage alternatives if properly operated. Nevertheless, optimal WDS scheduling is challenged by the hydraulic law, according to which the pressure along a pipe drops proportionally to its squared water flow (WF). The optimal water flow (OWF) task is formulated here as a mixed-integer nonconvex problem incorporating flow and pressure constraints, critical for the operation of fixed-speed pumps, tanks, reservoirs, and pipes. The hydraulic constraints of the OWF problem are subsequently relaxed to second-order cone constraints. To restore feasibility of the original nonconvex constraints, a penalty term is appended to the objective of the relaxed OWF. The modified problem can be solved as a mixed-integer second-order cone program, which is analytically shown to yield WDS-feasible minimizers under certain sufficient conditions. Under these conditions, by suitably weighting the penalty term, the minimizers of the relaxed problem can attain arbitrarily small optimality gaps, thus providing OWF solutions. Numerical tests using real-world demands and prices on benchmark WDS demonstrate the relaxation to be exact even for setups where the sufficient conditions are not met.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a distributed state-and-fault estimation scheme for multiagent systems. The estimator is based on an ℓ 1 -norm optimization problem, which is inspired by sparse signal recovery in the field of compressive sampling. Two theoretical results are given to analyze the correctness of our approach. First, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition such that the state and fault signals are correctly estimated. The result presents a fundamental limitation of the algorithm, which shows how many faulty nodes are allowed to ensure correct estimation. Second, we analyze how the estimation error grows over time by showing that the upper bound of the estimation error depends on the previous state estimate and the number of faulty nodes. An illustrative example is given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The objective is to design distributed algorithms such that a team of agents seeks to minimize the sum of local objective functions in a finite-time and robust manner. Specifically, a distributed optimization algorithm, combined with a continuous integral sliding-mode control scheme, is proposed to solve this finite-time optimization problem, while rejecting local disturbance signals. The developed algorithm is further applied to solve economic dispatch and resource allocation problems, and proven that under proposed schemes, the optimal solution can be achieved in finite time, while satisfying both global equality and local inequality constraints.

  abstract     = {Target control of directed networks, which aims to control only a target subset instead of the entire set of nodes in large natural and technological networks, is an outstanding challenge faced in various real-world applications. We address one fundamental issue regarding this challenge, i.e., for a given target subset, how to allocate a minimum number of control sources, which provide input signals to the network nodes. This issue remains open in general networks with loops. We show that if this issue is relaxed to a path cover problem, then it can be further converted into a maximum network flow problem. A method called “maximum flow based target path-cover” (MFTP) with complexity O(|V|1/2|E|), where |V| and |E|, respectively, denote the numbers of network nodes and edges, is proposed. It is also rigorously proven that MFTP provides the minimum number of control sources to control the target nodes in directed networks if the target control can be relaxed to the path cover problem, whether loops exist or not. We anticipate that this paper would serve wide applications in target control of real-life networks, as well as counter control of various complex systems.},

Although it is reliable and resilient to local disruptions, extreme situations, such as natural disasters and political conflicts, can degenerate its capability of gas transportation and delivery, influencing other social activities. Evaluating loadability regions of natural gas networks is hard due to nonlinear constraints. This article proposes a fast computational tool for feasibility screening of natural gas load profiles. It first establishes the theoretical results on the convexity of loadability regions with sufficient conditions. Then, an asymptotic algorithm is applied to compute a sequence of inner polytopes that converges to the convex loadability region. Each polytope in the sequence can serve as a certificate for feasibility. The conservativeness of this inner estimation will decline along the monotone sequence. The algorithm is testified on a modified realistic Belgian natural gas system with multidimensional load profiles.},

To achieve asymptotic behavior, a robust continuous term with adaptive varying gains is added to alleviate the effects of the external disturbances with unknown bounds. In the case of a fixed directed graph, by introducing an integrate term in the auxiliary variable design, the final consensus equilibrium can be explicitly derived. We show that the agents achieve weighted average consensus, where the final equilibrium is dependent on three factors, namely, the interactive topology, the initial positions of the agents, and the control gains of the proposed control algorithm. In the case of switching directed graphs, a model-reference-adaptive-consensus-based algorithm is proposed such that the agents achieve leaderless consensus if the infinite sequence of switching graphs is uniformly jointly connected. Motivated by the fact that the relative velocity information is difficult to obtain accurately, we further propose a leaderless consensus algorithm with gain adaptation for multiple Lagrangian systems without using neighbors&#39; velocity information. We also propose a model-reference-adaptive-consensus-based algorithm without using neighbors&#39; velocity information for switching directed graphs. The proposed algorithms are distributed in the sense of using local information from its neighbors and using no common control gains.

  abstract     = {In this article, a protection placement problem for power network measurement system data integrity is considered. The placement problem is motivated from [G. Dan and H. Sandberg, “Stealth attacks and protection schemes for state estimators in power systems,” in Proc. 1st IEEE Int. Conf. Smart Grid Commun., 2010, pp. 214-219], where supervisory-control-and-data-acqui-sition and phasor measurement unit measurements can be selectively encrypted and protected to prevent false data injection attacks. The problem is shown to be NP-hard and an integer linear programming formulation is provided based on the topological observability condition by [G. Krumpholz, K. Clements, and P. Davis, “Power system observability: A practical algorithm using network topology,” IEEE Trans. Power App. Syst., vol. PAS99, no. 4, pp. 1534-1542, Jul. 1980.]. The description of the observability condition requires a graph connectivity constraint, which is found to be most effectively described by the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin conditions. For a specialization without line power flow measurements, the protection placement problem can be modeled by a domination-type integer linear program that is much easier to solve than the general formulation requiring graph connectivity. Numerical studies with IEEE benchmark and other large power systems with more than 2000 buses indicate that by using the proposed formulations, the protection placement problem can be solved in a negligible amount of time in realistic application settings.},

To reduce the amount of required communication, we develop a self-triggered algorithm that allows agents to communicate with the cloud only when necessary rather than at a fixed period. Unlike the vast majority of similar works that propose distributed event- and/or self-triggered control laws, this paper does not assume agents can be “listening” continuously. In other words, when an event is triggered by one agent, neighboring agents will not be aware of this until the next time they establish communication with the cloud themselves. Using a notion of “promises” about future control inputs, agents are able to keep track of higher quality estimates about their neighbors allowing them to stay disconnected from the cloud for longer periods of time while still guaranteeing a positive contribution to the global task. We prove that our self-triggered coordination algorithm guarantees that the system asymptotically reaches the set of desired states. Simulations illustrate our results.},

Our method is based on the chordal decomposition of sparse block matrices and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We first apply a classical parameterization technique to restrict the optimal decentralized control into a convex problem that inherits the sparsity pattern of the original problem. The parameterization relies on a notion of strongly decentralized stabilization, and sufficient conditions are discussed to guarantee this notion. Then, chordal decomposition allows us to decompose the convex restriction into a problem with partially coupled constraints, and the framework of ADMM enables us to solve the decomposed problem in a distributed fashion. Consequently, the subsystems only need to share their model data with their direct neighbors, without needing central computation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We initially consider on-off loads that switch when prescribed frequency thresholds are exceeded, together with a large class of passive continuous dynamics for generation and demand. The considered on-off loads are able to assist existing secondary frequency control mechanisms and return to their nominal operation when the power system is restored to its normal operation, a highly desirable feature that minimizes users&#39; disruption. We show that system stability is not compromised despite the switching nature of the loads. However, such control policies are prone to chattering, which limits the practicality of these schemes. As a remedy to this problem, we propose a hysteretic on-off policy where loads switch on and off at different frequency thresholds and show that stability guarantees are retained when the same decentralized passivity conditions for continuous generation and demand hold. Several relevant examples are discussed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed results. Furthermore, we verify our analytic results by using numerical investigations on the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) 140-bus system.},

Yet generally, the information propagation is affected by the type of interaction between individuals. In this article, we study the propagation problem over a network with antagonistic interactions, modeled as a signed graph. The sign attached to an edge in this graph characterizes the cooperative (positive edge) or antagonistic (negative edge) relation between agents. If the relation between an agent and its neighbor is positive, it will believe the information coming from its neighbor, otherwise it believes the opposite information. Following the above rule, we propose a novel information propagation model by a mean-field approximation. First, we give the threshold condition such that the zero equilibrium of the propagation model is asymptotically stable, which means that the information will eventually disappear in the network. Second, when the threshold condition is violated, by Brouwer&#39;s fixed point theorem, we prove the existence of nonzero equilibrium. Moreover, the influence of structurally balanced and unbalanced signed networks on the propagation process are analyzed, respectively.},

These algorithms are set up in the manner of a direct mechanism in which the queues reveal their states (backlog), and the scheduler chooses an allocation. In policies such as longest queue first (LQF), scheduling can be shown to yield short queue lengths. However, these algorithms are reliant on truthful declarations of state. Our goal in this article is to determine if a Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG)-type mechanism (a second price auction) that elicits truthful value will also possess the desired LQF-like behavior in a system of dynamically evolving queues. Our approach is to use the concept of a mean field game under which at each time instant, a queue chooses its bid as a best response to its belief that the bids of the others will be drawn independently from a common bid distribution. If this best response is itself a sample from the belief bid distribution, a mean field equilibrium (MFE) is said to exist. We show the existence of the MFE and find it using its structure that the results of the allocation policy are the same as LQF. Thus, the desired LQF-like behavior arises naturally under the second-price auction mechanism. We also present results on the accuracy of the model as the number of agents (queues) becomes large. Finally, using simulations with a large number of queues, we show that computation of the MFE is straightforward.},

This article formulates such a nonlinear timing relationship as a linear form based on a special algebraic structure. An algorithm is developed to find all legal send times that allow the control commands to be performed at the given time. It is pointed out that the problem for finding all legal send times is nondeterministic polynomial (NP)-hard. In addition, the method for finding the latest legal send time is presented, which has a polynomial complexity. This article also analyzes the robustness of networked control systems with perturbations, which decides the send time such that the actuators can perform the control commands at the specified time no matter how the time delays vary in bounded intervals.

  abstract     = {This article considers a 2-D persistent monitoring problem by controlling movements of second-order agents to minimize some uncertainty metric associated with targets in a dynamic environment. In contrast to common sensing models depending only on the distance from a target, we introduce an active sensing model, which considers the distance between an agent and a target, as well as the agent&#39;s velocity. We propose an objective function, which can achieve a collision-free agent trajectory by penalizing all possible collisions. Applying structural properties of the optimal control derived from the Hamiltonian analysis, we limit agent trajectories to a simpler parametric form under a family of 2-D curves depending on the problem setting, e.g., ellipses and Fourier trajectories. Our collision-free trajectories are optimized through an event-driven infinitesimal perturbation analysis and gradient descent method. Although the solution is generally locally optimal, this method is computationally efficient and offers an alternative to other traditional time-driven methods. Finally, simulation examples are provided to demonstrate our proposed results.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a novel physics-inspired traffic coordination approach and applies it to unmanned aircraft system (UAS) traffic management. We extend available physics-inspired approaches previously applied to 1-D traffic flow on highways and urban streets to support models of traffic coordination in higher dimension airspace for cases where no predefined paths exist. This article considers airspace as a finite control volume while UAS coordination, treated as continuum deformation, is controlled at the airspace boundaries. By partitioning airspace into planned and unplanned spaces, the article models nominal coordination in the planned airspace as the solution of a partial differential equation with spatiotemporal parameters. This article also improves resilience to vehicle failures with a resilient boundary control algorithm to update the geometry of the planned space when UAS problems threaten safe coordination in existing navigable airspace channels. To support UAS coordination at the microscopic level, we propose clustering vehicles based on vehicle performance limits. UAS clusters, with each UAS treated as a particle of a virtual rigid body, use leader-follower containment to acquire the macroscopic desired trajectory.},

For reconstructibility analysis, explicit and recursive methods are derived. A termination condition is provided to avoid the running of the recursive method longer than necessary. After that, if a general BCN is reconstructible, then an approach for observer design is given. The Luenberger-like observer for general BCNs is introduced to facilitate an online implementation. The state estimate always contains the real state and converges to the real state at a time not later than the minimal reconstructibility index.

To estimate the states of all targets, a consensus Kalman information filtering algorithm with an adaptive and finite-time matrix-weighted consensus strategy is proposed. When the communication network is strongly connected and the sensing network is time-varying while being always collectively observable, it is proved that if the targets&#39; system matrices are time invariant, the mean-square estimation errors of the sensors are bounded for any number of consensus iterations. If the targets&#39; system matrices are time varying and the number of the consensus steps per information filtering is larger than the diameter of the communication topology, the mean-square estimation errors of the sensors are also bounded. When each sensor is intermittently activated to observe the targets and the network does not remain collectively observable, an allowable lower bound of detection probability is derived to guarantee the stochastic boundedness of the estimation errors. Then, the filtering algorithm is applied to design a distributed containment controller for multiple agents to encircle multiple planar heterogeneous dynamic targets.

Agents of a network want to minimize the sum of local cost functions, each one depending on a local variable, subject to local and coupling constraints, with the latter involving all the decision variables. We propose a novel fully distributed algorithm based on a relaxation of the primal problem and an elegant exploration of duality theory. Despite its complex derivation, based on several duality steps, the distributed algorithm has a very simple and intuitive structure. That is, each node finds a primal-dual optimal solution pair of a local relaxed version of the original problem and then updates suitable auxiliary local variables. We prove that agents asymptotically compute their portion of an optimal (feasible) solution of the original problem. This primal recovery property is obtained without any averaging mechanism typically used in dual decomposition methods. To corroborate the theoretical results, we show how the methodology applies to an instance of a distributed model-predictive control scheme in a microgrid control scenario.},

Connecting these controlled observers into a network results in a distributed observer whose nodes produce unbiased robust estimates of the plant.

The resultant closed-loop algorithm tracks the solution of the time-varying optimization problem without requiring knowledge of (time varying) disturbances in the dynamical system. The analysis leverages integral quadratic constraints to provide linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions that guarantee global exponential stability and bounded tracking error. Analytical results show that under a sufficient time-scale separation between the dynamics of the LTI dynamical system and the algorithm, the LMI conditions can be always satisfied. This paper further proposes a modified algorithm that can track an approximate solution trajectory of the constrained optimization problem under less restrictive assumptions. As an illustrative example, the proposed algorithms are showcased for power transmission systems, to compress the time scales between secondary and tertiary control, and allow to simultaneously power rebalancing and tracking of the DC optimal power flow points.},

  abstract     = {Complex contagion models have been developed to understand a wide range of social phenomena, such as adoption of cultural fads, the diffusion of belief, norms, and innovations in social networks, and the rise of collective action to join a riot. Most existing works focus on contagions where individuals&#39; states are represented by binary variables, and propagation takes place over a single isolated network. However, characterization of an individual&#39;s standing on a given matter as a binary state might be overly simplistic as most of our opinions, feelings, and perceptions vary over more than two states. Also, most real-world contagions take place over multiple networks (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) or involve multiplex networks where individuals engage in different types of relationships (e.g., acquaintance, coworker, family, etc.). To this end, this paper studies multistage complex contagions that take place over multilayer or multiplex networks. Under a linear threshold based contagion model, we first give analytic results for the expected size of global cascades, that is, cases where a randomly chosen node can initiate a propagation that eventually reaches a positive fraction of the whole population. Next, we analytically derive the probability of triggering global cascades. Then, analytic results are confirmed and supported by an extensive numerical study. In addition, we demonstrate how the dynamics of complex contagions is affected by the extra weight exerted by hyperactive nodes and by the structural properties of the networks. In particular, we reveal an interesting connection between the assortativity of a network and the impact of hyperactive nodes on the cascade size.},

IoT networks are naturally two layers with the cloud and cellular networks coexisting with the underlaid device-to-device communications. The connectivity of IoTs plays an important role in information dissemination for mission-critical and civilian applications. However, IoT communication networks are vulnerable to cyber attacks including the denial-of-service and jamming attacks, resulting in link removals in the IoT network. In this paper, we develop a heterogeneous IoT network design framework in which a network designer can add links to provide additional communication paths between two nodes or secure links against attacks by investing resources. By anticipating the strategic cyber attacks, we characterize the optimal design of the secure IoT network by first providing a lower bound on the number of links a secure network requires for a given budget of protected links, and then developing a method to construct networks that satisfy the heterogeneous network design specifications. Therefore, each layer of the designed heterogeneous IoT network is resistant to a predefined level of malicious attacks with minimum resources. Finally, we provide case studies on the Internet of Battlefield Things to corroborate and illustrate our obtained results.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the problem of robust distributed sampling of a field in the presence of unreliable sensors/agents. An algorithm is devised to estimate the maximum of the field over the domain spanned by the agents where some of the sensors can sample wrong measurements over a finite time, higher than the maximum field value. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given to guarantee convergence to the maximum field value and a robust and redundant algorithm design is presented by combining an exhaustive ergodic search with multiagent consensus protocols. In this original setup, the presence of unilateral interactions and exogenous signals is considered, the latter representing the measures sampled by the agents. Representative examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and conditions.},

  abstract     = {An important challenge in controlling distributed parameter systems is implementing feedback control laws over an infinite-dimensional space. One widely studied approach is to place sensors at a set of discrete locations and then approximate the state feedback using the sensor outputs. This approach naturally raises the question of where the sensors should be located. In this paper, we investigate the problem of placing a set of sensors on the unit interval in order to minimize the mean-square deviation between a desired infinite-dimensional control law, and an approximate finite-dimensional controller obtained by applying state feedback at the chosen sensor positions. We propose a greedy algorithm and derive optimality bounds on the selected set of sensors. We also present a simplified greedy algorithm in which the incremental improvements from adding each sensor are not updated at each step. We analyze the performance of the approaches under two scenarios. In the case where the sensor placements are constrained such that each of the detection radii of each pair of sensors do not overlap, we show that the two algorithms are equivalent and achieve a 1/2 + ε optimality guarantee, where ε can be made arbitrarily small at the cost of increased computational overhead. When overlaps exist between sensor detection areas, we derive an optimality bound for the simplified algorithm. The value of the optimality bound is determined by the sensor model, cardinality of sensor set, and the allowed minimum sensor distance. Our approach is illustrated through numerical study, in which we compare our proposed greedy algorithm, the current state-of-the-art approach, and the true optimum obtained from exhaustive search.},

To overcome this limitation, we first introduce a generalized susceptible-infected-susceptible spreading model that allows transmission and recovery times to follow phase-type distributions. In this context, we derive a lower bound on the exponential decay rate toward the infection-free equilibrium of the spreading model without relying on mean-field approximations. Based on our results, we illustrate how the particular shape of the transmission/recovery distribution influences the exponential rate of convergence toward the equilibrium.},

In this paper, an infinite horizon linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) system is considered wherein the control inputs transmitted over cyber links are vulnerable to compromise and false data injection by adversaries. The adversarial cyber-attack is driven to minimize the performance of the LQG system, and the controller is equipped with an intrusion detection system that monitors the sequence of internal physical states to detect adversarial input modification. The problem is formulated as a two-player zero-sum game with the false alarm probability as the reward, wherein the attacker aims to achieve a target increase in controller cost while maximizing the false alarm probability, and a detector who wishes to minimize the false alarm probability while remaining consistent. It is shown that in such a game, an ε-equilibrium exists. The equilibrium attacker strategy is the one that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance between legitimate and falsified state dynamics, and the equilibrium detector strategy is the corresponding likelihood-ratio test. Numerical simulations are presented that showcase the equilibrium strategy pair and the intuitive strategies comparisons.},

  abstract     = {Data crowdsourcing has found a broad range of applications (e.g., environmental monitoring and image classification) by leveraging the “wisdom” of a potentially large crowd of “workers” (e.g., mobile users). A key metric of crowdsourcing is data accuracy, which relies on the quality of the participating workers&#39; data (e.g., the probability that the data are equal to the ground truth). However, the data quality of a worker can be its own private information (which the worker learns, e.g., based on its location) that it may have incentive to misreport, which can, in turn, mislead the crowdsourcing requester about the accuracy of the data. This issue is further complicated by the fact that the worker can also manipulate its effort made in the crowdsourcing task and the data reported to the requester, which can also mislead the requester. In this paper, we devise truthful crowdsourcing mechanisms for quality, effort, and data elicitation (QEDE), which incentivize strategic workers to truthfully report their private worker quality and data to the requester, and make truthful effort as desired by the requester. The truthful design of the QEDE mechanisms overcomes the lack of ground truth and the coupling in the joint elicitation of the worker quality, effort, and data. Under the QEDE mechanisms, we characterize the socially optimal and the requester&#39;s optimal (RO) task assignments, and analyze their performance. We show that the RO assignment is determined by the largest “virtual quality” rather than the highest quality among workers, which depends on the worker&#39;s quality and the quality&#39;s distribution. We evaluate the QEDE mechanisms using simulations that demonstrate the truthfulness of the mechanisms and the performance of the optimal task assignments.},

Previous distributed algorithms that aimed at accomplishing this task have nontrivial demands, in that they require point-to-point communication capabilities among the agents, which may need to exchange large amounts of data in order to execute their computations. Within the proposed approach, instead, the agents need no prior knowledge about their neighbors and can simply communicate using broadcasts. The proposed solution consists in organizing data transmission following a token-passing approach, thus limiting the communication effort with respect to synchronous distributed implementations; furthermore, the token-passing phase is implemented via the broadcast-only communication, thus avoiding the requirements of the point-to-point communication. As shown via simulations, the latter feature is obtained at the cost of a modest increase in data transmission with respect to a traditional point-to-point token-passing scheme.},

The approach dealt with combines, in a holistic way, a distributed fault detection and isolation algorithm with a specific tube-based model predictive control scheme. A distributed fault-tolerant control strategy is illustrated to guarantee overall stability and constraint satisfaction even after the occurrence of a fault. In particular, each subsystem is controlled and monitored by a local unit. The fault diagnosis component consists of a passive set-based fault detection algorithm and an active fault isolation one, yielding fault-isolability subject to local input and state constraints. The distributed active fault isolation module-thanks to a modification of the local inputs-allows to isolate the fault that has occurred, avoiding the usual drawback of controllers that possibly hide the effect of the faults. The Active Fault Isolation method is used as a decision support tool for the fault-tolerant control strategy after fault detection. The distributed design of the tube-based model predictive control allows the possible disconnection of faulty subsystems or the reconfiguration of local controllers after fault isolation. Simulation results on a well-known power network benchmark show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

Often, such interactions occur through different types of functions giving rise to so-called multiplex networks. As an example, two masses can interact through both a spring and a damper. In many practical applications, the multiplex network topology is unknown, and global information is not available. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed approach to infer the network topology for a class of networks with both nonlinear node dynamics and multiplex couplings. In our strategy, the estimators measure only local network states but cooperate with their neighbors to fully infer the network topology. Sufficient conditions for stability and convergence are derived using appropriate Lyapunov functions. Applications to networks of chaotic oscillators and multirobot manipulation are presented to validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

The system is monitored by a control center that collects output measurements from the agents after every event and estimates the eigenvalues of the model to keep track of any adverse impact of the disturbance on its spectral characteristics. Sharing measurements in this way, however, can be susceptible to privacy breaches. If an intruder gains access to these measurements, she may estimate the values of sensitive model parameters and launch more severe attacks. To prevent this, we employ a differential privacy framework by which agents can add synthetic noise to their measurements before sending them to the control center. The noise is designed carefully by characterizing the sensitivity of the system so that it limits the intruder from inferring any incremental change in the sensitive parameters, thereby protecting their privacy. Our numerical results show that the proposed design results in marginal degradation in eigenvalue estimation when compared to the error incurred by the intruder in identifying the sensitive parameters.},

Each sensor observes distinct Gaussian random variables, which may be correlated. This system can be analyzed as a team decision problem with two agents: the scheduler and the remote estimator. The scheduler observes the output of both sensors and chooses which of the two is revealed to the remote estimator. The goal is to jointly design scheduling and estimation policies that minimize a mean-squared estimation error criterion. The person-by-person optimality of a policy pair called “max-scheduling/mean-estimation” is established, where the measurement with the largest absolute value is revealed to the estimator, which uses a corresponding conditional mean operator. This result is obtained for independent Gaussian random variables, and correlated Gaussian random variables with symmetric variances. Finally, the joint design of scheduling and linear estimation policies for any two Gaussian random variables with an arbitrary correlation structure is considered. In this case, the optimization problem is recast as a difference-of-convex program, and locally optimal solutions can be found using a simple numerical procedure.},

  abstract     = {Classes of performance measures expressed in terms of H 2 -norms have been recently introduced to quantify the response of coupled dynamical systems to external perturbations. So far, investigations of these performance measures have been restricted to nodal perturbations. Here, we go beyond these earlier works and consider the equally important, but so far neglected case of line perturbations. We consider a network-reduced power system, where a Kron reduction has eliminated passive buses. Identifying the effect that a line fault in the physical network has on the Kron-reduced network, we find that performance measures depend on whether the faulted line connects two passive, two active buses, or one active to one passive bus. In all cases, performance measures depend quadratically on the original load on the faulted line times a topology-dependent factor. Our theoretical formalism being restricted to Dirac-δ perturbations, we investigate numerically the validity of our results for finite-time line faults. For uniform damping over inertia ratios, we find good agreement with theoretical predictions for longer fault durations in systems with more inertia, for which eigen modes of the network are harder to excite.},

  abstract     = {This study considers the control of parent-child systems where a parent system is acted on by a set of controllable child systems (i.e., a swarm). Examples of such systems include a swarm of robots pushing an object over a surface, a swarm of aerial vehicles carrying a large load, or a set of end-effectors manipulating an object. In this paper, a general approach for decoupling the swarm from the parent system through a low-dimensional abstract state space is presented. The conditions that enable this approach are given along with how constraints on both systems propagate through the abstract state and impact the requirements of their controllers. To demonstrate, several controllers with hard state constraints are designed to track a given desired angle trajectory of a tilting plane with a swarm of robots driving on top. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous swarms of varying sizes and properties are considered to test the robustness of this architecture. The controllers are shown to be locally asymptotically stable and are demonstrated in simulation.},

Based on the wiring digraph of a BCN rather than the state transition digraph, an algorithm is proposed to construct a corresponding permutation digraph and permutation system. Then, we prove that if there exists a pinning controller such that the outputs of a permutation system are robust w.r.t. disturbances, then there must also exist another pinning controller such that the outputs of the corresponding original systems achieve robustness. Furthermore, pinning controllers are designed based on the neighbors of the pinned-nodes rather than all of the nodes.

We consider diffusively coupled networks comprised of maximal equilibrium-independent passive (MEIP) dynamics on the nodes, and a general class of nonlinear coupling functions on the edges. The first contribution of this paper is to generalize the classical notion of signed networks for graphs with scalar weights to graphs with nonlinear edge functions using notions from the passivity theory. We show that the output of the network can finally form one or several steady-state clusters if all edges are positive and, in particular, all nodes can reach an output agreement if there is a connected subnetwork spanning all nodes and strictly positive edges. When there are nonpositive edges added to the network, we show that the tension of the network still converges to the equilibria of the edge functions if the relative outputs of the nodes connected by nonpositive edges converge to their equilibria. Furthermore, we establish the equivalent circuit models for signed nonlinear networks, and define the concept of equivalent edge functions, which is a generalization of the notion of the effective resistance. We finally characterize the relationship between the convergence property and the equivalent edge function, when a nonpositive edge is added to a strictly positive network comprised of nonlinear integrators. We show that the convergence of the network is always guaranteed, if the sum of the equivalent edge function of the previous network and the new edge function is passive.},

We then construct a set of verifiers to track all of these string collections. Checking if all of the indistinguishable string collections are valid or not can be done by checking if the states in these verifiers are “good” or “bad”. The specification language is delay co-observable if and only if there are no “bad” states in all verifiers.

Due to a limited communication capacity of the channel, not all plants can exchange information with their controllers at any instant of time. We propose a method to find periodic scheduling policies under which global asymptotic stability of each plant in the NCS is preserved. The individual plants are represented as switched systems, and the NCS is expressed as a weighted directed graph. We construct stabilizing scheduling policies by employing cycles on the underlying weighted directed graph of the NCS that satisfy appropriate contractivity conditions.

However, most work has only focused on communication and computation costs without accounting for data caching costs. Given the increasing interest in cache networks, this is a serious deficiency. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy consumption in data communication, computation and caching (C3) with a quality-of-information (QoI) guarantee in a communication network. Our goal is to identify the optimal data compression rates and cache placement over the network that minimizes the overall energy consumption in the network. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with nonconvex functions, which is non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) in general. We propose a variant of the spatial branch-and-bound algorithm (V-SBB) that can provide an $\epsilon$-global optimal solution to the problem. By extensive numerical experiments, we show that the C3 optimization framework improves the energy efficiency by up to 88% compared to any optimization that only considers either communication and caching or communication and computation. Furthermore, the V-SBB technique provides comparatively better solutions than some other MINLP solvers at the cost of additional computation time.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a fully distributed control protocol that achieves time-varying group formation tracking for linear multiagent systems connected via a directed graph. The group formation tracking often leads to sub-formations especially when the leaders are placed far apart or they have separate control inputs. In the proposed approach, the followers are distributed into several subgroups and each subgroup attains the predefined subformation along with encompassing the leaders. Each subgroup can be assigned multiple leaders, contrary to the single-leader case considered in most existing literature, which makes the current problem nontrivial. When multiple leaders exist in a subgroup, the subformation attained by that subgroup keeps tracking a convex combination of the states of the leaders. A distributed adaptive control protocol has been introduced in this paper which uses only relative state information and, thus, avoids direct computation of the graph Laplacian matrix. Due to the virtue of this, the proposed scheme remains effective even when some of the agents get disconnected from the network due to sudden communication failure. An algorithm is provided to outline the steps to design the control law to attain time-varying group formation tracking with multiple leaders. Toward the end, a case study on multitarget surveillance operation is taken up to show an important application of the proposed adaptive control technique.},

To circumvent the aforementioned difficulty, we decouple it into two steps. First, the idea of an unknown input observer is introduced to propose the distributed observer, which can estimate the consensus error in fixed time. The fully distributed adaptive protocol is then generated by the proposed distributed observer to achieve consensus tracking. Both the full-order and reduced-order distributed fixed-time observers are proposed to form fully distributed adaptive protocols based on only relative output information, without using any eigenvalue information of the Laplacian matrix, or exchanged information of distributed observers between neighboring agents.},

  abstract     = {Complex systems in the real world inevitably suffer from unpredictable perturbations, which can trigger system disasters, wreaking significant economical losses. To exploit the robustness of complex systems in the face of disturbances is of great significance. One of the most useful methods for system robustness analysis comes from the field of complex networks characterized by percolation theories. Many percolation theories, therefore, have been developed by researchers to investigate the robustness of diverse complex networks. Nevertheless, extant percolation theories are primarily devised for multilayer or interdependent networks. Little endeavor is dedicated to systems with multipartitivity structures, that is, multipartite networks, which are an indispensable part of complex networks. This paper fills this research gap by theoretically examining the robustness of multipartite networks under random or target node attacks. The generic percolation theory for robustness analysis of multipartite networks is accordingly put forward. To validate the correctness of the proposed percolation theory, we carry out simulations on computer-generated multipartite networks with Poisson degree distributions. The results yielded by the proposed theory coincide well with the simulations. Both theoretical and simulation results suggest that complex systems with multipartitivity structures could be more robust than those with multilayer structures.},

  abstract     = {It is known that connected and autonomous vehicles are capable of maintaining shorter headway and distances when they form platoons of vehicles. Thus, such technologies can potentially increase the road capacities of traffic networks. Consequently, it is envisioned that their deployment will also increase the overall network mobility. In this paper, we examine the validity of this expected impact, assuming that drivers select their routes selfishly, in traffic networks with mixed vehicle autonomy, that is, traffic networks with both regular and autonomous vehicles. We consider a nonatomic routing game on a network with inelastic (fixed) demands for a set of network origin destination (O/D) pairs, and study how replacing a fraction of regular vehicles by autonomous vehicles will affect the mobility of the network. Using well-known U.S. Bureau of Public Roads traffic delay models, we show that the resulting Wardrop equilibrium is not necessarily unique for networks with mixed autonomy. Then, we state the conditions under which the total network delay at equilibrium is guaranteed to not increase as the fraction of autonomous vehicles increases. However, we show that when these conditions do not hold, counterintuitive behaviors may occur-the total network delay can grow as the fraction of autonomous cars increases. In particular, we prove that for networks with a single O/D pair, if the road degrees of capacity asymmetry (i.e., the ratio between the road capacity when all vehicles are regular and the road capacity when all vehicles are autonomous) are homogeneous, the total delay is: 1) unique and 2) a nonincreasing continuous function of the fraction of autonomous vehicles in the network. We show that for heterogeneous degrees of capacity asymmetry, the total delay is not unique, and it can further grow as the fraction of autonomous vehicles increases. We demonstrate that similar behaviors may be observed in networks with multiple O/D pairs. We further bound such performance degradations due to the introduction of autonomy in general homogeneous networks.},

  abstract     = {Linear consensus protocol is an iterative distributed algorithm with asymptotic convergence guarantees. This paper develops and analyzes an algorithm for agents running linear consensus iterations to detect convergence to consensus within a specified error tolerance in a distributed manner. The distributed stopping criterion allows for time-varying bounded delays in information transmission and reception between agents. The algorithm relies on distributively determining the maximum and minimum values held by the agents. This paper further develops an algorithm for average consensus that utilizes a distributive stopping criterion, based on maximum and minimum consensus, where no centralized coordination is needed on how each agent weights its neighbor&#39;s values. Here, the doubly stochastic assumption on the weight matrix is relaxed and only column stochasticity is needed. The effectiveness of the algorithms is demonstrated by simulations and a comparison with prior work in the literature. Moreover, the demonstration of the proposed algorithms on an experimental test bed of Raspberry-Pi agents communicating wirelessly validates its applicability and utility.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies distributed convex optimization problems over continuous-time multiagent networks subject to two types of constraints, i.e., local feasible set constraints and coupled inequality constraints, where all involved functions are not necessarily differentiable, only assumed to be convex. In order to solve this problem, a modified primal-dual continuous-time algorithm is proposed by projections on local feasible sets. With the aid of constructing a proper Lyapunov function candidate, the existence of solutions of the algorithm in the Carathéodory sense and the convergence of the algorithm to an optimal solution for the distributed optimization problem are established. Additionally, a sufficient condition is provided for making the algorithm fully distributed. Finally, the theoretical result is corroborated by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing the flows in a lossless flow network with additional nonconvex cycle constraints on nodal variables; such constraints appear in several applications, including electric power, water distribution, and natural gas networks. This problem is a nonconvex version of the minimum-cost network flow problem (NFP), and to solve it, we propose three different approaches. One approach is based on solving a convex approximation of the problem, obtained by augmenting the cost function with an entropy-like term to relax the nonconvex constraints. We show that the approximation error, for which we give an upper bound, can be made small enough for practical use. An alternative approach is to solve the classical NFP, that is, without the cycle constraints, and solve a separate optimization problem afterwards in order to recover the actual flows satisfying the cycle constraints; the solution of this separate problem maximizes the individual entropies of the cycles. The third approach is based on replacing the nonconvex constraint set with a convex inner approximation, which yields a suboptimal solution for the cyclic networks with each edge belonging to at most two cycles. We validate the practical usefulness of the theoretical results through numerical examples, in which we study the standard test systems for water and electric power distribution networks.},

  abstract     = {In a networked discrete event system, communication between a plant and a supervisor/agent is carried out via a wired/wireless communication network, in which communication delays are unavoidable. Hence, how to obtain state estimates under communication delays is an important problem. The existing methods assume that there is only one communication channel and, thus, the first-in, first-out (FIFO) property is satisfied. In complex systems distributed over several locations, several channels are often used to send the event occurrences to the (central) supervisor/agent, in which the FIFO property holds only for each channel and communication delays may be different for different channels. To address these new challenges, this paper investigates the state estimation problem in multichannel networked discrete event systems. Two methods are proposed. The first method is relatively simpler and computes only conservative estimates. The second method is more complex, but it computes the exact state estimates. Examples are given to illustrate the results.},

The objective is to optimize the sum of local cost functions, each of which is only known by the corresponding agent. First, a piecewise continuous distributed optimization algorithm is proposed, such that all agents reach consensus in finite time and reach the optimal point of the total cost function asymptotically under a time-invariant graph. Then, another distributed optimization algorithm is presented to preserve the initial edges and make the agents solve DCOP on a state-dependent graph. In particular, any pair of agents can exchange information with each other when their geometry distance is less than a certain range. Finally, several simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

We propose a systematic stability analysis framework for multisensor cyber-physical systems. The proposed framework provides closed-form characterizations of a stability condition for general measurement matrices with rank-deficient cases covered. Utilizing the observable and unobservable cone decomposition of the coordinate transformed system induced by the singular value decomposition of the measurement matrices, we decompose the conventional Riccati recursion of state estimation covariance. Based on the decomposed recursion, we establish closed-form sufficient requirements on the communication resources needed to achieve stabilization of multisensor cyber-physical systems using the Lyapunov drift analysis approach. The proposed framework is also compared with various representative literature and we show that significant performance gains can be achieved.},

  abstract     = {Taking into account multiagent systems with general linear dynamics and directed topologies, the issue of achieving finite-time consensus in a distributed event-triggered fashion is discussed in this paper. A novel model-based triggering function, which depends only on local information, is adopted. To ensure the finite-time convergence of the disagreement vector and the triggering error, a dynamic threshold, which is guaranteed to converge to zero in finite time, is adopted in the proposed triggering function design. By employing a novel distributed event-triggered controller for each agent, finite-time consensus of multiagent systems can be achieved. In the proposed approach, no continuous communication is needed in either controller updates or triggering detection. Furthermore, the triggering number is significantly reduced and the high frequency triggering is restrained. In addition, the feasibility of the proposed approach is guaranteed by the comprehensive theoretical demonstration of the finite-time consensus stability and the analysis of the Zeno behavior. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.},
