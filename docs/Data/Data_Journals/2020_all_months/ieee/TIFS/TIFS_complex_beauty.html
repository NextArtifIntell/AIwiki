  abstract     = {To increase the resilience of shipboard power systems, this paper presents an optimal defense strategy to protect critical lines against attacks. In the modeling, an attack is considered to destroy one critical bus, which may result in that all lines are connected to this bus will be out of service unless protection is enabled. Furthermore, after one true attack occurs, the network restoration is performed as soon as possible to pick up the critical loads and maintain system operation. To address the uncertain location of the attacks, a tri-level robust optimal defense strategy is set up to protect the critical lines under the worst attack. Moreover, a nested column-constraint generation method is employed to solve this model. A 60-bus shipboard power system is studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the defense method.},

  abstract     = {Since the master key length becomes longer and longer in ciphers, an adversary often needs to preform the multi-round side channel analysis (SCA) in order to recover the master key by enough round keys. Traditional multi-round SCA is launched by adaptive manner in practice, which means that the input of each round is calculated in an on-the-fly way based on all round keys of anterior rounds. However, compared to the classical single-round SCA, the multi-round SCA in adaptive manner is severely limited in several practical scenarios, because all round keys of anterior rounds must be properly recovered before the attack against the next round. In this paper, we focus on the Feistel-SP networks, break the interdependency between the alternating measurement and analysis phases, propose a Multi-round non-Adaptive Chosen Message (MACM) approach, which can reduce the multi-round SCA to the single-round attack. In MACM, the set of plaintexts applied to multiple rounds is calculated in an off-line way. We also prove that the revealed round keys by MACM are adequate to recover the master key. Furthermore, we carefully analyze the advantages of MACM regarding to robustness and compatibility. In order to further manifest the validity of MACM, we perform extensive experiments on three typical Feistel-SP ciphers, Camellia, CLEFIA and SM4, the master keys are recovered as expected, and the number of traces in MACM is at least 25% less than that in the adaptive manner.},

  abstract     = {Given a target image as query, person re-identification systems retrieve a ranked list of candidate matches on a per-camera basis. In deployed systems, a human operator scans these lists and labels sighted targets by touch or mouse-based selection. However, classical re-id approaches generate per-camera lists independently. Therefore, target identifications by operator in a subset of cameras cannot be utilized to improve ranking of the target in remaining set of network cameras. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel sequential multi-camera re-id approach. The proposed approach can accommodate human operator inputs and provides early gains via a monotonic improvement in target ranking. At the heart of our approach is a fusion function which operates on deep feature representations of query and candidate matches. We formulate an optimization procedure custom-designed to incrementally improve query representation. Since existing evaluation methods cannot be directly adopted to our setting, we also propose two novel evaluation protocols. The results on two large-scale re-id datasets (Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID) demonstrate that our multi-camera method significantly outperforms baselines and other popular feature fusion schemes. Additionally, we conduct a comparative subject-based study of human operator performance. The superior operator performance enabled by our approach makes a compelling case for its integration into deployable video-surveillance systems.},

  abstract     = {The consumer unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market has grown significantly over the past few years. Despite its huge potential in spurring economic growth by supporting various applications, the increase of consumer UAVs poses potential risks to public security and personal privacy. To minimize the risks, efficiently detecting and identifying invading UAVs is in urgent need for both invasion detection and forensics purposes. Aiming to complement the existing physical detection mechanisms, we propose a machine learning-based framework for fast UAV identification over encrypted Wi-Fi traffic. It is motivated by the observation that many consumer UAVs use Wi-Fi links for control and video streaming. The proposed framework extracts features derived only from packet size and inter-arrival time of encrypted Wi-Fi traffic, and can efficiently detect UAVs and identify their operation modes. In order to reduce the online identification time, our framework adopts a re-weighted ℓ 1 -norm regularization, which considers the number of samples and computation cost of different features. This framework jointly optimizes feature selection and prediction performance in a unified objective function. To tackle the packet inter-arrival time uncertainty when optimizing the trade-off between the detection accuracy and delay, we utilize maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to estimate the packet inter-arrival time. We collect a large number of real-world Wi-Fi data traffic of eight types of consumer UAVs and conduct extensive evaluation on the performance of our proposed method. Evaluation results show that our proposed method can detect and identify tested UAVs within 0.15-0.35s with high accuracy of 85.7-95.2%. The UAV detection range is within the physical sensing range of 70m and 40m in the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, respectively. The operation mode of UAVs can be identified with high accuracy of 88.5-98.2%.},

  abstract     = {Recently, three useful secrecy metrics based on the partial secrecy regime were proposed to analyze secure transmissions on wireless systems over quasi-static fading channels, namely: generalized secrecy outage probability, average fractional equivocation, and average information leakage. These metrics were devised from the concept of fractional equivocation, which is related to the decoding error probability at the eavesdropper, so as to provide a comprehensive insight on the practical implementation of wireless systems with different levels of secrecy requirements. Considering the partial secrecy regime, in this paper we examine the secrecy performance of an amplify-and-forward relaying network with an untrusted relay node, where a destination-based jamming is employed to enable secure transmissions. In this regard, a closed-form approximation is derived for the generalized secrecy outage probability, and integral-form expressions are obtained for the average fractional equivocation and the average information leakage rate. Additionally, equal and optimal power allocation schemes are investigated and compared for the three metrics. From this analysis, we show that different power allocation approaches lead to different system design criteria. The obtained expressions are validated via Monte Carlo simulations.},

As shown in a previous study, existing feature based methods do not work well. In this paper, we propose a robust data-driven approach, called CNN-MLS (convolutional neural network based multi-domain learning scheme), to distinguish VoIP calls from mobile phone calls. To better explore the differences between VoIP and mobile phone calls, we first process data with high-pass filtering, and then extract deep features from both temporal domain and spectral domain. Two CNN architectures are designed for accepting data from respective domains, and some tricks such as auxiliary classifiers and individual subnet training are used for accelerating network convergence. The deep features are finally fused in a classification module for identifying the phone call type. The proposed method is evaluated on VPCID (VoIP Phone Call Identification Database) dataset, under various testing conditions. We pay particular attention to tests on data belonging to a source mismatched with the training sources. Experimental results show that, compared with existing methods, our method can achieve satisfactory and better accuracy on two-second-long inputs, implying that an alert may be activated shortly after a VoIP call is made.},

  abstract     = {Age variations bring a large challenge for face recognition tasks. Existing Cross-Age Face Recognition (CAFR) methods have two limitations. Firstly, many CAFR approaches require both age labels and identity labels for training. However, it is difficult to collect images under a large age span from each individual. Secondly, many works are based on the assumption that age and identity information are independent of each other, which may not satisfy various conditions. In this paper, a Cycle Age-Adversarial Model (CAAM) is proposed for CAFR, which only uses the age labels for training without considering independence hypothesis. CAAM includes two different branch networks. Firstly, the branch of Age-robust Feature Extracting Model (AFEM) is designed to adaptively learn age-invariant features by adversarial learning scheme, which includes an age discriminator network and a feature generator network. The age discriminator network is trained to discriminate the age information, and the generator extracts age-invariant features through adversarial learning with discriminator. Secondly, a branch of the Identity Preserving Network (IPN) is proposed to keep identity information, which introduces Unsupervised Identity Loss (UIL) to enlarge the inter-class distance, and decrease the loss of identity information in the learning process. Finally, the features of the two branches are cyclically optimized through minmizing Feature Consistency Loss (FCL), which integrates age invariance learning and identity discrimination learning into final feature representation. Different from existing CAFR networks, our adversarial learning strategy for age-robust feature learning can be generalized to other attributes including pose and expression. Moreover, we introduce cycle optimization strategy to merge the advantages of two branch networks, which is a novel strategy to fuse multi-task features. Extensive CAFR experiments performed on the benchmark MORPH Album2, CACD-VS and Cross Age LFW databases demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CAAM.},

  abstract     = {A botnet is a network of remote-controlled devices that are infected with malware controlled by botmasters in order to launch cyber attacks. To evade detection, the botmaster frequently changes the domain name of his Command and Control (C&amp;C) server. Notice that most of these types of domain names are generated by domain generation algorithms (DGAs). In this paper, we propose Khaos, a novel DGA with high anti-detection ability based on neural language models and the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The key insight of our research is that real domain names are composed of readable syllables and acronyms, and thus we can arrange syllables and acronyms using neural language models to mimic real domain names. In Khaos, we first find the most common n-grams in real domain names, then tokenize these domain names into n-grams, and finally synthesize new domain names after learning arrangements of n-grams from real domain names. We carry out experiments using a variety of state-of-the-art DGA detection approaches: the statistics-based, the distribution-based, the LSTM-based and the graph-based detection approach. Our experimental results show that the average distance for detecting Khaos under the distribution-based detection approach is 0.64, the AUCs of Khaos under the statistics-based and the LSTM-based detection approach are 0.76 and 0.57, respectively, and the precision of Khaos under the graph-based detection approach is 0.68. Our work proves that the existing detection approaches have big troubles in detecting Khaos, and Khaos has better anti-detection ability than state-of-the-art DGAs. In addition, we find that training the existing detection approach on a dataset including the domain names generated by Khaos can improve its detection ability.},

  abstract     = {In the case where the private data is not equally important, personalized local privacy preservation based on randomized response (RR) is studied in the collection of sensitive data. So far, the existing RR mechanisms for multiple discrete private sources, which are termed as conventional randomized response (CRR) mechanisms, focus on a universal approach that exerts the same amount of privacy preservation for all sensitive values, without catering for their concrete privacy requirements. An immediate consequence is that they may be offering insufficient protection to a subset of data contributors with relatively higher privacy requirements, while applying excessive privacy control to another subset with relatively lower privacy requirements. Motivated by this, a novel perturbation framework, which is termed as personalized randomized response (PRR) mechanism, is proposed to achieve personalized privacy preservation (Personalized-PP) by designing the statistical privatization mechanism for multiple sensitive values. The proposed PRR technique introduces the weights for different sensitive values according to their sensitivity, and then introduces the weights into the decision of PRR by considering the concrete requirements for privacy, and thus, attains a higher data utility with respect to the quality of statistics while guaranteeing Personalized-PP. The estimate error of the private distribution is used to measure the quality of statistics for the two RR mechanisms. Theoretical study shows that the estimate error of PRR mechanism is smaller than that of the CRR mechanism for a certain same subjective privacy leakage degree. In particular, simulation results reveal the circumstances where CRR mechanism fails to provide Personalized-PP, and then establish the superiority of PRR mechanism.},

Despite previous efforts, most of existing focus on addressing the eyeblink detection problem under constrained indoor conditions with relative consistent subject and environment setup. Nevertheless, towards practical applications, eyeblink detection in the wild is highly preferred, and of greater challenges. In this paper, we shed the light to this research topic. A labelled eyeblink in the wild dataset (i.e., HUST-LEBW) of 673 eyeblink video samples (i.e., 381 positives, and 292 negatives) is first established. These samples are captured from the unconstrained movies, with the dramatic variation on face attribute, head pose, illumination condition, imaging configuration, etc. Then, we formulate eyeblink detection task as a binary spatial-temporal pattern recognition problem. After locating and tracking human eyes using SeetaFace engine and KCF (Kernelized Correlation Filters) tracker respectively, a modified LSTM model able to capture the multi-scale temporal information is proposed to verify eyeblink. A feature extraction approach that reveals the appearance and motion characteristics simultaneously is also proposed. The experiments on HUST-LEBW reveal the superiority and efficiency of our approach. The comparisons with the existing state-of-the-art methods validate the advantages of our manner for eyeblink detection in the wild.},

First, services heavily rely on the traditional password paradigm, which diminishes the end-users&#39; security and usability. Second, the lack of attribute-based authentication does not allow anonymity-preserving access to services. Third, users have multiple online accounts that often reflect distinct identity aspects. This makes proving combinations of identity attributes hard on the users. In this paper, we address these weaknesses by proposing a privacy-preserving architecture for device-centric and attribute-based authentication based on: 1) the seamless integration between usable/strong device-centric authentication methods and federated login solutions; 2) the separation of the concerns for Authorization, Authentication, Behavioral Authentication and Identification to facilitate incremental deployability, wide adoption and compliance with NIST assurance levels; and 3) a novel centralized component that allows end-users to perform identity profile and consent management, to prove combinations of fragmented identity aspects, and to perform account recovery in case of device loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort towards fusing the aforementioned techniques under an integrated architecture. This architecture effectively deems the password paradigm obsolete with minimal modification on the service provider&#39;s software stack.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial audio attacks can be considered as a small perturbation unperceptive to human ears that is intentionally added to an audio signal and causes a machine learning model to make mistakes. This poses a security concern about the safety of machine learning models since the adversarial attacks can fool such models toward the wrong predictions. In this paper we first review some strong adversarial attacks that may affect both audio signals and their 2D representations and evaluate the resiliency of deep learning models and support vector machines (SVM) trained on 2D audio representations such as short time Fourier transform, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and cross recurrent plot against several state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. Next, we propose a novel approach based on pre-processed DWT representation of audio signals and SVM to secure audio systems against adversarial attacks. The proposed architecture has several preprocessing modules for generating and enhancing spectrograms including dimension reduction and smoothing. We extract features from small patches of the spectrograms using the speeded up robust feature (SURF) algorithm which are further used to transform into cluster distance distribution using the K-Means++ algorithm. Finally, SURF-generated vectors are encoded by this codebook and the resulting codewords are used for training a SVM. All these steps yield to a novel approach for audio classification that provides a good tradeoff between accuracy and resilience. Experimental results on three environmental sound datasets show the competitive performance of the proposed approach compared to the deep neural networks both in terms of accuracy and robustness against strong adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {A novel image copy-move forgery detection scheme using a Dense-InceptionNet is proposed in this paper. Dense-InceptionNet is an end-to-end, multi-dimensional dense-feature connection, Deep Neural Network (DNN). It is the first DNN model to autonomously learn the feature correlations and search the possible forgery snippets through the matching clues. The proposed Dense-InceptionNet consists of Pyramid Feature Extractor (PFE), Feature Correlation Matching (FCM), and Hierarchical Post-Processing (HPP) modules. The PFE module is proposed to extract multi-dimensional and multi-scale dense-features. The features of each layer in this extractor module are directly connected to the preceding layers. The FCM module is proposed to learn the high correlations of deep features and obtain three candidate matching maps. Finally, the HPP module which makes use of three matching maps to obtain a combination of cross-entropies is amenable to better training via backpropagation. Experiments demonstrate that the efficiency of the proposed Dense-InceptionNet is much better than the other state-of-the-art methods while achieving the relative best performance against most known attacks.},

  abstract     = {Reversible data hiding (RDH) can be used to imperceptibly embed data into images in a reversible manner. Many RDH schemes have been developed for uncompressed images. However, JPEG compressed images are more widely used in our daily lives. The existing RDH techniques for JPEG images may cause significant distortion or a large increase in the file size of marked images. In this paper, a novel RDH scheme for JPEG images is proposed. First, the negative influence models of data embedding, including image visual distortion model and file size change model, are mathematically established. Then, a negative index for each frequency is defined as the weighted sum of the normalized average image visual distortion and the normalized average file size change per 1-bit hidden data, and the frequencies with small negative indices will be used for data embedding with a high priority. The weighting factor can be adjusted according to the user&#39;s preference for less image distortion or smaller file size. Lastly, secret data is embedded into non-zero quantized AC coefficients of the selected frequencies in ascending order of zero-run length. Extensive experiments conducted on typical images and a well-known image database show that the presented negative influence models are effective, and the proposed RDH scheme based on the models can achieve low image distortion and small increase in the file size of marked images.},

  abstract     = {Threshold Implementation (TI) is one of the most widely used countermeasure for side channel attacks. Over the years several TI techniques have been proposed for randomizing cipher execution using different variations of secret-sharing and implementation techniques. For instance, sharing without decomposition (4-shares) is the most straightforward implementation of the threshold countermeasure. However, its usage is limited due to its high area requirements. On the other hand, sharing using decomposition (3-shares) countermeasure for cubic non-linear functions significantly reduces area and complexity in comparison to 4-shares. Nowadays, security of ciphers using a side channel countermeasure is of utmost importance. This is due to the wide range of security critical applications from smart cards, battery operated IoT devices, to accelerated crypto-processors. Such applications have different requirements (higher speed, energy efficiency, low latency, small area etc.) and hence need different implementation techniques. Although, many TI strategies and implementation techniques are known for different ciphers, there is no single study comparing these on a single cipher. Such a study would allow a fair comparison of the various methodologies. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of the various ways in which TI can be implemented for a lightweight cipher. We chose GIFT for our analysis as it is currently one of the most energy-efficient lightweight ciphers. The experimental results show that different implementation techniques have distinct applications. For example, the 4-shares technique is good for applications demanding high throughput whereas 3-shares is suitable for constrained environments with less area and moderate throughput requirements. The techniques presented in the paper are also applicable to other blockciphers. For security evaluation, we performed TVLA (test vector leakage assessment) on all the design strategies. Experiments using up to 50 million traces show that the designs are protected against first-order attacks.},

In some of these database applications, the query frequency analysis of keywords is quite important to the optimization of the databases and it is easy to be implemented when the data are not encrypted. However, with the growing demands of data privacy, it is desired that the data should be encrypted before uploaded to the cloud. Searchable encryption has been proposed which enables users to make keyword search over the encrypted data with keyword privacy. In a secure searchable encryption scheme, it is required that the keyword in each query should not be revealed. So it becomes challenging to analyze the query frequency of keywords in an encrypted database which has the pressing need of optimization. In this paper, we first consider this problem and present an efficient solution to it which enables the query frequency analysis of keywords without destroying the privacy of the encrypted data and the identity privacy of data users.

By doing so, malicious actors can promote their targeted items in those web services. To obtain a deeper understanding on the recommender systems of our interest (including YouTube, Yelp, Taobao, and 360 App market), we first conduct a measurement-based analysis on several real-world recommender systems by leveraging machine learning algorithms. Then, web injection is implemented in three different types of devices ( i . e ., computer, router, and proxy server) to investigate the scenarios where web injection could occur. Based on the implementation of web injection, we demonstrate that it is feasible and sometimes effective to manipulate the real-world recommender systems through web injection. We also present several countermeasures against such manipulations.},

  abstract     = {Wireless communication security can be enhanced by leveraging the characteristics of the physical (PHY) layer, where discriminatory scrambling can be employed at the symbol level to either improve the signal quality of the legitimate receiver or degrade that of the eavesdroppers. However, in the presence of multiple passive eavesdroppers with more antennas than the transmitter, the transmitted signals can still be reliably separated from random disturbances. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a two-dimensional vectorized secure transmission scheme. Unlike existing transmission schemes (where the same data symbol is sent over each antenna with a predesigned complex weight at a time), in the proposed scheme, a sequence of data symbols in a predefined order (named symbol vector) is first pre-superposed through pre-coding with a random complex matrix prior to been sent as a vector in parallel over each transmitting antenna at a time. As a result, physical randomness of the legitimate channel is introduced into the received signals at passive eavesdroppers in the pre-coding procedure. Moreover, to ensure that transmitted data symbols can be recovered in the right order, each symbol vector is sent repeatedly, according to the principle of maximum entropy. To ensure the intended receiver can recover the transmitted symbol vector, the random pre-coding matrices are selected such that a linear constraint imposed by the CSI of the legitimate channel is satisfied. In addition, an extended maximum likelihood (ML) detection method is developed for the desired receiver while the random pre-coding matrices are not required to be transmitted. We then analyze its security based on the signal detection theory to demonstrate that the intended receiver can recover the transmitted symbol vectors while the eavesdroppers are not capable of doing so. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

Different from the previous works where NOMA and HARQ are separately considered for secure transmissions, in this paper, both NOMA and HARQ are utilized to enhance the security of the SR user. We derive the closed-form expressions for connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), reliable and secure transmission probability (RSP) and effective secrecy throughput (EST) of the SR user in both maximum ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC) schemes. The security-reliability trade-off (SRT) results of the SR user in both MRC and SC schemes are also provided. Analysis and simulation results show that HARQ improves secrecy performance in MRC and SC schemes in terms of RSP, especially in low transmit power region. Besides, since every retransmission is utilized in the MRC scheme, it strictly outperforms the SC scheme in terms of the SRT metric. However, the SC scheme has the potential to achieve higher EST than the MRC scheme by optimizing the transmit power or the power allocation factor. Significantly, the quality of service (QoS) of the OS user can be guaranteed by pairing an SR user who is far away from the transmitter and the secrecy performance of the SR user can be enhanced by pairing an OS user.},

We propose a new method, referred to as subband transform, that characterizes the signals by subband. It is found that subband transform captures the artifacts in synthetic speech more effectively than full band transform. We propose equal subband transform, octave subband transform, and mel subband transform for three novel features, namely, constant-Q equal subband transform (CQ-EST), constant-Q octave subband transform (CQ-OST) and discrete Fourier mel subband transform (DF-MST). We evaluate the three features on the ASVspoof 2015, noisy ASVspoof 2015 and ASVspoof 2019 logical access corpora. The experiments show that the proposed CQ-EST feature achieves an average equal error rate of 0.056% on ASVspoof 2015 evaluation set. The study observes that the features based on subband transform outperform those based on full band transform under both clean and noisy conditions. In addition, the tandem detection cost function of CQ-OST can reach 0.188 on ASVspoof 2019 logical access evaluation set.},

  abstract     = {Despite the strong presence of color images for communication, scholars have mainly devoted their attention to research on steganography for grayscale images. In contrast to grayscale images, color images have three interrelated color channels, and the relationships among the three channels have a strong impact on the steganography security. In this paper, we present a steganographic scheme for spatial color images by exploiting the correlations and differences between the color channels. We find that the G channel has a stronger correlation with R and B than the one between R and B, and thus, synchronizing the modification directions of the R and B channels with those from the G channel will have better resistance to detection. In addition, the payload capacity and the distribution of complex regions between channels are different. Based on these findings, we design a new strategy for defining non-additive costs for color image steganography, called G-channel-related Inter-channel Non-Additive (GINA) strategy. The GINA strategy can make the modification directions of the R and B channels consistent with those of the G channel and can adaptively distribute the embedding capacity between the three channels. Specifically, this strategy will not violate the Complexity Prior rule. The experimental results show that the proposed GINA strategy can significantly improve the performance in terms of resisting color image steganalysis compared with previous methods.},

  abstract     = {Low-end computing devices are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, especially due to the widespread deployment of Internet-of-Things products. There is, however, much concern about sensitive data being processed on these low-end devices which have limited protection mechanisms in place. This paper proposes a Hardware-Entangled Software Protection (HESP) scheme that leverages hardware features to protect software code from malicious modification before or during run-time. It also enables implicit hardware authentication. Thus, the software will execute correctly only on an authorized device and if the timing of the software, e.g., control flow, was not changed through malicious modifications. The proposed ideas are based on the new concept of Dynamic Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). Dynamic PUFs have time-varying responses and can be used to tie the software execution to the timing of software and the physical properties of a hardware device. It is further combined with existing approaches for code self-checksumming, software obfuscation, and call graph and register value scrambling to create the HESP scheme. HESP is demonstrated on commodity, off-the-shelf computing devices, where a DRAM PUF is used as an instance of a Dynamic PUF. The protection scheme can be applied automatically to LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) code through an AutoPatcher written in Python. For a sample program containing AES encryption and decryption routine, HESP introduces 48% execution time overhead and increases the binary file size by 32.5%, which is moderate compared to other schemes such as software obfuscation. It takes about 2.6 seconds on average for the tested programs to be patched and compiled through the modified compilation flow and scripts.},

  abstract     = {We propose the first auctioneer-free sealed-bid auction protocol with a linear computation and communication complexity O(c), c being the bit length of the bid price. Our protocol, called Self-Enforcing Auction Lot (SEAL), operates in a decentralized setting, where bidders jointly compute the maximum bid while preserving the privacy of losing bids. In our protocol, we do not require any secret channels between participants. All operations are publicly verifiable; everyone including third-party observers is able to verify the integrity of the auction outcome. Upon learning the highest bid, the winner comes forward with a proof to prove that she is the real winner. Based on the proof, everyone is able to check if there is only one winner or there is a tie. While our main protocol works with the first-price sealed-bid, it can be easily extended to support the second-price sealed-bid (also known as the Vickrey auction), revealing only the winner and the second highest bid, while keeping the highest bid and all other bids secret. To the best of our knowledge, this work establishes to date the best computation and communication complexity for sealed-bid auction schemes without involving any auctioneer.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) is highly vulnerable to emerging Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) that are often operated by well-resourced adversaries. Achieving perfect security for IoT networks is often cost-prohibitive if not impossible. Cyber insurance is a valuable mechanism to mitigate cyber risks for IoT systems. In this work, we propose a bi-level game-theoretic framework called FlipIn to design incentive-compatible and welfare-maximizing cyber insurance contracts. The framework captures the strategic interactions among APT attackers, IoT defenders, and cyber insurance insurers, and incorporates influence networks to assess the systemic cyber risks of interconnected IoT devices. The FlipIn framework formulates a game over networks within a principal-agent problem of moral-hazard type to design a cyber risk-aware insurance contract. We completely characterize the equilibrium solutions of the bi-level games for a network of distributed defenders and a semi-homogeneous centralized defender and show that the optimal insurance contracts cover half of the defenders&#39; losses. Our framework predicts the risk compensation of defenders and the Peltzman effect of insurance. We study a centralized security management scenario and its decentralized counterpart, and leverage numerical experiments to show that network connectivity plays an important role in the security of the IoT devices and the insurability of both distributed and centralized defenders.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the security of a compressed sensing (CS) based cryptosystem called a sparse one-time sensing (S-OTS) cryptosystem, which encrypts a plaintext with a sparse measurement matrix. To construct the secret matrix and renew it at each encryption, a bipolar keystream and a random permutation pattern are employed as cryptographic primitives, which can be obtained by a keystream generator of stream ciphers. With a small number of nonzero elements in the measurement matrix, the S-OTS cryptosystem achieves efficient CS encryption in terms of memory and computational cost. In security analysis, we show that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be indistinguishable as long as each plaintext has constant energy, which formalizes computational security against ciphertext only attacks (COA). In addition, we consider a chosen plaintext attack (CPA) against the S-OTS cryptosystem, which consists of two sequential stages, keystream and key recovery attacks. Against keystream recovery under CPA, we demonstrate that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be secure with overwhelmingly high probability, as an adversary needs to distinguish a prohibitively large number of candidate keystreams. Finally, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis to show that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be resistant against key recovery under CPA by guaranteeing that the probability of success is extremely low. In conclusion, the S-OTS cryptosystem can be computationally secure against COA and the two-stage CPA, while providing efficiency in CS encryption.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers secure simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The system consists of a large number of randomly (Poisson-distributed) located access points (APs) serving multiple information users (IUs) and an information-untrusted dual-antenna active energy harvester (EH). The active EH uses one antenna to legitimately harvest energy and the other antenna to eavesdrop information. The APs are networked by a centralized infinite backhaul which allows the APs to synchronize and cooperate via a central processing unit (CPU). Closed-form expressions for the average harvested energy (AHE) and a tight lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) are derived. The obtained lower bound on the ESR takes into account the IUs&#39; knowledge attained by downlink effective precoded-channel training. Since the transmit power constraint is per AP, the ESR is nonlinear in terms of the transmit power elements of the APs and that imposes new challenges in formulating a convex power control problem for the downlink transmission. To deal with these nonlinearities, a new method of balancing the transmit power among the APs via relaxed semidefinite programming (SDP) which is proven to be rank-one globally optimal is derived. A fair comparison between the proposed cell-free and the colocated massive MIMO systems shows that the cell-free MIMO outperforms the colocated MIMO over the interval in which the AHE constraint is low and vice versa. Also, the cell-free MIMO is found to be more immune to the increase in the active eavesdropping power than the colocated MIMO.},

In the spread-spectrum systems, low probability of detection (LPD) and anti-jamming (AJ) abilities are two key issues. In this paper, a multiple linear chirp (MLC)-based binary orthogonal keying (BOK)-CSS system considering cross-correlation coefficient for improving the LPD and the AJ performances is proposed. In order to analyze the performance of the MLC-based BOK-CSS system, the cross-correlation coefficient between two different chirps is analytically derived according to the time-bandwidth separation product, and it is numerically compared to a Monte Carlo simulation. From the results, the proposed MLC-based BOK-CSS system guarantees higher survivability than the conventional schemes by considering the cross-correlation coefficient according to the bandwidth separation.},

However, fusion of biometric data is a non-trivial task and curtail employability of multimodal systems for a varying set of biometric characteristics with different type and dimension. Moreover, comprehensive solutions against adversary attacks that ensure template protection and prevent presentation attacks are not in place. In this article, a secure multimodal cancelable biometric system is proposed to address these concerns. This approach introduces key images based generic feature extraction technique which reduces feature dimension and achieves revocability. The non-invertibility and unlinkability are ensured through cross-diffusion of complementary information from different modalities. A new feature fusion method based on an adaptive graph is proposed to generate multimodal cancelable biometric templates. Robustness against presentation attack is accomplished through quality based adaptation of features. Extensive experimentation is performed on benchmark databases for fingerprint, face, and iris, to illustrate the efficacy of multimodal cancelable templates. The proposed approach is shown to perform favorably against state-of-the-art feature fusion methods. Furthermore, the resilience of the proposed approach against security and privacy attacks is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {The growth of online social media has led to a huge increase in the number of users who want to share and publicize various kinds of information. Twitter, the most popular micro-blogging platform, has become a hotbed for users who are involved in different activities such as news publishing, job hunting, recruiting, advertising and publicity. Retweeting a tweet is a major action to broadcast a user’s message out to millions of users. Retweet action has two major advantages: (i) gaining quick exposure to the content, and (ii) increasing likelihood of gaining new Twitter followers in return. The organic way of gaining a larger number of retweets is a time consuming process, which leads to the creation of unfair methods to gain retweets. Thus, Twitter users often approach various blackmarket services to gain retweets inorganically in a short duration. Blackmarkets spread their collusive ecosystem in such a way that Twitter is unable to detect them even after devoting significant effort to purge the platform off bots, trolls, and fake accounts. One major reason behind the evasion is that the collusive users involved in blackmarket services exhibit a mix of organic and inorganic behavior – they organically reweet some genuine tweets; at the same time, they inorganically retweet tweets submitted to blackmarket services. This paper is the first attempt to provide a thorough study of the collusive users involved in two types of blackmarket services – Premium and Freemium. We collect a novel dataset of collusive users comprising of users from both types of blackmarket services. We provide network-centric, profile-centric, timeline-centric and retweet-centric characteristics of these users and show how users involved in premium blackmarket services exhibit diverse behavior as compared to those involved in freemium services. We further employ human annotators to label collusive users into three types: bots, promotional customers, and normal customers. We then curate 63 novel features to run state-of-the-art classifiers in two settings – binary classification (collusive vs. genuine) and multi-class classification (bot, promotional customers, normal customers, and genuine users). Bagging achieves the best accuracy (macro F1-score of 0.892) in the former setting, whereas Random Forest outperforms others (macro F1-score of 0.791) in the latter setting. We also develop a chrome extension, SCoRe++ which can detect collusive retweeters in real time.},

In order to study their privacy, we propose an appropriate general model obtained by constraining Vaudenay&#39;s model. We then propose two symmetric-key cryptography based RFID schemes in this class that achieve weak and destructive privacy, respectively, in addition to mutual authentication.

  abstract     = {Right from its introduction, fault attacks (FA) have been established to be one of the most practical threats to both public key and symmetric key based cryptosystems. Statistical Ineffective Fault Analysis (SIFA) is a recently proposed class of fault attacks introduced at CHES 2018. The fascinating feature of this attack is that it exploits the correct ciphertexts obtained during a fault injection campaign, instead of the faulty ciphertexts. SIFA has been shown to bypass almost all of the existing fault attack countermeasures even when they are combined with masking schemes for side-channel resistance. The goal of this work is to propose a countermeasure framework for SIFA. It has been observed that a randomized domain transformation of the intermediate computation combined with bit-level error correction can prevent SIFA attacks. The domain transformation (Transform) can be realized by standard masking schemes. In fact, we prove that if biased faults are injected at the state register of a block cipher at a certain target round, then masking is sufficient for SIFA protection, until all the shares for a specific bit are corrupted. However, masking alone cannot prevent SIFA if the faults are injected at certain specific locations inside the S-Boxes. To address this issue, we incorporate a bit-level error-correction mechanism (Encode). An instantiation of this Transform-and-Encode (TaE) framework, called AntiSIFA, has been proposed and realized for the block cipher PRESENT as a proof-of-concept. Practical evaluation of the countermeasure implementation in both hardware and software ensures our theoretical claims regarding SIFA security, as well as protection against Side-Channel-Attacks (SCA).},

When the attacker modifies the software application to exfiltrate sensitive information through a channel, this channel is called a covert channel. In this paper, we model this covert channel as a communication channel and derive upper and lower capacity bounds. Because the covert channels are not designed to transmit information, they are exposed not only to the errors created by the transmission, but also by varying the execution time of computer activities, and/or by insertions from other activities such as interrupts, stalls, etc. Combining all of these effects, we propose to model the covert channel as an insertion channel where the transmitted sequence is a pulse amplitude modulated signal with random pulse positions. Utilizing this model, we derive capacity bounds of the covert channel with random insertion and substitution due to the noise and jitter errors, and propose a receiver design that can correctly detect the computer-activity-created signals. To illustrate the severity of leakages, we perform experiments with high clock speed devices at some distance. Further, the theoretical derivations are compared to empirical results, and show good agreement.},

  abstract     = {In electric network frequency (ENF) based audio forensics, the ENF signal captured in a questioned audio recording is estimated and analyzed for authentication purposes.

In this paper, we propose a robust filtering algorithm (RFA) for ENF signal enhancement in audio recordings, which could effectively suppress the additive noise and facilitate subsequent ENF estimation, especially in practical low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situations. The proposed algorithm encodes the time domain expression of the preprocessed audio signal (ENF signal plus noise) as the instantaneous frequencies (IFs) of an analytical sinusoidal frequency modulated (SFM) signal. Then, a kernel function is utilized to generate a sinusoidal time-frequency distribution (STFD) whose peaks correspond to the IFs of the analytical signal, i.e., the denoised ENF signal. It is then proven that finding the STFD peaks is equivalent to finding the averaged phases of the kernel function if the additive noise is a zero mean wide sense stationary (WSS) process. The RFA serves as a noise reduction mechanism yielding improved SNR at the filter output. Combined with generic frequency estimation methods, ENF extraction accuracy could be substantially improved with the use of the proposed RFA than without using it. Both synthetic and experimental results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposal. Reliable ENF extraction could be achieved under noise level down to -20 dB SNR, and the RFA is suitable for a wide range of ENF-based forensic applications.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a deep neural network architecture that achieves state of the art multi-session verification and identification performance for Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE) biometric system. TEOAE is a 20ms long response generated by the ear that is naturally strong against falsification, and replay attacks. It can be measured using a device with a speaker and multiple microphones. Previous TEAOE authentication methods focused on single-session or mixed-session performance. Our method focuses on multi-session authentication performance. We train a neural network model that generates a TEOAE embedding that is separable in Euclidean space by using the triplet loss function. These embeddings are used to create identity templates which are used to authenticate the user. We achieved identification accuracy of 99.3 ± 1.04%, and achieved an EER(Equal Error Rate) of 0.187 ± 0.146% for verification scenarios. Our method has achieved 7.56% performance increase for identification scenarios and 13.3% performance increase for verification scenarios over previous methods when averaged across all tests.},

  abstract     = {Orphaned file fragment carving is concerned with recovering contents of encoded data in the absence of any coding metadata. Constructing an orphaned file carver requires addressing three challenges: a specialized decoder to interpret partial file data; the ability to discriminate a specific type of encoded data from all other types of data; and comprehensive prior knowledge on possible encoding settings. In this work, we build on the ability to render a partial image contained within a segment of JPEG coded data to introduce a new carving tool that addresses all these challenges. Towards this goal, we first propose a new method that discriminates JPEG file data from among 993 file data types with 97.7% accuracy. We also introduce a method for robustly delimiting entropy coded data segments of JPEG files. This in turn allows us to identify partial JPEG file headers with zero false rejection and 0.1% of false alarm rate. Secondly, we examine a very diverse image set comprising more than 7 million images. This ensures comprehensive coverage of coding parameters used by 3,269 camera models and a wide variety of image editing tools. Further, we assess the potential impact of the developed tool on practice in terms of the amount of new evidence that it can recover. Recovery results on a set of used SD cards purchased online show that our carver is able to recover 24% more image data as compared to existing file carving tools. Evaluations performed on a standard dataset also show that JpgScraper improves the state-of-the-art significantly in carving JPEG file data.},

By relying on a universal rate-distortion analysis applied to a generic double compression scheme, we first explain the rationale behind the presence of the VPF in double compressed videos and then justify the need of exploiting a new source of information such as the motion vectors, to enhance the VPF acquisition process. Finally, we describe the shifted VPF induced by the presence of B-frames and detail how to compensate the shift to avoid misguided GOP size estimations. The experimental results show that the proposed Generalized VPF (G-VPF) technique outperforms the state of the art, not only in terms of double compression detection and GOP size estimation, but also in reducing computational time.},

  abstract     = {Labeling malware or malware clustering is important for identifying new security threats, triaging and building reference datasets. The state-of-the-art Android malware clustering approaches rely heavily on the raw labels from commercial AntiVirus (AV) vendors, which causes misclustering for a substantial number of weakly-labeled malware due to the inconsistent, incomplete and overly generic labels reported by these closed-source AV engines, whose capabilities vary greatly and whose internal mechanisms are opaque (i.e., intermediate detection results are unavailable for clustering). The raw labels are thus often used as the only important source of information for clustering. To address the limitations of the existing approaches, this paper presents Andre, a new ANDroid Hybrid REpresentation Learning approach to clustering weakly-labeled Android malware by preserving heterogeneous information from multiple sources (including the results of static code analysis, the meta-information of an app, and the raw-labels of the AV vendors) to jointly learn a hybrid representation for accurate clustering. The learned representation is then fed into our outlier-aware clustering to partition the weakly-labeled malware into known and unknown families. The malware whose malicious behaviours are close to those of the existing families on the network, are further classified using a three-layer Deep Neural Network (DNN). The unknown malware are clustered using a standard density-based clustering algorithm. We have evaluated our approach using 5,416 ground-truth malware from Drebin and 9,000 malware from VirusShare (uploaded between Mar. 2017 and Feb. 2018), consisting of 3324 weakly-labeled malware. The evaluation shows that Andre effectively clusters weakly-labeled malware which cannot be clustered by the state-of-the-art approaches, while achieving comparable accuracy with those approaches for clustering ground-truth samples.},

The proposed trigger identification is a reference-free scheme, and no prior knowledge of a Trojan-free design is required. First, we reveal the relation between combinational 0/1-controllability and 0/1-probability and propose a static transition probability analysis based on our proposed difference-amplified controllability, which can be easily obtained by the Sandia Controllability/Observability Analysis Program. The k-means clustering method is adopted for potential trigger classification to extend the scalability and adaptability to different circuit sizes. Second, we propose to utilize the transition probability of a dynamic simulation for correction of the results. Experiments show that the proposed detection scheme can obtain a 0% false negative rate and a maximum 11.7% false positive rate on Trust-HUB benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {In industrial machine type communications, an increasing number of wireless devices communicate under reliability, latency, and confidentiality constraints, simultaneously. From information theory, it is known that wiretap codes can asymptotically achieve reliability (vanishing block error rate (BLER) at the legitimate receiver Bob) while also achieving secrecy (vanishing information leakage (IL) to an eavesdropper Eve). However, under finite block length, there exists a tradeoff between the BLER at Bob and the IL at Eve. In this work, we propose a flexible wiretap code design for degraded Gaussian wiretap channels under finite block length, which can change the operating point on the Pareto boundary of the tradeoff between BLER and IL given specific code parameters. To attain this goal, we formulate a multi-objective programming problem, which takes the BLER at Bob and the IL at Eve into account. During training, we approximate the BLER by the mean square error and the IL by schemes based on Jensen&#39;s inequality and the Taylor expansion and then solve the optimization problem by neural network autoencoders. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can find codes outperforming polar wiretap codes (PWC) with respect to both BLER and IL simultaneously. We show that the codes found by the autoencoders could be implemented with real modulation schemes with only small losses in performance.},

Hence, the researchers have focused on identifying the conspicuous permissions that lead to malware detection. Most of these permissions, common to malware and normal applications present themselves in different patterns and contribute to attacks. Therefore, it is essential to find the significant combinations of the permissions that can be dangerous. Hence, this paper aims to identify the pairs of permissions that can be dangerous. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works have used the permission pairs to detect malware. In this paper, we proposed an innovative detection model, named PermPair, that constructs and compares the graphs for malware and normal samples by extracting the permission pairs from the manifest file of an application. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed scheme is successful in detecting malicious samples with an accuracy of 95.44% when compared to other similar approaches and favorite mobile anti-malware apps. Further, we also proposed an efficient edge elimination algorithm that removed 7% of the unnecessary edges from the malware graph and 41% from the normal graph. This lead to minimum space utility and also 28% decrease in the detection time.},

  abstract     = {With millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless communication envisioned to be the key enabler of next generation high data rate wireless networks, security is of paramount importance. While conventional security measures in wireless networks operate at a higher layer of the protocol stack, physical layer security utilizes unique device dependent hardware features to identify and authenticate legitimate devices. In this work, we identify that the manufacturing tolerances in the antenna arrays used in mmWave devices contribute to a beam pattern that is unique to each device, and to that end we propose a novel device fingerprinting scheme based on the unique beam pattern of different codebooks used by the mmWave devices. Specifically, we propose a fingerprinting scheme with multiple access points (APs) to take advantage of the rich spatial-temporal information of the beam pattern. We perform comprehensive experiments with commercial off-the-shelf mmWave devices to validate the reliability performance of our proposed method under various scenarios. We also compare our beam pattern feature with a conventional physical layer feature namely power spectral density feature (PSD). To that end, we implement PSD feature based fingerprinting for mmWave devices. We show that the proposed multiple APs scheme is able to achieve over 99% identification accuracy for stationary LOS and NLOS scenarios and significantly outperform the PSD feature fingerprinting method. For mobility scenario, the overall identification accuracy is 99%. In addition, we perform security analysis of our proposed beam pattern fingerprinting system and PSD fingerprinting system by studying the feasibility of performing impersonation attacks. We design and implement an impersonation attack mechanism for mmWave wireless networks using state-of-the-art 60 GHz software defined radios. We discuss our findings and their implications on the security of the mmWave wireless networks.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using the HTTP protocol have started gaining popularity in recent years. A recent trend in this direction has been the use of computationally expensive requests to launch attacks. These attacks, called Asymmetric Workload attacks can bring down servers using limited resources, and are extremely difficult to detect. The introduction of HTTP/2 has been welcomed by developers because it improves user experience and efficiency. This was made possible by the ability to transport HTTP requests and their associated inline resources simultaneously by using Multiplexing and Server Push. However multiplexing has made request traffic bursty and rendered DDoS detection mechanisms based on connection limiting obsolete. Contrary to its intention, multiplexing can also be misused to launch sophisticated DDoS attacks using multiple high workload requests in a single TCP connection. However, sufficient research has not been done in this area. Existing research demonstrates that the HTTP/2 protocol allows users to launch DDoS attacks easily, but does not focus on whether an HTTP/2 server can handle DDoS attacks more efficiently or not. Also, sufficient research has not been done on the possibility of Multiplexing and Server Push being misused. In this work, we analyse the performance of an HTTP/2 server compared to an HTTP/1.1 server under an Asymmetric DDoS attack for the same load. We propose a new DDoS attack vector called a Multiplexed Asymmetric DDoS attack, which uses multiplexing in a different way than intended. We show that such an attack can bring down a server with just a few attacking clients. We also show that a Multiplexed Asymmetric Attack on a server with Server Push enabled can trigger an egress network layer flood in addition to an application layer attack.},

Recent observations indicate that the success of crowdsourcing has been threatened by the malicious behaviors of the contributors.

Both theoretical analysis and simulation studies are performed, and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm has the following two attractive characteristics: 1) the requestor can incentivize the worker to become cooperative without any long-term extra cost; and 2) the proposed algorithm is fair so that the requestor cannot arbitrarily penalize an innocent worker to increase its payoff even though it can dominate the game. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to adopt the ZD strategies to stimulate both players to cooperate in an IPD game. Moreover, our proposed algorithm is not restricted to solve only the problem of crowdsourcing dilemma - it can be employed to tackle any problem that can be formulated into an IPD game.},

  abstract     = {Digital video provides various types of embedding domains, which lead to a great diversity in video steganography. However, in the detection of video steganography, the existing video steganalytic features all specialize in a particular domain, and are hardly to detect the steganography in other embedding domains. In this paper, we propose a universal feature set which is capable of detecting the video steganography in multiple domains. Two popular embedding domains, i.e., partition mode (PM) domain and motion vector (MV) domain, are considered for steganalysis. The idea is based on the observation that the MVs of the sub-blocks in the same macroblock are usually different from each other, and they will tend to be consistent in values after the MV modifications or PM modifications. Thus the consistency of MVs can be used as an evidence for the steganographic embedding in two domains, and finally a 12-dimensional feature set is designed for universal detection. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature set. The results show that our feature set achieves superior universality and accuracy in both PM domain and MV domain, and even performs well in mismatched domains, where the detection model trained in one domain can directly be used to attack the steganography in another domain. Besides, the low complexity of the proposed feature set also indicates its advantage in real-time video steganalysis.},

  abstract     = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives control of personal data back to the owners by appointing higher requirements and obligations on service providers who manage and process personal data. As the verification of GDPR-compliance, handled by a supervisory authority, is irregularly conducted; it is challenging to be certified that a service provider has been continuously adhering to the GDPR. Furthermore, it is beyond the data owner&#39;s capability to perceive whether a service provider complies with the GDPR and effectively protects her personal data. This motivates us to envision a design concept for developing a GDPR-compliant personal data management platform leveraging the emerging blockchain and smart contract technologies. The goals of the platform are to provide decentralised mechanisms to both service providers and data owners for processing personal data; meanwhile, empower data provenance and transparency by leveraging advanced features of the blockchain technology. The platform enables data owners to impose data usage consent, ensures only designated parties can process personal data, and logs all data activities in an immutable distributed ledger using smart contract and cryptography techniques. By honestly participating in the platform, a service provider can be endorsed by the blockchain network that it is fully GDPR-compliant; otherwise, any violation is immutably recorded and is easily figured out by associated parties. We then demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed design concept by developing a profile management platform implemented on top of the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain framework, following by valuable analysis and discussion.},

  abstract     = {Offline Handwritten Signature verification presents a challenging Pattern Recognition problem, where only knowledge of the positive class is available for training. While classifiers have access to a few genuine signatures for training, during generalization they also need to discriminate forgeries. This is particularly challenging for skilled forgeries, where a forger practices imitating the user&#39;s signature, and often is able to create forgeries visually close to the original signatures. Most work in the literature address this issue by training for a surrogate objective: discriminating genuine signatures of a user and random forgeries (signatures from other users). In this work, we propose a solution for this problem based on meta-learning, where there are two levels of learning: a task-level (where a task is to learn a classifier for a given user) and a meta-level (learning across tasks). In particular, the meta-learner guides the adaptation (learning) of a classifier for each user, which is a lightweight operation that only requires genuine signatures. The meta-learning procedure learns what is common for the classification across different users. In a scenario where skilled forgeries from a subset of users are available, the meta-learner can guide classifiers to be discriminative of skilled forgeries even if the classifiers themselves do not use skilled forgeries for learning. Experiments conducted on the GPDS-960 dataset show improved performance compared to Writer-Independent systems, and achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art Writer-Dependent systems in the regime of few samples per user (5 reference signatures).},

  abstract     = {Alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) is a powerful method to solve decentralized convex optimization problems. In distributed settings, each node performs computation with its local data and the local results are exchanged among neighboring nodes in an iterative fashion. During this iterative process the leakage of data privacy arises and can accumulate significantly over many iterations, making it difficult to balance the privacy-accuracy tradeoff. We propose Recycled ADMM (R-ADMM), where a linear approximation is applied to every even iteration, its solution directly calculated using only results from the previous, odd iteration. It turns out that under such a scheme, half of the updates incur no privacy loss and require much less computation compared to the conventional ADMM. Moreover, R-ADMM can be further modified (MR-ADMM) such that each node independently determines its own penalty parameter over iterations. We obtain a sufficient condition for the convergence of both algorithms and provide the privacy analysis based on objective perturbation. It can be shown that the privacy-accuracy tradeoff can be improved significantly compared with conventional ADMM.},

  abstract     = {In an ever more data-centric economy, machine learning models have risen in importance. With the large amounts of data companies collect, they are able to develop highly accurate models to predict the behaviours of their customers. It is thus important to safeguard the data used to build these models to prevent competitors from mimicking their services. In addition, as this type of techniques finds its way into areas that need to deal with more sensitive information, like the medical industry, the privacy of the data that needs to be classified also has to be ensured. Herein, this topic is addressed by homomorphically evaluating Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, in a way that guarantees that a client learns nothing about the model except for the classification of his data, and that the service provider learns nothing about the data. Whereas, previously, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has mostly focused on either bit-wise or value-wise computations, SVMs present an additional challenge since they combine both: during an initial phase a kernel function is evaluated that makes use of real arithmetic, and during a second phase the sign bit has to be extracted. Novel techniques are herein proposed that allow for speedups of up to 2.7 and 6.6 for the evaluation of polynomials and the determination of sign, respectively, in comparison to the state of the art. Finally, it is shown that the proposed techniques do not deteriorate the classification accuracy of the SVM models.},

  abstract     = {Widely used as fundamental security components in most cryptographic applications, random number generators (RNGs) rely mainly on randomness provided by entropy sources. If the provided randomness is less than expected, RNGs may be compromised and thus impair the security of the whole cryptographic applications. However, the common assumptions (e.g., outputs are independent and identically distributed, i.e., IID) may not always hold. For example, many entropy sources are based on some physical phenomena that are fragile and sensitive to external factors (e.g., temperature), which means the distributions of these entropy sources&#39; outputs are continuously changing. As important tools to measure the quality of entropy sources, existing entropy estimation methods may provide false estimations against these time-varying data, because they cannot detect the changes of data distributions. In this paper, we firstly review and analyze the existing typical entropy estimators including the NIST SP 800-90B (90B for short) estimators and the lately proposed neural network based (NN-based) estimators, especially, their limitations on the aforementioned time-varying data. Second, we propose an entropy estimation framework adopting change detection techniques to address this problem. In contrast to the NN-based estimators, the proposed estimator under this framework employs a change detection method to preprocess the tested data and adds additional distribution features to each data sample, which makes it possible to learn the distribution changes and estimate the entropy more accurately. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our estimator using various kinds of simulated data and real world data, and compare our estimator with the 90B estimators and the NN-based estimators. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed estimator provides similar or more accurate entropy estimation than the other estimators, especially for time-varying data.},

Cloud computing provides a good platform for solving this problem due to its abundant computing resources. However, cloud computing poses new challenges, such as how to protect clients&#39; data privacy without reducing efficiency. In this paper, we review some of the results of previous research and analyze an outsourcing protocol for eigen decomposition and singular value decomposition. On this basis, we propose a secure and efficient outsourcing protocol for face recognition through principal component analysis. In the proposed protocol, information privacy is well protected, and computational resources are saved by means of conversions of the original image information. In addition, local verification is supported to cope with the laziness of the cloud. We show the feasibility and advancement of our protocol from both theoretical and experimental perspectives.},

Moreover, they do not support flexible permission models, and they are often tightly coupled with a specific SDN controller. To address such limitations, we introduce an automated permission generation and verification system called VOGUE. A distinguishing aspect of VOGUE is that it automatically generates flexible permission models and yet is completely separated from the SDN controller implementation. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implement a prototype, evaluate its completeness and soundness, and examine its performance. In addition, to show the effectiveness of VOGUE, we demonstrate its use cases and security impact to SDN in the context of popular SDN controllers.},

However, a few schemes focus on the conditional privacy protection authentication of vehicular networks under a multi-cloud environment. In this regard, we propose a robust and extensible authentication scheme for vehicular networks to fulfil the ever-growing diversified service demands from users. According to our solution, the vehicles need to register with the trusted authority (TA) only once to achieve a fast and efficient authentication with CSPs. Additionally, as long as the new CSP is successfully registered in TA, it can participate in vehicular service. A cloud broker, which is managed by the TA, is responsible for connecting all the cloud services; consequently, the complexity involved in the selection of CSPs is hidden from the users’ view. A detailed security analysis establishes that our scheme can fulfil conditional privacy protection and achieve the security objectives of vehicular networks. Our scheme is based on elliptic curve cryptography and does not employ the complex bilinear pairing operation. An evaluation of performance of the proposed scheme indicates that it is suitable for applications involving vehicular networks.},

  abstract     = {Faces in the wild may contain pose variations, age changes, and with different qualities which significantly enlarge the intra-class variations. Although great progresses have been made in face recognition, few existing works could learn local and multi-scale representations together. In this work, we propose a new model, called Local and multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks (LS-CNN). First, since similar discriminative face regions may occur at different scales, it is necessary to learn multi-scale features. To this aim, we introduce a new backbone network, namely Harmonious multi-Scale Network (HSNet), which extracts rich multi-scale features from two harmonious perspectives: utilization of different kernel sizes in a single layer, and concatenation of multi-scale feature maps from different layers. Second, identifying similar local patches is important when global face appearances have dramatic changes. Meanwhile, different face regions have different discriminative abilities. To capture critical local similarities and weigh adaptively on different local patches, a spatial attention is proposed. Third, channels have different convolutional kernels which can detect different features with various importance. Besides, hierarchical channels concatenated from different layers contain diverse information: channels from low layers describe local details or small-scale parts, and channels in high layers represent high-level abstraction or large-scale parts. To emphasize important channels and suppress less informative ones automatically, channel attention is used. Due to the complementary characteristics of channel attention and spatial attention, they are fused to form the Dual Face Attentions (DFA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to employ attentions for the general face recognition task. The LS-CNN is developed by incorporating DFA into HSNet model. Experimental results on various face matching tasks show its capability of learning complex data distributions.},

  abstract     = {With new cryptocurrencies being frequently introduced to the market, the demand for cryptomining - a fundamental operation associated with most of the cryptocurrencies - has initiated a new stream of earning financial gains. The cost associated with the lucrative cryptomining has driven general masses to unethically mine cryptocurrencies using “plundered” resources in the public organizations (e.g., universities) as well as in the corporate sector that follows Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) culture. Such exploitation of the resources causes financial detriment to the affected organizations, which often discover the abuse when the damage has already been done. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages magnetic side-channel to detect covert cryptomining. Our proposed approach works even when the examiner does not have login-access or root-privileges on the suspect device. It merely requires the physical proximity of the examiner and a magnetic sensor, which is often available on smartphones. The fundamental idea of our approach is to profile the magnetic field emission of a processor for the set of available mining algorithms. We built a complete implementation of our system using advanced machine learning techniques. In our experiments, we included all the cryptocurrencies supported by the top-10 mining pools, which collectively comprise the largest share (84% during Q3 2018) of the cryptomining market. Moreover, we tested our methodology primarily on two different laptops. By using the data recorded from the magnetometer of an ordinary smartphone, our classifier achieved an average precision of over 88% and an average F1 score of 87%. Apart from our primary goal - which is to identify covert cryptomining - we also performed four additional experiments to further evaluate our approach. We found that due to its underlying design, our system is future-ready and can readily adapt even to zero-day cryptocurrencies.},

However, these two branches do not cover some palmprint images which have the potential for forensic investigation. Due to the prevalence of smartphone and consumer camera, more evidence is in the form of digital images taken in uncontrolled and uncooperative environment, e.g., child pornographic images and terrorist images, where the criminals commonly hide or cover their face. However, their palms can be observable. To study palmprint identification on images collected in uncontrolled and uncooperative environment, a new palmprint database is established and an end-to-end deep learning algorithm is proposed. The new database named NTU Palmprints from the Internet (NTU-PI-v1) contains 7881 images from 2035 palms collected from the Internet. The proposed algorithm consists of an alignment network and a feature extraction network and is end-to-end trainable. The proposed algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art online palmprint recognition methods and evaluated on three public contactless palmprint databases, IITD, CASIA, and PolyU and two new databases, NTU-PI-v1 and NTU contactless palmprint database.

Regrettably, Intel SGX&#39;s design objectives omit trusted I/O paths. Without such guarantees, it is unlikely for an enclave to fulfill its security and privacy purposes because the source or sink of data may have been corrupted. To this end, we propose a novel architecture called Aurora to provide trusted I/O paths for enclave programs even in the presence of untrusted system software. Specifically, Aurora exploits two commercial-off-the-shelf features (System Management Mode, SMM and SGX) and establishes a secure channel between an enclave program and target device. Furthermore, we design and implement trusted paths for HID keyboard, serial port printer, hardware clocks, and USB mass storage, respectively. Leveraging these trusted paths, we protect real-world applications including OpenSSH client, OpenSSL server/client and SQLite database. Security and performance evaluations show that Aurora mitigates several kinds of I/O related attacks and introduces acceptable overheads. Our framework has been open-sourced and is available to the security community.},

  abstract     = {The photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) is a distinctive image sensor characteristic, and an imaging device inadvertently introduces its sensor&#39;s PRNU into all media it captures. Therefore, the PRNU can be regarded as a camera fingerprint and used for source attribution. The imaging pipeline in a camera, however, involves various processing steps that are detrimental to PRNU estimation. In the context of photographic images, these challenges are successfully addressed and the method for estimating a sensor&#39;s PRNU pattern is well established. However, various additional challenges related to generation of videos remain largely untackled. With this perspective, this work introduces methods to mitigate disruptive effects of widely deployed H.264 and H.265 video compression standards on PRNU estimation. Our approach involves an intervention in the decoding process to eliminate a filtering procedure applied at the decoder to reduce blockiness. It also utilizes decoding parameters to develop a weighting scheme and adjust the contribution of video frames at the macroblock level to PRNU estimation process. Results obtained on videos captured by 28 cameras show that our approach increases the PRNU matching metric up to more than five times over the conventional estimation method tailored for photos. Tests on a public dataset also verify that the proposed method improves the attribution performance by increasing the accuracy and allowing the use of smaller length videos to perform attribution.},

In this paper, we show that location information can be compromised through mobile inertial sensors which are considered insensitive and accessible by any mobile application in both iOS and Android without special privilege. We present MISSILE, an automatic system that can infer users&#39; indoor location using labeled sensor data as prior knowledge. The key idea is that when a user reaches a particular indoor location, it is very likely that he/she has passed through some unique interior structures of a building, such as winding corridors, fire stop doors or elevators. These structures exhibit repeatable motion and environment patterns in mobile sensors that can be recognized by supervised learning. In our MISSILE system, the location labels of training data are automatically attained by Bluetooth beacons deployed in sensitive locations. With effective feature extraction procedure robust modeling, MISSILE shows good success rate for inference attack. For example, in a university campus with 15 sensitive locations, MISSILE achieves up to 73% correct prediction score whereas a random guess can only achieve 1/(15 + 1) = 6.25%. Further improvements on system performance and countermeasures are also discussed.},

In this work, we approach the problem of speaker recognition from severely degraded audio data by judiciously combining two commonly used features: Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Linear Predictive Coding (LPC). Our hypothesis rests on the observation that MFCC and LPC capture two distinct aspects of speech, viz., speech perception and speech production. A carefully crafted 1D Triplet Convolutional Neural Network (1D-Triplet-CNN) is used to combine these two features in a novel manner, thereby enhancing the performance of speaker recognition in challenging scenarios. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets, different types of audio degradations, multi-lingual speech, varying length of audio samples, etc. convey the efficacy of the proposed approach over existing speaker recognition methods, including those based on iVector and xVector.},

Meanwhile, the unique features of lip movements during speaking have been proved to be useful for authentication. However, the unimodal biometric authentication systems based on either voice or lip movements have certain limitations. Voice authentication systems are prone to spoofing attacks and suffer from serious performance degradation in noisy environments. Lip movements authentication systems are unstable and are sensitive to the user&#39;s physical and psychological conditions. In this paper, we propose and implement LVID, a multimodal biometrics authentication system on smartphones, which resolves the defects of the original systems by combining the advantages of lip movements and voice. LVID simultaneously captures these two biometrics with the built-in audio devices on smartphones and fuses them at the data level. The reliable and effective features are then extracted from the fused data for authentication. LVID is practical as it requires neither cumbersome operations nor additional hardwares but only a speaker and a microphone that are commonly available on smartphones. Our experimental results with 104 participants show that LVID can achieve 95% accuracy for user authentication, and 93.47% of the attacks can be detected. It is also verified that LVID works well with different smartphones and is robust to different smartphone positions.},

Deep learning has been successfully applied in numerous research fields as a universal representation learning method. However, the heterogeneity of flow-level communication data obstructs the application of deep learning to communication representation learning, and research on this problem is still lacking. To cope with this problem, we propose a heterogeneous communication data-encoding approach to extract fixed-size encoding data to apply deep learning to heterogeneous communication data by preserving the spatiotemporal characteristics of the data. Then, we propose a feature extractor based on deep learning to automatically learn hierarchical and robust communication representations without expert knowledge. We show that the proposed approach can replicate and optimize the key steps of feature engineering well and learn hierarchical representations directly from heterogeneous communication data. Moreover, compared with features extracted with principal component analysis (PCA), manifold learning and manually crafted methods, the features extracted by deep learning are more robust and are characterized by their better adaptability to various classifiers and datasets. To the best of our knowledge, the initial work here is the first to apply deep learning techniques to heterogeneous flow-level data; consequently, the heterogeneous communication data processing method can provide technical means for the application of deep learning in other communication-related research fields.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies device to device (D2D) coded-caching with information theoretic security guarantees. A broadcast network consisting of a server, which has a library of files, and end users equipped with cache memories, is considered. Information theoretic security guarantees for confidentiality are imposed upon the files. The server populates the end user caches, after which D2D communications enable the delivery of the requested files. Accordingly, we require that a user must not have access to files it did not request, i.e., secure caching. First, a centralized coded caching scheme is provided by jointly optimizing the cache placement and delivery policies. Next, a decentralized coded caching scheme is developed that does not require the knowledge of the number of active users during the caching phase. Both schemes utilize non-perfect secret sharing and one-time pad keying, to guarantee secure caching. Furthermore, the proposed schemes provide secure delivery as a side benefit, i.e., any external entity which overhears the transmitted signals during the delivery phase cannot obtain any information about the database files. The proposed schemes provide the achievable upper bound on the minimum delivery sum rate. Lower bounds on the required transmission sum rate are also derived using cut-set arguments indicating the multiplicative gap between the lower and upper bounds. Numerical results indicate that the gap vanishes with increasing memory size. Overall, the work demonstrates the effectiveness of D2D communications in cache-aided systems even when confidentiality constraints are imposed at the participating nodes and against external eavesdroppers.},

  abstract     = {With powerful parallel computing GPUs and massive user data, neural-network-based deep learning can well exert its strong power in problem modeling and solving, and has archived great success in many applications such as image classification, speech recognition and machine translation etc. While deep learning has been increasingly popular, the problem of privacy leakage becomes more and more urgent. Given the fact that the training data may contain highly sensitive information, e.g., personal medical records, directly sharing them among the users (i.e., participants) or centrally storing them in one single location may pose a considerable threat to user privacy. In this paper, we present a practical privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning system that allows users to cooperatively build a collective deep learning model with data of all participants, without direct data sharing and central data storage. In our system, each participant trains a local model with their own data and only shares model parameters with the others. To further avoid potential privacy leakage from sharing model parameters, we use functional mechanism to perturb the objective function of the neural network in the training process to achieve $\epsilon $ -differential privacy. In particular, for the first time, we consider the existence of unreliable participants , i.e., the participants with low-quality data, and propose a solution to reduce the impact of these participants while protecting their privacy. We evaluate the performance of our system on two well-known real-world datasets for regression and classification tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed system is robust against unreliable participants, and achieves high accuracy close to the model trained in a traditional centralized manner while ensuring rigorous privacy protection.},

  abstract     = {Mobile operators offer a wide range of value-added services (VAS) to their subscribers (i.e., mobile users), which in turn generates around 15% of the telecommunication industry revenue. However, simultaneous VAS requests from a large number of mobile devices to a single server or a cluster in an internet-of-things (IoT) environment could result in an inefficient system, if these requests are handled one at a time as the present traditional cellular network scenario is. This will not only slow down the server&#39;s efficiency but also adversely impacts the performance of the network. The current (insecure) practice of transmitting user identity in plaintext also results in traceability. In this paper, we introduce the first known protocol designed to efficiently handle multiple VAS requests at one time, as well as ensuring the secure delivery of the services to a large number of requesting mobile users. The proposed batch verification protocol (BAS-VAS) is capable of authenticating multiple simultaneous requests received by a large number of mobile users. We demonstrate that the protocol preserves user privacy over the network. The provider&#39;s servers ensure the privacy of the requested service&#39;s priority by performing sorting over encrypted integer data. The simulation results also demonstrate that the proposed protocol is lightweight and efficient in terms of communication and computation overheads, protocol execution time, and batch and re-batch verification delay. Specifically, we perform batch and re-batch verification (after detecting and removing malicious requests from the batch) for multiple requests in order to improve the overall efficiency of the system, as well as discussing time, space and cost complexity analysis, along with the security proof of our protocol using Proverif.},

Although these devices are critical, they are often insecure by design: communicating over unauthenticated protocols, failing to provide standard password protection, and using trivially spoofed checksums for detecting program changes instead of cryptographic hashes. Furthermore, extreme resource limitations, long life cycles, and strict downtime requirements make it difficult to patch existing devices in the field and virtually impossible to install any kind of endpoint protection. While these limitations have traditionally been considered a security weakness, they may also be leveraged for change and anomaly detection. Specifically, this research proposes to leverage these resource limitations for continuous behavior anomaly detection for the PLCs themselves, using program execution times to detect single-instruction changes to control programs from both the network and local access. The basic techniques are extended to include white box modeling for estimating rare execution behavior from source code, and proof-of-work functions are utilized to increase the techniques&#39; resiliency against mimicry attacks.},

In the private coded matrix multiplication, the master needs to compute a matrix multiplication on its own matrix and one of the matrices in a library exclusively shared by the external workers. After the master recovers the matrix multiplication through coded matrix multiplication, the workers should not know which matrix in the library was desired by the master, which implies that the master&#39;s privacy is ensured. Our problem is a special case of linear private computation, where a linear combination of matrices in the library should be concealed.

  abstract     = {We investigate the effect of outdated channel state information (CSI) on the secrecy performance of wireless-powered untrusted relay networks, in which the relay is a potential eavesdropper. To keep the information secret from this untrusted relay, the destination sends a jamming signal to the relay when the source transmits an information signal. At the same time, the relay harvests energy from the radio-frequency power, and forwards the received signals to the destination using this harvested energy. To determine the proportions of energy harvesting and information processing, the relay makes use of relaying based on power splitting or time switching policy. Although the destination tries to remove the jamming signal from the relaying signal, it cannot cancel out the jamming signal perfectly due to imperfect channel reciprocity caused by the outdated CSI; this residual jamming signal therefore has a negative impact on secrecy performance. In this scenario, we derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average secrecy rate, and find the jamming power ratio, power splitting ratio, and time switching ratio to optimize these secrecy performance metrics. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis, and show that the proposed secure relaying protocols achieve a near-optimal secrecy performance, as well as outperforming the conventional scheme without the jamming power control.},

  abstract     = {Random delay countermeasure is a commonly used defense against side-channel attacks, which brings certain interference and disturbance to those calculation sequences in the time domain. Data alignment and frequency attack are considered as typical techniques to counteract the random delay countermeasure. However, these attacks have limitations from the perspectives of both efficiency and performance. In comparison, facing those delays, wavelet analysis is considered as a more efficient technique due to its detailed and comprehensive interpretation of a signal. This paper applies different wavelet techniques to three attack components: noise reduction, trace alignment and key extraction. For the first time, the unified wavelet-based attack framework against random delays is proposed where wavelet analysis is fully applied in the entire attack life cycle. In particular, a novel method of trace alignment at the wavelet level is proposed in this framework, which is based on wavelet pattern detection to synchronize the misaligned power traces. Most importantly, the overall wavelet-based attack framework is systematically evaluated over three random delay strategies, after the respective contribution of each component is investigated through a series of comparative experiments. Experimental results show that the performance of the wavelet-based attack framework is significantly improved compared to standard attack procedures and frequency ones, which can be regarded as a unified and effective solution to conquer random delay countermeasures.},

  abstract     = {Feature pyramids aim to learn multi-scale representations for detecting faces over various scales. However, they often lack adequate context over different scales, especially when there are many tiny faces in the wild. In this paper, we propose an attention-guided semantically enriched feature aggregation framework to learn a feature pyramid with rich semantics at all scales for face detection. Specifically, high-level abstract features are directly integrated into low-level representations by skip connections to retain as much semantic as possible. In addition, an attention mechanism is employed as a gate to emphasize relevant features and suppress useless features during feature fusion. Inspired by human visual perception of tiny faces, we specially design a deep progressive refined loss (DPRL) to effectively facilitate feature learning. According to the above principles, we design and investigate various feature pyramid frameworks through extensive experiments. Finally, two typical structures named Centralized Attention Feature (CAF) and Distributed Attention Feature (DAF) are proposed for face detection, which are in-place and end-to-end trainable. Extensive experiments across different aggregation architectures on four challenging face detection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Power non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered as a new enabling technology in 5G communication. In this paper, we introduce the problem of pilot contamination attack (PCA) on NOMA in millimeter wave (mmWave) and massive MIMO 5G communication. Due to the new characteristics of NOMA such as superposed signals with multi-users, PCA detection faces new challenges. By harnessing the sparseness and statistics of mmWave and massive MIMO virtual channel, we propose two effective PCA detection schemes for NOMA tackling static and dynamic environments, respectively. For the static environment, the problem of PCA detection is formulated as a binary hypothesis test of the virtual channel sparsity. For the dynamic environment, the statistic of the peaks in the virtual channel is leveraged to distinguish the contamination state from the normal state. A peak estimation algorithm and a machine learning based detection framework are proposed to achieve high detection performance. To further optimize the proposed scheme, a feature selection algorithm and an optimization model considering the detection accuracy and detection delay are presented. Simulation results evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed detection schemes. The detection rate can approach 100% with 10 -3 false alarm rate in the static environment and above 95% in the dynamic environment under various system parameters.},

For evaluating the system performance, we then derive the closed-form expressions of end-to-end secrecy outage probability, system throughput and secrecy throughput, respectively. Based on the theoretical performance analysis, we further explore the performance optimization issues, revealing the insightful tradeoffs between the transmission security and QoS. An iterative algorithm is developed to identify the optimal setting of link selection parameters, which is helpful for the practical configuration of link selection policies to satisfy various system performance requirements.

Existing solutions in smart grid usually use cryptographic tools, such as homomorphic encryption, to protect individual privacy, which, however, can only support limited and simple functionalities. Moreover, the resource-constrained smart meters need to perform heavy asymmetric cryptography in these solutions, and thus unnecessarily increases load on smart grid. In this paper, we present a practical and secure SGX-enabled smart grid system, named SecGrid. Our system leverages trusted hardware SGX to ensure that grid utilities can efficiently execute rich functionalities on customers&#39; private data, while guaranteeing their privacy. With our well-devised security protocols in SecGrid, only the smart meters need to perform AES encryption. To validate the superiority of our design, we conduct security analysis and experimentation. Security analysis shows that SecGrid can thwart various attacks from malicious adversaries, and the experimental results show that SecGrid is much faster than the existing privacy-preserving schemes in smart grid.},

The non-overlapping labels challenge that the source domain and the target domain have entirely different persons further increases the re-identification difficulty. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to narrow such domain gaps. We derive a camera style adaptation framework to learn the style-based mappings between different camera views, from the target domain to the source domain , and then we can transfer the identity-based distribution from the source domain to the target domain on the camera level. Target camera variations can be captured by the style adaptation method, thus, the re-identification model trained on the target domain can learn target camera-invariant features better. It indicates that the style translator approximates an appropriate metric space for improving feature matching. To overcome the non-overlapping labels challenge and guide the person re-identification model to narrow the gap further, an efficient and effective soft-labeling method is proposed to mine the intrinsic local structure of the target domain through building the connection between GAN-translated source domain and the target domain. Experiment results conducted on real benchmark datasets indicate that our method gets state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification requires extraction of discriminative features to ensure a correct match; this must be done independent of challenges, such as occlusion, view, or lighting changes. While occlusion can be eliminated by changing the camera setup from a horizontal to a vertical (overhead) viewpoint, other challenges arise as the total visible surface area of persons is decreased. As a result, methods that focus on the most discriminative regions of persons must be applied, while different domains should also be considered to extract different semantics. To further increase feature discriminability, complementary features extracted at different abstraction levels should be fused. To emphasize features at certain abstraction levels depending on the input, fusion should be done intelligently. This work considers multiple domains and feature discrimination, where a multimodal convolution neural network is applied to fuse RGB and depth information. To extract multi-local discriminative features, two different attention modules are proposed: (1) a spatial attention module, which is able to capture local information at different abstraction levels, and (2) a layer-wise attention module, which works as a dynamic weighting scheme to assign weights and fuse local abstraction-level features intelligently, depending on the input image. By fusing local and global features in a multimodal context, we show state-of-the-art accuracies on two publicly available datasets, DPI-T and TVPR, while increasing the state-of-the-art accuracy on a third dataset, OPR. Finally, through both visual and quantitative analysis, we show the ability of the proposed system to leverage multiple frames, by adapting feature weighting depending on the input.},

Then they proposed a revocable and scalable certificateless remote authentication protocol with anonymity for wireless body area networks based on the combination of R-CLE scheme and R-CLS scheme. However, we show that their RCLS scheme is insecure against type I adversaries: a type I adversary who knows only a user&#39;s secret value can forge signatures on any messages in the same time period.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of image set-based face verification and identification. Unlike traditional single sample (an image or a video) setting, this situation assumes the availability of a set of heterogeneous collection of orderless images and videos. The samples can be taken at different check points, different identity documents $etc$ . The importance of each image is usually considered either equal or based on a quality assessment of that image independent of other images and/or videos in that image set. How to model the relationship of orderless images within a set remains a challenge. We address this problem by formulating it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in a latent space. Specifically, we first propose a dependency-aware attention control (DAC) network, which uses actor-critic reinforcement learning for attention decision of each image to exploit the correlations among the unordered images. An off-policy experience replay is introduced to speed up the learning process. Moreover, the DAC is combined with a temporal model for videos using divide and conquer strategies. We also introduce a pose-guided representation (PGR) scheme that can further boost the performance at extreme poses. We propose a parameter-free PGR without the need for training as well as a novel metric learning-based PGR for pose alignment without the need for pose detection in testing stage. Extensive evaluations on IJB-A/B/C, YTF, Celebrity-1000 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms many state-of-art approaches on the set-based as well as video-based face recognition databases.},

Accordingly, we propose a unified Bayesian model of group-based schemes and a related MCMC methodology to learn the population parameters from an anonymized table.

Most existing forensic methods can roughly be grouped into statistical and physics-based approaches. Statistical methods can oftentimes be fully automated, and achieve impressive results on current state-of-the-art benchmarks. Physics-based methods explain image inconsistencies using an analytic model, and are more robust to common image processing operations such as resizing or recompression. In this work, we propose a physics-based forensic descriptor to characterize 2-D lighting environments of objects. The key idea is that the integral over a gradient field of an object indicates the direction of incident light in the image plane. In contrast to prior 2-D lighting methods, the proposed method is remarkably robust to changes in object color and variations in user input, as it operates on the whole object area instead of object contours. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method is unaffected by image resizing or compression, which makes it possible to analyze images that are impossible to analyze with current state-of-the-art statistical methods.},

  abstract     = {The increased need for unattended authentication in multiple scenarios has motivated a wide deployment of biometric systems in the last few years. This has in turn led to the disclosure of security concerns specifically related to biometric systems. Among them, presentation attacks (PAs, i.e., attempts to log into the system with a fake biometric characteristic or presentation attack instrument) pose a severe threat to the security of the system: any person could eventually fabricate or order a gummy finger or face mask to impersonate someone else. In this context, we present a novel fingerprint presentation attack detection (PAD) scheme based on i) a new capture device able to acquire images within the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, and ii) an in-depth analysis of several state-of-theart techniques based on both handcrafted and deep learning features. The approach is evaluated on a database comprising over 4700 samples, stemming from 562 different subjects and 35 different presentation attack instrument (PAI) species. The results show the soundness of the proposed approach with a detection equal error rate (D-EER) as low as 1.35% even in a realistic scenario where five different PAI species are considered only for testing purposes (i.e., unknown attacks).},

Pose estimation of latent fingerprints is a challenging problem. A few methods based on machine learning were proposed in the past decade. These methods try to predict a pose from corrupted information. In this paper, we propose a systematic feedback approach which can remedy the corrupted information while simultaneously estimates a reliable pose. Without manual segmentation, our fully automatic algorithm is able to progressively locate potential poses, and enhance weak friction ridges that form and support these poses through an iterative feedback. Using the NIST SD27 and MOLF DB4 latent fingerprint databases, our experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art and existing commercial products for latent fingerprint pose estimation in terms of precision and identification accuracy.},

However, cookies may contain private and sensitive information about users. Thus, in order to guarantee the security of cookies, most web browsers and servers support not only Transport Layer Security (TLS) but also other mechanisms such as HTTP Strict Transport Security and cookie flags. However, a recent study has shown that it is possible to circumvent cookie flags in HTTPS by exploiting a vulnerability in HTTP software that allows message truncation. In this paper, we propose a novel cookie hijacking attack called rotten cookie which deactivates cookie flags even if they are protected by TLS by exploiting a weakness in HTTP in terms of integrity checks. According to our investigation, all major browsers ignore uninterpretable sections of the header of HTTP response messages and accept incorrect formats without any rejection. We demonstrate that, when combined with TLS or application vulnerabilities, this form of attack can obtain private cookies by removing cookie flags. Thus, the attacker can impersonate a legitimate user in the eyes of the server when cookies are used as an authentication token. We prove the practicality of our attack by demonstrating that our attack can lead five major web browsers to accept a cookie without any cookie flags. We thus present a mitigation strategy for the transport layer to preserve cookie security against our attack.},

  abstract     = {Air-gapped computers are devices that are kept isolated from the Internet, because they store and process sensitive information. When highly sensitive data is involved, an air-gapped computer might also be kept secluded in a Faraday cage. The Faraday cage prevents the leakage of electromagnetic signals emanating from various computer parts, which may be picked up remotely by an eavesdropping adversary. The air-gap separation, coupled with the Faraday shield, provides a high level of isolation, preventing the potential leakage of sensitive data from the system. In this paper, we show how attackers can bypass Faraday cages and air-gaps in order to leak data from highly secure computers. Our method is based on exploitation of the magnetic field generated by the computer&#39;s CPU. Unlike electromagnetic radiation (EMR), low frequency magnetic fields propagate through the air, penetrating metal shielding such as Faraday cages (e.g., a compass still works inside a Faraday cage). Since the CPU is an essential part of any computer, the magnetic covert channel is relevant to virtually any device with a CPU: desktop PCs, servers, laptops, embedded systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We introduce a malware codenamed `ODINI&#39; that can control the low frequency magnetic fields emitted from the infected computer by regulating the load of the CPU cores. Arbitrary data can be modulated and transmitted on top of the magnetic emission and received by a magnetic `bug&#39; located nearby. We implement a malware prototype and discuss the design considerations along with the implementation details. We also show that the malicious code does not require special privileges (e.g., root) and can successfully operate from within isolated virtual machines (VMs) as well. Finally, we propose different types of defensive countermeasures such as signal detection and signal jamming to cope with this type of threat (demonstration video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h07iXD-aSCA).},

  abstract     = {IP prefix hijacking continues to be a pervasive cyber security threat to the core internet routing infrastructure. The data security of multiple cloud-based services is also susceptible to these threats, due to the high dependency on traditional routing protocols. Although a number of hijacking detection techniques have been recently proposed, no existing system has effectively addressed the problem of detecting malicious transit Autonomous System (AS) services in any detected hijacking occurrences. The ability to locate and isolate malicious services is critical for conducting a necessary mitigation strategy at an early stage, to minimise the impact of the attack, to restore cloud services quickly. In this paper, we propose an effective real-time processing method, so-called Ontological Graph Identification (OGI), for detecting IP prefix hijacking of nodes and suspicious transit nodes caused by the hijacked nodes through ASs. The proposed method is evaluated using the two public datasets of RIPE RIS and RouteView. Experimental results revealed improved performance for the detection of malicious transit nodes compared with peer techniques. It is, therefore, shown that the proposed method has utility in automating the process of investigating nodes with suspicious activities in real network systems.},

Numerous visual security indexes (VSIs) have been proposed to evaluate visual content leakage. Due to the lack of perceptually encrypted image databases, image quality assessment (IQA) databases are widely adopted to evaluate the performance of existing VSIs. However, there are huge differences between VSIs and IQAs. The misuse of databases may lead to an inaccurate evaluation. In this paper, we propose a perceptually encrypted image database (PEID) which contains 1080 encrypted images from 20 plain images with 10 well-known perceptual encryption techniques. Both visual quality and content leakage scores of the encrypted images are obtained through a comprehensive subjective evaluation. We also propose a systemic methodology to accurately evaluate the monotonicity, fitness, and accuracy of VSIs. We conduct extensive experiments on the proposed PEID to evaluate the performance of existing state-of-the-art VSIs. We have made the database publicly available for download and hope that the proposed PEID can facilitate the research of visual security evaluation and beyond.},

  abstract     = {For steganalysis, many studies showed that convolutional neural network (CNN) has better performances than the two-part structure of traditional machine learning methods. Existing CNN architectures use various tricks to improve the performance of steganalysis, such as fixed convolutional kernels, the absolute value layer, data augmentation and the domain knowledge. However, some designing of the network structure were not extensively studied so far, such as different convolutions (inception, xception, etc.) and variety ways of pooling(spatial pyramid pooling, etc.). In this paper, we focus on designing a new CNN network structure to improve detection accuracy of spatial-domain steganography. First, we use $3\times 3$ kernels instead of the traditional $5\times 5$ kernels and optimize convolution kernels in the preprocessing layer. The smaller convolution kernels are used to reduce the number of parameters and model the features in a small local region. Next, we use separable convolutions to utilize channel correlation of the residuals, compress the image content and increase the signal-to-noise ratio (between the stego signal and the image signal). Then, we use spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) to aggregate the local features and enhance the representation ability of features by multi-level pooling. Finally, data augmentation is adopted to further improve network performance. The experimental results show that the proposed CNN structure is significantly better than other five methods such as SRM, Ye-Net, Xu-Net, Yedroudj-Net and SRNet, when it is used to detect three spatial algorithms such as WOW, S-UNIWARD and HILL with a wide variety of datasets and payloads.},

Additionally, the current work develops a methodology for evaluating adversarial success in the context of wireless communications, where the primary metric of interest is bit error rate and not human perception, as is the case in image recognition. The methodology is demonstrated using the well known Fast Gradient Sign Method to evaluate the vulnerabilities of raw IQ based Automatic Modulation Classification and concludes RFML is vulnerable to adversarial examples, even in OTA attacks. However, RFML domain specific receiver effects, which would be encountered in an OTA attack, can present significant impairments to adversarial evasion.},

  abstract     = {The traditional two-dimensional (2D) barcode has been employed in anti-counterfeiting systems as a storage media for serial numbers. However, an attack can be initiated by simply copying the 2D barcode and attaching it to a counterfeit product. In this paper, we aim at proposing an authentication scheme with a mobile imaging device for a 2D barcode. This work presents a competitive solution among the 2D barcode authentication schemes that have been verified under mobile imaging conditions. The proposed copy-proof scheme is composed of two sets of features which are extracted by exploiting the characteristics of barcoding channel models. The proposed features identify the intrinsic differences between genuine and counterfeit barcode images in the frequency and spatial domains. An efficient two-stage barcode authentication framework is then proposed by combining the two sets of features in a cascading manner. To evaluate the practicality of the proposed authentication scheme, four databases with different devices (printers, scanners, mobile cameras), barcode sizes, and barcode designs are considered in the experiments. By comparing with the existing texture descriptors and some deep learning-based approaches, it is shown that the proposed scheme has a higher authentication accuracy under various conditions, such as cross-database, cross-size and cross-pattern experiments which study the generalities of a pre-trained model towards challenging conditions commonly found in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, the proposed scheme has been evaluated under some state-of-the-art attack scenarios where the attacker employs several realizations of genuine patterns or the deep learning-based technique to produce a counterfeit copy.

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection is an important technique used to identify patterns of unusual network behavior and keep the network under control. Today, network attacks are increasing in terms of both their number and sophistication. To avoid causing significant traffic patterns and being detected by existing techniques, many new attacks tend to involve gradual adjustment of behaviors, which always generate incomplete sessions due to their running mechanisms. Accordingly, in this work, we employ the behavior symmetry degree to profile the anomalies and further identify unusual behaviors. We first proposed a symmetry degree to identify the incomplete sessions generated by unusual behaviors; we then employ a sketch to calculate the symmetry degree of internal hosts to improve the identification efficiency for online applications. To reduce the memory cost and probability of collision, we divide the IP addresses into four segments that can be used as keys of the hash functions in the sketch. Moreover, to further improve detection accuracy, a threshold selection method is proposed for dynamic traffic pattern analysis. The hash functions in the sketch are then designed using Chinese remainder theory, which can analytically trace the IP addresses associated with the anomalies. We tested the proposed techniques based on traffic data collected from the northwest center of CERNET (China Education and Research Network); the results show that the proposed methods can effectively detect anomalies in large-scale networks.},

We develop an adaptive protocol that, under conditions that we explicitly specify, not only allows the transmitter and the legitimate receiver to exchange a secret key but also conceals from the active warden whether the protocol is being run. When specialized to passive adversaries that do not control the channel state, we partially characterize the covert secret key capacity. In particular, the covert secret key capacity is sometimes equal to the covert capacity of the channel, so that secrecy comes “for free.”},

  abstract     = {In this paper, to address the issue of demand response in the smart grid with island MicroGrids (MGs), we introduce an effective and secure auction market that allows electric vehicles (EVs) having surplus energy to act as sellers, and the EVs having insufficient energy in the island MGs to act as buyers. There are two primary challenges in designing an effective auction market in the smart grid. First, the auction market scheme shall be online, allowing buyers and sellers to enter the market at any time, and satisfy several critical economic properties (individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and so on.). Second, the sensitive information of participants shall be protected in the auction process. To address these challenges, we present a novel privacy-preserving online double auction scheme based on differential privacy. In our auction market, the MicroGrid Center Controller (MGCC) acts as the auctioneer, aiming at solving the social welfare maximization problem to match buyers and sellers. The principle of differential privacy is leveraged to protect the privacy of EVs&#39; sensitive bidding information. Via theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that our designed auction scheme satisfies both economic and privacy-preserving properties, including individual rationality, incentive compatibility, weak budget balance, and ε-differential privacy. We conduct an extensive performance evaluation to measure the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Our experimental results show that the proposed auction scheme can not only ensure the privacy of participants but also effectively facilitates demand response in the smart grid, with respect to social welfare, satisfaction ratio, social efficiency, and computational overhead.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have considered thwarting false data injection (FDI) attacks against state estimation in power grids by proactively perturbing branch susceptances. This approach is known as moving target defense (MTD). However, despite of the deployment of MTD, it is still possible for the attacker to launch stealthy FDI attacks generated with former branch susceptances. In this paper, we prove that, an MTD has the capability to thwart all FDI attacks constructed with former branch susceptances only if (i) the number of branches l in the power system is not less than twice that of the system states n (i.e., l ≥ 2n, where n + 1 is the number of buses); (ii) the susceptances of more than n branches, which cover all buses, are perturbed. Moreover, we prove that the state variable of a bus that is only connected by a single branch (no matter it is perturbed or not) can always be modified by the attacker. Nevertheless, in order to reduce the attack opportunities of potential attackers, we first exploit the impact of the susceptance perturbation magnitude on the dimension of the stealthy attack space, in which the attack vector is constructed with former branch susceptances. Then, we propose that, by perturbing an appropriate set of branches, we can minimize the dimension of the stealthy attack space and maximize the number of covered buses. Besides, we consider the increasing operation cost caused by the activation of MTD. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to illustrate our findings with IEEE standard test power systems.},

This model subsumes other instances of CSI availability as special cases, and calls for efficient utilization of the state sequence for both reliability and security purposes. An inner bound on the semantic-security (SS) SM-SK capacity region is derived based on a superposition coding scheme inspired by a past work of the authors. The region is shown to attain capacity for a certain class of SD-WTCs. SS is established by virtue of two versions of the strong soft-covering lemma. The derived region yields an improvement upon the previously best known SM-SK trade-off result reported by Prabhakaran et al., and, to the best of our knowledge, upon all other existing lower bounds for either SM or SK for this setup, even if the semantic security requirement is relaxed to weak secrecy. It is demonstrated that our region can be strictly larger than those reported in the preceding works.},

  abstract     = {Finger vein modality has unique advantages, allowing it to play an important role in biometrics. However, the approach to vein imaging and information acquisition typically adopted in current vein verification systems employs a monocular camera to acquire a single-view 2D vein image from only one side of the finger, which causes two problems: it acquires limited vein pattern information for verification, and it causes clear differences among samples of the same subject captured from different finger positions in contact-free mode. Both of these problems have adverse effects on system performance. In general, existing systems are more sensitive to positional variations of the finger, particularly those caused by pitch and roll movements. This concern remains a challenge despite considerable efforts to address it in recent years. To provide a fundamental solution to the above issues, we propose an entirely new system, which includes a software and hardware platform that collects a full-view of the vein pattern information from whole fingers with three cameras, a novel 3D reconstruction method to build the full-view 3D finger vein image, and a corresponding 3D finger vein feature extraction and matching strategy based on a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) with depthwise separable convolution. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of our proposed system and show that compared to the traditional single-view 2D mode of finger vein recognition, the new system both efficiently improves the recognition performance and simultaneously takes full advantage of additional valid information provided by the finger vein biometrics.},

  abstract     = {Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.},

To simplify the feature extraction process, we leverage various deep learning architectures for mouse movement sequences classification, including convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and a hybrid model which combines convolutional and recurrent layers. It is known that the training of these networks with random initialization of weights on small datasets will produce models that perform poorly. Therefore, we consider a two-dimensional convolutional neural network that allows transfer learning, which is a domain adaptation technique effective for learning on small datasets. Although employing such architecture may seem counterintuitive, since the temporal information is discarded from the input data, the architecture has outperformed all the other deep architectures investigated, as well as a classical machine learning method. In order to understand the features learned, we adopt the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm to compute relevance scores for each part of the mouse curves. In addition, the models are measured for their usability and effectiveness in realistic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Lightweight block ciphers rely on simple operations to allow compact implementation. Thanks to its efficiency, bit permutation has emerged as an optimal choice for state-wise diffusion. It can be implemented by simple wiring in hardware or shifts in software. However, efficiency and security often go against each other. In this paper, we show how bit permutations introduce a side-channel vulnerability that can be exploited to extract the secret key from the cipher. Such vulnerabilities are specific to bit permutations and do not occur in other state-wise diffusion alternatives. We propose side-channel assisted differential-plaintext attack (SCADPA) which targets this vulnerability in the bit permutation operation. SCADPA is first experimentally demonstrated on PRESENT-80 on an 8-bit microcontroller, with the best case key recovery in 17 encryptions. In Addition, we adjust SCADPA to state-of-the-art bit sliced implementation from CHES&#39;17 with experimental evaluation on a 32-bit microcontroller. The attack is then extended to latest bit-permutation-based cipher GIFT, allowing full key recovery in 36 encryptions. Application for reverse engineering of secret S-boxes in PRESENT-like proprietary ciphers is also shown.},

Physical layer security is a concept that unifies both and connects them with entropic quantities. In this paper, a framework based on Turing machines is developed to address the question of deciding whether or not a communication system meets these requirements. It is known that the class of Turing solvable problems coincides with the class of algorithmically solvable problems so that this framework provides the theoretical basis for effective verification of such performance requirements. A key issue here is to decide whether or not the performance functions, i.e., capacities, of relevant communication scenarios, particularly those with secrecy requirements and active adversaries, are Turing computable. This is a necessary condition for the corresponding communication protocols to be effectively verifiable. Within this framework, it is then shown that for certain scenarios including the wiretap channel the corresponding capacities are Turing computable. Next, a general necessary condition on the performance function for Turing computability is established. With this, it is shown that for certain scenarios, including the wiretap channel with an active jammer, the performance functions are not computable when deterministic codes are used. As a consequence, such performance functions are also not computable on all other computer architectures such as the von Neumann-architecture or the register machines.},

  abstract     = {Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a widely used tool for machine learning in distri-buted settings where a machine learning model is trained over distributed data sources through an interactive process of local computation and message passing. Such an iterative process could cause privacy concerns of data owners. The goal of this paper is to provide differential privacy for ADMM-based distributed machine learning. Prior approaches on differentially private ADMM exhibit low utility under high privacy guarantee and assume the objective functions of the learning problems to be smooth and strongly convex. To address these concerns, we propose a novel differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithm called DP-ADMM, which combines an approximate augmented Lagrangian function with time-varying Gaussian noise addition in the iterative process to achieve higher utility for general objective functions under the same differential privacy guarantee. We also apply the moments accountant method to analyze the end-to-end privacy loss. The theoretical analysis shows that the DP-ADMM can be applied to a wider class of distributed learning problems, is provably convergent, and offers an explicit utility-privacy tradeoff. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide explicit convergence and utility properties for differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithms. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can achieve good convergence and model accuracy under high end-to-end differential privacy guarantee.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning-based solutions have been successfully employed for the automatic detection of malware on Android. However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features ( e.g. , requested permissions, API calls, etc. ), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application’s manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning-based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APK’s Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin. Our results show that the malware detection rates decreased from 96% to 0% in MaMaDroid, and from 97% to 0% in Drebin, with just a small number of codes to be inserted into the APK.},

In this paper, a related scenario is considered where instead of secret key generation, the goal is to securely store data in a public database. The database allows for error-free storing of the data, but is constrained in its size which imposes a rate constraint on storing. The corresponding capacity for secure storage is known and it has been shown that the capacity-achieving strategy satisfies the strong secrecy criterion. Here, the case when the storage in the public database is subject to errors is considered and the corresponding capacity is characterized. In addition, the continuity properties of the two capacity functions are analyzed. These capacity functions are continuous as opposed to the discontinuous secret key capacity with rate constraint. It is shown that for secure storage the phenomenon of super activation can occur. Finally, it is discussed how the results in this paper differ from previous results on super activation.},

SCNs improve radio spectrum utilization by deploying more base stations (BSs) in the networks. Even though authenticated key exchange (AKE) is still essential to ensure entity authentication and confidentiality in mobile communications. Besides, user anonymity is required to guarantee the footprints of mobile communications being concealed. However, AKE with user anonymity may increase the latency of communications dramatically in total due to several times more frequency in SCNs. The increase of latency will be more serious when an AKE protocol supports user anonymity, where traceability and revocability to users are necessary. Thus, this paper presents a secure region-based handover scheme (ReHand) with user anonymity and fast revocation for SCNs. ReHand greatly reduces the communication latency when user equipments (UEs) roam between small cells within the region of a macro BS, i.e., eNB, and the computation costs due to the employment of symmetry-based cryptographic operations. Compared to the three related prior arts, ReHand dramatically reduces the latency from 82.92% to 99.99% by region-based secure handover. Nevertheless, this paper demonstrates the security of ReHand by theoretically formal proofs.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging training model with neural networks, federated learning has received widespread attention due to its ability to update parameters without collecting users&#39; raw data. However, since adversaries can track and derive participants&#39; privacy from the shared gradients, federated learning is still exposed to various security and privacy threats. In this paper, we consider two major issues in the training process over deep neural networks (DNNs): 1) how to protect user&#39;s privacy (i.e., local gradients) in the training process and 2) how to verify the integrity (or correctness) of the aggregated results returned from the server. To solve the above problems, several approaches focusing on secure or privacy-preserving federated learning have been proposed and applied in diverse scenarios. However, it is still an open problem enabling clients to verify whether the cloud server is operating correctly, while guaranteeing user&#39;s privacy in the training process. In this paper, we propose VerifyNet, the first privacy-preserving and verifiable federated learning framework. In specific, we first propose a double-masking protocol to guarantee the confidentiality of users&#39; local gradients during the federated learning. Then, the cloud server is required to provide the Proof about the correctness of its aggregated results to each user. We claim that it is impossible that an adversary can deceive users by forging Proof, unless it can solve the NP-hard problem adopted in our model. In addition, VerifyNet is also supportive of users dropping out during the training process. The extensive experiments conducted on real-world data also demonstrate the practical performance of our proposed scheme.},

One or more sensors make measurements of the state vector and sends information to a fusion center, which performs the final state estimation. To achieve an optimal tradeoff between the utility of estimating the public states and protection of the private states, the measurements at each time step are linearly compressed into a lower dimensional space. Under the centralized setting where all measurements are collected by a single sensor, we propose an optimization problem and an algorithm to find the best compression matrix. Under the decentralized setting where measurements are made separately at multiple sensors, each sensor optimizes its own local compression matrix. We propose methods to separate the overall optimization problem into multiple sub-problems that can be solved locally at each sensor. We consider the cases where there is no message exchange between the sensors; and where each sensor takes turns to transmit messages to the other sensors. Simulations and empirical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach in allowing the fusion center to estimate the public states with good accuracy while preventing it from estimating the private states accurately.},

  abstract     = {Latent fingerprints are one of the most important and widely used sources of evidence in law enforcement and forensic agencies. Yet the performance of the state-of-the-art latent recognition systems is far from satisfactory, and they often require manual markups to boost the latent search performance. Further, the COTS systems are proprietary and do not output the true comparison scores between a latent and reference prints to conduct quantitative evidential analysis. We present an end-to-end latent fingerprint search system, including automated region of interest (ROI) cropping, latent image preprocessing, feature extraction, feature comparison, and outputs a candidate list. Two separate minutiae extraction models provide complementary minutiae templates. To compensate for the small number of minutiae in small ridge area and poor quality latents, a virtual minutiae set is generated to construct a texture template. A 96-dimensional descriptor is extracted for each minutia from its neighborhood. For computational efficiency, the descriptor length for virtual minutiae is further reduced to 16 using product quantization. Our end-to-end system is evaluated on four latent databases: NIST SD27 (258 latents); MSP (1200 latents), WVU (449 latents), and N2N (10 000 latents) against a background set of 100K rolled prints, which includes the true rolled mates of the latents with rank-1 retrieval rates of 65.7%, 69.4%, 65.5%, and 7.6%, respectively. A multi-core solution implemented on 24 cores obtains 1-ms per latent to rolled comparison.},

  abstract     = {In digital image steganography, the statistical model of an image is essential for hiding data in less detectable regions and achieving better security. This has been addressed in the literature where different cost-based and statistical model-based approaches were proposed. However, due to the usage of heuristically defined distortions and non-constrained message models, resulting in numerically solvable equations, there is no closed-form expression for security as a function of payload. The closed-form expression is crucial for a better insight into image steganography problem and also improving performance of batch steganography algorithms. Here, we develop a statistical framework for image steganography in which the cover and the stego messages are modeled as multivariate Gaussian random variables. We propose a novel Gaussian embedding model by maximizing the detection error of the most common optimal detectors within the adopted statistical model. Furthermore, we extend the formulation to cost-based steganography, resulting in a universal embedding scheme that improves empirical results of current cost-based and statistical model-based approaches. This methodology and its presented solution, by reason of assuming a continuous hidden message, remains the same for any embedding scenario. Afterward, the closed-form detection error is derived within the adopted model for image steganography and it is extended to batch steganography. Thus, we introduce Adaptive Batch size Image Merging steganographer, AdaBIM, and mathematically prove it outperforms the state-of-the-art batch steganography method and further verify its superiority by experiments.},

To prevent the fusion center from abusing the sensor information, each sensor sanitizes its local observation using a local privacy mapping, which is designed to achieve both inference privacy of a private hypothesis and data privacy of the sensor raw observations. Various inference and data privacy metrics have been proposed in the literature. We introduce the concept of privacy implication (with vanishing budget) to study the relationships between these privacy metrics. We propose an optimization framework in which both local differential privacy (data privacy) and information privacy (inference privacy) metrics are incorporated. In the parametric case where sensor observations&#39; distributions are known a priori, we propose a two-stage local privacy mapping at each sensor, and show that such an architecture is able to achieve information privacy and local differential privacy to within the predefined budgets. For the nonparametric case where sensor distributions are unknown, we adopt an empirical optimization approach. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate that our proposed approaches allow the fusion center to accurately infer the public hypothesis while protecting both inference and data privacy.},

The problem is motivated by the fact that channel capacity and secrecy capacity are generally achieved by different transmit strategies. First, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure a positive secrecy capacity is shown. The optimal tradeoff between secrecy rate and transmission rate is characterized by a weighted rate sum maximization problem. Since this problem is not necessarily convex, equivalent problem formulations are introduced to derive the optimal transmit strategies. Under sum power constraint only, a closed-form solution is provided. Under per-antenna power constraints, necessary conditions to find the optimal power allocation are derived. Sufficient conditions are provided for the special case of two transmit antennas. For the special case of aligned channels, the optimal transmit strategies can deduced from an equivalent point-to-point channel problem. Last, the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor&#39;s view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question.

In this study, we propose a novel highly secure distributed dynamic state estimation mechanism for wide-area (multi-area) smart grids, composed of geographically separated subregions, each supervised by a local control center. We first propose a distributed state estimator assuming regular system operation that achieves near-optimal performance based on the local Kalman filters and with the exchange of necessary information between local centers. To enhance the security, we further propose to 1) protect the network database and the network communication channels against attacks and data manipulations via a blockchain (BC)-based system design, where the BC operates on the peer-to-peer network of local centers, 2) locally detect the measurement anomalies in real-time to eliminate their effects on the state estimation process, and 3) detect misbehaving (hacked/faulty) local centers in real-time via a distributed trust management scheme over the network. We provide theoretical guarantees regarding the false alarm rates of the proposed detection schemes, where the false alarms can be easily controlled. Numerical studies illustrate that the proposed mechanism offers reliable state estimation under regular system operation, timely and accurate detection of anomalies, and good state recovery performance in case of anomalies.},

In this paper, a novel PIR scheme is proposed, allowing the user to recover a file from a storage system with low communication cost, while allowing some servers in the system to collude in the quest of revealing the identity of the requested file.

To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor.

  abstract     = {The rise of recycled integrated circuits (ICs) in the critical infrastructures causes a major concern to the government and industry because these chips exhibit lower performance and have shorter remaining useful life. The detection of these ICs becomes extremely challenging when they are in the supply chain. It is necessary to power up a chip at a distributor&#39;s site to measure different electrical parameters for verifying whether it is used before. However, this can be challenging, as many of the distributors may not be equipped with proper test infrastructures. Moreover, the reliability of authentic chips may be reduced if they have been removed from the packaging boxes for testing purposes. In this paper, we propose a robust and low-cost solution for enabling the traceability of an IC. The proposed solution builds a chain of trust among the manufacturer, distributors, and system integrator by enabling end-to-end traceability from manufacturing to system integration and provides protection against IC recycling. The proposed solution utilizes a small passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag, which needs to be placed on the package. Any entity in the supply chain can verify the authenticity of a chip using a commercial RFID reader.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a securely precoded OFDM (SP-OFDM) system for efficient and reliable transmission under disguised jamming, where the jammer intentionally misleads the receiver by mimicking the characteristics of the authorized signal and causes complete communication failure. More specifically, we bring off a dynamic constellation by introducing secure randomness shared between the legitimate transmitter and receiver, and hence, break the symmetricity between the authorized signal and the disguised jamming. We analyze the channel capacities of both the traditional OFDM and SP-OFDM under hostile jamming using the arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) model. It is shown that the deterministic coding capacity of the traditional OFDM is zero under the worst disguised jamming. On the other hand, due to the secure randomness shared between the authorized transmitter and receiver, SP-OFDM can achieve a positive capacity under disguised jamming since the AVC channel corresponding to SP-OFDM is not symmetrizable. A remarkable feature of the proposed SP-OFDM scheme is that while achieving strong jamming resistance, it has roughly the same high spectral efficiency as the traditional OFDM system. The robustness of the proposed SP-OFDM scheme under disguised jamming is demonstrated through both theoretic and numerical analyses.},

However, there are a number of limitations in conventional data trading platforms due to the existence of dishonest buyer/data broker. To mitigate these limitations, we posit the importance of a data processing-as-a-service model, which complements the conventional data hosting/exchange-as-a-service model. Specifically, in this paper, we introduce a secure data trading ecosystem and present a new blockchain-based data trading ecosystem (hereafter referred to as SDTE). In the ecosystem, both data broker and buyer are not able to obtain access to the seller’s raw data, as they are only getting access to the analysis findings that they require. In other words, we reduce the challenge of securing the dataset to the challenge to secure the data processing. We also build a security model to analyze the data trading market and describe a new set of trading protocols for the entire data trading market. To demonstrate utility, we implement our proposed secure data trading platform (SDTP) on Ethereum &amp; Intel’s Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and perform an in-depth analysis.},

  abstract     = {With the prevalence of smartphones, mobile websites have been more and more popular. However, many mobile websites collect the location information which greatly increases users&#39; risks of being tracked unexpectedly. The current location access control setting is not sufficient since it cannot prevent the service providers which have been granted location-access permissions from tracking the users. In this paper, we propose a novel location privacy preservation mobile app, called MoveWithMe, which automatically generates decoy queries to hide the real users&#39; locations and intentions when they are using location-based mobile services. Unlike the existing works on dummy trajectories which may be easily discovered by attackers through data analysis, the uniqueness of the MoveWithMe app is that our generated decoys closely behave like real humans. Each decoy in our system has its own moving patterns, daily schedules, and social behaviors, which ensures its movements to be semantically different from the real user&#39;s trace and satisfying geographic constraints. Thus, our decoys can hardly be distinguished even by advanced data mining techniques. Another advantage of the MoveWithMe app is that it guarantees the same level of user experience without affecting the response time or introducing extra control burdens. Decoys move independently in the back end and automatically submit queries to the same service provider whenever the user does so. Our proposed MoveWithMe app has both iOS and Android versions and has been tested on different brands of smartphones against various location-based services, such as Yelp and TripAdvisor. Experimental results demonstrate its practicality, effectiveness, and efficiency.},

In TA, different statistical tools, such as the Euclidean distance (ED) and the Mahalanobis distance (MD), can be used to recover the secret key used by the target device. In practice, values of different parameters influence the key-recovery efficiency of TA. However, until now, the exact relationship between the success rate (SR) of TA and different parameters is not very clear. Therefore, in order to accurately evaluate the physical security of crypto devices with TA, evaluators need to vary values of different parameters and empirically evaluate the SR of TA in different cases. Considering that both the computational complexity and the measurement complexity of the empirical evaluation are high, this may induce unnecessary evaluation overhead and make the evaluation period long. In light of this, in this paper, the exact relationship between the SR of TA and values of different parameters is theoretically analyzed, and the soundness of the theoretical analysis is empirically verified in both simulated and real scenarios. Then, by setting the values of different parameters, the SR of TA can be accurately and efficiently estimated. Overall, this contribution may help evaluators to efficiently evaluate the physical security of crypto devices with TA in practice.},

By taking mean-field approximation, we develop a new continuous-time Markov model to capture the propagations of cascading failures and the rewiring actions that individual nodes can take to bypass failed neighbors. We analyze the stability of the model to identify the critical conditions, under which the cascading failures can be eventually inhibited or would proliferate.

  abstract     = {With the increasing prevalent of digital devices and their abuse for digital content creation, forgeries of digital images and video footage are more rampant than ever. Digital forensics is challenged into seeking advanced technologies for forgery content detection and acquisition device identification. Unfortunately, existing solutions that address image tampering problems fail to identify the device that produces the images or footage while techniques that can identify the camera is incapable of locating the tampered content of its captured images. In this paper, a new perceptual data-device hash is proposed to locate maliciously tampered image regions and identify the source camera of the received image data as a non-repudiable attestation in digital forensics. The presented image may have been either tampered or gone through benign content preserving geometric transforms or image processing operations. The proposed image hash is generated by projecting the invariant image features into a physical unclonable function (PUF)-defined Bernoulli random space. The tamper-resistant random PUF response is unique for each camera and can only be generated upon triggered by a challenge, which is provided by the image acquisition timestamp. The proposed hash is evaluated on the modified CASIA database and CMOS image sensor-based PUF simulated using 180 nm TSMC technology. It achieves a high tamper detection rate of 95.42% with the regions of tampered content successfully located, a good authentication performance of above 98.5% against standard content-preserving manipulations, and 96.25% and 90.42%, respectively, for the more challenging geometric transformations of rotation (0 ~ 360°) and scaling (scale factor in each dimension: 0.5). It is demonstrated to be able to identify the source camera with 100% accuracy and is secure against attacks on PUF.},

In particular, we present a scheme that enables private computation of polynomials of any degree on Lagrange encoded data, while being robust to Byzantine and straggling servers, and to servers colluding to attempt to deduce the identities of the functions to be evaluated. Moreover, incorporating ideas from the well-known Shamir secret sharing scheme allows the data itself to be concealed from the servers as well.

  abstract     = {Contactless fingerprint identification offers significantly higher user convenience, hygiene and has attracted increasing attention for the deployments. However, the presentation of fingers towards the contactless fingerprint sensors is hard to control and often results in unwanted pose changes that significantly degrade the contactless fingerprint matching accuracy. In order to address such problems and improve the fingerprint matching accuracy, this paper proposes a more precise minutiae extraction and pose-compensation approach. As compared with the conventional minutiae extraction approaches, our deep neural network-based approach does not require any image enhancement and is robust to spurious minutiae. All the minutiae extracted from our network are subjected to a three stage pose compensation framework: a) view angle estimation based on the location of core point, b) ellipsoid model formulation which simulates and compensate finger pose, c) intersection area estimation and alignment between different view angles. The proposed ellipsoid model is adaptive to both the silhouette of 2D contactless fingerprint image and the estimated view angle. The corresponding area between the different view angles can be theoretically estimated using this model and incorporated to align two contactless fingerprints for achieving superior matching accuracy. Our reproducible experimental results presented in this paper using public databases, and a database acquired during this work, validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over the commercial software and earlier methods.},

The variables S and X are treated as bounded and non-probabilistic, but are otherwise general. We consider two existing non-stochastic privacy measures, namely the maximum uncertainty reduction L 0 (S → X̂) and the refined information X̂) (also called the maximin information) of S. For each I (S; privacy measure, we propose a corresponding agglomerative clustering algorithm that converges to a locally optimal quantization solution X̂ by iteratively merging elements in the alphabet of X. To instantiate the solution to this problem, we consider two specific utility measures, the worst-case resolution of Xby observing X̂ and the maximal distortion of the released data X̂. We show that the value of the maximin information I (S; X̂) can be determined by dividing the confusability graph into connected subgraphs. Hence, I (S; X̂) can be reduced by merging nodes connecting subgraphs. The relation to the probabilistic information-theoretic privacy is also studied by noting that the Gács-Körner common information is the stochastic version of I and indicates the attainability of statistical indistinguishability.},

This class of modular brainwaves adds extra features to the system like cancelability and two-step authentication. To investigate the biometric potential of AEPs, brainwaves from 40 subjects were recorded while being stimulated by multiple auditory tones modulated at two frequency bands; 40 Hz (m-40) and 80 Hz (m-80). Each subject participated in two sessions on two different days for time-permanence evaluation. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) techniques were adopted here for the rapid estimation of the AEPs using canonical correlation analysis. The energy distribution of the AEPs in different frequency bands represented the subject-unique features. For intra-session setup, correct recognition rates up to 96.46% and equal error rates as low as 0% were achieved using the m-80 stimulation over all the 40 subjects. Moreover, results across different sessions showed high recognition rates (94.5 - 96.5%) and low error rates (2 - 4%) over the same number of subjects. These results show that AEPs carry subject discriminating features allowing the possibility of employing AEPs as a biometric trait.},

This motivates us to investigate which kind of robustness the ensemble defense or effectiveness the ensemble attack can achieve, particularly when they combat with each other. We thus propose a new attack approach, named mixture of attacks, by rendering attackers capable of multiple generative methods and multiple manipulation sets, to perturb a malware example without ruining its malicious functionality. This naturally leads to a new instantiation of adversarial training, which is further geared to enhancing the ensemble of deep neural networks. We evaluate defenses using Android malware detectors against 26 different attacks upon two practical datasets. Experimental results show that the new adversarial training significantly enhances the robustness of deep neural networks against a wide range of attacks, ensemble methods promote the robustness when base classifiers are robust enough, and yet ensemble attacks can evade the enhanced malware detectors effectively, even notably downgrading the VirusTotal service.},

However, one particularly critical threat in the PoS setting is the well-known long-range attacks caused by secret key leakage (LRSL attack). Specifically, an adversary can attempt to control/compromise accounts possessing substantial stake at some past moment such that double-spend or erase past transactions, violating the fundamental persistence property of blockchain. Puncturable signatures provide a satisfying solution to construct practical proof-of-stake blockchain resilient to LRSL attack, despite of the fact that existent constructions are not efficient enough for practical deployments. In this paper, we provide an in-depth study of puncturable signatures and explore its applications in the proof-of-stake blockchain. We formalize a security model that allows the adversary for adaptive signing and puncturing queries, and show a construction with efficient puncturing operations based on the Bloom filter data structure and strong Diffie-Hellman assumption. The puncturing functionality we desire is for a particular part of message, like prefix, instead of the whole message. Furthermore, we use puncturable signatures to construct practical proof-of-stake blockchain protocols that are resilient to LRSL attack, while previously the forward-secure signature is used to immunize this attack. We implement our scheme and provide experimental results showing that in comparison with the forward-secure signature, our construction performs substantially better on signature size, signing and verification efficiency, significantly on key update efficiency.},

  abstract     = {As the core of prediction-error expansion technique, prediction method has a fundamental impact on performance of reversible data hiding. Pixel value ordering (PVO) prediction has been extensively investigated for its high accuracy. However, the correlation of pixels within block has not been fully exploited yet. In this paper, a novel prediction method is proposed by developing PVO prediction in the aspects of spatial correlation and correlated pixel pair. The key to PVO embedding is invariant pixel value order such that the predicted pixel can be identified by value. Instead of predicting and enlarging the largest pixel, we propose to predict and reduce the second largest one and even all others. As the largest pixel which serves as predicted value is maintained after embedding, the numerous predicted pixels can be identified and thus reversibility is guaranteed. IPVO prediction which location-dependently determines the predicted pixel is also developed. For further optimization, multi-pass IPVO embedding is extended from single-layered to double-layered such that full-enclosing pixels can be used to estimate pixel distribution and determine the optimal mode of defining spatial location. Finally, an enhanced pairwise PEE is incorporated with multi-pass IPVO for performance enhancement. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme not only outperforms PVO embedding and its miscellaneous extensions, but also achieves significant superiority in fidelity over a series of state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {In reversible image secret sharing (RISS), the cover image can be recovered to some degree, and a share can be comprehensible rather than noise-like. Reversible cover images play an important role in law enforcement and medical diagnosis. The comprehensible share can not only reduce the suspicion of attackers but also improve the management efficiency of shares. In this paper, we first provide a formal definition of RISS. Then, we propose an RISS algorithm for a (k, n)-threshold based on the principle of the Chinese remainder theorem-based ISS (CRTISS). In the proposed RISS, the secret image is losslessly decoded by a modular operation, and the original cover image is recovered by a binarization operation, both of which are just simple operations. Theoretical analyses and experiments are provided to validate the proposed definition and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Path validation has been explored as an indispensable security feature for the future Internet. Motivated by the Path-Aware Networking Research Group (PANRG) under the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), it gives end-hosts more control over packet forwarding and ensures that the forwarding history is verifiable. The main idea is to require that routers add proofs in packet headers for other routers to verify. We identify linear-scale proofs as the essential efficiency barrier of existing path validation solutions. In this paper, we propose Atomos to validate network paths with constant-size proofs. To this end, we construct a noncommutative homomorphic asymmetric-key encryption scheme. Asymmetric cryptography minimizes the number of proofs needed and saves time in processing proofs. The homomorphism we design yields constant-size proofs. It limits the header-space overhead and outperforms existing linear-scale counterparts when the path length exceeds a value that is usually small. Furthermore, the proposed encryption scheme is noncommutative so that any deviation from the forwarding path can be detected. We explore a series of design strategies for security and efficiency. The evaluation results show that Atomos yields not only shorter proofs but also faster validation than existing solutions.},

  abstract     = {Specific emitter identification (SEI) is a technique that identifies the unique emitter from its received signal by using the specific characteristics of an emitter. In this paper, we consider an SEI problem with unknown receiver distortion. Two groups of SEI schemes based on signal decomposition are proposed. In the proposed schemes, the received signal is pre-processed by either of the following decomposition, i.e., empirical mode decomposition (EMD), intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD), or variational mode decomposition (VMD). In the first group of the proposed schemes, the skewness and the kurtosis are extracted from the decomposed signal, which characterize the non-Gaussian features of the signal. The support vector machine (SVM) or the back-propagation (BP) neural network is applied to fuse the features extracted from the multiple distorted receivers respectively and then determine the unknown emitter. In the second group of the proposed schemes, an approach based on the long short term memory (LSTM) is proposed. The LSTM model learns the deep features rather than the specific non-Gaussian features from the pre-processed signal. In contrast to the first group, the features used to identify the unknown emitter are extracted directly from the pre-processed signal by the trained LSTM model. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-receiver cooperative schemes can achieve the diversity gain in the identification performance. Moreover, we evaluate the identification performance of the proposed schemes in various channels, including the Gaussian channel and the fading channel. Compared to the existing methods based on different time-frequency representations, the proposed schemes possess the merits of high identification accuracy and low complexity. The significance of this paper is that the receive diversity can be achieved by the proposed schemes by using multiple distorted receivers even without compensating the receiver distortion prior to the identification.},

We first provide the modeling of SSR under a general beamforming setting as well as the theoretical formulation of the optimal beamforming design problem. Based on the ideal assumption that the full channel state information is available, we then develop a novel theoretical framework to solve the optimal design problem and thus establish an upper bound on SSR, where the techniques of alternate optimization, fractional programming, semi-definite programming and barrier function method are jointly employed. With the consideration of the constraints in practical implementations, we further propose two sub-optimal beamforming design solutions based on either Wiener prediction or asymptotic approximation. The issue of how to reduce the computational complexity in the optimal relay beamforming design is also discussed in this paper. Finally, we present extensive numerical results to illustrate our theoretical findings and to demonstrate the performance of the proposed sub-optimal beamforming design solutions.},

From a practical point of view, we use the perspective of a hierarchical game to analyze the interactions without the prior information of the eavesdropper. The results show that with the help of the proposed scheme, the performance of the FD-mode attack is inferior to that of passive eavesdropping. A statistical upper bound of eavesdropping is given in a closed-form, which is mainly determined by the direction and distance of the eavesdropper relative to users. Then, a joint power and combining matrix optimization algorithm is proposed to improve the secrecy capacity of the system.},

  abstract     = {According to recent empirical studies, a majority of users have the same, or very similar, passwords across multiple password-secured online services. This practice can have disastrous consequences, as one password being compromised puts all the other accounts at much higher risk. Generally, an adversary may use any side-information he/she possesses about the user, be it demographic information, password reuse on a previously compromised account, or any other relevant information to devise a better brute-force strategy (so called targeted attack). In this work, we consider a distributed brute-force attack scenario in which m adversaries, each observing some side information, attempt breaching a password secured system. We compare two strategies: an uncoordinated attack in which the adversaries query the system based on their own side-information until they find the correct password, and a fully coordinated attack in which the adversaries pool their side-information and query the system together. For passwords X of length n, generated independently and identically from a distribution PX, we establish an asymptotic closed-form expression for the uncoordinated and coordinated strategies when the side-information Y(m) are generated independently from passing X through a memoryless channel PY|X, as the length of the password n goes to infinity. We illustrate our results for binary symmetric channels and binary erasure channels, two families of side-information channels which model password reuse. We demonstrate that two coordinated agents perform asymptotically better than any finite number of uncoordinated agents for these channels, meaning that sharing side-information is very valuable in distributed attacks.},

The secrecy performance of the proposed scheme is analytically investigated and optimized. We develop a new accurate closed-form expression of a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) of each LU without assuming asymptotes for any system parameter. To make system design tractable, we develop another lower bound on ESR which is so analytically amenable that it enables one to not only extend the results of the previous related works but also explore some untouched aspects of the well known artificial-noise-aided scheme. We derive the optimized power allocation coefficient to message-bearing signals which maximizes the latter ESR lower bound. Furthermore, we theoretically study respectively the impacts of the two main parameters, i.e., transmit power P and the number of feedback bits of each LU B, on the power allocation coefficient, and show the asymptotic results for the high-power and high-quantization-resolution systems. We also develop a sufficient condition on P and B under which a positive ESR of each LU can be achieved. We study some important parameters called the minimum required transmit power (MRTP) and the minimum required number of feedback bits (MRFBs) for each LU to achieve a positive ESR or to achieve a target ESR, which have rarely been touched before. Besides, we propose the algorithms to obtain the MRTP and MRFBs. Numerical results are also provided to verify our theoretical results.},

Non-coherent massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is one of promising techniques to fulfill ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements. In addition, physical layer authentication (PLA) technology is particularly suitable for secure IIoT communications thanks to its low-latency attribute. A PLA method for non-coherent massive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) IIoT communication systems is proposed in this paper. This method realizes PLA by embedding an authentication signal (tag) into a message signal, referred to as “message-based tag embedding”. It is different from traditional PLA methods utilizing uniform power tags. We design the optimal tag embedding and optimize the power allocation between the message and tag signals to characterize the trade-off between the message and tag error performance. Numerical results show that the proposed message-based tag embedding PLA method is more accurate than the traditional uniform tag embedding method which has an unavoidable tag error floor close to 10%.},

In this paper, we propose a relativity representation on Riemannian manifold for face spoofing detection. The relativity representation improves generalization capability while ensuring discriminability, at both levels of feature description and classification score. The feature-level relativity representation generalizes information by modeling interrelationships among basic features, and would not depend too much on characteristics of a particular dataset. The score-level relativity representation makes decisions relatively, not absolutely, according to interrelationships (via Riemannian metric) and competitions (via example reweighting) among data samples on Riemannian manifold. The discriminability is ensured by the high-order nature of the feature-level relativity representation as well as Riemannian reweighted discriminative learning of the score-level relativity representation. Moreover, we integrate an attack-sensitive SVM classifier in Euclidean space to improve spoofing detection. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both intra-dataset and cross-dataset testing.},

Several methods for verifying the topology have been suggested in the literature for electrical power distribution networks, but we are not aware of any publications for natural gas networks. In this paper, we develop a useful topology verification algorithm for natural gas networks based on modifying a general known statistics-based approach to eliminate serious limitations for this application while maintaining good performance. We prove that the new algorithm is equivalent to the original statistics-based approach for a sufficiently large number of sensor observations.

To do this, we propose a two-part deep-learning system composed of a convolutional neural network-based feature extractor and a three-layer neural network, called the similarity network. This system maps the pairs of image patches to a score indicating whether they contain the same or different forensic traces. We evaluated the system accuracy of determining whether two image patches were captured by the same or different camera model and manipulated by the same or a different editing operation and the same or a different manipulation parameter, given a particular editing operation. Experiments demonstrate applicability to a variety of forensic traces and importantly show efficacy on “unknown” forensic traces that were not used to train the system. Experiments also show that the proposed system significantly improves upon prior art, reducing error rates by more than half. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of the forensic similarity approach in two practical applications: forgery detection and localization, and database consistency verification.},

This paper proposes a distortion function generating a framework for steganography. It has three modules: a generator with a U-Net architecture to translate a cover image into an embedding change probability map, a no-pre-training-required double-tanh function to approximate the optimal embedding simulator while preserving gradient norm during backpropagation in the adversarial training, and an enhanced steganalyzer based on a convolution neural network together with multiple high pass filters as the discriminator. Extensive experimental results on different datasets have shown that the proposed framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art steganographic schemes. Moreover, the adversarial training time is reduced dramatically compared with the GAN-based automatic steganographic distortion learning framework (ASDL-GAN).},

  abstract     = {Scientific collaborations benefit from sharing information and data from distributed sources, but protecting privacy is a major concern. Researchers, funders, and the public in general are getting increasingly worried about the potential leakage of private data. Advanced security methods have been developed to protect the storage and computation of sensitive data in a distributed setting. However, they do not protect against information leakage from the outcomes of data analyses. To address this aspect, studies on differential privacy (a state-of-the-art privacy protection framework) demonstrated encouraging results, but most of them do not apply to distributed scenarios. Combining security and privacy methodologies is a natural way to tackle the problem, but naive solutions may lead to poor analytical performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel strategy that combines differential privacy methods and homomorphic encryption techniques to achieve the best of both worlds. Using logistic regression (a popular model in biomedicine), we demonstrated the practicability of building secure and privacy-preserving models with high efficiency (less than 3 min) and good accuracy [&lt;;1% of difference in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) against the global model] using a few real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel methodology for real-time monitoring of software running on embedded processors in cyber-physical systems (CPS). The approach uses real-time monitoring of hardware performance counters (HPC) and applies to multi-threaded and interrupt-driven processes typical in programmable logic controller (PLC) implementation of real-time controllers. The methodology uses a black-box approach to profile the target process using HPCs. The time series of HPC measurements over a time window under known-good operating conditions is used to train a machine learning classifier. At run-time, this trained classifier classifies the time series of HPC measurements as baseline (i.e., probabilistically corresponding to a model learned from the training data) or anomalous. The baseline versus anomalous labels over successive time windows offer robustness against the stochastic variability of code execution on the embedded processor and detect code modifications. We demonstrate effectiveness of the approach on an embedded PLC in a hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testbed emulating a benchmark industrial process. In addition, to illustrate the scalability of the approach, we also apply the methodology to a second PLC platform running a representative embedded control process.},

  abstract     = {Despite the great success achieved by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in various image understanding tasks, it is still difficult for CNNs to be applied to vein recognition tasks due to the problems of insufficient training datasets, intra-class variations, and inter-class similarities. Besides, due to the essential requirement on the storage of millions of parameters for CNN, it is challenging to use a CNN for designing a vein-based embedded person identification system. In this paper, these two problems are addressed by learning a discriminative and compact vein recognition model. For the first problem, a hierarchical generative adversarial network (HGAN) consisting of a constrained CNN and a CycleGAN is proposed for data augmentation. Two similarity losses are defined for estimating the self-similarity and inter-class dissimilarity, and a CycleGAN model is properly trained with these two losses for better task-specific training sample generation. After obtaining a baseline vein recognition model fine-tuned on the augmented datasets, the existence of parameter redundancy in the over-parameterized network motivates the proposal of model compression by way of filter pruning and low rank approximation, thus making the compressed model more suitable for deployment on embedded systems. Through the vein recognition experiments with two different datasets and an additional palmprint recognition experiment, the proposed algorithms are shown to yield a highly compact model while keeping the accuracy acceptable for application.},

The “cut-off” density of the eavesdroppers under which the secrecy capacities vanish is identified. By decoupling the analysis of the random trajectories from the random channel fading, closed-form approximations with almost sure convergence to the secrecy capacities are devised. The analysis is extended to study the impact of the oscillator phase noises and finite memories of the aerial eavesdroppers on the secrecy performance of the ground link. Validated by simulations, the cut-off density only depends on the range of the link in the case of SC eavesdropping, while it depends on the flight region of the eavesdroppers in the case of MRC eavesdropping.},

  abstract     = {Since the human face preserves the richest information for recognizing individuals, face recognition has been widely investigated and achieved great success in various applications in the past decades. However, face spoofing attacks (e.g., face video replay attack) remain a threat to modern face recognition systems. Though many effective methods have been proposed for anti-spoofing, we find that the performance of many existing methods is degraded by illuminations. It motivates us to develop illumination-invariant methods for anti-spoofing. In this paper, we propose a two-stream convolutional neural network (TSCNN), which works on two complementary spaces: RGB space (original imaging space) and multi-scale retinex (MSR) space (illumination-invariant space). Specifically, the RGB space contains the detailed facial textures, yet it is sensitive to illumination; MSR is invariant to illumination, yet it contains less detailed facial information. In addition, the MSR images can effectively capture the high-frequency information, which is discriminative for face spoofing detection. Images from two spaces are fed to the TSCNN to learn the discriminative features for anti-spoofing. To effectively fuse the features from two sources (RGB and MSR), we propose an attention-based fusion method, which can effectively capture the complementarity of two features. We evaluate the proposed framework on various databases, i.e., CASIA-FASD, REPLAY-ATTACK, and OULU, and achieve very competitive performance. To further verify the generalization capacity of the proposed strategies, we conduct cross-database experiments, and the results show the great effectiveness of our method.},

To this, we propose a highly practical solution for the privacy-preserving integration and sharing of datasets among a group of participants. At the heart of our solution is a new interactive protocol, PrivateLink. Through PrivateLink, each participant is able to randomize his/her dataset via an independent and untrusted third party, such that the resulting dataset can be merged with other randomized datasets contributed by other participants in a privacy-preserving manner. Our approach does not require key sharing among participants in order to integrate different datasets. This, in turn, leads to a user-friendly and scalable solution. Moreover, the correctness of a randomized dataset returned by the third party can be securely verified by the participant. We further demonstrate PrivateLink&#39;s general utilities: using it to construct a structure-preserving data integration protocol. This is particularly useful for private, fine-grained integration of network traffic data. We state the security of our protocols under the well-established real-ideal simulation paradigm and demonstrate practicality by a prototype implementation on: 1) healthcare datasets and 2) DNS and NetFlow datasets.},

  abstract     = {People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducted experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used for image recognition, speech recognition, and other pattern analysis tasks. Despite the success of DNNs, these systems can be exploited by what is termed adversarial examples. An adversarial example, in which a small distortion is added to the input data, can be designed to be misclassified by the DNN while remaining undetected by humans or other systems. Such adversarial examples have been studied mainly in the image domain. Recently, however, studies on adversarial examples have been expanding into the voice domain. For example, when an adversarial example is applied to enemy wiretapping devices (victim classifiers) in a military environment, the enemy device will misinterpret the intended message. In such scenarios, it is necessary that friendly wiretapping devices (protected classifiers) should not be deceived. Therefore, the selective adversarial example concept can be useful in mixed situations, defined as situations in which there is both a classifier to be protected and a classifier to be attacked. In this paper, we propose a selective audio adversarial example with minimum distortion that will be misclassified as the target phrase by a victim classifier but correctly classified as the original phrase by a protected classifier. To generate such examples, a transformation is carried out to minimize the probability of incorrect classification by the protected classifier and that of correct classification by the victim classifier. We conducted experiments targeting the state-of-the-art DeepSpeech voice recognition model using Mozilla Common Voice datasets and the Tensorflow library. They showed that the proposed method can generate a selective audio adversarial example with a 91.67% attack success rate and 85.67% protected classifier accuracy.},

One such approach is the use of hardware performance counters (HPCs) to detect malware for Linux and Android platforms. This paper, for the first time, presents an analytical framework to investigate the security provided by HPC-based malware detection techniques. The HPC readings are periodically monitored over the duration of the program execution for comparison with a golden HPC reading. We develop a mathematical framework to investigate the probability of malware detection, when HPCs are monitored at a pre-determined sampling interval.

This paper analyzes whether IP addresses used by cloud providers are unpredictable enough in practice. We analyze the IP address allocation behaviors in two major cloud computing providers (Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform) and find that the actual entropy provided by allocated IP addresses is limited. We evaluate several prediction models, including a simple frequency-based model as well as a Markov process model that produces an address prediction set from time series data of collected IP addresses. Our results show that simple models can reduce the search space for allocated IP addresses and diminish the effectiveness of randomization defenses.},

The scenario we explore consists of a set of signatures, which could be signed by the same author or by multiple signers. As such, we discuss three methods which estimate automatically the common authorship of a set of off-line signatures. The first method develops a score similarity matrix, worked out with the assistance of duplicated signatures; the second uses a feature-distance matrix for each pair of signatures; and the last method introduces pre-classification based on the complexity of each signature. Publicly available signatures were used in the experiments, which gave encouraging results. As a baseline for the performance obtained by our approaches, we carried out a visual Turing Test where forensic and non-forensic human volunteers, carrying out the same task, performed less well than the automatic schemes.},

The custom (personalized) fabrication is a key feature of this technology, enabling customization per application, even in small quantities due to low-cost printing compared with lithography. However, the personalized and on-demand fabrication, the non-standard circuit design, and the limited number of printing layers with larger geometries compared with traditional silicon chip manufacturing open doors for new and unique reverse engineering (RE) schemes for this technology. In this paper, we present a robust RE methodology based on supervised machine learning, starting from image acquisition all the way to netlist extraction.

  abstract     = {Infrastructure networks are vulnerable to both cyber and physical attacks. Building a secure and resilient networked system is essential for providing reliable and dependable services. To this end, we establish a two-player three-stage game framework to capture the dynamics in the infrastructure protection and recovery phases. Specifically, the goal of the infrastructure network designer is to keep the network connected before and after the attack, while the adversary aims to disconnect the network by compromising a set of links. With costs for creating and removing links, the two players aim to maximize their utilities while minimizing the costs. In this paper, we use the concept of subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) to characterize the optimal strategies of the network defender and attacker. We derive the SPE explicitly in terms of system parameters. We further investigate the resilience planning of the defender and the strategic timing of attack of the adversary. Finally, we use case studies of UAV-enabled communication networks for disaster recovery to corroborate the obtained analytical results.},

We focus on the practically relevant setting with no channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). More specifically, the legitimate transmitter and the cooperative jammer only have statistical knowledge of the channel in terms of the effective number of ISI channel taps, i.e., channel impulse response (CIR) lengths, toward the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Our main contribution is to show that in the absence of CSIT, positive SDoF can be achieved by carefully exploiting: 1) the heterogeneity of the CIR lengths toward both receivers and 2) the relative number of antennas at the four terminals. To achieve secrecy, we propose a scheme in which the transmitter strategically sends a mixture of information and artificial noise symbols in a way that exploits the heterogeneity of CIR lengths. Additionally, the cooperative jammer transmits artificial noise symbols in a way that completely masks all the information symbols that are received at the eavesdropping node. Under the proposed scheme, positive SDoF can be achieved, even when the number of antennas at the legitimate receiver is less than the number of antennas at the eavesdropper.},

  abstract     = {Clustering Internet of Things (IoT) networks, to alleviate the network scalability problem, provides an opportunity for an adversary to compromise a set of nodes by simply compromising the relay they are associated with. In such scenarios, an adversary who has compromised the relay can affect the network&#39;s performance by deliberately dropping the packets transmitted by the IoT devices and/or by corrupting the packets to be forwarded by the relay. In this way, the adversary can successfully mimic a bad radio channel between the IoT devices and the relay, thereby requiring the IoT devices to retransmit more frequently. Such a strategy increases the processing load on the IoT devices and will drain their batteries at a faster rate. To detect such an attack, we present hybrid intrusion detection systems that rely on the monitoring of uplink and downlink packets transmitted between IoT devices and the relay. Specifically, we compare the observed packet drop probabilities against their long-term expected values. The detection rules proposed originate from the generalized likelihood ratio test, where the adversary parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. A semi-analytical approach to obtain the expressions for the false alarm probability is presented in order to determine the decision thresholds. Results presented show the effectiveness of the proposed detection systems, demonstrate the impact of the choice of adversary parameters on them, and validate the expressions obtained for the false alarm probability.},

  abstract     = {Location-based service (LBS) in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) has significantly benefited information acquisition from geographically-based social networking. Authentication guarantees the unforgeability and the effectiveness of the LBS information. Unfortunately, owing to a large quantity of redundant or useless LBS messages disseminated in VANETs, the heavy authentication overhead of the existing work adopting a periodically released authentication key, filtering with message identifiers or exploiting public key (fully) homomorphic encryption (FHE), is either intolerable by resource-constrained on-board units (OBUs) or inappropriate to the realtime controlling requirement for VANETs. In this paper, an efficient multi-key secure outsourced computation scheme MSOC without exploiting public key FHE is first proposed, in the setting of two non-colluding servers, namely the cloud and the cryptographic service provider (CSP). Then, based on MSOC, an efficient and secure comparison protocol LSCP is devised, without the interaction between the server and the users. Furthermore, a lightweight privacy-preserving authentication protocol LPPA for LBS in VANETs is proposed, by eliminating duplicate and useless encrypted LBS messages before authentication is executed, through a newly devised efficient privacy-preserving information filtering system. Both user’s location privacy and interest privacy are well protected against even the collusion between the roadside units (RSUs) serving as the cloud (or CSP) and malicious users. Especially, the property of ciphertext re-encryption of our proposed MSOC also guarantees the interest pattern privacy whether two users accept the same LBS information. Finally, formal security proof and extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness and practicability of our proposed LPPA.},

Existing cross-modality recognition works mainly focus on learning sharable feature representations to handle the cross-modality discrepancies. However, apart from the cross-modality discrepancy caused by different camera spectrums, VT-REID also suffers from large cross-modality and intra-modality variations caused by different camera environments and human poses, and so on. In this paper, we propose a dual-path network with a novel bi-directional dual-constrained top-ranking (BDTR) loss to learn discriminative feature representations. It is featured in two aspects: 1) end-to-end learning without extra metric learning step and 2) the dual-constraint simultaneously handles the cross-modality and intra-modality variations to ensure the feature discriminability. Meanwhile, a bi-directional center-constrained top-ranking (eBDTR) is proposed to incorporate the previous two constraints into a single formula, which preserves the properties to handle both cross-modality and intra-modality variations. The extensive experiments on two cross-modality re-ID datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {Despite being highly secure, vein recognition suffers from the high inter-class similarity and intra-class variation resulting from the uncontrolled image capture, making the design of discriminative and robust representation very important. The recent success of convolutional neural network (CNN) for various image understanding tasks makes it a promising method for feature extraction. However, limited variability in small-scale datasets leads to systems derived from the direct training or fine-tuning not transferable and unreliable for practical biometric applications. This motivates the design of a multi-weighted co-occurrence descriptor encoding (MWCDE) model for vein recognition. Instead of directly conducting a feed-forward operation with a pre-trained CNN for obtaining the semantic features from the fully connected layers, co-occurrence features among convolutional filters are modeled first in MWCDE by a simple convolution between an indicator filter in a higher layer with a to-be-reweighted filter in a lower layer, and a redundancy-driven indicator filter selection algorithm is designed for filtering out some ambiguous representations. Second, another hard feature weighting strategy with a binary masking scheme is proposed for discarding noisy background and feature redundancy. The selected high-order descriptors are then embedded and aggregated into the compact feature vectors with a saliency driven spatial weighted Fisher vector algorithm, followed by the introduction of a generalized support vector machine for recognition. Extensive experiments with three benchmark vein datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art results, and an additional experiment with the PolyU multispectral palmprint database illustrates its generalization ability.

However, hardware and software techniques also bring smart grid numerous security concerns, especially various cyberattacks. Malicious users can launch cyberattacks to tamper with smart meters anytime and anywhere, mainly for the purpose of stealing electricity. This makes electricity theft much easier to commit and more difficult to detect. Researchers have devised many approaches to identify malicious users. However, these approaches suffer from either poor accuracy or expensive cost of deploying monitoring devices. This paper aims to locate malicious users using a limited number of monitoring devices (called inspectors) within the shortest detection time. Before inspectors conduct any inspection, suspicions that users steal electricity are comprehensively assessed, mainly through analyzing prior records of electricity theft as well as deviations between the reported and predicted normal consumptions. On the basis of these suspicions, we further propose a suspicion assessment-based inspection (SAI) algorithm, in which the users with the highest suspicions will be first probed individually. Then, the other users will be probed by a binary tree-based inspection strategy. The binary tree is built according to users&#39; suspicions. The inspection order of the nodes on the binary tree is also determined by the suspicions. The experiment results show that the SAI algorithm outperforms the existing methods.},

The first scheme is based on two non-colluded untrusted cloud servers, and the second one is under the single untrusted cloud server model. In the designed schemes, we develop a new technique that contains merging vertices and edges, inserting fake vertices and edges, shuffling vertices and randomizing weights of edges to protect the privacy of graphs. In order to realize the checkability of result from a single untrusted cloud server, we design a novel verification mechanism by outsourcing the min-cut of two related graphs. Besides, we also provide security analysis and the experimental evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first research on secure outsourcing of graph algorithm.},

Even though system administrators can secure critical devices in the network using best practices and state-of-the-art technology, a single vulnerable device can undermine the security of the entire network. The goal of this work is to limit the ability of an attacker to exploit a vulnerable device on an IoT network and fabricate deceitful messages to co-opt other devices. The approach is to limit attackers by using device proxies that are used to retransmit and control network communications. We present an architecture that prevents deceitful messages generated by compromised devices from affecting the rest of the network. The design assumes a centralized and trustworthy machine that can observe the behavior of all devices on the network. The central machine collects application layer data, as opposed to low-level network traffic, from each IoT device. The collected data is used to train models that capture the normal behavior of each individual IoT device. The normal behavioral data is then used to monitor the IoT devices and detect anomalous behavior. This paper reports on our experiments using both a binary classifier and a density-based clustering algorithm to model benign IoT device behavior with a realistic test-bed, designed to capture normal behavior in an IoT-monitored environment. Results from the IoT testbed show that both the classifier and the clustering algorithms are promising and encourage the use of application-level data for detecting compromised IoT devices.},

To achieve desired security, it is necessary (but not sufficient) to find proper low entropy mask sets to protect all sensitive secret-dependant intermediate variables. However, one crucial problem concerning this intuitive idea is that what ‘proper’ mask sets should be. To formally capture such crucial qualification, we introduce the notion of balancedness to characterize this natural attribute of mask sets themselves. Considering that this notion is limited to characterize first-order security, we generalize it to $d$ -dimension balancedness to accommodate $d^{th}$ -order security, then we exhibit lower and upper bounds on $d$ -dimension balancedness for any $d$ . With the help of these essential definitions, we prove that no balanced low entropy mask set really exists, which implies that LEMS implementations always have vulnerabilities in theory due to the unbalancedness of underlying mask sets. In order to further demonstrate the practical implications of balancedness, we show 4 different kinds of attacks on three state-of-the-art LEMS implementations. Specifically, the distribution attack proposed in this paper is a general first-order attack on LEMS. The results demonstrate that unbalanced mask sets actually do lead to serious vulnerabilities.},

A number of previous works have shown that it performs well in measuring the similarities of individuals given a set of correctly labeled pairwise data by domain experts. These important and precisely-labeled pairwise data are often highly sensitive in real world (e.g., patients similarity). This paper studies, for the first time, how pairwise information can be leaked to attackers during distance metric learning, and develops differential pairwise privacy (DPP), generalizing the definition of standard differential privacy, for secure metric learning. Unlike traditional differential privacy which only applies to independent samples, thus cannot be used for pairwise data, DPP successfully deals with this problem by reformulating the worst case . Specifically, given the pairwise data, we reveal all the involved correlations among pairs in the constructed undirected graph. DPP is then formalized that defines what kind of DML algorithm is private to preserve pairwise data. After that, a case study employing the contrastive loss is exhibited to clarify the details of implementing a DPP- DML algorithm. Particularly, the sensitivity reduction technique is proposed to enhance the utility of the output distance metric. Experiments both on a toy dataset and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves pairwise data privacy without compromising the output performance much (Accuracy declines less than 0.01 throughout all benchmark datasets when the privacy budget is set at 4).},

  abstract     = {The vulnerability of facial recognition systems to face morphing attacks is well known. Many different approaches for morphing attack detection (MAD) have been proposed in the scientific literature. However, the MAD algorithms proposed so far have mostly been trained and tested on datasets whose distributions of image characteristics are either very limited (e.g., only created with a single morphing tool) or rather unrealistic (e.g., no print-scan transformation). As a consequence, these methods easily overfit on certain image types and the results presented cannot be expected to apply to real-world scenarios. For example, the results of the latest NIST FRVT MORPH show that the majority of submitted MAD algorithms lacks robustness and performance when considering unseen and challenging datasets. In this work, subsets of the FERET and FRGCv2 face databases are used to create a realistic database for training and testing of MAD algorithms, containing a large number of ICAO-compliant bona fide facial images, corresponding unconstrained probe images, and morphed images created with four different face morphing tools. Furthermore, multiple post-processings are applied on the reference images, e.g., print-scan and JPEG2000 compression. On this database, previously proposed differential morphing algorithms are evaluated and compared. In addition, the application of deep face representations for differential MAD algorithms is investigated. It is shown that algorithms based on deep face representations can achieve very high detection performance (less than 3% D-EER) and robustness with respect to various post-processings. Finally, the limitations of the developed methods are analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Audio surveillance is gaining in the last years wide interest. This is due to the large number of situations in which this kind of systems can be used, either alone or combined with video-based algorithms. In this paper we propose a deep learning method to automatically recognize events of interest in the context of audio surveillance (namely screams, broken glasses and gun shots). The audio stream is represented by a gammatonegram image. We propose a 21-layer CNN to which we feed sections of the gammatonegram representation. At the output of this CNN there are units that correspond to the classes. We trained the CNN, called AReN, by taking advantage of a problem-driven data augmentation, which extends the training dataset with gammatonegram images extracted by sounds acquired with different signal to noise ratios. We experimented it with three datasets freely available, namely SESA, MIVIA Audio Events and MIVIA Road Events and we achieved 91.43%, 99.62% and 100% recognition rate, respectively. We compared our method with other state of the art methodologies based both on traditional machine learning methodologies and deep learning. The comparison confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperforms the existing methods in terms of recognition rate. We experimentally prove that the proposed network is resilient to the noise, has the capability to significantly reduce the false positive rate and is able to generalize in different scenarios. Furthermore, AReN is able to process 5 audio frames per second on a standard CPU and, consequently, it is suitable for real audio surveillance applications.},

However, the pressure to drive down costs is likely to lead to cheap untrusted solutions and a multitude of unprecedented risks. These risks will especially emerge at the frontier between the cyberspace and DNA biology. To address these risks, we perform a forensic-security assessment of a typical DNA-fingerprinting flow. We demonstrate, for the first time, benchtop analysis of biochemical-level vulnerabilities in flows that are based on a standard quantification assay known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After identifying potential vulnerabilities, we realize attacks using benchtop techniques to demonstrate their catastrophic impact on the outcome of the DNA fingerprinting. We also propose a countermeasure, in which DNA samples are each uniquely barcoded (using synthesized DNA molecules) in advance of PCR analysis, thus demonstrating the feasibility of our approach using benchtop techniques. We discuss how molecular barcoding could be utilized within a cyber-biological framework to improve DNA-fingerprinting security against a wide range of threats, including sample forgery. We also present a security analysis of the DNA barcoding mechanism from a molecular biology perspective.},

  abstract     = {Line current differential relays (LCDRs) detect faults accurately and promptly, by comparing all currents flowing into the line. This type of relay has been identified in the literature as a reliable protection for lines in DC microgrids (MGs). LCDRs, however, lack the required resiliency against cyber intrusions, such as false data injection attacks (FDIAs) and time synchronization attacks (TSAs), due to their high dependence on communication infrastructure and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS). This paper first introduces coordinated attacks-i.e., several almost-simultaneous FDIAs or TSAs that are carried out independently to achieve a specific objective-as potential threats for MGs. Then, through a case study, it shows how coordinated FDIAs and TSAs can initiate a sequence of events that result in instability of an entire MG. Afterwards, an approach is presented to detect FDIAs and TSAs, and to distinguish them from real faults. The proposed method is comprised of passive oscillator circuits (POCs) installed in series with each converter. During faults, the resultant RLC circuit causes the POCs to resonate and generate a damped sinusoidal component with a specific frequency, i.e., f d . However, f d is not generated during FDIAs and TSAs, since unlike faults, which are physical events that trigger the natural frequencies of a system, cyber-attacks happen in the cyber layer without provoking natural frequencies of the physical layer. Thus, an LCDR pickup without detecting f d denotes an FDIA or a TSA. Since f d is locally measured and analyzed by each LCDR, the proposed detection approach cannot be targeted by cyber-attacks. The proposed method is evaluated on a simulated ±2.5 kV DC MG. Numerical analysis confirms that the proposed method (i) is system-independent; (ii) detects FDIAs and TSAs in less than 1 ms; (iii) is sensitive to high-resistance faults; (iv) can determine fault types, and (v) reduces faults&#39; peak currents.},

To deal with intra-variability, we analyze the idiosyncrasy in individual handwriting. We identify/verify the writer from highly idiosyncratic text-patches. Such patches are detected using a deep recurrent reinforcement learning-based architecture. An idiosyncratic score is assigned to every patch, which is predicted by employing deep regression analysis. For writer identification, we propose a deep neural architecture, which makes the final decision by the idiosyncratic score-induced weighted average of patch-based decisions. For writer verification, we propose two algorithms for patch-fed deep feature aggregation, which assist in authentication using a triplet network.

Today, challenges still exist in historical writer identification (WI), where documents may present very complex handwriting styles. In this paper, we propose novel techniques for a detailed description and accurate identification of handwriting in historical documents. Because handwriting contours are one of the most salient components to characterize one&#39;s handwriting style, a novel pathlet feature is proposed to describe their rich properties beyond slant and curvature in a principled way; these properties can be exploited in a VLAD-like encoding framework for fine-grained handwriting description. Besides the pathlet feature, we extract unidirectional SIFT feature to describe handwriting corners and junctions. To effectively encode the pathlet and SIFT features, a novel encoding method, named bagged VLAD, is further proposed to address the problem that a large codebook sparsely spreads out the data points and leads to a degraded performance, allowing a much larger codebook for improved encoding performance. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ICDAR2017 Historical-WI database and ICDAR2019 HDRC-IR database, and has won the first place in ICDAR2019 HDRC-IR competition.},

  abstract     = {Conventional intrusion detection systems based on supervised learning techniques require a large number of samples for training, while in some scenarios, such as zero-day attacks, security agencies can only intercept a limited number of shots of malicious samples. Therefore, there is a need for few-shot detection. In this paper, a detection method based on a meta-learning framework is proposed for this purpose. The proposed method can be used to distinguish and compare a pair of network traffic samples as a basic task of learning, including a normal unaffected sample and a malicious one. To accomplish this task, we design a deep neural network (DNN) named FC-Net, which mainly comprises two parts: feature extraction network and comparison network. FC-Net learns a pair of feature maps for classification from a pair of network traffic samples, then compares the obtained feature maps, and finally determines whether the pair of samples belongs to the same type. To evaluate the proposed detection method, we construct two datasets for few-shot network intrusion detection based on real network traffic data sources, using a specifically developed approach. The experimental results indicate that the proposed detection method is universal and is not limited to specific datasets or attack types. Training and testing on the same datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the average detection rate up to 98.88%. The outcome of training on one dataset and testing on the other one confirms that the proposed method can achieve better performance. In a few-shot scenario, malicious samples in an untrained dataset can be detected successfully, and the average detection rate is up to 99.62%.},

Assume Alice and Bob have access to the input and the output links of an anonymous network, respectively, and they wish to collaboratively reveal the connections between the input and the output links without being detected by Willie who protects the network. Alice generates a codebook where each codeword is a unique fingerprint indicating a sequence of interpacket delays, and shares it only with Bob. To trace each flow, Alice selects a fingerprint and manipulates the packet timings of the flow to follow the packet timings suggested by the fingerprint, and Bob extracts the fingerprints from it after it passes through the network. We model the network as parallel M/M/1 queues where each queue is shared by a flow f i from Alice to Bob and other flows independent of f i . Packet timings of the flows are governed by independent Poisson processes. Assuming all input flows have equal packet rates and that Bob observes only flows with fingerprints, we first present two scenarios: 1) Alice fingerprints all the flows and 2) Alice fingerprints a subset of the flows, unknown to Willie. Then, we extend the construction and analysis to the case of arbitrary flow rates and the case where Bob observes flows with and without fingerprints. For each scenario, we derive the number of flows that Alice and Bob can trace by fingerprinting.},

  abstract     = {The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has recently identified digital relays as targets vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The DHS has also noted that attacks to multiple relays can bring about cascading outages of transmission lines, leading to blackouts. As a result, making protective relays cyber-resilient is a prominent security issue in power networks. Line current differential relays (LCDRs) are among the potentially vulnerable digital relays that are increasingly deployed for protecting critical transmission lines. LCDRs, however, lack the required resiliency against cyber attacks, due to their high dependence on communication systems. This paper unveils that such susceptibilities can result in unwarranted trip signals through false data injection attacks (FDIAs), and so cause instability if several attacks are coordinated. It also presents a solution for detecting FDIAs and distinguishing them from real internal faults. To detect attacks, the proposed method compares the estimated and locally measured voltages at an LCDR&#39;s terminal for both the positive sequence (PS) and negative sequence (NS). To estimate the local voltage for each sequence, the proposed technique uses an unknown input observer (UIO), the state-space model of the faulty line, and remote and local measurements, all associated with that sequence. The difference between the measured and estimated local voltages for each sequence remains close to zero during real internal faults because, in this condition, the state-space model based on which the UIO operates correctly represents the line. Nevertheless, the state-space model mismatch during FDIAs leads to a large difference between measured and estimated values in both sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed method is corroborated using simulation results for the IEEE 39-bus network.},

  abstract     = {Lightweight cryptography has become more and more important in recent years because of the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and usage of smart mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a novel secure lightweight entity authentication hardware primitive called SLATE, where its area is about 50% to more than 3X smaller than existing lightweight ciphers and strong physical unclonable functions (PUFs), respectively. Even though the authentication of SLATE is done through challenge response pair (CRP) verification similar to strong PUFs, the source of the key for SLATE must be coming from any existing secret key storage used for any ciphers. A main advantage of SLATE over most existing strong PUFs being an entity authentication primitive is that SLATE is resistant to known attacks to strong PUFs or logic obfuscations, such as model building attacks and Boolean satisfiability (SAT) attacks. Furthermore, we show that the implementation cost of SLATE with a 176-bit key and 244 CRPs is only 663 gate equivalents (GEs). Compared with lightweight ciphers and existing secure strong PUFs, we show that SLATE is a practical security primitive for resource constrained systems for its extremely small footprint and security. Finally, we show that SLATE is information theoretically secure when valid CRPs are communicated through insecure channels.},

  abstract     = {Massive MIMO attains high spectral and power efficiency transmission by leveraging a large number of transmit antennas. However, to capture the benefits of massive MIMO, each antenna should be accompanied with a dedicated RF chain, and consequently, the hardware costs would scale up tremendously with the increase of the antennas. Cheap implementations of massive MIMO have recently gained considerable attention, and constant modulus (CM) signaling is seen as a promising solution, owing to its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This paper investigates the physical-layer (PHY) security in massive MIMO with an emphasis on the CM signaling. In particular, we consider a transmitter with massive antennas broadcast common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, and a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our goal is to design the CM beamforming at the transmitter so that the multicast secrecy rate is maximized. This secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is generally NP-hard. To tackle it, two tractable approaches are developed. The first one employs the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and the Charnes–Copper transformation to obtain a convex relaxation of the SRM problem. However, due to the dimension lifting of SDR, this approach is feasible only for small to medium antenna sizes. The second approach leverages the Dinkelbach method to work directly over the beamformer domain; a custom-build nonconvex alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to efficiently perform each Dinkelbach update. Simulation results demonstrate that the second approach is computationally more efficient and can achieve nearly optimal performance when the number of antennas is large.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of the high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard enables people to enjoy high definition (HD) video content; meanwhile, HD videos, tamper detection has become a crucial issue and gradually aroused people&#39;s attention. The detection of double HEVC compressed videos with the same coding parameters is challenging since the recompression traces are inconspicuous. To deal with this issue, a novel method based on the intra prediction mode is proposed in this paper. First, the quality degradation mechanism is analyzed to facilitate the selection of classification features and the source of error in intra coding is fully considered to establish the equivalent error model. Second, the feature model of double HEVC compression detection, which is mainly based on the statistical feature of intra prediction mode, is proposed. Finally, the experiment is carried out in 720p and 1080p HEVC videos instead of low-resolution (CIF or QCIF) videos. Experimental results have demonstrated better efficiency of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the proposed method is more robust to various encoding configurations.},

The concepts of DoS frequency and DoS duration are introduced to describe the DoS attacks. According to the attack situation, that is, whether the attack is successfully implemented or not, the original physical system is rewritten as a switched version. A resilient sliding mode control scheme is designed to guarantee that the physical process is exponentially stable, which is a foundation of the main results. Then, a zero-sum game is employed to establish an effective mixed defense mechanism. Furthermore, a defense-based resilient sliding mode control scheme is proposed and the desired control performance is achieved. Compared with the existing results, the differences mainly lie in two aspects, that is, one where a switched model is obtained, based on which the average dwell-time like approach is utilized to derive the resilient control scheme, and the other where the zero-sum game in employed to make the attacks satisfy the concepts of DoS frequency and DoS duration. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilient control approach.},

  abstract     = {Single sample per person face recognition (SSPP FR), i.e., identifying a person (i.e., data subject) with a single face image only for training, has several attractive potential applications, but it is still a challenging problem. Existing generic learning methods usually leverage prototype plus variation (P+V) model for SSPP FR provided that face samples in the biometric enrolment database are variation-free and thus can be treated as the prototypes of data subjects. However, this condition is not satisfied when these samples are contaminated by nuisance facial variations in the wild, such as varied expressions, poor lightings, and disguises (e.g., wearing scarf). We call this new and practical problem SSPP FR with a ${c}$ ontaminated biometric ${e}$ nrolment database (SSPP-ce FR). Subsequently, a challenging issue will be raised on estimating proper prototypes from the contaminated enrolment samples in SSPP-ce FR. Moreover, the generated variation dictionary also needs to be enhanced because it is simply based on the subtraction of average face from the samples of the same data subject in the generic set, thus containing individual characteristics that can hardly be shared by other data subjects. To address these two issues, we propose a novel synergistic generic learning (SGL) method to study the SSPP-ce FR problem. Compared with the existing generic learning methods, SGL develops a new “learned P + learned V” model to identify new query samples. Specifically, it learns better prototypes for the contaminated samples in the biometric enrolment database by preserving their more discriminative subject-specific portions and learns a representative variation dictionary by extracting the less discriminative intra-subject variants from an auxiliary generic set. The experiments on various benchmark face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SGL method.},

  abstract     = {The use of human biometrics is becoming widespread and its major application is human recognition for controlling unauthorized access to both digital services and physical localities. However, the practical deployment of human biometrics for recognition poses a number of challenges, such as template storage capacity, computational requirements, and privacy of biometric information. These challenges are important considerations, in addition to performance accuracy, especially for authentication systems with limited resources. In this paper, we propose a wave atom transform (WAT)-based palm-vein recognition scheme. The scheme computes, maintains, and matches palm-vein templates with less computational complexity and less storage requirements under a secure and privacy-preserving environment. First, we extract palm-vein traits in the WAT domain, which offers sparser expansion and better capability to extract texture features. Then, the randomization and quantization are applied to the extracted features to generate a compact, privacy-preserving palm-vein template. We analyze the proposed scheme for its performance and privacy-preservation. The proposed scheme obtains equal error rates (EERs) of 1.98%, 0%, 3.05%, and 1.49% for PolyU, PUT, VERA and our palm-vein datasets, respectively. The extensive experimental results demonstrate comparable matching accuracy of the proposed scheme with a minimum template size and computational time of 280 bytes and 0.43 s, respectively.},

Face sketch synthesis is widely applied in law enforcement as well as digital entertainment fields. However, the existing methods either focus on hand-crafted techniques where prior human experience is relied on or adopt deep learning techniques as an end-to-end framework, where facial details cannot be well represented. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for face sketch synthesis in the wild via a deep patch representation-based probabilistic graphical model (DeepPGM). A Siamese network is constructed to extract deep patch representation from a raw facial patch, where the representative detail information for robust face sketch synthesis can be exploited. The generated deep patch representation and facial image patches are then optimally combined through a probabilistic graphical model. The proposed DeepPGM approach not only outperforms the state-of-the-art on public face sketch datasets but also can cope with forensic photos in the wild conditions, including varying lightings, poses, occlusions, skin colors, and ethnic origins. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by extensive experiments on two public face sketch datasets and real-world forensic photos in the wild.},

Currently, the state-of-the-art systems require that the font of letters present in the test documents of unknown origin must be available in those used for training the classifier. In this paper, we attempt to take the first step toward overcoming this limitation. Specifically, we introduce a novel printer specific local texture descriptor. The highlight of our technique is the use of encoding and regrouping strategy based on small linear-shaped structures composed of pixels having similar intensity and gradient. The results of experiments performed on two separate datasets show that: 1) on a publicly available dataset, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for characters printed in the same font and reduces the confusion between the printers of same brand and model on another dataset having documents printed in four different fonts, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cross font experiments.},

A notable example is the PRNU pattern, which can be regarded as a device fingerprint, and has received great attention in multimedia forensics. In this paper, we propose a method to extract a camera model fingerprint, called noiseprint, where the scene content is largely suppressed and model-related artifacts are enhanced. This is obtained by means of a Siamese network, which is trained with pairs of image patches coming from the same (label +1) or different (label -1) cameras. Although the noiseprints can be used for a large variety of forensic tasks, in this paper we focus on image forgery localization.

Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic achievable secrecy sum rate when the CT transmit power goes to infinity.

  abstract     = {Person re-identification is an important task in forensics applications. Most existing person re-identification methods focus on matching persons captured by different true-color cameras. In practice, the captured pedestrian videos may be grayscale in some cases due to camera malfunction or special treatment for gray mode. In these cases, the person re-identification between true-color and grayscale pedestrian videos, which we call color to gray video person re-identification (CGVPR), will be needed. Since the color information that is very important to represent a pedestrian is usually intensity information and monochrome in grayscale videos, the CGVPR problem is very challenging. To relieve the difficulties in CGVPR, we propose an asymmetric within-video projection based Semicoupled Dictionary Pair Learning (SDPL) approach. SDPL simultaneously learns two within-video projection matrices, a pair of true-color and grayscale dictionaries, as well as a semi-coupled mapping matrix. The learned within-video projection matrices can make each video (true-color or grayscale) more compact. The learned dictionary pair and the mapping matrix can work together to bridge the gap between features of true-color and grayscale videos. To date there exists no true-color and grayscale pedestrian video dataset, so we contribute a new one, called true-color and grayscale video person re-identification dataset (CGVID). Our dataset is collected under a real-world scenario and consists of over 50K frames. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the collected CGVID dataset is very challenging and can be used for further research on person re-identification. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the compared methods on the CGVPR task.},

Then, he can locate the monitored targets around the source nodes with a high probability. In this paper, a Source-location privacy Protection scheme based on Anonymity Cloud (SPAC) is proposed. We first design a light-weight (t, n)-threshold message sharing scheme and map the original message to a set of message shares which are shorter in length and can be processed and delivered with minimal energy consumption. Based on the shares, the source node constructs an anonymity cloud with an irregular shape around itself to protect its location privacy. Specifically, an anonymity cloud is a set of active nodes with similar radio actions and they are statistically indistinguishable from each other. The size of the cloud is controlled by the preset number of hops that the shares can walk in the cloud. At the border of the cloud, the fake source nodes independently send the shares to the sink node through proper routing algorithms. At last, the original message can be recovered by the sink node once at least t shares are received. The simulation results demonstrate that the SPAC can strongly protect the source-location privacy in an efficient manner. Moreover, the message sharing mechanism of SPAC increases the confidentiality of network data and it also brings high tolerance for the failures of sensor nodes to the data transmission process.},

  abstract     = {A family of texture-based generative models for fingerprint images is proposed. The generative models are used to estimate upper bounds on the image entropy for systems with small sensor acquisition. The identification capacity of such systems is then estimated using the mutual information between different samples from the same finger. Similar to the generative model for entropy estimation, pixel-level model families are proposed for estimating the similarity between fingerprint images with a given global affine transformation. These models are used for mutual information estimation, and are also adopted to compensate for local deformations between samples. Finally, it is shown that sensor sizes as small as 52 × 52 pixels are potentially sufficient to discriminate populations as large as the entire world population that ever lived, given that the complexity-unconstrained recognition algorithm is available which operates on the lowest possible pixel level.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition is a mainstream biometric authentication method. However, the vulnerability to presentation attacks (a.k.a. spoofing) limits its usability in unsupervised applications. Even though there are many methods available for tackling presentation attacks (PA), most of them fail to detect sophisticated attacks such as silicone masks. As the quality of presentation attack instruments improves over time, achieving reliable PA detection with visual spectra alone remains very challenging. We argue that analysis in multiple channels might help to address this issue. In this context, we propose a multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network-based approach for presentation attack detection (PAD). We also introduce the new Wide Multi-Channel presentation Attack (WMCA) database for face PAD which contains a wide variety of 2D and 3D presentation attacks for both impersonation and obfuscation attacks. Data from different channels such as color, depth, near-infrared, and thermal are available to advance the research in face PAD. The proposed method was compared with feature-based approaches and found to outperform the baselines achieving an ACER of 0.3% on the introduced dataset. The database and the software to reproduce the results are made available publicly.},

However, due to the inherent characteristic of perspective distortions of contactless fingerprints, achieving a highly accurate contactless fingerprint recognition system is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a robust contactless fingerprint recognition method based on global minutia topology and loose genetic algorithm. In order to avoid the inaccurate minutiae alignment problem suffered in conventional transformation-based methods, the minutiae correspondence is established by optimizing an energy function of the similarity matrix. We define an innovative similarity matrix based on both minutiae and minutia-pairs, which takes the global minutia topology into account. By adopting a distortion-free feature of ridge count to define the similarity, the problem of perspective distortions is effectively overcome. To solve the optimization, we propose a new genetic algorithm (GA) named loose GA with new mutation and crossover operators. We also propose a strict minutia-pair expanding algorithm to enhance the reliability of the minutiae correspondence. For recognition, a metric for measuring comparison scores which takes advantage of both the global topological similarity and the number of corresponding minutiae is proposed. We evaluate our method using two contactless fingerprint benchmark databases and achieve competitive performances in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.},

This enables us to trace down the owner of a video sequence, which proves extremely helpful to solve copyright infringement cases as well as to fight distribution of illicit material (e.g., child exploitation clips and terroristic threats). Currently, the most promising methods to tackle this task exploit unique noise traces left by camera sensors on acquired images. However, given the recent advancements in motion stabilization of video content, robustness of sensor pattern noise-based techniques is strongly hindered. Indeed, video stabilization introduces geometric transformations to video frames, thus making camera fingerprint estimation problematic with classical approaches. In this paper, we deal with the challenging problem of attributing stabilized videos to their recording device. Specifically, we propose: 1) a strategy to extract the characteristic fingerprint of a device, starting from either a set of images or stabilized video sequences and 2) a strategy to match a stabilized video sequence with a given fingerprint. The proposed methodology is tested on videos coming from a set of different smartphones, taken from the modern publicly available Vision Dataset. The conducted experiments also provide an interesting insight on the effect of modern smartphones video stabilization algorithms on specific video frames.},

In theory, it could be considered to be a perfect match for constrained devices needing to acquire and protect the data with computationally cheap operations. However, the theoretical results on the secrecy of compressive cryptosystems only hold under the assumption of infinite precision representation. With this work, we aim to close this gap and lay the theoretical foundations to support this practical framework. We provide theoretical upper bounds on the distinguishability of the measurements acquired through finite precision sensing matrices and experimentally validate them. Our main result is that the secrecy of a CS cryptosystem can be exponentially increased with a linear increase in the representation precision. This result confirms that the CS can be an effective secrecy layer and provides tools to use it in practical settings.},

MLaaS applications often rely on centralised collection and aggregation of user data, which could lead to significant privacy concerns when dealing with sensitive personal data. To address this problem, we propose PrivEdge, a technique for privacy-preserving MLaaS that safeguards the privacy of users who provide their data for training, as well as users who use the prediction service. With PrivEdge, each user independently uses their private data to locally train a one-class reconstructive adversarial network that succinctly represents their training data. As sending the model parameters to the service provider in the clear would reveal private information, PrivEdge secret-shares the parameters among two non-colluding MLaaS providers, to then provide cryptographically private prediction services through secure multi-party computation techniques. We quantify the benefits of PrivEdge and compare its performance with state-of-the-art centralised architectures on three privacy-sensitive image-based tasks: individual identification, writer identification, and handwritten letter recognition. Experimental results show that PrivEdge has high precision and recall in preserving privacy, as well as in distinguishing between private and non-private images. Moreover, we show the robustness of PrivEdge to image compression and biased training data. The source code is available at https://github.com/smartcameras/PrivEdge.},

Rule-based firewalls are the most widely deployed among traditional ones. However, as the size of the rule list of a firewall increases, lookup latency increases significantly. One main solution to enhance the performance of a firewall is to reorder rules based on traffic characteristics to obtain the minimum number of packet matches. The optimal firewall rule ordering problem (ORO) is NP-Complete. Therefore, setting up a centralized firewall for a whole network is infeasible. Our proposed solution dynamically scales in and out firewalls across multiple administrative domains for more efficient rules optimization, filtering, and better attack response. The proposed solution, in this paper, outsources the firewall functions into micro firewalls, which are located in different places and have their configurations. Therefore, traffic is treated locally and in a distributed way. The experimental results show that our proposed solution is scalable regarding the organization&#39;s network requirements.

Subject to channel conditions and hardware Trojan design restrictions, this analysis seeks to determine the impact of these malicious circuits on the legitimate communication and to understand the capabilities of the covert channel that they establish in practical wireless networks, by characterizing its error probability. Next, we present the implementation of two hardware Trojan examples on a Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP)-based experimental setup. These examples reside in the analog and the RF circuitry of an 802.11a/g transmitter, respectively, where they manipulate the transmitted signal characteristics to leak their payload bits. Using these examples, we demonstrate (i) attack robustness, i.e., ability of the rogue receiver to successfully retrieve the leaked data, and (ii) attack inconspicuousness, i.e., ability of the hardware Trojan circuits to evade detection by existing defense methods. Lastly, we propose a defense mechanism that is capable of detecting analog/RF hardware Trojans in WiFi transceivers. The proposed defense, termed Adaptive Channel Estimation (ACE), leverages channel estimation capabilities of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems to robustly expose the Trojan activity in the presence of channel fading and device noise. Effectiveness of the ACE defense has been verified through experiments conducted in actual channel conditions, namely over-the-air and in the presence of interference.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL), as a type of distributed machine learning, is capable of significantly preserving clients’ private data from being exposed to adversaries. Nevertheless, private information can still be divulged by analyzing uploaded parameters from clients, e.g., weights trained in deep neural networks. In this paper, to effectively prevent information leakage, we propose a novel framework based on the concept of differential privacy (DP), in which artificial noise is added to parameters at the clients’ side before aggregating, namely, noising before model aggregation FL (NbAFL). First, we prove that the NbAFL can satisfy DP under distinct protection levels by properly adapting different variances of artificial noise. Then we develop a theoretical convergence bound on the loss function of the trained FL model in the NbAFL. Specifically, the theoretical bound reveals the following three key properties: 1) there is a tradeoff between convergence performance and privacy protection levels, i.e., better convergence performance leads to a lower protection level; 2) given a fixed privacy protection level, increasing the number $N$ of overall clients participating in FL can improve the convergence performance; and 3) there is an optimal number aggregation times (communication rounds) in terms of convergence performance for a given protection level. Furthermore, we propose a $K$ -client random scheduling strategy, where $K$ ( $1\leq K&amp;lt; N$ ) clients are randomly selected from the $N$ overall clients to participate in each aggregation. We also develop a corresponding convergence bound for the loss function in this case and the $K$ -client random scheduling strategy also retains the above three properties. Moreover, we find that there is an optimal $K$ that achieves the best convergence performance at a fixed privacy level. Evaluations demonstrate that our theoretical results are consistent with simulations, thereby facilitating the design of various privacy-preserving FL algorithms with different tradeoff requirements on convergence performance and privacy levels.},

  abstract     = {Gait recognition has received increasing attention for security and authentication since it can be done unintrusively from afar and without a subject&#39;s awareness. In this work, we propose a new model-based gait recognition technique called JRC-CNN gait recognition. We introduce three new concepts. (1) We create a new way to preprocess skeleton data by rotating skeleton data using two virtual axes. This process reduces the fluctuation in movements and resolves the multi-viewpoint issue. All postures in a walk are observed from the same angle. (2) We introduce new Joint Replacement Coordinates (JRCs), which represent the movements of the left and right joints in a group of three connected joints. These JRC gait features are designed to put more emphasis on local movements than the movements of non-connected joints. (3) We construct a new Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for the classification process, which consists of a convolutional layer on each JRC and two fully-connected layers. A convolutional layer is designed to discover relations within a group of three connected joints. Fully-connected layers also find the relations of all groups of three connected joints throughout an entire body (in a posture). Our JRC-CNN technique achieves above 98.4% accuracy and significantly outperforms other existing techniques for all free-direction walk datasets. It also performs well under the gallery-size test and the CMC curve test. This means that our proposed JRC-CNN gait recognition technique can be used in a real-world situation. Experimental results also suggest that a person can be identified by a unique posture (an entire body is observed as a whole) with the focus on the movements of connected joints.},

  abstract     = {Multi-user interference (MUI) is usually considered to be a harmful component in wireless communications. However, recently emerged symbol-level precoding techniques can constructively exploit the MUI by transforming it into useful signal at the receiver and contribute to symbol detection. This paper adopts this concept and aims to investigate the exploitation of the MUI to enhance both physical layer security against eavesdropping and the quality of legitimate transmissions. Particularly, we consider the problem of secure symbol-level precoding in multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) wiretap systems. Our goal is to design the symbol-level precoder to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of all legitimate transmissions as well as ensure security against eavesdropping. The symbol-level precoder algorithms for physical layer security are developed under different assumptions about the availability of channel state information (CSI) of the legitimate and eavesdropping channels. Extensive simulation results validate the exploitation of MUI for security and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed secure symbol-level precoding algorithms.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detecting face presentation attacks based on intrinsic properties of the scene such as albedo, depth, and reflectance properties of the facial surfaces, which were recovered through a shape-from-shading (SfS) algorithm. To extract meaningful patterns from the different maps obtained with the SfS algorithm, we designed a novel shallow CNN architecture for learning features useful to the presentation attack detection (PAD). We performed several experiments considering the intra- and inter-dataset evaluation protocols. The obtained results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method considering several types of photo- and video-based presentation attacks, and in the cross-sensor scenario, besides achieving competitive results for the inter-dataset evaluation protocol.},

A novel signal processing scheme with two stages is proposed for the identification of specific radar emitters. In the first stage, the received radar pulses are accurately time aligned and coherently integrated in order to increase the Signal-to-Noise (SNR) ratio. Using this technique, measurements with SNR improvements of more than 25 dB are obtained, enabling detection of subtle differences between different emitters. In the second step, Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is used to decompose both the envelope and the instantaneous frequency of the received signal into a set of modes. Then, these mode signals are characterized by using a group of features for identification. We demonstrate highly successful identification performance with the proposed method on real radar datasets.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a buffer-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) network consisting of one multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple single-antenna users, in which the AP is provisioned with data buffers for temporarily storing the data for each user either from the upper layer applications or the message by the AP. The data for one specific user must be kept confidential from all other unintended users. For such a system, we aim at maximizing the long-term average achievable secrecy rate region by carefully designing the flow control, the information signal and artificial noise beamforming, as well as the user selection. To address this issue, we first transform the time average optimization problem into a real-time one by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. Then it is proposed to decompose the optimization problem into several sub-problems by using the optimization decomposition technique. Although the information signal and artificial noise beamforming sub-problem is non-convex, we show that it can be decomposed into a two-stage optimization problem to effectively solve it by using the exact line search and DC (difference of two convex functions) algorithms. Moreover, we extend the average secrecy rate region maximization problem to the worst-case scenario, in which all unintended users are colluding in eavesdropping. Our analysis discloses that, there exists an inherent tradeoff between the average achievable secrecy rate region and the average queueing length. It is shown that a better average secrecy rate region can be realized by fully taking advantage of the buffer-aided transmission potentials in the MISO network, if a certain queueing delay is tolerable.},

However, how to verify its authenticity becomes a challenge when this big data stream in an untrusted environment such as cloud platform, for it faces the problems just like delay-sensitive, unpredictable data size and privacy leaks caused by third-party audits. To solve these problems, we propose a new authenticate data structure named privacy-preserving adaptive trapdoor hash authentication tree (P-ATHAT) by introducing trapdoor hash and BLS signature to the Merkle hash tree. The P-ATHAT scheme realizes real-time verification of data stream and can dynamically expand its structure as the data stream arrives. These characteristics not only shorten the authentication path but also solve the single point failure problem of the conventional authentication trees and enhance the robustness of the scheme. Moreover, we construct a homomorphic verification scheme above tree structure to solve the privacy leakage problem in third-party audit. Finally, security analysis and detailed experimental evaluation are performed on the proposed scheme, both results demonstrate that it is desirable for big data stream authentication and privacy-preserving in practical application.},

The discrimination of channel estimation performance provides secrecy against the passive eavesdropper while delivering information to the legitimate receiver. We provide the mean square error (MSE) to indicate the performance achieved by linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimators. We have also provided bit error rate (BER), and secrecy capacity analysis to indicate the performance of secure communication achieved by securing the channel estimates from the eavesdropper. The BER analysis shows that for proposed DCE, BER at the eavesdropper is close to 0.1 while the legitimate node is able to robustly decode the information.

To apply this method, images or videos need to be obtained from a camera to create a “camera fingerprint” which then can be compared against the PRNU of the query media whose origin is under question. The fingerprint extraction process can be time consuming when a large number of video frames or images have to be denoised. This may need to be done when the individual images have been subjected to high compression or other geometric processing such as video stabilization. This paper investigates a simple, yet effective and efficient technique to create a camera fingerprint when so many still images need to be denoised. The technique utilizes Spatial Domain Averaged (SDA) frames. An SDA-frame is the arithmetic mean of multiple still images. When it is used for fingerprint extraction, the number of denoising operations can be significantly decreased with little or no performance loss. Experimental results show that the proposed method can work more than 50 times faster than conventional methods while providing similar matching results.},

The aim of this paper is to study the effects of pilot spoofing attacks on uplink channel estimation, by assuming that the BS knows the angle of arrivals (AoAs) of the legitimate channels. Specifically, after assessing the performance of the simple least squares estimator (LSE), we consider more sophisticated estimators, such as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and different versions of the minimum mean square error estimator (MMSEE), involving different degrees of a priori information about the pilot spoofing attacks. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are used to compare the performance of such estimators. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that the spoofing effects in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime can be completely suppressed, under certain conditions involving the AoAs of the legitimate and spoofing channels. Moreover, we show that even an imperfect knowledge of the AoAs and of the average transmission power of the spoofing signals allows the MLE and MMSEE to achieve significant performance gains over the LSE.},

However, there exists a conflicting requirement between publishing an attributed social graph and protecting the privacy of sensitive information contained in each user&#39;s local data. In this paper, we aim to collect and generate attributed social graphs in a decentralized manner while providing local differential privacy (LDP) for the collected data. Existing LDP-based synthetic graph generation methods either fail to preserve important graph properties (such as modularity and clustering coefficient) due to excessive noise injection or are unable to process attribute data, thus limiting their adoption and applicability. To overcome these weaknesses, we propose AsgLDP, a novel technique to generate privacy-preserving attributed graph data while satisfying LDP. AsgLDP preserves various graph properties through carefully designing the injected noise and estimating the joint distribution of attribute data. There are two key steps in AsgLDP: 1) collecting and generating graph data while satisfying LDP, and 2) optimizing the privacy-utility tradeoff of the generated data while preserving general graph properties such as the degree distribution, community structure and attribute distribution. Through theoretical analysis as well as experiments over 6 real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AsgLDP in preserving general graph properties such as degree distribution, community structure and attributed community search, while rigorously satisfying LDP. We also show that AsgLDP achieves a superior balance between utility and privacy as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, are often used to capture gait dynamics. These inertial sensors are commonly integrated into smartphones and are widely used by the average person, which makes gait data convenient and inexpensive to collect. In this paper, we study gait recognition using smartphones in the wild. In contrast to traditional methods, which often require a person to walk along a specified road and/or at a normal walking speed, the proposed method collects inertial gait data under unconstrained conditions without knowing when, where, and how the user walks. To obtain good person identification and authentication performance, deep-learning techniques are presented to learn and model the gait biometrics based on walking data. Specifically, a hybrid deep neural network is proposed for robust gait feature representation, where features in the space and time domains are successively abstracted by a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network. In the experiments, two datasets collected by smartphones for a total of 118 subjects are used for evaluations. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves higher than 93.5% and 93.7% accuracies in person identification and authentication, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Face verification systems are prone to spoofing attacks on photos, videos, and 3D masks. Face spoofing detection, i.e., face anti-spoofing, face liveness detection, or face presentation attack detection, is an important task for securing face verification systems in practice and presents many challenges. In this paper, a state-of-the-art face spoofing detection method based on a depth-based Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is revisited. Different supervision schemes, including global and local label supervisions, are comprehensively investigated. A generic theoretical analysis and associated simulation are provided to demonstrate that local label supervision is more suitable than global label supervision for local tasks with insufficient training samples, such as the face spoofing detection task. Based on the analysis, the Spatial Aggregation of Pixel-level Local Classifiers (SAPLC), which is composed of an FCN part and an aggregation part, is proposed. The FCN part predicts the pixel-level ternary labels, which include the genuine foreground, the spoofed foreground, and the undetermined background. Then, these labels are aggregated together to yield an accurate image-level decision. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate the proposed SAPLC, experiments are carried out on the CASIA-FASD, Replay-Attack, OULU-NPU, and SiW datasets. The experiments show that the proposed SAPLC outperforms the representative deep networks, including two globally supervised CNNs, one depth-based FCN, two FCNs with binary labels, and two FCNs with ternary labels, and achieves competitive performances close to some state-of-the-art method performances under various common protocols. Overall, the results empirically verify the advantage of the proposed pixel-level local label supervision scheme.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, an increasing number of individuals and organizations are sharing data in the public cloud. To protect the privacy of data stored in the cloud, a data owner usually encrypts his data in such a way that certain designated data users can decrypt the data. This raises a serious problem when the encrypted data needs to be shared to more people beyond those initially designated by the data owner. To address this problem, we introduce and formalize an identity-based encryption transformation (IBET) model by seamlessly integrating two well-established encryption mechanisms, namely identity-based encryption (IBE) and identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE). In IBET, data users are identified and authorized for data access based on their recognizable identities, which avoids complicated certificate management in usual secure distributed systems. More importantly, IBET provides a transformation mechanism that converts an IBE ciphertext into an IBBE ciphertext so that a new group of users not specified during the IBE encryption can access the underlying data. We design a concrete IBET scheme based on bilinear groups and prove its security against powerful attacks. Thorough theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the high efficiency and practicability of the proposed scheme.},

This is the case, for example, of encrypted databases stored in a public cloud. We also evaluate the performance of our proposals in comparison with two alternatives displaying additive homomorphism: the traditional Paillier asymmetric cryptosystem, which is not quantum-resistant; and the XPIR algorithm, which is both quantum-resistant and symmetric. Our experimental results show that both solutions provide considerable speed-ups when compared to Paillier. Namely, encryption and decryption with FAHE1 are, respectively, 120 and 25 times faster than Paillier&#39;s, while for FAHE2 both operations run more than 1000 times faster. In addition, when compared with a highly optimized XPIR code, our reference implementation remains quite competitive while producing smaller ciphertexts.},

We devise a grid-based location protection method, which can protect the locations of workers and tasks while keeping the distance-aware information on the protected locations such that we can quantify the distance between tasks and workers. We propose an efficient task assignment algorithm, which can instantly assign tasks to nearby workers on encrypted data. To protect the task content, we leverage both attribute-based encryption and symmetric-key encryption to establish secure channels through servers, which ensures that the task is delivered securely and accurately by any untrusted server.

  abstract     = {A downlink single-input single-output non-orthogonal multiple access setting is considered, in which a base station (BS) is communicating with two legitimate users in two possible scenarios of unsecure environments: existence of an external eavesdropper and communicating through an untrusted relay. For the first scenario, a number of trusted cooperative half-duplex relays is employed to assist with the BS&#39;s transmission and secure its signals from the external eavesdropper. Various relaying schemes are proposed and analyzed for that matter: cooperative jamming, decode-and-forward, and amplify-and-forward. For each scheme, secure beamforming signals are devised at the relays to maximize the achievable secrecy rate regions. For the second scenario, with the untrusted relay, achievable secrecy rate regions are derived for two different relaying schemes, compress-and-forward and amplify-and-forward, under two different modes of operation. In the first mode, coined passive user mode, the users receive signals from both the BS and the untrusted relay and combine them to decode their messages. In the second mode, termed the active user mode, the users transmit a cooperative jamming signal simultaneously with the BS&#39;s transmission to further confuse the relay. Focusing on half-duplex nodes, the users cannot receive the BS&#39;s signal while jamming the relay, i.e., while being active, and rely only on the signals forwarded to them by the relay. It is shown that the best relaying scheme highly depends on the system parameters, in particular the distances between the nodes, and also on the part of the secrecy rate region at which the system is to operate.},

This smart attacker does not make the channel busy all the time, instead it senses spectrum and when a primary user leaves, it occupies the spectrum by mimicking the signal characteristics of the primary users. To model such a smart attacker, we use a dependent Markov chain to model the primary user and primary user emulation attacker activities, simultaneously. We derive the transition probabilities for the assumed dependent Markov model. Then, the effect of the primary user and attacker traffic on a secondary user&#39;s throughput under Rayleigh flat fading channel is investigated and closed form expressions are derived for the average probability of detection and false alarm. Furthermore, the impact of this attacker on the performance of a CRN and the throughput of the secondary user network is studied analytically. We also derive a test rule based on the generalized likelihood ratio test, to detect the legitimate user from smart illegitimate user. In addition, launching primary user emulation attacker in the conventional and proposed smart attacking procedures are compared, where the results demonstrate that by using smart attacking, the deterioration in throughput of the secondary user&#39;s network is considerable. In fact, it is shown that under proper selection of the traffic parameters, the secondary user&#39;s network throughput may tend toward zero.

  abstract     = {Edge caching has become one of promising technologies in mobile social networks (MSNs) to proximally provide popular contents for mobile users. However, since caching contents inevitably consume resources (e.g., power, bandwidth, storage, etc.), edge caching devices maybe selfish to cheat the content provider for earning service fees. In addition, due to the open access of edge caching devices, the edge caching service is vulnerable to various attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attack and content tamper attack, etc., resulting in the degradation of content delivery performance. To efficiently tackle the above problems, in this paper, we propose a secure edge caching scheme for the content provider and mobile users in MSNs. Specifically, we first develop a secure edge caching framework consisting of the content provider, multiple edge caching devices, and some mobile users. To motivate the participation of edge caching devices, Stackelberg game is exploited to model the interactions between the content provider and edge caching devices. The content provider serves as the game-leader to determine the payment strategy of secure caching service and each edge caching device is the game-follower to make the strategy on the quality of secure caching service. Especially, the zero payment mechanism is adopted to suppress the selfish behaviors of edge caching devices. Apart from this, for lack of the knowledge on interactions between the content provider and edge caching devices in dynamic network scenarios, we also employ the Q-leaning to derive the optimal payment strategy of the content provider and the security strategy of edge caching device. Extensive simulations are conducted, and results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can efficiently motivate edge caching devices to provide the content provider and mobile users with high-quality secure caching services.},

  abstract     = {User privacy is an extremely important concern for mobile applications. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has penalized multiple mobile application developers, such as TikTok and BabyBus for violating privacy regulations. Privacy concerns are more critical for children, who do not comprehend the risks associated with transmitting private information like geospatial location. The Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is an online privacy regulation platform to monitor data usage by mobile applications designed for children. Existing research on detecting whether an application complies with certain privacy regulations is performed either by analyzing the application binary or by dynamic monitoring of network at runtime. However, as explained in related work, both methods have their respective demerits. We propose COPPTCHA, a Hardware performance counter (HPC)-based technique to detect whether a children&#39;s app abides by the COPPA regulations. HPCs are special purpose registers found in all processors that measure system level events. Since the proposed method is hardware-based, it is difficult to undermine it compared to software-based COPPA compliance detection. COPPTCHA has no hardware overhead, since HPC data collection is integral to all industry standard processors. The HPC readings of applications running on a smartphone are classified using machine learning based classifiers to detect COPPA compliance. Our experiments employing a Moto-G4 smartphone shows that COPPTCHA can detect COPPA-violating apps with ≥ 99% accuracy.},

Further, the biometric data, once leaked or stolen, remains compromised forever. Hence biometric security is of utmost importance. Existing biometric template protection schemes either degrade the recognition performance or they have issues with security and speed. We propose a cancelable multi-biometric authentication approach where a novel bit-wise encryption scheme transforms a biometric template to a protected template using a secret key generated from another biometric template. It fully preserves the number of bit-errors in the original and the protected template to ensure recognition performance equivalent to the performance of the unprotected systems. We introduce Algorithm I and Algorithm II for bit-wise encryption; both are defined over cryptographic-primitives- block cipher based encryption and keyed-hash function. We profile these algorithms on various hardware architectures to calculate the efficiency in terms of the time taken during enrolment and authentication phase. For Algorithm II, we observe that a 3.3 GHz desktop architecture takes about 18 milliseconds on an average of over 200 runs to authenticate a user. Additionally, we provide mathematical proof to show that the proposed scheme guarantees secrecy and irreversibility. The results of comparisons with the existing biometric template protection schemes on the various face and iris databases show that the proposed work provides significantly good recognition performance and efficiency, while it achieves high security. Finally, the bit-wise encryption scheme can be built over the commercial-off-the-shelf systems to achieve security with equivalent high performance.},

  abstract     = {Remote attestation has emerged as a valuable security mechanism which aims to verify remotely whether or not a potentially untrusted device has been compromised. The protocols of Remote attestation are particularly important for securing Internet of Things (IoT) systems which, due to the large number of interconnected devices and limited security protections, are susceptible to a wide variety of cyber attacks. To guarantee the integrity of a software running on a single device, remote attestation is usually executed as an uninterrupted procedure: at the attestation time, a device stops the normal operation and executes the attestation of the entire device without interruption. The remote attestation protocols that aim to attest a large number of devices also follow the assumption on uninterrupted execution: when a device attests its network neighbours, each device verified in the neighborhood suspends its normal operation until the attestation protocol is completed. To avoid unnecessary suspension of the normal operation of the devices, this paper proposes a novel Secure Asynchronous Remote Attestation (SARA) protocol that releases the constraint of synchronous interaction among devices. In particular, SARA is an attestation protocol that exploits asynchronous communication capabilities among IoT devices in order to attest a distributed IoT service executed by them. SARA verifies both that each IoT device is not compromised (device trustworthiness), and that the exchanged communication data have not maliciously influence the communicating devices (legitimate operations). By tracing the execution order of each service invocation of an asynchronous distributed service, SARA allows each service to collect accurately historical data of its interactions, and transmits asynchronously such historical data to other interacting services. We have implemented and validated SARA through a realistic simulation on the Contiki emulator that demonstrates the functionality and efficiency of our protocol. The results confirm the suitability of SARA for low-end devices.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, it usually requires a massive amount of labeled data to train a deep neural network. When no labeled data is available in some application scenarios, domain adaption can be employed to transfer a learner from one or more source domains with labeled data to a target domain with unlabeled data. However, due to the exposure of the trained model to the target domain, the user privacy may potentially be compromised. Nevertheless, the private information may be encoded into the representations in different stages of the deep neural networks, i.e., hierarchical convolutional feature maps, which poses a great challenge for a full-fledged privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private domain adaptation framework called DPDA to achieve domain adaptation with privacy assurance. Specifically, we perform domain adaptation in an adversarial-learning manner and embed the differentially private design into specific layers and learning processes. Although applying differential privacy techniques directly will undermine the performance of deep neural networks, DPDA can increase the classification accuracy for the unlabeled target data compared to the prior arts. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, and the results show that our proposed DPDA can indeed achieve high accuracy in many domain adaptation tasks with only a modest privacy loss.},

  abstract     = {We present the physical-layer maximum a posteriori (MAP) test for detecting false data in multiple-source wireless relay networks. The MAP test, which minimizes the average probability of detection error, exploits the noisy (erroneous) information about the true packet that the destination receives (overhears) directly from the source nodes as a reference. We show that the average probability of detection error decreases exponentially as the number of source nodes increases, regardless of the reliability of the reference information. This indicates that the multiplicity of source nodes can be leveraged to construct a powerful integrity check mechanism for detecting false data at the destination. We also present a parallel MAP test that improves the detection accuracy when the number of source nodes is limited and overhearing channel disparities are high. Then, we present a packet recovery mechanism to recover false alarmed packets, i.e. unmodified packets that are mistakenly declared as modified, by the MAP test and thereby to improve the throughput.},

  abstract     = {Binary authorship characterization refers to the process of identifying stylistic characteristics that are related to the author of an anonymous binary code. The aim is to automate the laborious and error-prone reverse engineering task of discovering information related to the author(s) of binary code. This paper presents CPA, a novel approach for characterizing the authors of program binaries. Instead of using generic features such as n-grams, CPA proposes a set of new features based on collections of various aspects of author style, including author code traits, code structure characteristics, and author expertise in solving coding tasks. It employs the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to generate author style signatures to help identify similar author style characteristics in other binaries. We evaluated CPA on large datasets extracted from selected opensource C/C++ projects in GitHub and Google Code Jam events, and it successfully attributed a large number of authors with a significantly higher F 1 score: around 91% when the number of authors was 1,500. In addition, the false positive rate was low, around 1.5%. When the code was subjected to refactoring techniques or code transformation or was processed using different compilers/compilation settings, there was no significant drop in accuracy, demonstrating the robustness of our tool. Finally, in the case of code written by multiple authors, CPA was able to identify the authors with a high F 1 score, around 89%.},

  abstract     = {Data sharing has become of primary importance in many domains such as big-data analytics, economics and medical research, but remains difficult to achieve when the data are sensitive. In fact, sharing personal information requires individuals’ unconditional consent or is often simply forbidden for privacy and security reasons. In this paper, we propose Drynx, a decentralized system for privacy-conscious statistical analysis on distributed datasets. Drynx relies on a set of computing nodes to enable the computation of statistics such as standard deviation or extrema, and the training and evaluation of machine-learning models on sensitive and distributed data. To ensure data confidentiality and the privacy of the data providers, Drynx combines interactive protocols, homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs of correctness, and differential privacy. It enables an efficient and decentralized verification of the input data and of all the system’s computations thus provides auditability in a strong adversarial model in which no entity has to be individually trusted. Drynx is highly modular, dynamic and parallelizable. Our evaluation shows that it enables the training of a logistic regression model on a dataset (12 features and 600,000 records) distributed among 12 data providers in less than 2 seconds. The computations are distributed among 6 computing nodes, and Drynx enables the verification of the query execution’s correctness in less than 22 seconds.},

The existing matching techniques, however, are limited to relatively simple types such as string, categorical and signal numerical values. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that significantly extends the class of matching primitives that are based on privacy-preserving Bloom filter mechanism. These primitives include sequence data matching and popular distance-based machine learning algorithms such as KNN and SVM. Our scheme hash-maps a sequence data vector into the Bloom filter space while checking the similarity of the data points efficiently with negligible utility loss by adding a timestamp (bit) for each element in the data represented with its neighboring values. Furthermore, it includes a Laplace-like perturbation method on the constructed Bloom filters to address the weakness of deterministic probability led by encoding techniques. As a result, the proposed work guarantee the private data records are difficult to be discriminated due to collisions and differential privacy. The experimental results on three real-scenario based datasets illustrate that our method can achieve a significantly better trade-off between utility and privacy than the state-of-the-art differential privacy-based method by adding Laplace noise to the data directly.},

  abstract     = {Facial image synthesis has been extensively studied, for a long time, in both computer graphics and computer vision. Particularly, the synthesis of face images with varying ages, expressions and poses has received an increasing attention owing to several real-world applications. In this paper, facial age and expression synthesis are addressed. While previous and current research papers on facial age synthesis mostly adopt an age span of 10 years, this paper investigates face aging with a shorter time span. For expression synthesis, given a neutral face, we work on synthesizing faces with varying expression intensities (e.g., from zero to high). Note that both human ages and expression intensities are inherently ordinal. To fully exploit this ordinal nature, we devise ordinal ranking generative adversarial networks (ranking GAN). For each face, a one-hot label is assigned to define its age range/expression intensity. By exploiting the relative order information among age ranges/expression intensities, a binary ranking vector is further computed for each face. In ranking GAN, one-hot labels are used as the condition of the generator for synthesizing faces with target age groups/expression intensities. Moreover, we add a sequence of cost-sensitive ordinal rankers on top of several multi-scale discriminators, with the aim of minimizing age/intensity rank estimation loss when optimizing both the generator and discriminators. In order to evaluate the proposed ranking GAN, extensive experiments are carried out on several public face databases. As demonstrated by the experimental testing, this ranking scheme performs well even when the amount of available labeled training data is limited. The reported experimental results well demonstrate the effectiveness of ranking GAN on synthesizing face aging sequences and faces with varying expression intensities.},

To address this problem, this paper proposes a high-efficiency deep learning based iris segmentation approach, named IrisParseNet. Different from many previous CNN-based iris segmentation methods, which only focus on predicting accurate iris masks by following popular semantic segmentation frameworks, the proposed approach is a complete iris segmentation solution, i.e., iris mask and parameterized inner and outer iris boundaries are jointly achieved by actively modeling them into a unified multi-task network. Moreover, an elaborately designed attention module is incorporated into it to improve the segmentation performance. To train and evaluate the proposed approach, we manually label three representative and challenging iris databases, i.e., CASIA.v4-distance, UBIRIS.v2, and MICHE-I, which involve multiple illumination (NIR, VIS) and imaging sensors (long-range and mobile iris cameras), along with various types of noises. Additionally, several unified evaluation protocols are built for fair comparisons. Extensive experiments are conducted on these newly annotated databases, and results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. Further, as a general drop-in replacement, the proposed iris segmentation method can be used for any iris recognition methodology, and would significantly improve the performance of non-cooperative iris recognition.},

To mitigate the flaw, in this paper, we investigate the reliable and secure transmission of NOMA systems with untrusted near users, and propose joint beamforming and power allocation (JBP) scheme for the scenario. Meanwhile, from security point of view, we extend to a worse-case scenario where both untrusted near users and external eavesdroppers exist, and propose joint artificial noise aided beamforming and power allocation (JANBP) scheme to achieve a reliable and secure transmission for the scenario. The exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) for the two scenarios are derived to evaluate the secrecy performance achieved by the proposed schemes, respectively. The analysis and simulation results show the superiority of the proposed JBP and JANBP schemes in terms of combating internal and external eavesdropping, and also indicate the two schemes can achieve the same SOP at high SNR.},

However, the issue of data privacy is far from being well solved and thus has been a general concern in the cloud-aided machine learning. In this work, we investigate the study of how to efficiently do decision tree training and evaluation in the cloud and meanwhile achieve privacy preservation. Unlike existing cloud server-assisted model training approaches, in our proposed solution, the whole training process is mostly done by the cloud service provider who owns the machine learning model. Since the cloud cannot directly divide the encrypted dataset according to the best attributes selected, we propose a new method for decision tree training without dataset splitting. Precisely, we design three methods for decision tree training with the different tradeoff between privacy and efficiency. In all of these methods, the outsourced data are not revealed to the cloud service provider. We also propose a privacy-preserving decision tree evaluation scheme where the cloud service provider learns nothing about the user&#39;s input and the classification result while the trained model is kept secret to the user who could only learn the classification result. Compared with previous decision tree evaluation work, our scheme achieves desirable privacy preservation against both the user and the cloud service provider, and also minimizes the user&#39;s computation and communication costs. Moreover, besides protecting the data confidentiality, our proposed scheme also supports off-line users and thus has good scalability. The real-world dataset-based experimental results demonstrate that our system is of desirable utility and efficiency.},

However, in most non-cooperative SEI scenarios, supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches are often incompatible due to the lack of labeled datasets. To solve this challenge, an unsupervised SEI framework is proposed based on information maximized generative adversarial networks (InfoGANs) and radio frequency fingerprint embedding (RFFE). To enhance individual discriminability, a gray histogram is first constructed according to the bispectrum extracted from the received signal before being embedded into the proposed framework. In addition to the latent class input and the RFFE, the proposed InfoGAN incorporates a priori statistical characteristics of the wireless propagation channels in the form of a structured multimodal latent vector to further improve the GAN quality. The probabilistic distribution of the bispectrum is derived in closed-form and the convergence of the InfoGAN is analyzed to demonstrate the influence of the RFFE. Numerical results indicate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for unsupervised SEI applications, both in terms of evaluation score and classification accuracy.},

First, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the worst jamming distribution. Second, by analyzing the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for the worst jamming, we prove that the worst jamming distribution is discrete in amplitude with a finite number of mass points, either with or without peak power constraints. Numerical results are provided on the worst jamming distribution and the minimum channel capacity under disguised jamming. It is shown that the minimum channel capacity of SP-OFDM is guaranteed to be positive under the worst disguised jamming, while the minimum capacity of the traditional OFDM under disguised jamming is zero. Both our theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the robustness of SP-OFDM and also reveal its performance lower bound under disguised jamming.},

  abstract     = {Cancelable biometric schemes generate secure biometric templates by combining user specific tokens and biometric data. The main objective is to create irreversible, unlinkable, and revocable templates, with high accuracy of comparison. In this paper, we cryptanalyze two recent cancelable biometric schemes based on a particular locality sensitive hashing function, index-of-max (IoM): Gaussian Random Projection-IoM (GRP-IoM) and Uniformly Random Permutation-IoM (URP-IoM). As originally proposed, these schemes were claimed to be resistant against reversibility, authentication, and linkability attacks under the stolen token scenario. We propose several attacks against GRP-IoM and URP-IoM, and argue that both schemes are severely vulnerable against authentication and linkability attacks. We also propose better, but not yet practical, reversibility attacks against GRP-IoM. The correctness and practical impact of our attacks are verified over the same dataset provided by the authors of these two schemes.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative relaying can be introduced as a promising approach for data communication in the Internet of Things (IoT), where the source and the destination may be placed far away. In this paper, by taking a variety of realistic hardware imperfections (HWIs) and channels estimation errors (CEEs) into account, the secrecy performance of a three-hop cooperative network with a source, a destination and two consecutive amplify-and-forward (AF) relays is investigated. The relays are considered to be untrusted, i.e., while they are mandatory helpers for data transmission, they may overhear the received signals. We adopt the artificial noise injection scheme, to keep the source message secret from being captured by the untrusted relays. Given this system model, a novel closed-form expression is obtained in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime for the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) performance over Nakagami-m fading. Our simulation results highlight that the secrecy performance of the system is improved when the tolerable HWIs are distributed beneficially across the transmission and reception radio-frequency (RF) front-ends of each node. Our work reveals that unlike the ideal case, the realistic scenario of non-ideal hardware with CEEs faces with the secrecy rate ceiling. Finally, under a constraint on the total energy consumption which is applicable for battery-limited IoT equipment, we maximize the achievable secrecy rate. Our results highlight the importance of the destination&#39;s jamming cooperation and the first relay&#39;s role on the secrecy performance.},

In order to safeguard the content delivery, we consider that the BSs transmits the artificial noise together with the useful signals. By using tools from stochastic geometry, we first analyze the average reliable transmission probability (RTP) and the average confidential transmission probability (CTP), which take both the impact of the eavesdroppers and the impact of the jammers into consideration. We further provide tight upper and lower bounds on the average RTP. These analytical results enable us to obtain rich insights into the behaviors of the average RTP and the average CTP with respect to key system parameters. Moreover, we optimize the caching distribution of the files to maximize the average RTP of the system, while satisfying the constraints on the caching size and the average CTP. Through numerical results, we show that our proposed secure random caching scheme can effectively boost the secrecy performance of the system compared to the existing solutions.},

  abstract     = {As surveillance footage plays an increasingly significant role in law enforcement, it is imperative to ensure the integrity of recorded video data and the authenticity of its originator, and instill situation awareness into these monitoring systems with a fidelity record of the incidents. Unfortunately, existing frame-based networked surveillance systems could only partially fulfill these requirements. The emerging Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) sheds new light on solving this problem with its completely different sensor design, i.e., DVS responds only to temporal intensity change and records only sparse asynchronous address-events with precise timing information. Motivated by the reduced data size of activities and the prevention of privacy intrusion of subjects under surveillance as well as other appealing attributes, this work introduces the first event-driven physical unclonable function (Ed-PUF) system to fill the forensic gap of simultaneously authenticating the event data integrity and source camera identity for reactive monitoring by DVS camera. New DVS sensor architecture is proposed with negligible modifications made to the original DVS pixel. The Ed-PUF response bit can only be triggered by and uniquely dependent on the asynchronous addressed event without being interfered by the simultaneous firing of other address events. Address event streams are securely transmitted with an event package tag created by a keyed hash-based message authentication code with the key being the Ed-PUF response. A secure protocol to authenticate the identity of DVS camera and the integrity of address events transmitted through cellular network is also proposed. A camera lock is embedded to protect against severing and splicing the inter-chip connectivity within the camera for raw PUF responses. The proposed system is evaluated using raw PUF data obtained by post-layout Monte Carlo simulation in UMC 180nm technology and real event stream captured by a DVS camera. The proposed Ed-PUF has been demonstrated to have excellent uniqueness, randomness and reliability. Collision test is also conducted to show that the quality of DVS imaging is not compromised. Besides keeping the hardware/power/timing overheads low, the proposed scheme is also analyzed to be resilient against multiple attack scenarios.},

An important class of SoC security attack involves a rogue IP tampering with the inter-IP communication. These attacks include message snoop, message mutation, message misdirection, IP masquerade, and message flooding. Static IP-level trust verification cannot protect against these SoC-level attacks. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerabilities of system level communication among IPs and develop a novel SoC security architecture that provides system resilience against exploitation by untrusted 3PIPs integrated over an NoC fabric. We show how to address the problem through a collection of fine-grained SoC security policies that enable on-the-fly monitoring and control of appropriate security-relevant events. Our approach, for the first time to our knowledge, provides an architecture-level solution for trusted SoC communication through run-time resilience in the presence of untrusted IPs. We demonstrate viability of our approach on a realistic SoC design through a series of attack models and show that our architecture incurs minimal to modest overhead in area, power, and system latency.},

  abstract     = {In physically unclonable functions (PUFs), generating random cryptographs is required to secure private information. Various memory-based PUFs (MemPUFs), where cryptographs are generated independently from each PUF cell to increase the unpredictability of the cryptographs, have been proposed. Among them, the spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory MemPUF generates constant responses under temperature and voltage variations by exploiting a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) as the variation source. However, its response stability is diminished by the different characteristics of the two access transistors used in a PUF cell. To solve this problem, a novel PUF array that employs a diode-connected transistor and a shared access transistor, is proposed. In addition, a two-step postprocessing is adopted: 1) a write-back technique that amplifies the initial mismatch of MTJ resistances, and 2) a cell-classification technique that detects unstable PUF cells and discards their responses. The Monte Carlo HSPICE simulation results using industry-compatible 65-nm technology show that the proposed PUF system achieves the highest independence (autocorrelation factor of 0.0306) and the lowest maximum bit error rate (BER) under temperature and supply-voltage variations (&lt;; 0.01% and 0.04% in the ranges of -25 to 75 °C and 0.8-1.2 V, respectively) compared with conventional PUF systems that exploit independent variation sources.},

  abstract     = {The pervasiveness of personalized collaborative recommender systems has shown the powerful capability in a wide range of E-commerce services such as Amazon, TripAdvisor, Yelp, etc. However, fundamental vulnerabilities of collaborative recommender systems leave space for malicious users to affect the recommendation results as the attackers desire. A vast majority of existing detection methods assume certain properties of malicious attacks are given in advance. In reality, improving the detection performance is usually constrained due to the challenging issues: (a) various types of malicious attacks coexist, (b) limited representations of malicious attack behaviors, and (c) practical evidences for exploring and spotting anomalies on real-world data are scarce. In this paper, we investigate a unified detection framework in an eye for an eye manner without being bothered by the details of the attacks. Firstly, co-visitation and co-rating graphs are constructed using association rules. Then, attribute representations of nodes are empirically developed from the perspectives of linkage pattern, structure-based property and inherent association of nodes. Finally, both attribute information and connective coherence of graph are combined in order to infer suspicious nodes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detection approach compared with competing benchmarks. Additionally, abnormality forensics metrics including distribution of rating intention, time aggregation of suspicious ratings, degree distributions before as well as after removing suspicious nodes and time series analysis of historical ratings, are provided so as to discover interesting findings such as suspicious nodes (items or ratings) on real-world data.},

  abstract     = {Infection is a fault attack countermeasure, which aims to destroy the dependency of the faulty ciphertexts on the secret key. However, current security evaluations on infection countermeasures are either tailored for the specific attack scenario or not general enough to apply to various infection instances. They cannot come to convincing results, let alone make comparisons between different countermeasures. Based on information theory, this paper presents a generic evaluation framework that is feasible for various infection countermeasures and attack scenarios. The framework is constructed with the idea to separate the infection function from the unprotected cipher yet consider the fault injection effect on the unprotected cipher in the infection function evaluation. First, the security judging criteria for the infection function under different attack scenarios are personalized according to the injection-caused security loss of the unprotected cipher. Then, a universal method of security quantitative analysis on infection function is proposed with two important steps: the prior knowledge collection and the infection operation decomposition analysis. Because the analysis results of the simple infection operation can be reused within the infection function under various attack scenarios, the security quantifications are efficient. Based on this framework, the paper also reviews some existing infection countermeasures for their fault attack resistances. The result shows that our analysis can expose more infection vulnerabilities than the previous works. Besides, the security quantification and judgment on these countermeasures give us a new insight into their security applicable scopes. They are instructive for the countermeasure selection when the implementation costs are very close. Furthermore, the framework provides an efficient way to evaluate future infection countermeasures.},

  abstract     = {The concept of functional encryption (FE) has been introduced to address the shortcomings of public-key encryption (PKE) in many emerging applications which require both data storage and data sharing (e.g., cloud storage service). One of the major issues existing in most FE schemes is the efficiency, as they are built from bilinear pairings of which the computation is very expensive. A widely accepted solution to this problem is outsourcing the heavy workloads to a powerful third party and leaving the user with the light computation. Nevertheless, it is impractical to assume that the third party (e.g., the cloud) will provide free services. To our knowledge, no attention has been paid to the payment procedure between the user and the third party in an FE with outsourced decryption (FEOD) scheme under the assumption that neither of them should be trusted. Leveraging the transactions on cryptocurrencies supported by the blockchain technology, in this paper, we aim to design FE with payable outsourced decryption (FEPOD) schemes. The payment in an FEPOD scheme is achieved through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, which enables the user to pay a third party when it correctly completes the outsourced decryption. We define the adversarial model for FEPOD schemes, and then present a generic construction of FEPOD schemes. Also, we evaluate the performance of the proposed generic construction by implementing a concrete FEPOD scheme over a blockchain platform.},

  abstract     = {Android inter-app communication (IAC) allows apps to request functionalities from other apps, which has been extensively used to provide a better user experience. However, IAC has also become an enticing target by attackers to launch malicious activities. Dynamic class loading (DCL) and reflection are effective features to enhance the functionality of the apps. In this paper, we expose a new attack that leverages these features in conjunction with inter-app communication to conceal malicious attacks with the ability to bypass existing security mechanisms. To counteract such attack, we present DINA, a novel hybrid analysis approach for identifying malicious IAC behaviors concealed within dynamically loaded code through reflective/DCL calls. DINA appends reflection and DCL invocations to control-flow graphs and continuously performs incremental dynamic analysis to detect the misuse of reflection and DCL that obfuscates malicious Intent communications. DINA utilizes string analysis and inter-procedural analysis to resolve hidden IAC and achieves superior detection performance. Our extensive evaluation on 49,000 real-world apps corroborates the prevalent usage of reflection and DCL, and reveals previously unknown and potentially harmful, hidden IAC behaviors in real-world apps.},

While automatic characterization of malware benefits from recently proposed designs for passive monitoring, the subsequent dissection process still sees human analysts struggling with adversarial behaviors, many of which also closely resemble those studied for automatic systems. This gap affects the day-to-day analysis of complex samples and researchers have not yet attempted to bridge it. We make a first step down this road by proposing a design that can reconcile transparency requirements with manipulation capabilities required for dissection. Our open-source prototype BluePill (i) offers a customizable execution environment that remains stealthy when analysts intervene to alter instructions and data or run third-party tools, (ii) is extensible to counteract newly encountered anti-analysis measures using insights from the dissection, and (iii) can accommodate program analyses that aid analysts, as we explore for taint analysis.

  abstract     = {Sparse Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) has become a compelling approach to acquire and infer urban-scale sensing data. However, participants risk their location privacy when reporting data with their actual sensing positions. To address this issue, we propose a novel location obfuscation mechanism combining E-differential-privacy and δ-distortion-privacy in Sparse MCS. More specifically, differential privacy bounds adversaries&#39; relative information gain regardless of their prior knowledge, while distortion privacy ensures that the expected inference error is larger than a threshold under an assumption of adversaries&#39; prior knowledge. To reduce the data quality loss incurred by location obfuscation, we design a differential-and-distortion privacy-preserving framework with three components. First, we learn a data adjustment function to fit the original sensing data to the obfuscated location. Second, we apply a linear program to select an optimal location obfuscation function. The linear program aims to minimize the uncertainty in data adjustment under the constraints of E-differential-privacy, δ-distortion-privacy, and evenly-distributed obfuscation. We also design an approximated method to reduce the required computation resources. Third, we propose an uncertainty-aware inference algorithm to improve the inference accuracy for the obfuscated data. Evaluations with real environment and traffic datasets show that our optimal method reduces the data quality loss by up to 42% compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same level of privacy protection; the approximated method incurs &lt;; 3% additional quality loss than the optimal method, but only needs &lt;; 1% of the computation time.},

  abstract     = {Large matrix multiplications are central to large-scale machine learning applications. These operations are often carried out on a distributed computing platform with a master server and multiple workers in the cloud operating in parallel. For such distributed platforms, it has been recently shown that coding over the input data matrices can reduce the computational delay, yielding a trade-off between recovery threshold, i.e., the number of workers required to recover the matrix product, and communication load, i.e., the total amount of data to be downloaded from the workers. In this paper, in addition to exact recovery requirements, we impose security and privacy constraints on the data matrices, and study the recovery threshold as a function of the communication load. We first assume that both matrices contain private information and that workers can collude to eavesdrop on the content of these data matrices. For this problem, we introduce a novel class of secure codes, referred to as secure generalized PolyDot (SGPD) codes, that generalize state-of-the-art non-secure codes for matrix multiplication. SGPD codes allow a flexible trade-off between recovery threshold and communication load for a fixed maximum number of colluding workers while providing perfect secrecy for the two data matrices. We then study a connection between secure matrix multiplication and private information retrieval. We specifically assume that one of the data matrices is taken from a public set known to all the workers. In this setup, the identity of the matrix of interest should be kept private from the workers. For this model, we present a variant of generalized PolyDot codes that can guarantee both secrecy of one matrix and privacy for the identity of the other matrix for the case of no colluding servers.},

  abstract     = {Two legitimate parties, referred to as Alice and Bob, wish to generate secret keys from the wireless channel in the presence of an eavesdropper, referred to as Eve, in order to use such keys for encryption and decryption. In general, the secret key rate highly depends on the coherence time of the channel. In particular, a straightforward method of generating secret keys in static environments results in ultra-low rates. In order to resolve this problem, we introduce a low-complexity method called induced randomness. In this method, Alice and Bob independently generate local randomness to be used together with the uniqueness of the wireless channel coefficients in order to enable high-rate secret key generation. In this work, two scenarios are considered: first, when Alice and Bob share a direct communication channel, and second, when Alice and Bob do not have a direct link and communicate through an untrusted relay. After exchanging the induced randomness, post-processing is done by Alice and Bob to generate highly-correlated samples that are used for the key generation. Such samples are then converted into bits, disparities between the sequences generated by Alice and Bob are mitigated, and the resulting sequences are then hashed to compensate for the information leakage to the eavesdropper and to allow consistency checking of the generated key bit sequences. We utilize semantic security measures and information-theoretic inequalities to upper bound the probability of successful eavesdropping attack in terms of the mutual information measures that can be numerically computed. Given certain reasonable system parameters this bound is numerically evaluated to be 2 -31 and 2 -10.57 in the first and the second scenario, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The existing research work on facial age synthesis has been mostly focused on long-term aging (e.g., over an age span of 10 years or more). In this paper, we employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a tool to investigate age synthesis over different age spans. Compared with long-term aging, short-term age synthesis suffers from the reduced amount of available training data, which can severely hinder the model training. We conduct a series of experiments to validate this. To facilitate short-term age synthesis, we further propose label distribution-guided generative adversarial network (ldGAN), where each sample is associated with an age label distribution (ALD) rather than a single age group. Accordingly, each sample can contribute not only to the learning of its own age group but also to neighbouring groups&#39; learning. This is useful when addressing short-term aging to cope with the reduced amount of training data. In addition, unlike one-hot encoding which treats age groups as independent from one another, ldGAN can well capture the correlation among different age groups, so that smooth aging sequences can be achieved. The ALD model is integrated into GAN with a two-step process. Firstly, instead of the traditional one-hot encoding, ALD is applied as the condition of the generator. Secondly, we add a sequence of label distribution learners on top of several multi-scale discriminators, with the aim of minimizing the label distribution learning loss when optimizing both the generator and discriminators. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted to assess ldGAN&#39;s ability in dealing with two core issues of face aging, i.e., aging effect generation and identity preservation. The obtained experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ldGAN in both learning short-term aging patterns and coping with the lack of training data.},

As a matter of fact, some contactless vein-based recognition systems have already been deployed and commercialized. However, they require the users to keep their hands still over the acquisition device for a few seconds to perform recognition. In this study, we release this constraint and allow users to have their finger vein patterns acquired on-the-fly. To accomplish this goal, we introduce an ad-hoc acquisition architecture capable of capturing the finger vein structure using an array of low-cost cameras, and we propose a recognition framework based on the use of convolutional and recurrent neural networks. To test the proposed approach we acquire a finger vein image dataset, in video format at four different exposure times, from 100 subjects. The obtained experimental results show that, even in a very challenging scenario, the proposed system guarantees high performance levels, up to 99.13% recognition accuracy over the collected dataset.},

To illustrate the power of our method, we derive the capacity region of the multiple private key generation problem with an untrusted helper for continuous memoryless sources under Markov conditions.

This database contains more than 64K on-line character samples performed by 217 users, with 94 different smartphone models, and up to 6 acquisition sessions. ii) We perform a complete analysis of the proposed approach considering both traditional authentication systems such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and novel approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In addition, we present a novel approach named Time-Aligned Recurrent Neural Networks (TA-RNNs). This approach combines the potential of DTW and RNNs to train more robust systems against attacks. A complete analysis of the proposed approach is carried out using both MobileTouchDB and e-BioDigitDB databases. Our proposed TA-RNN system outperforms the state of the art, achieving a final 2.38% Equal Error Rate, using just a 4-digit password and one training sample per character. These results encourage the deployment of our proposed approach in comparison with traditional typed-based password systems where the attack would have 100% success rate under the same impostor scenario.},

Subsequently, a collaborative anomaly detection system is leveraged with the aim of supplying a cost-effective intrusion detection solution near the data plane. Moreover, to correlate the true positive alerts raised by the sensor nodes in the network edge, a Smart Monitoring System (SMS) is exploited in the control plane.

First, due to its invariance property, Fourier-Mellin transform is incorporated into the domain fingerprint minutiae blocks to provide feature alignment, therein generating a fixed-length minutiae representation for comparison. Then, dimensionality reduction and texture compression are exploited using fractal coding to generate a robust and compact hash for improved security and recognition. The experimental results demonstrate a favorable recognition performance on benchmarked state-of-the-art schemes from FVC2002 and FVC2004 fingerprint databases. The analyses prove our method&#39;s robustness and resiliency to security and privacy attacks. Our method also satisfies the revocability and unlinkability criteria of cancelable biometrics.},

However, in this letter, we show that the scheme is easily subject to a copy-summation attack and a single-copy attack, by which a cheating CSP only needs to invest a storage cost of a single copy—while can still pass the verifier’s challenge at all times. Therefore, the scheme is no longer secure in this case. Furthermore, we propose some simple but effective countermeasures and give a repaired scheme which is free from the above two attacks.},

  abstract     = {Byzantine attack is a severe security concern in network coding enabled wireless ad hoc networks, because the malicious nodes can easily inject bogus packets into the information flow and cause an epidemic propagation of pollution. In this paper, we address the Byzantine attack by proposing a malicious node identification scheme, which can achieve a high identification accuracy on malicious nodes and protect the benign nodes from being mis-identified as attackers. We consider two practical challenges, namely, 1) only a fraction of the intermediate nodes can be deployed as defenders; and 2) the malicious nodes are intelligent–they pretend to be legitimate nodes probabilistically to reduce the chances of being identified. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations show that our scheme performs well even under the conditions mentioned above. Furthermore, we conduct a series of comparisons between our scheme and several existing schemes, which show that our scheme outperforms them in both identification accuracy and valid throughput during the identification procedure. Finally, we present a two-player game theory framework to find the optimal strategy for the defender, and also provide a case study of the defender’s strategy optimization.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose the first joint watermarking-encryption-compression scheme for the purpose of protecting of medical images. The main originality of this scheme stands on its ability to give access to watermarking-based security services from both encrypted and compressed image bitstreams without having to decrypt or to decompress them, even partially. More clearly, there is no need neither to decrypt the encrypted image bitstream nor to decode the compressed image bitstream in order to extract watermarks. A second contribution is that it combines in a single algorithm the bit substitution watermarking modulation with JPEG-LS and the AES block cipher algorithm in its CBC mode. On their side, decompression, decryption and message extraction are conducted separately. Doing so makes our scheme compliant to the medical image standard DICOM. This scheme allows tracing images and controlling their reliability (i.e. based on proofs of image integrity and authenticity) either from the encrypted domain or from the compressed one. Experiments conducted on broad sets of Retina and ultrasound medical images demonstrate the capability of our system to securely make available a message in both encrypted and compressed domains while minimizing image distortion. Achieved watermarking capacities are large enough to support several watermarking-based security services at the same time.},

  abstract     = {We revisit the analysis and design of masked cryptographic implementations to prevent side-channel attacks. Our starting point is the (known) observation that proving the security of a higher-order masked block cipher exhaustively requires unrealistic computing power. As a result, a natural strategy is to split algorithms in smaller parts (or gadgets), with as main objectives to enable both simple composition (as initiated by Barthe et al. at CCS 2016) and efficient implementations. We argue that existing composition strategies allow either trivial composition with significant overheads or optimized composition with more analysis efforts. As a result, we first introduce a new definition of Probe Isolating Non-Interference (PINI) that allows both trivial composition and efficient implementations. We next prove general composition theorems for PINI gadgets that considerably simplify the analysis of complex masked implementations. We finally design efficient multiplication gadgets that satisfy this definition. As additional results, we exhibit a limitation of existing compositional strategies for the analysis of Multiple-Inputs / Multiple-Outputs (MIMO) gadgets, extend Barthe et al. definition of Strong Non-Interference (SNI) to deal with this context, and describe an optimization method to design efficient MIMO-SNI (sub)circuits. Our results allow proving the security of a recent masked AES implementation by Goudarzi and Rivain (EUROCRYPT 2017). From the implementation viewpoint, PINI implementations reach the level of performance of the best composable masking schemes for the AES Rijndael, and outperform them by significant factors for lightweight ciphers.},

  abstract     = {A public-key cryptographic algorithm based on multivariate quadratic equations is one of promising post-quantum alternatives for current public-key cryptography. The security of multivariate quadratic schemes has been sufficiently analyzed mathematically, but few works have been devoted to implementation attacks. In this paper, we present algebraic fault analysis of two well-known multivariate quadratic schemes, UOV and Rainbow, which combines fault attacks with key recovery attacks using good keys. We focus on fault attacks which cause faults on random Vinegar values used in signing. Our fault models are divided into three cases according to the leakage types of the Vinegar values: reused, revealed and set to zero. We show that the equivalent key of UOV is completely recovered in polynomial time from (m+1), n and m signatures generated by the entire faulty Vinegar values in the three cases, respectively. Specifically, the equivalent key of UOV is completely recovered from 45, 103 and 44 signatures generated by 59 bytes of faulty Vinegar values in the three cases, respectively, at a 128-bit security level. The equivalent key of Rainbow is also recovered from 44, 79 and 43 signatures with 36 bytes of faulty Vinegar values in the three cases, respectively. This is the first result that leads to the full secret key recovery of UOV and Rainbow from the leakage of the Vinegar values. In the other cases, we show that complexities of the key recovery attacks on Rainbow and UOV are significantly weakened in terms of the number of faulty Vinegar values. Our attacks can be applied to Rainbow and LUOV selected to NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Round 2. Countermeasures against our attacks are investigated.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) using conventional phased array (CPA) enables highly directional and fixed angular beamforming (FAB), therefore enhancing physical layer security (PLS) in the angular domain. However, as the eavesdropper is located in the direction pointed by the mainlobe of the information-carrying beam, information leakage is inevitable and FAB cannot guarantee PLS performance. To address this threat, we propose a novel fixed region beamforming (FRB) by employing a frequency diverse subarray (FDSA) architecture to enhance the PLS performance for mmWave communications. In particular, we carefully introduce multiple frequency offset increments (FOIs) across subarrays to achieve a sophisticated beampattern synthesis that ensures a confined information transmission only within the desired angle-range region (DARR) in close vicinity of the target user. More specifically, we formulate the secrecy rate maximization problem with FRB over possible subarray FOIs, and consider two cases of interests, i.e., without/with the location information of eavesdropping, both turn out to be NP-hard. For the unknown eavesdropping location case, we propose a seeker optimization algorithm to minimize the maximum sidelobe peak of the beampattern outside the DARR. As for the known eavesdropping location case, a block coordinate descend linear approximation algorithm is proposed to minimize the sidelobe level in the eavesdropping region. Moreover, we propose an inverted subarray subset technique to further randomize the sidelobes against sensitive eavesdropping. By using the proposed FRB, the mainlobes of all subarrays are constructively superimposed in the DARR while the sidelobes are destructively overlayed outside the DARR. Therefore, FRB exhibits prominent effect on confining information transmission within the DARR. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed FDSA-based FRB can provide superior PLS performance over the CPA-based FAB.},

We define a fake retweeter as a Twitter account that retweets spammy tweets, retweets an abnormally large amount of tweets in a short period, or misuses a trending hashtag to promote events irrelevant to the topic of discussion. We introduce an up-to-date, temporally diverse, trend-oriented labeled dataset to address the problem of fake retweeter detection. We develop a novel classifier, called HawkesEye which makes predictions based on a temporal window, in contrast to existing approaches which require a graph-like relationship between tweet entities, or the presence of the entire retweeting timeline of a retweeter. HawkesEye utilizes both temporal and textual information using a class-specific topic model and Hawkes processes. Experiments on our curated dataset show significant improvement over four state-of-the-art methods, with precision and recall scores of 0.964 and 0.960 on a balanced dataset, respectively – HawkesEye beats the best baseline by 6.16% and 25.98% relative improvement in terms of precision and recall, respectively. We also diagnose our model to understand the advantages and pitfalls of the underlying mechanism. We believe that the extent of this study is not restricted to Twitter, but generalizable to other social media systems such as Facebook and Instagram with similar reposting capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (Re-ID) has been widely studied by learning a discriminative feature representation with a set of well-annotated training data. Existing models usually assume that all the training samples are correctly annotated. However, label noise is unavoidable due to false annotations in large-scale industrial applications. Different from the label noise problem in image classification with abundant samples, the person Re-ID task with label noise usually has very limited annotated samples for each identity. In this paper, we propose a robust deep model, namely PurifyNet, to address this issue. PurifyNet is featured in two aspects: 1) it jointly refines the annotated labels and optimizes the neural networks by progressively adjusting the predicted logits, which reuses the wrong labels rather than simply filtering them; 2) it can simultaneously reduce the negative impact of noisy labels and pay more attention to hard samples with correct labels by developing a hard-aware instance re-weighting strategy. With limited annotated samples for each identity, we demonstrate that hard sample mining is crucial for label corrupted Re-ID task, while it is usually ignored in existing robust deep learning methods. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the robustness of PurifyNet over the competing methods under various settings. Meanwhile, we show that it consistently improves the unsupervised/video-based Re-ID methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/mangye16/ReID-Label-Noise.},

To elaborate, the QoS requirement of the QSU is guaranteed by a cognitive power allocation scheme, while the HARQ technique is employed to mitigate the successive interference cancellation (SIC) errors and improve the secrecy performance of the SRU. For reducing information leakage, a randomized retransmission NOMA (RR-NOMA) scheme is designed, where the retransmitted signals are generated from independent randomized codebooks. In this scheme, the closed-form expressions for the connection outage probability (COP), the average number of transmission (ANT), the secrecy outage probability (SOP), and effective secrecy throughput (EST) of the SRU are derived. In addition, as benchmarks, the performance analyses for the fixed retransmission (FR-NOMA) scheme and the randomized retransmission orthogonal multiple access (RR-OMA) scheme are also provided. Results show a trade-off between SOP and COP or EST, which is denoted by security-reliability trade-off (SRT) or security-efficiency trade-off (SET). Furthermore, simulation results show that the HARQ technique improves SRT and the RR-NOMA scheme achieves better SET than the FR-NOMA scheme in the low SOP region. We further conduct asymptotic analysis in the RR-NOMA, FR-NOMA and RR-OMA schemes. Asymptotic results demonstrate that the three schemes achieve the same ANT and the RR-NOMA scheme obtains better secrecy performance than the RR-OMA scheme and equal secrecy performance to the FR-NOMA scheme in terms of both EST and SOP.},

  abstract     = {Logic locking refers to a set of techniques that can protect integrated circuits (ICs) from counterfeiting, piracy and malicious functionality changes by an untrusted foundry. It achieves these goals by introducing new inputs, called key inputs, and additional logic to an IC such that the circuit produces the correct output only when the key inputs are set to specific values. The correct values of the key inputs are kept secret from the untrusted foundry and programmed after manufacturing and before distribution, thus rendering piracy, counterfeiting and malicious design changes infeasible. The security of logic locking relies on the assumption that the untrusted foundry cannot infer the correct values of the key inputs by analysis of the circuit. In this paper, we introduce a new attack on state-of-the-art logic locking schemes which invalidates the above assumption. We propose Functional Analysis attacks on Logic Locking algorithms (abbreviated as FALL attacks). FALL attacks have two stages. Their first stage is dependent on the locking algorithm and involves analyzing structural and functional properties of locked circuits to identify a list of potential locking keys. The second stage is algorithm agnostic and introduces a powerful addition to SAT-based attacks called key confirmation. Key confirmation can identify the correct key from a list of alternatives and works even on circuits that are resilient to the SAT attack. In comparison to past work, the FALL attack is more practical as it can often succeed (90% of successful attempts in our experiments) by only analyzing the locked netlist, without requiring oracle access to an unlocked circuit. Our experimental evaluation shows that FALL attacks are able to defeat 65 out of 80 (81%) circuits locked using Stripped-Functionality Logic Locking (SFLL-HD).},

Standard XOR PUFs typically contain multiple standard arbiter PUFs as components, and are more secure than standard arbiter PUFs or feed-forward (FF) arbiter PUFs (FF PUFs). This paper proposes design of feed-forward XOR PUFs (FFXOR PUFs) where each component PUF is a FF PUF. Various homogeneous and heterogeneous FFXOR PUFs are presented and evaluated in terms of four fundamental properties of PUFs: uniqueness, attack-resistance, reliability and randomness. Certain key issues pertaining to XOR PUFs such as their vulnerability to machine learning attacks and instability in responses are investigated. Other important challenges like the lack of uniqueness in FF PUFs and the asymmetry in FPGA arbiter PUFs are addressed and it is shown that FFXOR PUFs can naturally overcome these problems. It is shown that heterogeneous FFXOR PUFs (i.e., FFXOR PUFs with non-identical components) can be resilient to state-of-the-art machine learning attacks. We also present systematic reliability analysis of FFXOR PUFs and demonstrate that soft-response thresholding can be used as an effective countermeasure to overcome the degraded reliability bottleneck. Observations from simulations are further verified through hardware implementation of 64-bit FFXOR PUFs on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA.},

In this paper, we propose to learn regional adaptive convolution features that are locally and globally discriminative to facial identity and robust to facial variation. Then, a novel class-level joint representation framework is presented to exploit the distinctiveness and class-level commonality of different facial features. In the proposed class-level joint representation with regional adaptive convolution features (CJR-RACF), both discriminative facial features that are robust to facial variations and powerful representations for classification with generic facial variations have been fully exploited. Furthermore, the gallery discrimination is extracted by our proposed weight-embedded supervision in the training phase (denoted by CJR-RACFw), which is conducive to more specific features for FR with SSPDS. CJR-RACF and CJR-RACFw have been evaluated on several popular databases, including the large-scale CMU Multi-PIE, LFW, Megaface, and VGGFace datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the much higher robustness and effectiveness of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {With the development of demand response technologies, the pricing scheme in smart grids is moving from flat pricing to multiple pricing (MP), which facilitates the energy saving at the consumer side. However, the flexible pricing policy may be exploited for the stealthy reduction of utility bills. In this paper, we present a hidden electricity theft (HET) attack by exploiting the emerging MP scheme. The basic idea is that attackers can tamper with smart meters to cheat the utility that some electricity is consumed under a lower price. To construct the HET attack, we propose an optimization problem aiming at maximizing the attack profits while evading current detection methods, and design two algorithms to conduct the attack on smart meters. Moreover, we disclose and exploit several new vulnerabilities of smart meters to demonstrate the feasibility of HET attacks. To protect smart grids against HET attacks, we propose several defense and detection countermeasures, including selective protection on smart meters, limiting the attack cycle, and updating the billing mechanism. Extensive experiments on a real data set demonstrate that the attack could cause high economic losses, and the proposed countermeasures could effectively mitigate the attack&#39;s impact at a low cost.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, can potentially be deployed in a wide range of applications. Among these applications, decentralized payment systems (e.g. Bitcoin) have been one of the most mature blockchain applications with widespread adoption. While the early designs (e.g. Bitcoin) are often the currency of choice by cybercriminals (e.g., in ransomware incidents), they only provide pseudo-anonymity, in the sense that anyone can deanonymize Bitcoin transactions by using information in the blockchain. To strengthen the privacy protection of decentralized payment systems, a number of solutions such as Monero and Zerocash have been proposed. However, completely Decentralized Anonymous Payment (DAP) systems can be criminally exploited, for example in online extortion and money laundering activities. Recognizing the importance of regulation, we present a novel definition of Decentralized Conditional Anonymous Payment (DCAP) and describe the corresponding security requirements. In order to construct a concrete DCAP system, we first design a Condition Anonymous Payment (CAP) scheme (based on our proposed signature of knowledge), whose security can be demonstrated under the defined formal semantic and security models. To demonstrate utility, we compare the performance of our proposal with that of Zerocash under the same parameters and testing environment.},

  abstract     = {The biometric information contained in a face image is affected by many factors such as living environment, racial differences, and genetic diversity, this complexity leads to the nonstationary of the age estimation. In order to reduce the overlap of face features between adjacent ages and improve the accuracy of age prediction, a multi-stage feature constraints learning method is proposed for face age estimation. The proposed method gradually refines the feature through three feature constraint stages. In each stage, the algorithm continuously updates the feature center of its corresponding age range, and minimizes the distance between each age feature and feature center of the corresponding age range through feature constraint. Feature constraint makes the feature distances between different individuals in the same age feature space smaller and decrease the overlap areas between adjacent age range feature spaces. Meanwhile, the feature distance of different age range feature space is enlarged. The proposed network efficiently merges the features of three stages and optimizes the mapping of feature maps to an ordered binary comparison space. Experiments show that the proposed method is able to effectively improve the discrimination between different age features, and hence to improve the accuracy of face age estimation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is simple enough to achieve fast face age estimation.},

  abstract     = {With the advance of hardware, network, and virtualization technologies, cloud computing has prevailed and become the target of security threats such as the cross virtual machine (VM) side channel attack, with which malicious users exploit vulnerabilities to gain information or access to other guest virtual machines. Among the many virtualization technologies, the hypervisor manages the shared resource pool to ensure that the guest VMs can be properly served and isolated from each other. However, while managing the shared hardware resources, due to the presence of the virtualization layer and different CPU modes (root and non-root mode), when a CPU is switched to non-root mode and is occupied by a guest machine, a hypervisor cannot intervene with a guest at runtime. Thus, the execution status of a guest is like a black box to a hypervisor, and the hypervisor cannot mediate possible malicious behavior at runtime. To rectify this, we propose a hardware-assisted VMI (virtual machine introspection) based in-guest process monitoring mechanism which supports monitoring and management applications such as process profiling. The mechanism allows hooks placed within a target process (which the security expert selects to monitor and profile) of a guest virtual machine and handles hook invocations via the hypervisor. In order to facilitate the needed monitoring and/or management operations in the guest machine, the mechanism redirects access to in-guest memory space to a controlled, self-defined memory within the hypervisor by modifying the extended page table (EPT) to minimize guest and host machine switches. The advantages of the proposed mechanism include transparency, high performance, and comprehensive semantics. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed mechanism, we develop an API profiling system (APIf) to record the API invocations of the target process. The experimental results show an average performance degradation of about 2.32%, far better than existing similar systems.},

Using the proposed system, a face feature vector is stored on a remote server in encrypted form. To guarantee security against an honest-but-curious server who may try to learn the private feature vector, we perform a Euclidean distance-based matching score computation on encrypted feature vectors using homomorphic encryption. To provide security against malicious clients, we adopt a blinding technique. We implement the proposed system on a mobile client and a desktop server. Through an experiment with real-world participants, we demonstrate that secure face verification can be completed in real time (within 1.3 s) even when a smartphone is involved, with an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 3.04%. In further experiments with two public face datasets, CFP and ORL, face verification is completed in approximately 1 s with EER of 1.17% and 0.37%, respectively. Our system is two orders of magnitude faster than previous privacy-preserving face verification method with the same security assumptions and functionalities. To achieve this secure real-time computation, we improve the Catalano-Fiore transformation which converts a linear homomorphic encryption scheme into a quadratic scheme, and parallelize the decryption procedure of our system.},

  abstract     = {Some recent work treats age estimation as an ordinal ranking task and decomposes it into multiple binary classifications. However, a theoretical defect lies in this type of methods: the ignorance of possible contradictions in individual ranking results. In this paper, we partially embrace the decomposition idea and propose the Deep and Ordinal Ensemble Learning with Two Groups Classification (DOEL 2groups ) for age prediction. An important advantage of our approach is that it theoretically allows the prediction even when the contradictory cases occur. The proposed method is characterized by a deep and ordinal ensemble and a two-stage aggregation strategy. Specifically, we first set up the ensemble based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques, while the ordinal relationship is implicitly constructed among its base learners. Each base learner will classify the target face into one of two specific age groups. After achieving probability predictions of different age groups, then we make aggregation by transforming them into counting value distributions of whole age classes and getting the final age estimation from their votes. Moreover, to further improve the estimation performance, we suggest to regard the age class at the boundary of original two age groups as another age group and this modified version is named the Deep and Ordinal Ensemble Learning with Three Groups Classification (DOEL 3groups ). Effectiveness of this new grouping scheme is validated in theory and practice. Finally, we evaluate the proposed two ensemble methods on controlled and wild aging databases, and both of them produce competitive results. Note that the DOEL 3groups shows the state-of-the-art performance in most cases.},

  abstract     = {Pixel-value-ordering (PVO) is an efficient technique of reversible data hiding (RDH). By PVO, the maximum and minimum in each cover image block are first predicted and then modified to embed data. Actually, many PVO-based methods are essentially based on high-dimensional histogram modification. For these methods, a two-dimensional (2D) prediction-error histogram (PEH) is first generated and then modified based on a 2D mapping. However, these methods have two drawbacks. On one hand, the generated 2D PEH is irregular so that it is difficult to design suitable histogram modification strategy. On the other hand, the employed 2D mapping is empirically designed, and thus the embedding performance is far from optimal. Based on these considerations, a new PVO-based RDH scheme is proposed in this paper. By considering both pixel value orders and pixel locations, a new predictor is proposed so that the generated 2D PEH is regular in shape and suitable for reversible embedding. Moreover, instead of manually designing 2D mappings, to optimize the embedding performance, a self-learning mechanism is proposed to adaptively select the 2D mapping according to the image content. With the new predictor and the self-learning mechanism for 2D mapping selection, the proposed method works well with a good marked image quality, e.g., the PSNR of the image Lena is as high as 61.53 dB for an embedding capacity of 10 000 bits. Besides, compared with some state-of-the-art RDH methods, the superiority of the proposed method is experimentally verified.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we focus on the classical optical channel having Poissonian statistical behavior and propose a novel secrecy coding-based physical layer protocol. Our protocol is different but complementary to both (computationally secure) quantum immune cryptographic protocols and (information theoretically secure) quantum cryptographic protocols. Specifically, our (information theoretical) secrecy coding protocol secures classical digital information bits at photonic level exploiting the random nature of the Poisson channel. It is known that secrecy coding techniques for the Poisson channel based on the classical one-way wiretap channel (introduced by Wyner in 1975) ensure secret communication only if the mutual information to the eavesdropper is smaller than that to the legitimate receiver. In order to overcome such a strong limitation, we introduce a two-way protocol that always ensures secret communication independently of the conditions of legitimate and eavesdropper channels. We prove this claim showing rigorous comparative derivation and analysis of the information theoretical secrecy capacity of the classical one-way and of the proposed two-way protocols. We also show numerical calculations that prove drastic gains and strong practical potential of our proposed two-way protocol to secure information transmission over optical channels.},

However, some studies have noted that most CNN-based classifiers can be easily fooled by adversarial examples, which form slightly perturbed inputs to a target network according to the gradients. Inspired by this phenomenon, we first introduce a novel steganography method based on adversarial examples for digital audio in the time domain. Unlike related methods for image steganography, such as [1]-[4], which are highly dependent on some existing embedding costs, the proposed method can start from a flat or even a random embedding cost and then iteratively update the initial costs by exploiting the adversarial attacks until satisfactory security performances are obtained. The extensive experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the existing nonadaptive and adaptive steganography methods and achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we also provide experimental results to investigate why the proposed embedding modifications seem evenly located at all audio segments despite their different content complexities, which is contrary to the content adaptive principle widely employed in modern steganography methods.},
