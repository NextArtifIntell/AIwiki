On the other hand, decoding MI tasks within the same limb is a challenging problem with these classifiers; however, it would provide more options to control robotic devices. This work proposes to improve the hand MI tasks decoding within the same limb in a brain-computer interface using convolutional neural networks (CNNs); the CNN EEGNet, LDA, and SVM classifiers were evaluated for two (flexion/extension) and three (flexion/extension/grasping) MI tasks. Our approach is the first attempt to apply CNNs for solving this problem to our best knowledge. In addition, visual and electrotactile stimulation were included as BCI training reinforcement after the MI task similar to feedback sessions; then, they were compared. The EEGNet achieved maximum mean accuracies of 78.46% (±12.50%) and 76.72% (±11.67%) for two and three classes, respectively. Outperforming conventional classifiers with results around 60% and 48%, and similar works with results lower than 67% and 75%, respectively. Moreover, the electrical stimulation over the visual stimulus was not significant during the calibration session. The deep learning scheme enhanced the decoding of MI tasks within the same limb against the conventional framework.},

  abstract     = {Focal brain cooling (FBC) is a treatment for refractory epilepsy to suppress epileptic discharges from an epileptic focus. Our wearable FBC system under development consists of a recirculating coolant apparatus and a battery located extracorporeally, and a cooling device made of titanium with water channels inside which is embedded in the skull. An optimal channel design of the cooling device is needed to cool the brain efficiently. Although clinical and animal studies are required to design the cooling device, the number of experiments should be reduced, and finite element (FE) simulation be utilized instead. However, trial-and-error simulations impose a heavy computational burden. One option to deal with this problem is to use surrogate modeling, which is a data-driven approach that mimics the behavior of simulation models with a low computational burden. We optimized the channel structure by combining the surrogate model approach and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), which is a multi-objective optimization algorithm. The objective was to design a cooling device that simultaneously achieves high cooling performance and low pressure drop since low pressure loss contributes to miniaturization and energy saving of the recirculating apparatus. The optimization result showed that pressure loss was reduced by 28.7% in comparison with the design variables determined through experiments without deteriorating the cooling performance.},

Conventional robot skin is mainly made of rigid components and bendable films, which cannot provide a fully soft physical interface in HRI. In addition, the sensitivity of robot skin is still to be enhanced so that robot could perceive touch behavior more precisely from a human. Here, a novel robot skin with features of high sensitivity and softness is designed in this article. The proposed robot skin is composed of a matrix of carbon black-polyurethane sponge sensor units through a foaming process. The sensitivity of the sensor is further enhanced by optimizing its geometric structure, based on the finite element method and physical experimental tests. The excellent cycling stability and transient responsiveness of the sponge sensor embedded into the robot skin endow host robots with an accurate long-term perception of both transient and quasi-static force. Finally, the validation of the robot skin is carried out by installing it on the back of a collaborative robot to perceive four touch modalities, illustrating great application prospects in affective HRI.},

The Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO) is an acknowledged tool used in surface electromyography (sEMG) signal conditioning for improving the performances of many change-point detection methods. Here, a TKEO extended version (ETKEO) was used to investigate its effects, for different SNR ranges, among a series of well-assessed algorithms, including a threshold-based one (TP). An optimization procedure on synthetic signals for the selection of the operator structure was also developed. The detection errors between TKEO and ETKEO, performed on real sEMG signals with SNR≤8 dB, showed significant ( ${p} &amp;lt; 0.05$ ) overall improvements, not lower than 30%, when ETKEO was used. When compared with more robust techniques preconditioned by ETKEO as well, i.e., wavelet-, CUSUM- and profile likelihood maximization-based algorithms, the TP detector reached comparable performances for each SNR band, also for the lowest one. The results support the relevance of using ETKEO to improve onset analysis methods for a wide range of low SNR values, being particularly suitable for applications such as myoelectric motion intention detection. Moreover, the ETKEO adaptable structure suggests its use for other biological signals, presenting different characteristics with respect to sEMG signals.},

Although, different assistive robotic systems have been developed to perform essential tasks around the head, these existing robotic systems are either manually controlled, shared controlled or interactive ones. Although, fully autonomous robotic systems can have the potential of eliminating several limitations of the existing systems, such systems are limited in design due to critical issues of increased complexities and the associated risks. In this article, a hybrid impedance controller-based autonomous assistive robotic system for tooth brushing assistance is developed. A fixed base manipulator with an attached automatic tooth brush and Kinect RGB-D sensor are proposed as a platform to achieve the brushing task. An online face detection, mouth detection, head pose estimation and trajectory planning for the brushing task are achieved. Additionally, online re-planning the trajectories in case of patients’ head pose changes is taken into account. The controller performance is evaluated regarding tracking the generated brushing trajectories and the desired force trajectory by co-simulating the manipulator’s dynamics in ADAMS and SIMULINK. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed robotic system to achieve tooth brushing autonomously.},

Wearable sensors have gained popularity owing to their convenience of use in a flexible environment, while providing accuracy and reliability, in comparison with the gold standard system, i.e., motion capture. In this study, we proposed a framework for quantitative gait assessment using only two inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors, while extracting maximum number of features. Decreasing the number of sensors negatively affects the performance of gait assessment. However, through comparison with a motion capture setup and previous studies, we verified the potential and limitations of our proposed framework toward providing a compact sensing system with feature-rich diversity for gait assessment. The results revealed that the temporal differences were 4.22±15.48 ms (mean ± S.D.) and −8.31±21.02 ms (mean ± S.D.) in the initial contact and toe-off events, respectively. Additionally, with respect to the spatial features, the stride length and heel vertical displacement were overestimated by an average of 7.72 cm and 2.22 cm, respectively. We successfully extracted 17 gait features from two IMUs located on the foot. We have also demonstrated that symmetry index feature can distinguish normal healthy subjects and subject with recent history of lower-limb injury, which is important for clinical research.},

Current rehabilitation programs result in only partial recovery of motor ability for the patients, which has resulted in an ongoing search for methods to improve the rehabilitation approaches. Therefore, this study presents a novel method for early onset of active rehabilitation by combining an end effector robot with surface electromyography (sEMG) triggered functional electrical stimulation (FES) of rectus femoris and tibialis anterior muscles. This rehabilitation system was demonstrated in 10 able-bodied experimental participants. Defining a successful exercise repetition as a fully completed exercise, from start point to end point followed by a return to start point, when FES onset is triggered by the EMG threshold, the results showed that 97% of the exercise repetitions were successful for a leg press exercise and 100% for a dorsiflexion exercise. Furthermore, an FES stimulation current amplitude of 20–53 mA was required for the leg press exercise and 10–30 mA for the dorsiflexion exercise. The resulting generated force was in the range of 43.0-141.2 [N] for the leg press exercise and 5.4-17.6 [N] for dorsiflexion.},

Unfortunately, integrating state-of-the-art force sensors is challenging for these robots due to their small form factor, although contact forces are essential information in surgical procedures. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven approach based on Deep Direct Cascade Learning (DDCL) to create a virtual sensor for computing the tip contact force of Concentric Tube Continuum Robots. By exploiting the robot’s backbone’s inherent elasticity, deflection is used to estimate the respective external tip contact force. We evaluate our approach on different data representations for a single tube and apply it subsequently on a three-segment Concentric Tube Continuum Robot. Furthermore, we devise a novel transfer learning approach through DDCL to improve the estimation accuracy by pre-training a cascaded network with simulated data. Subsequently, we fine-tune the network based on a small real-world data set recorded from the physical robot.},

The ability to pass through complex and narrow regions makes them have great potential in biomedical applications. To date, various magnetic actuation systems and control methods have been developed to drive these tiny agents. However, steering their 3D locomotion at the human scale using electromagnetic systems is still challenging. In this regard, this article explores a closed-loop control strategy that guides swimming of magnetic microrobots at low Reynolds numbers in a large workspace. An eye-in-hand stereo-vision mobile-coil system is adopted to provide required dynamic magnetic fields and vision information. Both corkscrew-type and flexible-oar-type swimmers are analyzed, and a unified kinematic model is established. Based on the system and model, a triple-loop visual servoing scheme is proposed to fulfill simultaneous mechanism tracking and swimmer steering. Two different scaled-up untethered microrobots are employed in the path following experiment. Our prototype magnetic actuation system reaches a cylindrical workspace of diameter over 200 mm, and the mean error of path tracking is within 2 mm. These results provide a preliminary study for dexterous magnetic actuation of miniature robots for medical treatment.},

However, with existing technology, it is difficult, impossible, or traumatic to reach certain locations. In this article, we present a magnetically actuated soft-robotic concept for use in endoluminal applications (e.g., capsule endoscopes and catheters). The soft endoluminal robot is a simple device comprising two or more permanent magnets, axially magnetized and embedded co-axially with alternating polarity in a compliant body, with an optional internal lumen, actuated by an external rotating magnetic dipole field. We use simulations to elucidate the actuation concept’s underlying physics and, combined with experiments, demonstrate how the proposed concept outperforms other potential variations. We experimentally demonstrate the robustness to misalignment between the soft robot and the applied field, enabling operation in different applications without precise knowledge of the robot’s orientation or precise control of the actuator dipole field. Experiments are then performed inside a synthetic bowel to compare capsule-endoscope-size robots and multi-component robots formed by connecting multiple capsule-endoscope-size robots axially. Finally, experiments in a synthetic stomach show how the concept lends itself to directed self-assembly in the stomach, thus creating robots that are larger than could be swallowed.},

Due to its availability in open and laparoscopic surgery, surgeons with such experience potentially possess learned models of tissue stiffness that might promote good force estimation abilities during RMIS. To test if prior haptic experience leads to improved force estimation ability in teleoperation, 33 naive participants were assigned to one of three training conditions: manual manipulation, teleoperation with force feedback, or teleoperation without force feedback, and learned to tension a silicone sample to a set of forces. They were then asked to perform the tension task, and a previously unencountered palpation task, to a different set of forces under teleoperation without force feedback. Compared to the teleoperation groups, the manual group had higher force error in the tension task outside the range of forces they had trained on, but showed better speed-accuracy functions in the palpation task at low force levels. This suggests that the dynamics of the training modality affect force estimation ability during teleoperation, with the prior haptic experience accessible if formed under the same dynamics as the task.},

  abstract     = {Concentric tube robots are continuum robots particularly well-suited for minimally-invasive surgery. Their small diameter, natural free channel and snake-like shape unlock the potential for applications that require a high degree of dexterity in confined spaces. The synthesis and planning of such robots are generally based on the patient’s anatomy and the type of surgery to be performed. However, their practical deployment can be challenging. Open-loop approaches are prone to errors due to modeling accuracy or physiological motions of the patient during the procedure, and human-in-the-loop approaches require specific skills from the surgeon. In this article, we propose an automatic tip-steering approach for concentric tube robots based on visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). This allows a closed-loop control scheme to compensate for open-loop errors, and provides to the surgeon the opportunity to focus on the medical procedure, simplifying the management of the deployment. A method is proposed in the case of a robot geometry that achieves approximate follow-the-leader deployment. It is validated by performing an automatic tip-steering task in the trachea using a realistic simulator for concentric tube robots.},

  abstract     = {Current surgical approaches to radical prostatectomy are associated with high rates of erectile dysfunction and incontinence. These complications occur secondary to the disruption of surrounding healthy tissue, which is required to expose the prostate. The urethra offers the least invasive access to the prostate, and feasibility has been demonstrated of enucleating the prostate with an endoscope using Holmium laser, which can itself be aimed by concentric tube robots. However, the transurethral approach to radical prostatectomy has thus far been limited by the lack of a suitable means to perform an anastomosis of the urethra to the bladder after prostate removal. Only a few intraluminal anastomotic devices currently exist, and none are small enough to pass through the urethra. In this article we describe a new way to perform an anastomosis in the small luminal space of the urethra, harnessing the dexterity and customizability of concentric tube manipulators. We demonstrate a successful initial proof-of-concept anastomosis in an anthropomorphic phantom of the urethra and bladder.},

Operating telerobots such as surgical robots and upper-limb prostheses removes this multimodality feedback.

Here, we present an experimental framework designed to explore continuous multimodality haptic feedback for dexterous manipulation. Participants performed a grasp-and-hold task in a virtual environment with either direct or myoelectric control under different haptic feedback conditions: no feedback, vibrotactile feedback of object slip, squeeze feedback of grip force, and combined vibrotactile and squeeze feedback. Results from preliminary pilot studies highlight the gap in knowledge surrounding the potential utility of continuous multimodality feedback in differing telerobot control scenarios.},

Studies show that rehabilitation training using virtual reality games is helpful for patients to restore arm functions. It has been found that ensuring active patient participation and effort devoting in the process is very important to obtain better training results. This article introduces a method to help patients increase their engagement and provide motion assistance in virtual reality-mediated upper-limb rehabilitation training. Attention enhancement and motion assistance is achieved through an illusion of virtual forces created by altering the drag speed between the cursor and the object presented on a screen to the patient as the only feedback. We present two game forms using the proposed method, including a target-approaching game and a maze-following game. The results of evaluation experiments with human participants showed that the proposed method could provide path guidance that significantly improved path-following performance of users and required more involvement of the users when compared to playing the game without attention enhancement and motion assistance.},

  abstract     = {Whilst offering numerous benefits to patients, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has a disadvantage in the loss of tactile feedback to the surgeon, traditionally offering valuable qualitative tissue assessment, such as tumour identification and localisation. Tactile sensors aim to overcome this loss of sensation by detecting tissue characteristics such as stiffness, composition and temperature. Tactile sensors have previously been incorporated into MIS robotic end effectors, which require lengthy scanning procedures due to localised sensitivity. Distributed tactile sensors, or “artificial skin” offer a map of tissue properties in a single instance but are often not suitable for MIS applications due to limited biocompatibility or large collapsed volumes. We propose a deployable, soft, tactile sensor with a deformable saline chamber and integrated Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) electrodes. During contact with tissue, the saline is displaced from the chamber and the lesion size and stiffness can be inferred from the resultant impedance changes. Through optimisation of the EIT measurement protocol and hardware the sensor was capable of localising the centre of mass of palpation targets within 1.5 mm in simulation and 2.3–4.6mm in phantom experiments. Reconstructed image metrics differentiated target objects from 8–30 mm.},

The framework is modular in the sense that all components are connected independently, making it readily extensible and reconfigurable for supporting the clinical workflow of various interventional MRI procedures. Based on this framework we developed two body-mounted robots for musculoskeletal procedures. The first robot is a four-degree of freedom system called ArthroBot for shoulder arthrography in pediatric patients. The second robot is a six-degree of freedom system called PainBot for perineural injections used to treat pain in adult and pediatric patients. Body-mounted robots are designed with compact and lightweight structure so that they can be attached directly to the patient, which minimizes the effect of patient motion by allowing the robot to move with the patient. A dedicated clinical workflow is proposed for the MRI-guided musculoskeletal procedures using body-mounted robots. Initial cadaveric evaluations of both systems were performed to verify the feasibility of the systems and validate the clinical workflow.},

In this work we present a novel real-time soft tissue simulator aimed at testing the in vivo dynamic behavior of robotic implants. The simulator is capable of reproducing mechanical properties of the biological tissue, e.g., viscoelasticity, as well as its metabolism, being able to grow up to 260 mm. A control strategy based on impedance control enables the simulation of changing mechanical properties in real-time, in order to recreate conditions such as fibrosis or tissue scarring. We finally show the platform in use with a soft implant. The electric actuation in conjunction with the 500 Hz control loop frequency guarantees fast and accurate response. We believe our platform has the potential to reduce the need for in vivo preclinical studies and shorten the path to clinical experimentation.},

It has been shown that early involvement in rehabilitation therapies has a desirable effect on the long-term recovery of patients. There are, however, several challenges with the current state of delivering rehabilitation services, including limitations on the number of clinics, financial needs, and human resources. Robotic systems have been proposed in the literature to help with these challenges. However, most of the existing robotic systems are expensive, not-portable, and cannot be used for both upper- and lower-limb rehabilitation. This article presents a 3-DOF robotic device that has been designed to deliver both upper- and lower-limb therapy and incorporates a novel mechanical safety mechanism. The device is capable of teleoperation which makes it particularly suitable for telerehabilitation in the current COVID-19 environment. The rehabilitation robot can deliver therapy in assistive and resistive modes to aid patients at all stages of recovery. In the assistive mode, the robot&#39;s motion provides input to help the patient in completing the therapy task, while in the resistive mode, the robot opposes the motions generated by the patient thereby requiring additional muscle actuation. The robot has been tested by physiotherapists to assess its validity in a clinical setting, and by healthy participants to assess its functionality, safety, and engineering design. The study found that 80% of the physiotherapists agreed the platform has the potential to improve patient outcomes.},

The majority of research has sought to mitigate these issues through the integration of force feedback into the graspers. In this work we investigate an alternative strategy in which the grasper design is engineered to create preferential localised slip, also known as incipient slip, on the premise that this can be detected before the onset of macro slip, allowing graspers to use the minimum force required to maintain stable control. We demonstrate the ability to encourage incipient slip in a predictable and repeatable manner through the design of the grasper face profile and pattern. This provides an important foundation for development of sensing systems capable of detecting these slips during surgery to improve operative outcomes.},

Images were captured with an infrared CMOS sensor, pre-processed to isolate laser centers, and resized to test information requirements. Images for both laser types were scaled from $5\times5$ pixels to $30\times30$ pixels and trained on a convolutional neural network, GoogLeNet. At sizes above $15\times15$ pixels, the IR laser had a higher classification accuracy, reaching 97.8% at $30\times30$ pixels, whereas the red laser peaked at 94.1%. It was shown as not possible to qualitatively identify materials that were not trained in the network based on their probability outputs.

The surgical procedure consists of the resection of pathological tissues that occurs inside the middle ear cavity known as cholesteatoma. The current surgical procedure is performed manually, is invasive and does not guarantee an exhaustive cholesteatoma tissues removal leading to reoccurrence in 25-30% cases. To remedy this, we developed a new surgical protocol that combines a robotic solution and original surgical instruments. On one side, it consists of a redundant seven degrees of freedom (DoFs) robotic arm extended with a 2 DoFs flexible fibroscope (emulating a future microrobot under development). On the other side, different control architectures are proposed to achieve the surgical procedure. One control mode is based on the teleoperation of whole developed system using a joystick such as an Omni device. The other mode combines comanipulation of the 7 DoFs robotic arm using an embedded force/torque sensor and teleoperation of the remaining 2 DoFs fibroscope using a lab-made in-hand joystick. The proposed materials and methods were validated experimentally using a robotic setup. The obtained results using the different control schemes are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Stent placement in the gastrointestinal tract has emerged as an effective method of therapy for intestinal obstruction. In fluoroscopic guided stenting, clinicians first insert a hyper-elastic guidewire, and a stent introducer loaded with a compressed stent is passed along the guidewire to the desired deployment site. However, the high bending stiffness of the loaded stent introducer tends to straighten the inserted guidewire at the tortuous region. To overcome this issue, tubes of various stiffnesses are repeatedly inserted and removed. To optimize the mechanical properties of the devices for successful GI stenting, the interaction between the device and the environment should be considered as a key factor. In this study, conformability factor, a new index that abstracts the physical interaction for GI stenting was proposed. Based on the conformability factor, we proposed design requirements for variable stiffness continuum robots for GI stenting. The in vitro stent deployment experiment result shows that the proposed instrument can successfully deploy the loaded stent introducer without exchanging multiple tubes.},

  abstract     = {This research is motivated by the need of real-time needle tracking solutions in brachytherapy procedures for improving targeting accuracy. We compared two different modelling approaches to estimate brachytherapy 3D needle deflection during insertion into soft tissue from reaction forces and moments measured at the base of the needle: an analytical model based on beam deflection theory and, a data-driven model using a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN). Verification of the analytical model as well as training, validation, and testing of the ANN model were performed with experimental data obtained from over 120 insertion tests into gelatine tissue phantoms including a variety of needle types and tissue properties. The ANN model has lower prediction errors and is more robust to changes in testing conditions, with accurate predictions in 3 out of 4 tested scenarios; whereas the analytical model predictions are not statistically comparable to ground truth values in any of the tested scenarios. ANN models show a big potential for online 3D tracking of brachytherapy needles in a clinical context in comparison with beam theory analytical models. A simple neural network trained with numerous needle insertions into representative biological soft tissue could estimate needle tip position with submillimetre accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Robotic telesurgery is a new concept in surgical care that has gained relevance over the past two decades. Now, with the introduction of 5G mobile networks, this concept is becoming practical. Here, we report that surgeons successfully performed complex transoral laser microsurgeries on the vocal cords of an adult human cadaver located 15 km away from them. This was possible thanks to a high bandwidth and ultra-low latency 5G telecommunication system, which allowed for precise remote control of robotic instruments and full HD ( $1920\times 1280$ pixels) 3D visualization of the surgical site. During the operation, the mean video transmission latency was 102±9 ms with the maximum latency being 140 ms, but this was observed during less than 1% of the operation time. This latency did not cause any deterioration in surgeons’ performance. Our results demonstrate that surgical expertise can be exploited and shared efficiently using the new 5G telecommunication standard. This is critical for highly specialized operations such as the microsurgeries demonstrated here, which require surgical expertise that are not widely available. Therefore, the possibility to operate from a distance can bring significant benefits to healthcare systems, reducing costs and enhancing treatment quality for patients. In addition, it makes telementoring a reality, allowing expert surgeons to be present virtually in multiple operating rooms to guide and train less experienced colleagues.},

  abstract     = {Bone-anchored attachment of amputation limb prostheses is increasingly becoming a clinically accepted alternative to conventional socket suspension. The direct transfer of loads demands that the percutaneous implant system and the residual bone withstand all forces and moments transferred from the prosthesis. This study presents load measurements recorded at the bone-anchored attachment in 20 individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputation performing the everyday ambulatory activities: level ground walking, stairs ascent/descent and slope ascent/descent. Mean peak values for the sample populations across activities ranged from 498–684 N for the resultant force, 26.5–39.8 Nm for the bending moment, and 3.1–5.5 Nm for the longitudinal moment. Significant differences with respect to level walking were found for the resultant force during stairs ascent, (higher, p = 0.002), and stairs descent, (lower, p = 0.005). Using a crutch reduced the peak resultant forces and the peak bending moments with averages ranging from 5.5–12.6 % and 13.2–15.6 %, respectively. Large inter-participant variations were observed and no single activity resulted in consistently higher loading of the bone-anchored attachment across the participants. Results from this study can guide future development of percutaneous osseointegrated implant systems for limb prostheses and their rehabilitation protocols.},

The CNN runs on an embedded controller to identify obstacles on the surface of the road. Images are trained initially using a CNN on a host computer and are then classified on the embedded controller in real-time. The experimental analysis reveals that the proposed system has 98.73% accuracy for the front sensor with an error rate of 1.26% when the obstacle is at 50 cm distance. In addition, the proposed system obtains the accuracy, precision and recall of 92.67%, 92.33% and 93% respectively for image classification.

Exosuits can aid human movement and may be more accessible alternatives to current devices, but we know little about how they might assist post-stroke upper extremity movement. Here, we designed an exosuit actuator to support shoulder abduction, which we call an “exomuscle” and is based on a form of growing robot called a pneumatic-reel actuator. We also assembled a ceiling-mounted support for a positive control. We verified that both supports reduce the activity of shoulder abductor muscles and do not impede range of motion in healthy participants (n=4). Then, we measured reachable workspace area in stroke survivors (n=6) with both supports and without support. Our exomuscle increased workspace area in four participants (180±90 cm2) while the ceiling support increased workspace area in five participants (792±540 cm2). Design decisions that reduce exomuscle complexity, such as leaving the forearm free, likely contribute to performance differences between the two supports. Heterogeneity amongst stroke survivors’ abilities likely contribute to high variability in our results. Though both supports performed similarly for healthy participants, performance differences in stroke survivors highlight the need to validate assistive devices in the target population.},

To adapt it to different patients, the prediction model was built based on the physiological data recorded from subjects themselves. In addition, the spindle speed of the drilling tool was investigated to find a suitable speed for the robotic-assisted system. To ensure patient safety, a monitoring system was built based on the thrusting force and tracked position information. Finally, experiments were carried out on a fresh porcine lamellar bone fixed on a 3-PRS parallel robot used to simulate the vertebra displacement. The success rate of the robotic-assisted drilling procedure reached 95% when the moving bone was compensated.},

Previously developed navigation system for femoroplasty required the attachment of an external X-ray fiducial to the femur. We propose a fiducial-free 2D/3D registration pipeline using fluoroscopic images for robot-assisted femoroplasty. Intraoperative fluoroscopic images are taken from multiple views to perform registration of the femur and drilling/injection device. The proposed method was tested through comprehensive simulation and cadaveric studies. Performance was evaluated on the registration error of the femur and the drilling/injection device. In simulations, the proposed approach achieved a mean accuracy of 1.26 ± 0.74 mm for the relative planned injection entry point; 0.63 ± 0.21° and 0.17 ± 0.19° for the femur injection path direction and device guide direction, respectively. In the cadaver studies, a mean error of 2.64 ± 1.10 mm was achieved between the planned entry point and the device guide tip. The biomechanical analysis showed that even with a 4 mm translational deviation from the optimal injection path, the yield load prior to fracture increased by 40.7%. This result suggests that the fiducial-less 2D/3D registration is sufficiently accurate to guide robot assisted femoroplasty.},

We evaluated different mechanisms in bactericidal activity among several insect species, and we also provided a glimpse at attempts at fabricating bactericidal bioinspired structures. In addition, we investigated the link between species with mechano-bactericidal surfaces and their evolution and ecological dynamics. It emerged that mostly hemimetabolous insects evolved bactericidal nanostructures on their wings, probably due to development of their wings externally during postembryonal development. Whereas, holometabolous insects, which develop their wings internally during metamorphosis, have their wings exposed to the environment just in the adult instar, and thus subjected to bacteria for a shorter period compared to hemimetabolous insects. Bio-inspired high-aspect-ratio nanopillared surfaces with bactericidal properties might broaden the application area of bactericidal surfaces, to mechanically decrease the number of bacterial infections.},

Unlike rigid robots that are characterized with mechanical rigidity and limited degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), continuum robots were developed mainly for interventional medicine. A special class of continuum robots are Concentric Tube Robots (CTRs), that have diameters comparable to those of catheters and steerable needles. Since their introduction, huge effort has been dedicated to the kinematic modelling and real-time control. Due to their intrinsic actuation capability, miniaturization potential and controllable mechanical properties, they have been adopted for different surgical applications. Experimental tests based on phantom and cadaveric studies were performed to prove their feasibility. This review encompasses the generic design, modelling and control methods of CTRs. It also addresses, in detail, their different surgical applications. Finally, related main research limitations and future opportunities are briefly discussed.},

  abstract     = {Error-related potentials (ErrPs) provide an elegant method to improve human-machine interaction by detecting incorrect system behavior from the electroencephalogram of a human operator in real time. In this paper, we focus on adaptive subject-independent decoding models particularly suitable for ErrP classification. As individualized decoding models require a time-consuming calibration phase, such models provide a promising alternative. Based on an investigation of the characteristics of inter-subject variations in the signal and feature space, we evaluate the performance of a decoding model solely trained on prior data and the effectiveness of adapting this model to a new subject in a comparative study. Our results show that such a generalized model can decode ErrPs with an acceptable average accuracy of 72.7 ± 9.66% and that supervised adaptation can significantly improve the accuracy of the generalized model after adaptation with 85 trials by on average +3.8 ± 5.1%. We show that adaptation of subject-independent decoding models is superior to the traditional calibration procedure. Unsupervised adaptation only proved effective for some subjects and requires further attention to be practical for a broader range of subjects. Consequently, our work contributes to the development of calibration-free ErrP decoding in the broader scope of enhancing usability of ErrPs for human-machine interaction.},

Our system makes a good combination of sensors and algorithms. In order to find more feature points, we proposed an autonomous searching strategy of the bionic eyes, which is mainly inspired by the peripheral and central visual of human eyes. After that the camera motion is calculated using a robust motion estimation method. Our system is tested in indoor low-textured and large-scale outdoor environment. Experimental results show that compared to fixed stereo cameras, our bionic eyes SLAM system gains more robustness and avoid tracking failure problem when facing the low-textured environment.},

Semantic segmentation that imitates the mechanism of human visual system can effectively promote the correctness of scene understanding. It conforms to the basic principle of human environment perception and enables robots to better serve human society. In this paper, we propose a multilevel cross-aware network (MCA-Net) for RGBD semantic segmentation. It utilizes basic residual structure to encode texture information and depth geometric information respectively. In view of the flow pattern of different visual features in the visual pathway of human brain, our MCA-Net attempts to jointly reason about 2D appearance and depth geometric information. Therefore, multilevel cross-aware fusion modules are designed to fuse multi-scale complementary features extracted from RGB and depth images. As the depth and color information are independent, the reasonable combination of depth and RGB images can improve the quality of semantic labeling. Experiments conducted on ScanNetv2 dataset show that the proposed network produces high quality segmentation results of RGBD images and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the semantic labeling results on the bionic binocular robot in real-office scenes further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MCA-Net.},

The upper arm deformation is a biosignal which provides information about the complex activities of muscles and tendons. We designed a distance sensor array consisting of eight distance sensor units to measure the upper arm deformation. Based on the deformation, the pose and joint torque are estimated using Deep Neural Networks. In the experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method with five participants.

Many compliant mechanisms derive their design ideas from nature, since the structure of biological organisms sometimes offers a better solution than the conventional mechanisms. However, the bio-inspired structures usually have very complex geometries which cannot be easily modeled and analyzed using traditional methods. In this paper, we present a novel finite element method (FEM) based modeling framework in MATLAB to analyze the mechanics of different bio-inspired compliant mechanisms. Since the basic linear FEM formulation can only be employed to model small displacements of compliant mechanisms, a non-linear FEM formulation that integrates the modeling of large displacements, tendon-driven mechanisms and contact problems was implemented in the proposed framework to overcome the limitations. Simulations and experiments were also conducted to evaluate the performance of the modeling framework. Results have demonstrated the accuracy and plausibility of the proposed non-linear FEM formulation. Furthermore, the proposed framework can also be used to achieve structural optimization of bio-inspired compliant mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this paper is to propose a numerical calculation method for vessel preservation simulations to help brain surgeons in training techniques. Recently, neurosurgery simulators have been recognized as an effective training tool for surgical techniques. Vessel preservation is an important neurosurgical technique. Brain vessels are nonlinear and they are confined by arachnoid trabeculae in the subarachnoid space. Proper tension forces acting on the arachnoid trabeculae are important for vessel preservation, however, the subarachnoid space structure has not been considered in previous studies. Accordingly, to develop a vessel preservation simulation, a nonlinear and failure numerical calculation method of the vessel is proposed. The proposed numerical calculation method is verified by comparing the simulated results with the experimental results obtained from a vessel failure test. To simulate the effects of the arachnoid trabeculae in the vessel preservation process, a simplified geometrical model of the subarachnoid space is introduced and used in conjunction with the proposed method. Simulations show that displacement and retraction velocity are surmised as criteria for successful vessel preservation and they are helpful for the training of neurosurgeons and the improvement of their vessel preservation skills.},

  abstract     = {Transfemoral amputation substantially impairs locomotion. To restore the lost locomotive capability, amputees rely on knee-ankle prostheses. Theoretically, active knee-ankle prostheses may better support natural gait than their passive counterparts by replacing the missing muscle function. The control algorithms of such active devices need to comprehend the user&#39;s locomotive intention and convert them into control commands for actuating the prosthesis. For an active knee-ankle prosthesis, the gait variables to be controlled to allow the desired locomotion could be the knee angle, knee moment, ankle angle, ankle moment. In this paper, a random forest regression model is employed for the continuous prediction of these gait variables for level ground walking at self-selected normal speed. Experimentally obtained thigh kinematics were the input to the random forest model. The proposed method could predict the angles and moments of the knee and ankle with high accuracy (mean $R^{2}$ value of 0.97 for ankle angle, 0.98 for ankle moment, 0.99 for knee angle, 0.95 for knee moment across four able-bodied subjects). The proposed strategy shows potential for continuously controlling an active knee-ankle prosthesis for transfemoral amputees, whose thigh angular motion can be used to infer the required prosthetic moments or angles.},

We present a neurorobotic model for chemotaxis that implements such sensory processing. The model consists of a sensorimotor connection embodied in a simulated Braitenberg vehicle with a dynamic sensory processing variant which extends existing functional models, and the model parameters are tuned via an optimisation algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the vehicle with the contribution of temporal dynamics and optimised parameters is able to localise the odour source in both a simplified odour plume characterised by a steady state Gaussian distribution of odour concentration and a realistic odour plume based on filament-based gas dispersion modelling.},

There is a necessity to establish more controllable mobility for cyborg insects to develop more efficient maneuver plans. Here, this study demonstrates the control of sideways and forward walking in a cyborg beetle by emulating the touch responses of mechanoreceptors on the insect’s elytra using the electrical stimulation. The beetle walked sideways leftward when the right elytron was stimulated, and vice versa. The forward control was attained by stimulating both elytra simultaneously. In addition, these elicited motions were found to be graded by tuning the stimulation frequency as increasing the frequency sped up the sideways walking and slowed down the forward velocity. Besides complementing the controllability of the cutting-edge cyborg insects, this graded response is essential for improving the navigation in cyborg insects for search and rescue missions.},

This paper proposes an optimal approach to the selection of the main components of an actuation system (brushless DC motor and gearbox transmission) to be used in a back-support exoskeleton, but the principles can be extended and applied to other types of exoskeletons. To perform the optimization, an analytical model based on the dynamics of human-robot interaction has been developed. Moreover, to incorporate the weight of the actuator in the optimization framework, a mathematical relation between the weight and technical characteristics of the components, based on the polynomial regression technique using the low-discrepancy sequences method are developed. Consequently, the optimization criteria in terms of the closed-loop system frequency bandwidth, system power consumption and the weight of the components are formulated by imposing technical constraints on simulation parameters. The optimization results demonstrate two possible actuator combinations. Subsequently, the selected actuator components are evaluated in a lifting scenario by means of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller with double integral action. Extensive simulation results in terms of the control frequency bandwidth, torque tracking control, current produced by motors and system robustness with respect to external disturbances are presented and discussed to make comparisons between the possible combinations of the components and their feasibility in the back-support exoskeleton applications.},

We propose a new design for a textilebased actuator, which is made of an inflatable tube folded inside a housing fabric. The direction of the folds is perpendicular to the actuation plane allowing the actuator to exhibit high performance in dealing with heavy weights; it also demonstrates coherent behaviors with a broad set of its geometric parameters. We built a wearable glove that exhibits high performance in holding 9 kg weights. We show that with a larger scale, the bending actuator can hold up to 20 kg. Furthermore, a physical assistive experiment shows a reduction of 50% in electromyography signals reflecting flexor digitorum sublimis muscle activity during 9 kg weight bar grasping and releasing stages. Finally, we propose a variable curvature design, which provides a new perspective for the human-centered design of wearable robots.},

The Interlimb Parallel-link Powered Orthosis (IPPO), a newly developed wearable robot with a compact drive mechanism based on the medial system, forms the subject of this paper. IPPO has 9 active DOFs including a mechanism allowing the simultaneous movement of the stance hip adduction and swing hip abduction using one actuator. Two experiments were conducted for a preliminary proof-of-concept study wherein the standing posture center of pressure was evaluated amidst the lateral sway induced by IPPO. We confirmed that our prototype could assist the lateral movement of the user&#39;s body center of mass. In the performance experiment of walking on a treadmill, the results showed that the arm loading forces and arm muscle activities were reduced when the lateral weight bearing was assisted by IPPO. We conclude that the lateral weight bearing mechanism is feasible and effective for reducing arm loading by assisting the lateral weight bearing during walking.},

  abstract     = {Motor performance deficits are major issues impacting functional activities in older adults. Herein, we used locusts, emergent model organisms for neurodegeneration and motor deficit studies, to investigate the role of cognition as compensation strategy to age-related motor activation deficiency. An animal-robot interaction has been established to evoke antipredator motor responses in locusts. We found a significantly earlier decision making of older adults that displayed their first motor response at a significantly longer distance from the approaching robotic predator, compared to young adults. Although older adult locusts reacted earlier to the approaching robot, performing a wider movement with their hind leg if compared to young adults, older adults obtained a body displacement significantly shorter than the body displacement of younger individuals. The earlier reaction in older adult locusts is probably due to a strategic behavior compensating a slower muscular response that may require a longer time to be performed, and this is consistent with other compensation strategies reported in humans. To the best of our knowledge this research represents a pilot study using ethorobotics to characterize associations between cognitive and motor functions, adding basic information on high-speed sensory-motor activation, that can be exploited to ameliorate motor decline in older adults.},

However, most are based on velocity control and fail to activate the proprioception of the amputee, as they do not provide their user with adequate feedback. A novel control configuration called “Biomechatronic EPP” has been developed to overcome these shortcomings, which is based on the concept of the Extended Physiological Proprioception (EPP), an upper-limb prosthesis proven to be functionally superior to velocity control configurations. The performance of the “Biomechatronic EPP” is compared to that of three other control toplogies including: a “Classic EPP” controller, an “Unconnected” controller and an “EMG” controller. Fourteen able-bodied subjects engaged in a 1-D Fitts&#39; Law style task, designed with the Psychophysics Toolbox, a free set of MATLAB. Performance was evaluated using several measures. Overall, the experimental results show that the performance of “Biomechatronic EPP” is comparable to “Classic EPP” and superior to “Unconnected” and “EMG”. The proposed Biomechatronic EPP control configuration is an alternative to various invasive and non-invasive sensory feedback control integration methods for prosthesis control.},

The ForceArm comprises of PGMs to support four degrees of freedom of the human arm. The suit was evaluated using surface electromyographical (sEMG) signals to identify the muscle unloading effects in the forearm of elderly subjects. Muscle unloading effects were also examined in healthy subjects while performing elbow and shoulder flexion with and without ForceArm. Additionally, the motor ability of the upper extremity of two elderly subjects was evaluated through palm position and velocity data over two months while they participated in a gaming task. One of the subjects performed the task with assistance throughout, while the other subject performed the task without assistance. The results of sEMG data show that, on average, muscle unloading was achieved for all motions (except shoulder flexion) in assisted condition as compared to non-assisted condition in at least one out of four associated muscles. For the gaming task, if we consider the average values of the rates of change of scores (except hand-path ratio score) used to study the trend of the data, the subject who was provided with ForceArm augmentation showed better improvement in performance over time.},

To assist the upper limb in activities of daily livings, we have developed a wearable, portable and hybrid system with multi-degrees of freedom (DOFs). This novel hybrid system combined functional electrical stimulation (FES) with exoskeletons. A two-DOF shoulder exoskeleton, a wearable sleeve with FES electrodes, and a five-DOF hand robotic exoskeleton worked together to facilitate assistance in all of the upper limb joints: shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers. A `divide and rule&#39; strategy was adopted to utilize the relative merits of FES and exoskeletons according to different motion characteristics of upper limb joints. A finite state machine was developed as a high-level controller that issued commands to the real-time embedded controllers. Some functional movements of upper limb could be realised by a sequence of basic movements using the proposed system. The assistance performance of the exoskeleton was evaluated by electromyographic (EMG) signals, and the feasibility of this system was successfully verified by a drinking task.},

  abstract     = {Powered knee exoskeletons aim to assist individuals with lower limb impairments by providing power and torque at the joint level. However, if the anatomical and exoskeleton joints are not perfectly aligned, the exoskeleton assistance may result in spurious forces and torques transferred to the user’s limb. These spurious forces and torques can then generate undesired loads on the user’s joint and shear stress on the user’s skin, causing pain and ultimately undermining the exoskeleton assistance. To address this issue, we propose a novel powered knee exoskeleton with a self-aligning mechanism using a prismatic-revolute-revolute (PRR) configuration. The proposed self-aligning mechanism weighs 190 g (i.e., 5.3% of the total exoskeleton weight) and can transmit up to 120 Nm of torque at the knee joint (i.e., biological peak torque for a 50th percentile male climbing stairs). Our experiments show that during assisted sit-to-stand transfers the peaks of the spurious torques and forces are below 0.5 Nm and 5 N, respectively, even if misalignments are intentionally added between the user and the exoskeleton. This study supports the use of self-aligning mechanisms in powered exoskeletons.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, lower-limb exoskeletons have been marketed to become a possible alternative to wheelchairs for people with walking impairments or paralysis. However, most assistive exoskeletons rely on constraining control strategies based on remote controls or torso tilting events. One approach to build more intuitive control interfaces would be to exploit knowledge on human motor control, and the coordination between upper and lower limb movements during gait events, such as the anticipatory postural adjustments that precede gait initiation. In this study, it was hypothesized that generic trunk and arm movements preceding gait in a free walking setting in able-bodied users can still be retrieved while wearing an assistive lower-limb exoskeleton that constrains their leg movements. This was evaluated on a group of eight unimpaired participants, and analysis of upper-body wearable IMU signals showed similarity of postural adjustments between the free and exoskeleton-constrained settings. Additionally, a classification architecture showed that the walking state of the robot can be correctly triggered based on free-walking data gathered from all participants with an accuracy rate of 95%. This suggests that interlimb coordination still exists in a constrained setting, and could pave the road towards the elaboration of more natural controls for assistive lower-limb exoskeletons.},

  abstract     = {Currently controllers that dynamically modulate functional electrical stimulation (FES) and a powered exoskeleton at the same time during standing-up movements are largely unavailable. In this paper, an optimal shared control of FES and a powered exoskeleton is designed to perform sitting to standing (STS) movements with a hybrid exoskeleton. A hierarchical control design is proposed to overcome the difficulties associated with developing an optimal real-time solution for the highly nonlinear and uncertain STS control model with multiple degrees of freedom. A higher-level robust nonlinear control design is derived to exponentially track a time-invariant desired STS movement profile. Then, a lower-level optimal control allocator is designed to distribute control between FES and the knee electric motors. The allocator uses a person&#39;s muscle fatigue and recovery dynamics to determine an optimal ratio between the FES-elicited knee torque and the exoskeleton assist. Experiments were performed on human participants, two persons without disability and one person with spinal cord injury (SCI), to validate the feedback controller and the optimal torque allocator. The muscles of the participant with SCI did not actively contract to FES, so he was only tested with the powered exoskeleton controller. The experimental results show that the proposed hierarchical control design is a promising method to effect shared control in a hybrid exoskeleton.},

Reductions in knee angle and sEMG activity of the quadriceps are observed. The knee angles, GRFs, spatiotemporal parameters, and compensatory gait patterns are studied for the three impaired participants for treadmill walking. Reductions in the knee angle, hip flexion, step length, and step time are observed. Compensatory gait patterns for the three participants varied for all participants. A timed up-and-go (TUG) test is also performed with the impaired participants during overground walking. A reduced TUG execution time is observed, indicating potential improvement in functional mobility.

Manipulation of suture needles in minimally invasive surgery involves using articulated manual/robotic tools for needle steering and controlling needle-tissue or thread-tissue interactions. The large footprints of conventional articulated surgical tools significantly increase surgical invasiveness, potentially leading to longer recovery times, tissue damage, scarring, or associated infections. Aiming to address these issues, we investigate the feasibility of using magnetic fields to tetherlessly steer suture needles. The primary challenge of such a concept is to provide sufficient force for tissue penetration and ligation. In this work, we demonstrate proof-of-concept capabilities using the MagnetoSuture system, performing tissue penetration and ligation tasks using ex vivo tissues, customized NdFeB suture needles with attached threads, and remote-controlled magnetic fields. To evaluate the system performance, we conducted experiments demonstrating tetherless recreation of a purse string suture pattern, ligation of an excised segment of a rat intestine, and penetration of rat intestines.},

Compared to total kidney removal, partial nephrectomy improves outcomes for patients but is underutilized because it is challenging to accomplish minimally invasively, requiring accurate spatial awareness of unseen subsurface anatomy. Image guidance can enhance spatial awareness by displaying a 3D model of anatomical relationships derived from medical imaging information. It has been qualitatively suggested that the da Vinci robot is well suited to facilitate image guidance through touch-based registration. In this paper we validate and advance this concept toward real-world use in several important ways. First, we contribute the first quantitative accuracy evaluation of touch-based registration with the da Vinci. Next, we demonstrate real-time, touch-based registration and display of medical images for the first time. Lastly, we perform the first experiments validating use of touch-based image guidance to improve a surgeon’s ability to localize subsurface anatomical features in a geometrically realistic phantom.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution real-time intraocular imaging of retina at the cellular level is very challenging due to the vulnerable and confined space within the eyeball as well as the limited availability of appropriate modalities. A probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) system, can be a potential imaging modality for improved diagnosis. The ability to visualize the retina at the cellular level could provide information that may predict surgical outcomes. The adoption of intraocular pCLE scanning is currently limited due to the narrow field of view and the micron-scale range of focus. In the absence of motion compensation, physiological tremors of the surgeons hand and patient movements also contribute to the deterioration of the image quality. Therefore, an image-based hybrid control strategy is proposed to mitigate the above challenges. The proposed hybrid control strategy enables a shared control of the pCLE probe between surgeons and robots to scan the retina precisely, with the absence of hand tremors and with the advantages of an image-based auto-focus algorithm that optimizes the quality of pCLE images. The hybrid control strategy is deployed on two frameworks—cooperative and teleoperated. Better image quality, smoother motion, and reduced workload are all achieved in a statistically significant manner with the hybrid control frameworks.},

  abstract     = {In individuals with motor impairments such as those post-stroke or with cerebral palsy, the function of the knee extensors may be affected during walking, resulting in decreased mobility. We have designed a lightweight, hinge-free wearable robot combining soft textile exosuit components with integrated rigid components, which assists knee extension when needed but is otherwise highly transparent to the wearer. The exosuit can apply a wide range of assistance profiles using a flexible multi-point reference trajectory generator. Additionally, we implemented a controller safety limit to address the risk of hyperextension stemming from the hinge-free design. The exosuit was evaluated on six healthy participants walking uphill and downhill on a treadmill at a 10° slope with a set of joint power-inspired assistance profiles. A comparison of sagittal plane joint angles between no exosuit and exosuit unpowered conditions validated the device transparency. With positive power assistance, we observed reduction in average positive knee biological power during uphill walking (left: 17.5 ± 3.21%, p = 0.005; right: 23.2 ±3.54%, p = 0.008). These initial findings show promise for the assistive capability of the device and its potential to improve the quality of gait and increase mobility in clinical populations.},

Such a complex procedure may greatly benefit from robotic assistance in order to make the intubation safer and more efficient. We developed the first device to provide such assistance, the REALITI, which stands for Robotic Endoscope Automated via Laryngeal Imaging for Tracheal Intubation. This device allies the automated detection of key anatomical features in an endoscopic image to the robotic steering toward the recognized features in the task of guiding the tracheal tube into its correct position. The pre-clinical prototype presented in this paper has been developed to perform in vitro tracheal inbutation on a standard airway management training manikin. We performed a robust detection of anatomical features to steer the endoscope in a visual servoing fashion. Our prototype has been successfully used to perform automated and manual insertions into the trachea of an airway manikin.},

In this work, we will present the SARAS MRS platform validation protocol, framed in order to assess: (i) its technical performances in purely dexterity exercises, and (ii) its functional performances. The results obtained show a prototype able to put the users in the condition of accomplishing the tasks requested (both dexterity- and surgical-related), even with reasonably lower performances respect to the industrial standard. The main aspects on which further improvements are needed result to be the stability of the end effectors, the depth perception and the vision systems, to be enriched with dedicated virtual fixtures.

Many state-of-the-art physics-based shape models are unable to account for complex physical phenomena and subsequently are less accurate than is required for safe surgery. In this work, we present a learned model that can estimate the entire shape of a concentric tube robot. The learned model is based on a deep neural network that is trained using a mixture of simulated and physical data.

  abstract     = {Cleft palate is a congenital defect that affects approximately 1 in 800 births worldwide. A robotic approach for cleft palate repair is desired due to the potential ergonomic, vision and accessibility improvements in the small workspace of the oral cavity. This paper presents a 3 mm, 4-degree-of-freedom instrument for use with the widely available da Vinci system. The pin-jointed wrist design features cable guide channels in place of pulleys, significantly reducing the size of the wrist. Additionally, a novel cam mechanism minimizes any potential cable slack resulting from the lack of pulleys. The accuracy of the novel wrist was found to be 1.4° for motion in the same direction and the slack reducing capability of the cam mechanism was verified. Despite the 11.9° of hysteresis, there was no noticeable impact to teleoperation as the instrument was used to successfully perform suturing with the da Vinci Research Kit. Furthermore, contact between the tools and the oral aperture during surgery is significantly lower for the 3 mm instrument when compared to current 8 mm instruments. In summary, the novel instrument has the potential to better facilitate the adoption of a robotic approach.},

Current training approaches rely heavily on virtual reality simulators, in particular for basic psychomotor and visuomotor skill development. It is not clear, however, whether training in virtual reality is equivalent to inanimate model training. In this manuscript, we seek to compare virtual reality training to inanimate model training, with regard to skill learning and skill transfer. Using a custom-developed needle-driving training task with inanimate and virtual analogs, we investigated the extent to which N=18 participants improved their skill on a given platform post-training, and transferred that skill to the opposite platform. Results indicate that the two approaches are not equivalent, with more salient skill transfer after inanimate training than virtual training. These findings support the claim that training with real physical models is the gold standard, and suggest more inanimate model training be incorporated into training curricula for early psychomotor skill development.},

We present a model and characteristics of this soft actuator. SoPHIA reaches up to 36.3% of elongation with respect to its initial height and up to 7 N of force when pressurized at 38 kPa against anatomically-realistic spatial constraints. Furthermore, we introduce the capabilities of a physical in vivo simulator of biological tissue stiffness and growth, for the evaluation of the soft actuator in physiologically-relevant conditions. Lastly, we propose a model-based multi-stage control of the axial elongation of the actuator according to the tissue&#39;s physiological response. SoPHIA has the potential to reduce the invasiveness of surgical interventions and increase the effectiveness in growing tissue due to its mechanically compliant, configurable and multi-modal design.},

Major limitation of BCI system is that it requires a large number of data to train the system. However, collection of large amount of data from a single subject makes the task tedious for the subject and this will affect the quality of the acquired electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. To cope with this issues, a MsCNN model with transfer learning (MsCNN-TL) technique is proposed in this work for improvement of the P300 based character recognition performance with limited amount of training data. The multi-resolution deep features are extracted from the fully connected layer of the trained MsCNN-TL architecture. These deep features are optimized using Fisher ratio (F-ratio) based feature selection technique and the optimal features are applied to the ensemble of support vector machines (ESVMs) for P300 detection. The proposed method is tested on BCI competition datasets and it achieves better performance compared to the other state-of-the-art techniques for limited training dataset.},

In this study, we compare the recognition of three stimulation sites and their sensitivities to the stimulation applied to the upper and lower arm sites from a mechanotactile stimulation device. Our stimulation device is a crank-based mechanotactile feedback system, which applies a combination of a pressure applied in the normal direction and tangential direction to the skin at the stimulation sites on the lower arm and upper arm. The recognition rate for six grip patterns was found to be not statistically different between the upper and lower sites. Further, through Just Noticeable Difference (JND) measurements, there was no statistical difference between the sensitivities of the upper arm and lower arm at four stimulation sites. This study contributes to the literature from the point of view of identifying the upper arm as the alternative site of mechanotactile feedback for transradial prosthetic hand users in comparison to the lower arm, which is primarily used for EMG electrodes to identify the user&#39;s intention to control their robotic prosthetic hand.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the optimal design and redundancy resolution of a seven DOF robotic two-fingered hand exoskeleton intended for rehabilitation purposes. The exoskeleton is designed to track the human digit motion accurately. As the human digit joint cannot be modeled by single revolute joint due to instantaneously varying center of rotation, a 4-bar mechanism is employed to model each phalanx of a finger. Optimal 4-bar linkages are designed by minimizing the error between the Cartesian trajectories of the human phalanx and those of the coupler points in respective 4-bar mechanisms. It is demonstrated that the designed 4-bar based exoskeleton can track the human digit motion accurately. Performance analysis of the developed device has been carried out by resolving its kinematic redundancy during a fine object translation motion by instantaneously optimizing manipulability measure.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a progressive assist-as-needed (pAAN) controller into our custom-made lower limb exoskeleton system. This control strategy can enhance the active participation of subjects. The controller can dynamically estimate a subject&#39;s input (voluntary joint torque) based on electromyography (EMG) without calibrations. The EMG-torque relationship learning is unsupervised. The zero-error estimation of the subject&#39;s input is guaranteed by a progressive learning strategy. The adaptive controller adjusts the control inputs of motors to complete predefined trajectories. Online torque estimation and adaptive motion control are both realised in the pAAN controller. Additionally, some practical problems of EMG application, caused by time-varying property of EMG signals and electrode displacement, would be avoided. From the simulation and experimental studies, our pAAN controller can predict the subject&#39;s input well, and the exoskeleton helps subjects move precisely. Active participation of subjects is achieved during training.},

  abstract     = {Most transhumeral amputated individuals deplore the lack of functionality of their prosthesis due to control-related limitations. Commercialized prosthetic elbows are controlled via myoelectric signals, yielding complex control schemes when users have to control an entire prosthetic limb. Limited control causes the development of compensatory strategies. An alternative control strategy associates residual limb motions to automatize the prosthetic elbow motion using a model of physiological shoulder/elbow synergies. Preliminary studies have shown that elbow motion could be predicted from residual limb kinematic measurements, but results with transhumeral amputated individuals were lacking. This study focuses on the experimental assessment of automatic prosthetic elbow control during a reaching task, compared to conventional myoelectric control, with six transhumeral amputated individuals, among whom, three had an osseointegrated device. Part of the recruited participants had an osseointegrated prosthetic device. The task was achieved within physiological precision errors with both control modes. Automatic elbow control reduced trunk compensations, and restored a physiologically-like shoulder/elbow movement synchronization. However, the kinematic assessment showed that amputation and prosthesis wear modifies the shoulder movements in comparison with physiological shoulder kinematics. Overall, participants described the automatic elbow control strategy as intuitive, and this work highlights the interest of automatized prosthetic elbow motion.},

  abstract     = {Lower limb exoskeletons provide assistance during the gait cycle using a state variable, one in particular is gait phase. This is crucial for the exoskeleton controller to provide the user accurate assistance. Conventional methods often utilize an event marker to estimate gait phase by computing the average stride time. However, this strategy has limitations in adapting to dynamic speeds. We developed a sensor fusion-based neural network model to estimate the gait phase in real-time that can adapt to dynamic speeds ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 m/s. Ten able-bodied subjects walked with an exoskeleton using our estimator and were provided with corresponding torque assistance. Our best performing model had RMSE below 29 ms and 4% for real-time estimation and torque generation, respectively, reducing the estimation error by 36.0% (p &lt;; 0.01) and torque error by 40.9% (p &lt;; 0.001) compared to conventional methods. Our results indicate that creating a general user-independent model and additionally training on user-specific data outperforms the user-specific model and user-independent model. Our study validates the feasibility of using a sensor fusion-based machine learning model to accurately estimate the user&#39;s gait phase and improve the controllability of a lower limb exoskeleton.},

  abstract     = {In MRI-guided breast intervention, the biopsy procedure is carried out by manually inserting a biopsy gun. However, some lesions are barely accessible with conventional tools, and the imaging process must be repeated multiple times for a better insertion coordinate. In this paper, we present a parallel robot for MRI-guided breast intervention. The robot employs a nonmagnetic, compact design, and has a unique three-link-four-rotational (3-4R) parallel mechanism that can insert the biopsy gun from various angles. The robot is remotely driven by a cable-actuated system and piezo-electric motors. It can be safely operated inside MRI bores with promising biopsy needle targeting accuracy. Comparative experiments are performed to validate the kinematics and to evaluate the performance on repetitive accuracy, structural stiffness, cable tension, and magnetic resonance. The experimental results show that the robot satisfies the operational requirements and can provide effective assistance in clinical breast biopsy.},

  abstract     = {Augmented reality (AR) and robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) are both rapidly evolving technologies in recent years. RAS systems, such as the da Vinci Surgical System, aim to improve surgical precision and dexterity, as well as access to minimally-invasive procedures, while AR provides an advanced interface to enhance user perception. Combining the features of both, AR-integrated RAS has become an appealing concept with increased interest among the academic community. In this paper, we review the existing literature about AR-integrated RAS. We discuss the hardware components, application paradigms and clinical relevance of the literature. The concept of AR-integrated RAS has been shown to be feasible for various procedures. Encouraging preliminary results include reduced sight diversion and improved situation awareness. Special techniques, e.g., activation-on-demand, are taken into consideration to address visual clutter of the AR interface and ensure that the system is fail-safe. Although AR-integrated RAS is not yet mature, we believe that if the current trend of development continues, it will soon demonstrate its clinical value.},
