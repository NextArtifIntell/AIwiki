The transmission dynamics of an epidemic can be described by a simple compartmental model. Specifically, the estimation of epidemic spreading on networks can be achieved by a nonlinear Kalman filter, which is a tool for state estimation of nonlinear systems. In this article, epidemic spreading on networks is described by compartmental models, such as susceptible-infected-susceptible, susceptible-infected-recovered, and susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible models. The dynamics of epidemic spreading on homogeneous networks, including Erdös-Renyi network, Watts-Strogatz network, and Newman-Watts network, are estimated by several nonlinear Kalman filters, including extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter, and third-degree and fifth-degree cubature Kalman filters. The performance comparison in terms of accuracy and stability forms a guideline of utilizing nonlinear Kalman filters for tracking epidemic spreading. The theoretical analysis has been validated through numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose an efficient lattice-based ring signature scheme for message authentication in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). It provides unconditional identity privacy preservation, message authentication, and location privacy for the sender vehicle. The authentication of messages is extremely vital as it gives motivation for vehicles to accept, act, and further transmit messages to other vehicles in the network as well as remain a member of the network. Any unauthorized vehicle cannot transmit fraud messages into the network if messages are authenticated. The public key cryptography-based methods are more relevant for message authentication because of their easy key management and local derivation of keys. However, they add complexity to the whole network and require significant storage and computational power. Also, the predictable mobility characteristics of vehicles moving on the road make them vulnerable to tracking. This requires an additional mechanism to preserve location privacy. The proposed scheme provides unconditional identity privacy and location privacy. It is more efficient than the existing ring signature schemes in case of signature generation and verification process. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides security and unconditional privacy to vehicles in VANETs.},

This article investigates the scheduling of multiple EOSs under the impact of clouds. First, we formulate the presences of clouds as stochastic events, and propose an expectation model. Afterwards, for the first time, a branch-and-price algorithm based on Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition is devised to solve the model optimally and efficiently. In order to obtain initial columns for column generation, a dynamic programming algorithm and a heuristic algorithm are suggested, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of clouds in the case of joint probabilities, and establish a sample average approximation (SAA) model accordingly. With respect to the expectation model, numerical experiment results demonstrate the relative dominance of the proposed branch-and-price algorithm in terms of solution time compared to CPLEX. In addition, the solution of the proposed SAA model is proven to be more robust than that of the expectation model.},

Therefore, the test rig for the FCC, being a complex system itself, needs to be developed in a very short timeframe, starting the specification with many uncertainties about the system under test. This article presents a model-based system engineering (MBSE) methodology for the efficient specification of test rigs for FCCs. A systematic analysis of the prevailing common elements and variability in test rigs is presented. This analysis translates into a generic and reusable specification framework allowing the efficient and effective specification of new test rigs. The proposed MBSE approach covers operational and functional needs analysis and generic logical and physical architecture modeling at two levels of detail. A variant management capability is implemented to manage the different types and configurations of test rigs. This article closes a gap in the literature about test rig specification for modern FCC and contributes to the maturation of MBSE approaches and their practical implementation in the industry context.},

  abstract     = {Emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) techniques, such as phase change memory (PCM), spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM), and resistive random-access memory, are promising for high-performance data process by reserving data in the memory hierarchy. Many persistent memory file systems are tailored to achieve high performance by exploring the advanced features of the NVM and the hardware memory management unit (MMU) in the CPU. However, with the efficient storage device and the hardware acceleration, the write routines in persistent memory file systems pose considerable overhead since repeatedly allocating free blocks and constructing the file mapping structure are time consuming. In this article, we propose a new multigranularity space management scheme (MSMS) to accelerate the write performance. The MSMS employs multigranularity structured blocks whose mapping structure is proactively constructed to slash the overhead of allocating new space and constructing the file mapping structure. Moreover, we present efficiently dedicated space allocation algorithms for different write modes. For append write, we present a file-sizeand buffer-sizebased allocation (FBA) algorithm to efficiently allocate the appropriate blocks. And for copy-on-write, we present an updating data and offset-based allocation algorithm to preferentially allocate structured huge blocks for reducing the overhead of invoking allocation routines. Based on the new design, we have implemented the MSMS for SIMFS in the Linux kernel. Experimental results show that the MSMS significantly reduces the times of invoking allocation routines. The average append write and copy-on-write performance with the MSMS improve by 16.34\% and 7.51\%, respectively.},

The VM maps stakeholder preferences for baskets of capabilities to a single number. The mapping ideally has properties that allow for cost-benefit calculations and quantitative trades. An important and difficult element in building a VM is quantifying uncertainty. Uncertainty may stem from uncertainty in stakeholder prioritization, inexact scoring of alternatives against the VM, and the effects of issues outside the VM. This article presents several methods of quantifying uncertainty in the VM resulting from these sources and assessing the sensitivity of preferred alternative architectures to this uncertainty. We discuss methods focused on value uncertainty related to stakeholder consensus, performance scoring, and stakeholder preference uncertainty. Importantly, we include approaches for modeling the strong correlations that exist between alternatives. The methods are applied to a real case study of satellite constellation architecture, the NOAA Satellite Observing System Architecture study, which contains all of the above-mentioned complexities.},

The proposed prognosis methodology is a hybrid framework composed of a failure parameter estimation unit and an RUL unit. The failure parameter estimation unit observes the failure parameters using distributed neural networks via available measurements of the MFS system. Simultaneously, the remaining useful life is anticipated by the RUL unit employing the estimated failure parameter with a recursive Bayesian algorithm. Moreover, a relative accuracy (RA) measure is invoked to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulink model of the MFS system is verified by experimental data of the LJ200 series aircraft under fight condition.

Weight parameters are assigned to auxiliary variables, which enables control of priority of different redundancy level. The impact of zero injection bus is integrated into the model, as well as the channel limitation of PMUs and existing measurements. Besides, contingency is modeled in a generalized form, which enables N-1 or N-2 contingency analysis.

A key term named maximum decoded level (MDL), which models the transmitting characteristics of WSs under SIC, and thus, lays the foundations for revealing a sufficient and necessary condition for successive transmissions under SIC, is presented in the first step. Then, guided by the theoretical condition that decouples WS scheduling from power allocation, we present a two-step greedy algorithm for the SUS problem in the case of continuous transmit powers. We also prove that the proposed algorithm is optimal for two regular cases. One is for any traffic loads under 2-SIC, the other is for unit traffic load under k-SIC. Furthermore, in the case of discrete transmit powers, we further propose an optimal algorithm under 2-SIC and an approximation algorithm under k-SIC by adapting the above-mentioned greedy algorithm for the case of discrete transmit powers. Experimental evaluations reveal the effectiveness of the three algorithms.},

To address these challenges, we propose a new identity-based anonymous authentication scheme. In this scheme, the master key of the system will not be directly installed in the TPD; hence, it is impossible for an adversary to obtain the system master key from the TPD. To generate the private key of the vehicle, an additional secret is required, and this secret is provided by the roadside unit (RSU). Therefore, revoking a malicious vehicle from the VANETs is efficient, since the RSU only needs to stop generating the up-to-date secret for the vehicle. In addition, the signature verification algorithm of the scheme involves no bilinear pairing operations, making the verification process more efficient. The security of the scheme is proved to be equivalent to the elliptic curve discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle. The experimental results show that the authentication of the scheme is more efficient, and the communication cost has been diminished.},

Specifically, this article proposes a deep reinforcement learning model for demand response where the virtual agent learns the task like humans learns a task. The agent gets feedback for every action it takes in the environment; these feedbacks will drive the agent to learn about the environment and take much smarter steps later in its learning stages. The proposed approach outperformed the state of the art mixed integer linear programming for load peak reduction. Other key contribution is the design of an agent to minimize both consumer electricity bills and system peak load demand simultaneously. The proposed model was analyzed with loads from five different residential consumers; the method increases the monthly savings of each consumer by reducing their electricity bill drastically along with minimizing the peak load of the grid.},

Operation in islanded mode is one of the unique features of microgrids that can provide numerous benefits for both consumers and energy producers. Unlike the conventional distribution networks, reconfigurable microgrids enable the reconfiguration process to achieve optimal structure. In this article, a new optimal strategy for scheduling of reconfigurable microgrids considering islanding capability constraints is presented. To demonstrate the successful islanding operation, the islanding capability is considered as a probability of islanding operation (PIO) index which shows the probability, that the microgrid has adequate level of spinning reserve to meet the local load. Taking into account the forecast errors of generated power by renewable energy resources (PV and wind) as well as load demand, the 13-interval approximation is used for the simplification of nonlinearity of PIO. The scheduling of reconfigurable microgrid with islanding operation constraints is formulated as a chance-constrained goal optimization problem, where the objective is defined as minimizing the total operation cost of microgrid in terms of fuel cost, reliability cost, cost of purchasing power from the mains, and switching cost. The proposed method is implemented on a 10-bus radial reconfigurable microgrid test system with photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines, battery, and microturbines, with different levels of PIO. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling method.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have attracted intense attention due to their potential applications in many areas. However, the strong reliance on communication networks makes CPSs vulnerable to intentional cyberattacks. Therefore, a great number of attack detection methods have been proposed to enforce security of CPSs. In this article, various false data injection attack detection methods presented for CPSs are investigated and reviewed. According to the knowledge of control information, the controllers of CPSs are categorized as centralized and distributed controllers. Existing centralized attack detection approaches are discussed in terms of i) linear time-invariant systems, ii) actuator and sensor attacks, iii) nonlinear systems, and iv) systems with noise. Furthermore, the development of distributed attack detection is reviewed according to different decoupling methods. Some challenges and future research directions in the context of attack detection approaches are provided.},

The latter can potentially provide people with convenience and high-quality healthcare. However, how to protect the confidentiality and privacy of user data remains challenging. Although a number of schemes using cryptographic tools in WBANs have been proposed, they are not practical due to the low computing power and storage capabilities of the sensors. To remedy this shortcoming, in this article, we propose an efficient obfuscation for encrypted identity-based signatures in WBANs, which can securely and efficiently use the resources of mobile devices to sign and encrypt data collected by sensors. In particular, our proposed scheme employs the identity-based signature scheme in the IEEE P1363 standard. We prove the security of our scheme, and that it satisfies the virtual black box properties. Moreover, we implement our scheme using the Java pairing-based cryptography library on a laptop and an Android phone. The experimental results the utility of our scheme in WBANs.},

A unified approach to the application of these technologies does not appear to have occurred in this domain. A conceptual information theoretic framework for identifying appropriate technologies to support influence and other cyber operations is presented. It provides a holistic framework for making planning decisions about the development and employment of technology capabilities independent of specific detailed operational requirements, while allowing assessments of risk, cost, and effectiveness to be considered in the process. The framework defines the data, information needs, and acquisition process in the context of specific technology insertion point data, information, or knowledge requirements and services to facilitate execution of an operation. The framework allows for identification, down-selection, and prioritization of specific shared technologies that support multiple phases of the decision process and stages of an operation.

  abstract     = {Radio frequency (RF) chain circuits play a major role in digital receiver architectures, allowing passband communication signals to be processed in baseband. When operating at high frequencies, these circuits tend to be costly. This increased cost imposes a major limitation on future multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication technologies. A common approach to mitigate the increased cost is to utilize hybrid architectures, in which the received signal is combined in analog into a lower dimension, thus reducing the number of RF chains. In this article we study the design and hardware implementation of hybrid architectures via minimizing channel estimation error. We first derive the optimal solution for complex-gain combiners and propose an alternating optimization algorithm for phase-shifter combiners. We then present a hardware prototype implementing analog combining for RF chain reduction. The prototype consists of a specially designed configurable combining board as well as a dedicated experimental setup. Our hardware prototype allows us evaluating the effect of analog combining in MIMO systems using actual communication signals. The experimental study, which focuses on channel estimation accuracy in MIMO channels, demonstrates that using the proposed prototype, the achievable channel estimation performance is within a small gap in a statistical sense from that obtained using a costly receiver in which each antenna is connected to a dedicated RF chain.},

Also, we present closed-form expression for the tile normalized signal-to-noise ratio (nSNR) for the OTFDM scheme and the existing relationship with its counterpart for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme. Besides, we demonstrate that OFDM and single carrier-cyclic prefix schemes are particular cases of the OTFDM scheme, showing the flexibility of OTFDM for handling distinct scenarios. Numerical analyses show that OTFDM outperforms OFDM in terms of computational complexity reduction and data rate loss when a resource allocation technique applies. Both schemes attain a similar symbol error ratio under the impulsive noise presence. Finally, OTFDM offers a lower peak-to-average power ratio than OFDM.},

In this article, EE is studied for the downlink multiple-input single-output OFDMA-based user-relay assisted cellular networks. EE maximization is formulated for the decode and forward relaying scheme with the consideration of both transmit and circuit power consumption as well as the data rate requirements for the mobile users. The quality of service constrained EE maximization, which is defined for multicarrier, multiuser, multirelay, and multiantenna networks, is a nonconvex and combinatorial problem so it is hard to tackle. To solve this difficult problem, a radio resource management algorithm that solves the subcarrier allocation, mode selection, and power allocation separately is proposed. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by numerical results for different system parameters.},

  abstract     = {Increasing the number of active consumers in distribution networks necessitates transforming the current control, monitoring, and protection schemes. However, on one hand, installing high-frequency measurement devices and fast communication platforms in low-voltage (LV) distribution networks is not cost effective and scalable. On the other hand, the fault detection approaches, which can provide acceptable accuracy by relying only on low-frequency measured data (with 1-30-min sampling rates), are not developed yet. Currently, the overcurrent fault detectors work mainly based on fixed current thresholds, which makes them inefficient in a system with high-distributed-energy resources. This is due to high volatility and uncertainty in the measured profile of the current. In this article, a data-driven fault detection framework with dynamic fault current thresholds is proposed. The motivation here is to develop a framework that can locally detect and isolate faults within the LV distribution networks without requiring high-frequency sampling meters. The proposed model is based on quantile regression as a statistical method to generate the quantiles of distributions of the current measurements. Two different fault current thresholds are formulated for instantaneous and definite time fault detection schemes. The thresholds are dynamically predicted for each next time step. The proposed framework is evaluated using data from a real distribution network with 169 houses. The results suggest that the proposed model is very promising for LV residential distribution networks.},

However, at present, existing approaches are only applied to solve small-scale many-objective VRPSDPTW. For the large-scale problem, to obtain high-quality solutions (effectively) and solve the problem in a short running time (efficiently), we focus on two issues: 1) how to handle many-objective property and 2) how to tackle large-scale property of the problem. For the first issue, to enhance the convergence property, a novel local search algorithm utilizing seven neighborhood operators is proposed. Meanwhile, to maintain the diversity property, the concept of decomposition is adopted. The problem is first decomposed into multiple single-objective problems, then local search is utilized to optimize these subproblems. For the second issue, since optimizing a subproblem by local search is time consuming for large-scale problems, the key point is how to allocate the computational resources and balance the convergence and diversity. To handle this problem, a weight space partition strategy is introduced. Finally, a decomposition-based local search algorithm is proposed for many-objective VRPSDPTW. Experimental results on the large-scale instances provided by Chinese logistic company show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Therefore, we propose a priority-based access class barring (PACB) scheme, in which MTC devices are divided into multiple classes according to their delay requirements, and a different access class barring (ACB) factor is used for each class. This article suggests an approach to choose multiple ACB factors that can maximize the number of successful access events and can also guarantee the low delay requirement of the high-priority class. Then, an analytical model is proposed for the ideal case, and throughput, drop probability, and access delay are derived to evaluate the performance. For a realistic environment, we also suggest an estimation algorithm for the PACB scheme, in which a base station estimates the number of active devices for each class. Numerical and simulation results showed that the analytical model is consistent with the simulation results. Additionally, the performance of the estimation algorithm was similar to that of the ideal case. Furthermore, the proposed PACB scheme can decrease the delay of a high-priority class and improve the throughput and drop probability compared to existing algorithms.},

These attacks result into modification, controlling, accessing, and altering private and public information of transport depots and their communicating agents. In this article, we have proposed a novel agent pseudonymous authentication with a conditional privacy preservation scheme in a metropolitan area. The proposed scheme utilizes identity-based encryption and a Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signature scheme for authentication, pseudonyms based for privacy preservation, and public key cryptography for pseudonyms generation. It achieves privacy preservation of depot&#39;s information. The primary objective of the proposed scheme is to protect privacy of communicating agents of transport depots during exchange of information (such as surplus and deficit vehicles and vehicles dispatch allocation and revocation). The proposed scheme is capable of avoiding the presence of impersonate genuine and malicious agents at transport depot. The proposed scheme uses an emergent intelligence technique for collecting, sharing, and analyzing transportation information. In addition, it also takes dynamic decisions for protecting privacy of transport depot&#39;s communicating agents. In this article, first, formal security proofs of the proposed scheme has been carried out using ProVerif tool, and second, Crypto++ package is used for the experimental and performance analysis. The experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme efficiently preserves privacy of transport depots&#39; communicating agents.},

Two main types of DR programs, namely peak clipping and load shifting DR programs, are considered in the proposed methodology. In the peak clipping DR programs, LMP is calculated for each bus of the MMG. Then, the candidate loads, selected to be curtailed by the market mechanism, are paid based on the LMP values. In load shifting DR programs, the loads are paid for decreasing their amount of active power at peak hours. In this approach, the decreased active and reactive powers are shifted to off-peak times. The optimization method is formulated as nonlinear programing in GAMS software and simulated on a 55-bus MMG test system. The results of the proposed method are compared with the existing methods and the outcomes confirm that superior results in cost function are obtained using the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In this article, considering the performance limitations of the sensors used in real missions, the cooperative dynamic fuzzy perimeter surveillance (CDFPS) problem and its fluid-based solution framework are proposed for the first time. First, the two-dimensional concentration diffusion distribution function is used to imitate an irregular dynamic perimeter. Then, according to the onboard sensor resolution ratio, a fuzzification process is applied for the perimeter area. On this basis, the detected fuzzy perimeter area is modeled with virtual obstacles (VOs). Considering an obstacle set composed of VOs, fixed obstacles and agents, we transform the CDFPS problem into a unified obstacle avoidance problem for the first time and a fluid-based path planning method is designed based on restrained interfered fluid dynamical system and Lyapunov guidance vector field. To quantify the surveillance effect, two indexes for the CDFPS problem are proposed: the perimeter neutrality index and the phase angle uniformity index. Around these proposed indexes, the attractive/repulsive effects and the multiagent cooperative mechanism are constructed. Finally, the receding horizon control is introduced to further improve the surveillance effect. Simulations show that the proposed framework can drive agents to persistently track the perimeter and establish relatively stable phase angle offsets between adjacent agents.},

  abstract     = {Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) promises higher throughput than the conventional orthogonal access by multiplexing the signal of a weak user with that of a strong one. Identifying the right combination of users with an appropriate assignment of power appears to be the bottleneck in achieving optimal throughput in NOMA-driven systems. Despite the large volume of literature, it is still not well understood how the task of joint user selection and power allocation (PA) can be efficiently performed in multiband NOMA systems in the presence of a large number of users&#39;. To address this task, we propose a variable PA (VPA) scheme across sub-bands and evaluate its performance. Contrary to previous studies, we find that the proposed VPA scheme significantly outperforms the previously known schemes when the number of users and variation in their associated signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) are large. Our investigation also helps to visualize how the system throughput, the average number of selected users, and the system fairness change as functions of system parameters like SINRs and the number of system users.},

We believe that Open IoT, where devices are shared by multiple services, will be common in the future. However, constructing cyber-physical systems (CPS) by using shared devices has challenges. Since there are many combinations of devices and software in the network, designing and testing systems cannot be done manually as with current CPS. The system model and technologies suitable for Open IoT are necessary. In this article, we propose a new concept of CPS. It is “Ephemeral-Cyber-Physical System (E-CPS),” which is temporarily constructed by combining devices in the network similar to an instance of cloud computing. Also, we propose a method of actuator control optimization for automatically constructing E-CPS by using nonconfigured devices connected to the network. This method will significantly contribute to not only E-CPS but also quick and inexpensive provision of conventional CPS. Experiments with a simulator, and with lighting devices and cameras confirmed that the method can automatically optimize the actuator control value and it enables satisfying the service requirements at a low cost.},

Using the superimposed component of MSTCT, a new directional element is defined to address the second challenge. The developed strategy relies on an intelligent electronic device in each feeder, making it a cost-effective scheme. The proposed scheme is effective for all types of fault and can differentiate normal switching events from the fault conditions. Also, it properly operates in the presence of nonlinear loads and measurement noises.

  abstract     = {Potential challenge during a disaster is the wide range of disturbance caused to the power system network. The article attempts to develop a systematic procedure to progressively restore the network by recognizing the alive network. During disaster there is manpower shortage and poor road connectivity around the affected area. Hence, an autonomous priority-based restoration policy is required for critical load restoration. The main idea of the proposed article is to develop an autonomous system, which is decision-based restoration system by identifying the network component still available after disaster followed by reconfiguration confirming the proposed load pickup procedure. Because of the inherent capability of implementing the condition-based state transition of switches and parallel processing, a petri net (PN) based methodology has been used in the article to integrate alive parts, which further assists in identifying the best switching schedule of circuit breakers for autonomous load restoration. The primary contribution of the article is to develop an encapsulated algorithm using PN as a modeling platform of components as well as empowering the same by introducing the game-theory-based concept in the formulation of different microgrids integrated with distributed generators during extreme weather events. The verification of effective autonomous restoration is then realized by using the available delivery capability and design verification of the framed microgrids, and the comparison with different restoration strategies adopted by other authors. The studies are carried out with the IEEE 34, 37, and 123-bus feeder test systems for implementation and validation of the proposed article along with the comparison with other published works.},

The interviews led to insights about the role of heuristics within a design team and how documenting those heuristics can be of value to the team. The heuristics generated allowed for an overview of how designers at JPL perceived their own process heuristics. It was found that most heuristics were comprised a single, positively framed step to be carried out within the team, not just by an individual. Participants were also able to produce mainly informal actions they take, rather than formalized textbook approaches to design. It is hypothesized that the process heuristics generated are universal enough to be transferred out of the mission design domain and into another, if desired.},

The robust precoding problem is nonconvex and thus hard to solve. To overcome this difficulty, we first separate the logarithm function and the precoders in the objective function, then employ the sign-definiteness lemma to eliminate the channel uncertainties, and finally develop an effective iterative optimization algorithm to compute the precoders.

Physical layer defenses for mmWave systems have raised lots of attentions recently, yet the practicality of these designs remains in question. In this article, we perform extensive experiments using commercial testbed and investigate practical secure transmission schemes for mmWave communication systems. We provide the first empirical results that demonstrate the severity of sidelobe eavesdropping in mmWave systems. We show that eavesdropping attacks on mmWave links are highly effective in both indoor and outdoor settings. We then analyze the practicality and vulnerability of existing defenses. We find that existing defenses either impose impractical hardware requirements, or remain vulnerable against multiple colluding eavesdroppers. Finally, we propose the artificial noise hopping (ANH), a practical secure transmission scheme that introduces minimal hardware complexity in hybrid beamforming. Our approach does not need symbol-level beam steering, and we only require two radio frequency chains. From both experimental and simulation results, we show that ANH can effectively reduce the hardware cost while maintaining comparable level of security with traditional hybrid beamforming schemes.},

The quest for this configuration is often based on optimization processes that use the net present value as the evaluation function. Determining quantity, location, type, and trajectory of wells in a reservoir is a complex optimization problem, which has a high computational cost due to the continuous use of simulators. Many researchers have proposed the replacement of the reservoir simulator by a proxy, to reduce the computational cost, with promising results. However, in order to analyze all relevant variables and obtain a better solution, a comprehensive proxy model must also consider the conditions of the surface behavior, incorporating the complete integrated system. None of the previous works has developed a model based on the integrated simulation behavior. This article presents the proposal of a new proxy model based on neural networks, called SimProxy, which integrates reservoir and surface behavior, to reduce the computational cost of a decision support system. The proposed model was evaluated in a real oil reservoir. The results indicate that SimProxy can efficiently replace the use of commercial simulators in an optimization process, providing good accuracy with a substantial decrease in computational cost.},

Partial centralization can be also an option by employing network function splitting and keeping lower physical layer functions colocated with the RUs. This increases the power consumption but relaxes the high capacity requirement in the front haul. It is not intuitive which migration strategy is more cost effective. In this article, we formulate a pool placement optimization problem as an integer linear programming (ILP), which minimizes the total cost of ownership (TCO), and evaluate the migration cost to C-RAN with both full centralization of network functions, and partial centralization by using function splitting. We define a network upgrade optimization problem, by adding new cells to the network, as a revisited version of the original optimization problem to evaluate the upgradability of the architectures. We solve the problem with both ILP for optimality, and genetic algorithm for scalability. Simulation results show that partial centralization results in optimal TCO with lower crossover time compared to C-RAN with full centralization.},

This means that a particular flow may trigger the flow setup procedure multiple times, if the traversed switches are under different controller domains.

  abstract     = {The objective of this article is to develop a control mechanism that can suppress the ongoing transient instability in a power system through the continuous delivery of corrective actions. The continuous delivery of corrective actions basically refers to performing multiple adjustments in series until the transient instability is completely healed. The motivation behind the particular work arises from the observation that exercising the corrective action merely once may not always be sufficient to restore the stability of the system. In order to enable the continuous delivery of corrective actions, a macrolevel dynamic assessment approach is taken instead of the conventional and microlevel static coherency assessment. The macrolevel coherency assessment is to be carried out based upon real-time snapshots of system quantities for the on-spot identification of generator groups that have grossly lost synchronism with one another. A complete transient instability mitigation program is developed with due application of the macrocoherency assessment in delivering continuous corrective actions. In order to ensure almost instantaneous computation of coherent generator groups, a novel clustering algorithm is also developed. Corrective actions are delivered in the form of generator rejection and load curtailment. Extensive verification of the proposed methodology is carried out by means of real-time software-in-loop simulations.},

  abstract     = {The real vehicle motion signals cannot be applied for the simulation-based motion platforms (SBMPs) due to the restricted workspace of the SBMPs. The motion cueing algorithms (MCAs) have been used to regenerate the same motion feeling of the real vehicle with consideration of the SBMP&#39;s limited workspace. The idea of the model predictive control (MPC) is used recently to find the optimal value of the input signal with consideration of the SBMPs&#39; limitations. The hexarot manipulator is developed as a mid-sized SBMP with high capability of generating the angular displacement compared to hexapod SBMP. It is the first time that hexarot manipulator is employed as an SBMP with controller unit due to its high workspace limitation, especially in roll angle. In addition, the main contribution of this research is to design and develop a fuzzy incremental controller to configurate the hexarot SBMP using MPC-based MCA to improve the motion feeling of the high-frequency signals compared with the traditional PID controller. The proposed method is verified using MATLAB software. Finally, the results demonstrate the right follow of the motion signals using MPC-based MCA, which is not possible using the common hexapod manipulators.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a microservice-based architecture for an energy management system (MS-EMS) to address the fragility, poor flexibility, and hardware dependence of EMSs. Compared with the service-oriented architecture (SOA), the proposed architecture can significantly improve the load performance and scalability of an EMS through fine-grained decomposition of the system and decentralized data management. Container and cluster technologies are used to manage the microservices. A k-fault (k ≥ 2)-tolerant model is proposed to improve the reliability of the MS-EMS. The model employs containerized microservices as essential components to achieve a parallel connection of the essential components using the horizontal-scale technology of the containers. On the other hand, a MILP model-based algorithm for managing computing resources is also suggested. By minimizing the number of worker nodes of the cluster, where the MS-EMS is deployed, we can improve the utilization of the computing resources and avoid unnecessary costs. The result of the performance analysis showed that the reliability of the MS-EMS is 99.99965625\%, which is two orders and one order of magnitude higher than those of the existing EMSs and the SOA-based EMS (S-EMS), respectively. Moreover, the cost of the MS-EMS is also lower than those of the existing EMSs and S-EMSs. The proposed architecture is implemented in a realpower system and has shown favorable operation performances, indicating a promising prospect for future applications.},

  abstract     = {The intermittency of renewable energy makes the control of islanded microgrids more difficult than that of the grid-connected mode. In conventional methods, the controller is designed to regulate the system frequency and voltage only based on the droop control theory. Consequently, the system frequency and voltage regulation are mostly provided by the fast response distributed generators (DGs), e.g., energy storage systems. This controller design will reduce the availability of DGs with lower droop gains for future dispatches. The main novelty of this article relies on proposing an intelligent power sharing (IPS) approach to regulate the system frequency and voltage based on DGs&#39; operating power capabilities and their droop control gains. The communication infrastructure is involved in the proposed IPS to diminish the dependence on fast response DGs. Moreover, the IPS is equipped with an adaptive virtual impedance to reduce the impact of coupling between the active and reactive power on the voltage regulation. The performance of the controller is evaluated through different simulation studies based on a 14-bus CIGRE test system. Time-domain simulations prove the effectiveness of the IPS approach in achieving acceptable frequency and voltage regulation along with high-power sharing accuracy. Also, a small-perturbation stability analysis is developed to study the IPS control robustness under different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs) have gradually become a new class of effective ways to satisfy the requirements of a higher capacity and stronger connection in the future communications. In contrast with terrestrial networks, the fast periodic motion of satellites results in the dynamic time-varying features of STIN, which further leads to frequent changes in the connectivity of satellite-terrestrial links and the backhaul capacities of satellite networks. To balance the accessible capacity of STIN under the intermittent connectivity and dynamic backhaul capacity, an effective user association mechanism is needed. In this article, a dynamic user association (DUA) mechanism with task classification is proposed to meet the requirements of load balancing and the user task processing. First, a STIN model is constructed with low earth orbit satellites and the three types of base station, which are a macro base station, small cell base station, and low earth orbit based base station. After that, the optimization problem is formulated via jointly considering the task classification, the load condition of base stations, and the backhaul capacity of low earth orbit based base stations. Then, the DUA mechanism is proposed to find the most suitable base station serving each user. In DUA, a dynamic cell range extension algorithm is developed to adjust the load of STIN in terms of the resilient backhaul capacity, and a greedy-based user-centric user association with task classification algorithm is proposed to find the base station, which has the maximum rate and minimum load for each user and to meet the requirements of user task processing. The simulation results show that the proposed DUA can enhance the load balance and guarantee the task processing demand of STIN compared with the reference signal receiving power association and the max-sum rate association algorithms.},

In this article, the fairness of OIA system is measured in terms of the delay of the most unfortunate user, which has the maximal transmission delay. Based on whether base station (BS) cooperation is allowed or not, two fair OIA algorithms are proposed. Assuming S users are served per cell per time slot, in the first scheme, BS cooperation is utilized to design the useful signal spaces, by which W(&lt;; S) unserved users can be properly selected to enhance the fairness performance. To provide low latency services, the users with low latency requirements are regarded as unserved users and will be selected with priority. The second scheme improves the system fairness by increasing the probability of selecting unserved users. In addition, for the first time in this article, closed-form expressions are derived to facilitate the fairness performance evaluation for various OIA systems by applying the theories of Markov chains. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the analytical results and show that compared with conventional OIA algorithms, the proposed algorithms can achieve better fairness performance with comparable sum-rate performance.},

To mitigate this problem, moving more blocks from the CU to the DU has been considered. One of the split options for the uplink is to deliver data and pilot symbols separately from a DU to a CU. For more efficiency in the fronthaul, the compression of data and pilot symbols has been adopted. As an objective of optimization, both the maximization of the uplink user rate and minimization of the fronthaul rate are considered. The optimization of the transmit powers and distortion variances of data and pilot symbols is considered. The closed-form expressions of the optimal variances of the data and pilot signal distortions with fixed data and pilot power are derived. Additionally, the optimal power allocation between the data and pilot signals are obtained when the data and pilot distortion variances caused by compression are fixed.

This article proposes a multistep forecasting approach, mainly based on phase space reconstruction and support vector machine (SVM) methods, to solve these two problems. The relations between the forecasting step in the future and the historical data points that need to be fed into the SVM model are derived, which endue the model with the real ability to forecast adjustable steps of future load without the divergence of error and, therefore, have a notable engineering application significance. The proposed methodology is implemented on the European Network on Intelligent Technologies dataset. Compared with previous methods, the results show that the multistep implemented model is of more accurate prediction and stronger robustness. Moreover, the method is easy to implement and able to be combined with other intelligent methods to get better performance.},

A set of strategically located nodes acting as cluster heads (CHs) transfer energy to the wireless sensors within range, forming a cluster. The sensors use this energy to transmit data to the CHs, which, in turn, deliver the information to a base station (BS) using nonorthogonal multiple access. The BS processes the collected information and synchronizes the operation of all CHs. Furthermore, there exist two adversaries, namely, a jamming attacker and an eavesdropper, who cooperate to attack the considered system. To protect against this attack, the CHs should be controlled by suitable power allocation coefficients obtained from the security constraints of the CHs. Using these constraints, closed-form expressions are derived to find the power allocation coefficients that will enable reliable and secure communication. In addition, we propose an interference channel selection policy for the sensor-to-CHs links and CHs-to-BS links to improve the reliability of communication while enhancing energy utilization. Finally, an algorithm for finding the optimal EH time is also proposed.},

Barrier hole repairing is necessary to effectively extend the lifetime of barrier coverage in directional sensor networks (DSNs). This article studies the design of effective barrier-hole-repairing scheme for DSNs. Specifically, it first presents the important concept of the repairing region (RepR), inside which the mobile nodes located can repair the hole only by rotating their sensing directions. Then it analyzes the movement and rotation energy consumption of different types of candidate repairing nodes which are not in the barrier. Finally, based on the above analysis, it proposes an effective scheme to schedule an optimal node to repair the barrier hole with the minimum energy consumption, fully exploiting residual resources (unused nodes and power) to increase network service time. Simulation results show that, compared to other barrier-hole-repairing schemes, our scheme could greatly prolong the lifetime of barrier coverage.},

  abstract     = {Paradigms such as multiantenna transceivers, spectrum sharing, and beamforming are critical to meet the desired throughput, reliability, latency, spectrum, and energy efficiency constraints in next-generation wireless networks. To enable these paradigms, base stations are undergoing major overhaul with complex digital signal processing, reconfigurable multistage architectures, as well as wideband sensing capability. In this article, we focus on the low-complexity multiantenna BS receiver to accomplish ultrawideband angular sensing. The proposed receiver is based on novel reconfigurable and intelligent sub-Nyquist sampling architecture. Here, reconfigurability allows the receiver to select and digitize noncontiguous frequency bands, while online learning-based intelligence allows the receiver to learn spectrum statistics and choose the frequency bands for sensing in order to maximize the throughput. Unlike the existing approaches, we show that the proposed approach does not need any prior knowledge of spectrum statistics. The efficacy of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art approaches is validated via hardware complexity as well as simulation results. We show that the proposed approach offers lower hardware complexity and achieves up to 23\% lower estimation error than existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {People flow counting is to count the number of people passing through a passage or a gate. Conventional vision-based approaches require line-of-sight (LoS) and impose privacy concerns, while most radio-based approaches require dedicated equipment and incur high cost. In this article, we propose to exploit commodity WiFi to count the number of people of continuous flows in a device-free way, requiring one pair of WiFi transmitter and receiver. Leveraging the Doppler effect induced by human passing, the proposed method, named WiFlowCount, first constructs the spectrogram of Doppler shifts from channel state information. Based on the spectrogram, WiFlowCount detects the people flows and the subflows according to the power distribution in the spectrogram. An optimal rotation and segmentation algorithm is proposed to segment the spectrogram of a continuous flow into the subspectrograms of its subflows. The number of people in each subflow is estimated from its subspectrogram via convolutional neural networks, which add up to the total people count in the continuous flow. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method WiFlowCount, able to detect people flows and subflows accurately and count the number of people in continuous flows with high accuracy, outperforming the existing work.},

  abstract     = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems are well known as one of the most significant sources of distributed generations in the world. Nowadays, the usage of small-scale PVs by households in residential homes has increased noticeably. The output power of PVs is associated with uncertainty, so there is a need for a practicable method to forecast the output power that can be used by households. The current article presents a feasible method to predict the power of small-scale PVs in a day-ahead pattern. This applicable model does not have the complexities of other forecasting methods and can be applied by households in general. On the other hand, power produced by PVs depends on meteorological characteristics. Meanwhile, one important point to be noted is the fact that in many models the dependency of the PVs output power on meteorological characteristics is taken into account, but the correlation among these meteorological features is neglected. Therefore, in this article, the copula is used in order to model stochastic correlation structure among meteorological characteristics, such as ambient temperature, wind speed, and solar irradiance. Subsequently, by using a mathematical model for obtaining the output power of the PVs in parallel with utilizing the Monte Carlo method the prediction is performed. Here, to study the proposed method, a PV unit of a residential home in Swanson region in New Zealand is considered. The simulation results demonstrated high accuracy of the proposed method in diverse meteorological conditions.},

Such a security issue arises when electric power circuits, which are used for data communication, are constituted of unshielded power cables. This kind of investigation offers the direction for dealing with the PLS aspects of broadband in-home PLC systems. A data set of channel estimates and additive noises obtained from a measurement campaign carried out in several houses is used for providing practical results. The attained results show high values of the secrecy outage probability for all chosen values of the target secrecy rate and the total transmission power when the PLC devices are around 6 m away from each other and the eavesdropper is less than 2 m away from the PLC transmitter. Overall, the numerical results show that the vulnerability of broadband in-home PLC systems, in terms of PLS, may be relevant. Therefore, a rethinking of the use of unshielded power cables or new designs of broadband in-home PLC systems deserves special attention for ensuring PLS.},

  abstract     = {Currently, in the literature, the slow responding device like on-load tap changer transformer (OLTC) is better operated by introducing the time delay in the operation of fast-acting converters. Although the literature also indicates an improvement in the transient condition, it keeps the converters idle during the waiting period. Henceforth, there is a lot of scope for improving the reactive power reserve. In this article, we propose a coordinated voltage control (CVC) scheme that employs a unique approach where the converters are allowed to absorb reactive power (of a specific voltage range from the grid) during the waiting period. A modified IEEE 33-bus distribution system is modeled in the real-time digital simulator platform and the simulation results are compared with the existing and without CVC schemes. The simulation results justify the effectiveness of the proposed CVC scheme in terms of improving the reactive power reserve and voltage profile up to 100\%/164\% and 0.0093 pu/0.014 pu against existing/without CVC scheme, respectively. Furthermore, the postfault voltage recovery time in the case of proposed CVC is decreased by 20 ms/28 ms with respect to the existing/without CVC schemes. These results imply that the proposed CVC scheme performs better in all the operating conditions of the grid.},

Among others, there are two significant challenges in this area: the need for models that can characterize a realistic system in the absence of an implementation and an automated way to associate attack vector information, that is, historical data, to such system models. We propose the cybersecurity body of knowledge (CYBOK), which takes in sufficiently characteristic models of systems and acts as a search engine for potential attack vectors. CYBOK is fundamentally an algorithmic approach to vulnerability exploration, which is a significant extension to the body of knowledge it builds upon. By using CYBOK, security analysts and system designers can work together to assess the overall security posture of systems early in their lifecycle, during major design decisions and before final product designs, consequently, assisting in applying security earlier and throughout the systems lifecycle.},

Various patterns of internetwork connections among gateway nodes are studied. The implications of internetwork connections on data manipulation due to security breach by attackers are investigated by modeling the internetwork connections as a noisy communication channel. Specifically, the fundamental limit of the maximum achievable capacity afforded by internetwork connections is characterized, while considering the impact of security vulnerabilities that the internetwork connections introduce. For a nominal data-rate below the fundamental limit, the effect of security breach can be diminished to an arbitrarily low level by channel coding. Notably, any nominal data-rate above the fundamental limit is not achievable; hence, a packet-loss distortion is introduced to keep the data-rate below the fundamental limit. Moreover, the fundamental limit is used to find the optimal number of internetwork connections between two networks under prescribed data-rate and packet-loss distortion constraints.},

By utilizing the maximum ratio combining/maximum ratio transmission processing, the approximate achievable rates of uplink and downlink with imperfect channel state information environments are presented. Then, the effects of the loop interference (LI), quantization error, and interuser interference (IUI) are evaluated based on the derived rates. According to the derived results, we find that interference and noise can be wiped out by using proper power scaling law, more antennas and bigger Rician factor. The numerical results show that deploying more base station antennas can effectively eliminate the LI, IUI, and noise caused by the FD mode. We also find that the approximate achievable rates of uplink and downlink will converge to a constant as the number of quantized bits tends to infinity. Moreover, performance of an FD large-scale MIMO system is found in close relationship with the quantization bits number, which, however, is insignificant when the ADCs/DACs quantization bits are increased. Thus, the use of low-resolution ADCs/DACs is verified sufficient in a large-scale MIMO system.},

The uncertainties in the generated power, due to the variability of wind speed or solar radiation and the improper charging and discharging of the batteries, greatly affects the proper operation as well as the reliability of these power systems. Due to their huge cost and safety-critical nature, the reliability analysis using traditional simulation tools, which are mainly based on Monte Carlo approach, may not be an appropriate choice. In this article, we propose to use higher order logic theorem proving to conduct an accurate reliability analysis of the power systems consisting of conventional generators, the renewable energy sources, and the ESS. For this purpose, we formally verify the generic convolution properties for n-discrete random variables and also formalize the properties of Binomial random variables in the context of power system.

In view of this, we propose two novel event-triggered containment control schemes for the underlying multiagent systems with stochastic disturbances. Using the stochastic control theory, graph theory, and Lyapunov functional method, it is proven that the followers&#39; states can almost surely converge to the convex hull spanned by the leaders&#39; states. It is noted that the continuous communications among agents are not required and each agent&#39;s inter-event intervals are lower-bounded by a positive constant. As such, the proposed control schemes are both practical and implementable. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the developed schemes&#39; effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the problem of passive tracking of a noncooperating target indoors. We develop a novel system to localize a moving target using asynchronous self-localizing sniffer nodes, which passively listen to WiFi signals transmitted by the target. The proposed system uses only the time-difference-of-arrival between multipath components (multipath TDoA) at each receiver. This does not require phase synchronization. We develop two novel localization algorithms; one uses batch processing and the other is online. We also design a novel multipath association algorithm. A custom-designed hardware platform is developed to prototype the proposed system. The accuracy of the proposed system is verified experimentally. For signal-to-noise ratio of 10 dB, both proposed algorithms achieve target localization accuracies better than 40 cm with probability 0.95 without needing any knowledge of target or sniffer locations. If the location of one sniffer node is known, the accuracy improves to 15 cm.},

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can complement RSU coverage by providing flexible connectivity capable of adapting coverage for traffic fluctuations, energy consumption, and budgetary constraints that all have effects on ITS operations. This article proposes a general RSU/UAV joint planning solution, where complex dynamic parameters are investigated. The objective is to maximize the effective coverage of placed RSUs and UAV docks given: a budget comprised of periodic operating expenses and capital expenditures, limitations of the ground transceivers and UAVs, and use of renewable energy to offset the on-grid electricity cost. We formulate a mixed-integer quadratically constrained problem that can determine the optimal placement of RSUs and UAV stations, RSU activation schedules, if solar panels are attached, and their coverage during each time period. Due to NP-hard complexity of such a planning problem, we design a heuristic algorithm that produces suboptimal solutions in less time. Afterward, we perform a sensitivity analysis and show that changes to the parameters lead to logical shifts in infrastructure coverage. Additionally, we visualize the algorithm&#39;s performance on a large setting-Manhattan Island.},

To answer these challenges, engineers have always reused their know-how. However, facing today&#39;s rising complexity, reuse has to be much more performant. That is why models supported by formal or semiformal languages are preferred to avoid the variability of natural languages interpretation. In this context, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) made it possible to change the engineering paradigm by proposing a unique, shared system model. To promote and ease MBSE adoption, reuse should be fostered to respect the engineer&#39;s working method. A promising method for reusing models is based on the pattern concept.

In this sense, a two-stage thermal-electric HES operation method is developed, where the first stage for the hourly electric load and the second stage for the 20-minute thermal load.

In this context, this article proposes a localization-free shortest path reliable and energy-efficient pressure-based routing (SPRE-PBR) protocol for UWSNs. SPRE-PBR considers three parameters including residual energy, pressure, and link quality for selecting the next forwarding nodes. Moreover, SPRE-PBR is designed and developed to control path selection and reduce the unnecessary forwarding based on route cost calculation and optimal shortest path algorithm.

When sufficient automated vehicles (AVs) are present, they can provide wide-ranging and spatiotemporally detailed traffic information. Furthermore, AVs can be programmed to comply with traffic laws and optimized to smooth traffic flows. Thus, deploying AVs are expected to address the issues encountered by the existing variable speed limit (VSL) systems. However, the appealing scenario that 90\% or more AVs are on motorways is seen as a long-term goal. Therefore, this article explores the utilization of AV technologies in VSL systems under mixed traffic conditions where AVs coexist with manually driven vehicles. In this article, a VSL system using AVs as a source of data is presented. More specifically, an extended Kalman filter-based data assimilation method is proposed to estimate system variables (i.e., density, speed, critical density, and compliance rate) from the collected AV data. Following this, a model predictive control scheme is adopted to solve the optimal AV-data-based VSL control problem on the basis of estimated system variables. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed system is verified against a real motorway section in New Zealand.},

This model includes the dynamics of converters, interlinking capacitor, and the output filter of dc/ac inverter. The control commands are calculated through the assignment of desired damping and interconnection matrixes to the closed-loop system using a desired Hamiltonian energy function.

The design results verify that the economically optimized configurations derived by applying the proposed design tool are capable to cover the water requirements of the consumers and support the operation of the electric grid by injecting the RES-generated energy surplus. Numerical results are also presented, demonstrating that the application of the proposed methodology enables to reduce the lifetime cost of the desalination plant by 60\% compared with the exclusive use of electric grid energy.

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a multidimensional complex system that integrates computation, communication, and physical environment with essential and broad application prospects. However, there is a kind of CPS containing discrete events, continuous processes, stochastic phenomena, time-delay, and decision. It suffers from several sophisticated modeling and decision-making challenges, including deep integration of cyber and physical world, intensive temporal properties, model uncertainty, concurrency, and behavioral control. In this article, we deal with the above problems from the perspective of hybrid systems. We propose the modeling methods of CPS based on the modified hybrid stochastic timed Petri net (M-HSTPN) with three-tier architecture and introduce the decision place to strengthen the decision-making ability of CPS. Its advantages lie in describing multiple problems in CPS at the same time by adopting a unified open architecture. By integrating the various modeling and decision-making challenges under a unified framework, it is easy to analyze the problem systematically. Taking the humanoid soccer robot CPSs (HSR-CPS) as an example, by analyzing factors that affect the action cycle and interception success rate of the HSRs, we show the powerful modeling and decision-making capabilities of the M-HSTPN for CPS.},

  abstract     = {This article concerns receiver design for light-emitting diode (LED) communications, where the LED nonlinearity can severely degrade the performance of the system. We propose extreme learning machine (ELM)-based noniterative and iterative receivers to effectively handle the LED nonlinearity and memory effects. For the iterative receiver design, we also develop a data-aided receiver, where data are used as virtual training sequence in ELM training. It is shown that the ELM-based receivers significantly outperform conventional polynomial-based receivers. Iterative receivers can achieve huge performance gain compared to noniterative receivers, and the data-aided receiver can reduce training overhead considerably. This article can also be extended to radio frequency communications, e.g., to deal with the nonlinearity of power amplifiers.},

The energy optimization problem, being NP-hard in nature for scalable networks, has been addressed in the literature using traditional metaheuristic techniques. Quantum inspired metaheuristics have shown better performance than their traditional counterparts in solving such optimization problems in different domains. Toward this end, this article proposes a quantum inspired green communication framework for Energy Balancing in sensor enabled IoT systems (Q-EBIoT). First, an energy optimization model for sensor enabled IoT environments is presented, where energy consumption is derived as cost of the energy-oriented paths. Second, a quantum computing oriented solution is developed for the optimization problem focusing on energy centric solution representation, measurement, and rotation angle. The proposed solution is implemented to evaluate the comparative performance with the state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation demonstrates the benefit of the proposed framework in terms of various energy-related metrics for sensor enabled IoT environments.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a model-based characterization of energy consumption in a software-defined wireless sensor network (SD-WSN) architecture in an effort to examine the implications for network performance when making the WSN reprogrammable. The proposed model consists of breaking down all key functions involved in the correct functioning of an SD-WSN, namely; neighbor discovery, neighbor advertisement, network configuration, and data collection. The model is analyzed from a multihop network perspective. We consider two static SD-WSN scenarios to examine scalability, and one scenario to assess the performance implications in a pseudo-dynamic SD-WSN. Extensive simulation results are presented regarding the control overhead introduced, the percentage of alive nodes and remaining energy, and the impacts on network lifetime. We show that the accumulated control overhead is inversely proportional to the interaction period with the controller, whereas the remaining energy and the network lifetime are directly proportional to this parameter. Results show that the control overhead, for static SD-WSNs, can take up to 10\%-29\% of the total data flowing to the controller for the large SD-WSN and 6-19\% for the small SD-WSN. For a pseudo-dynamic network, the control overhead can take up to two-thirds of the total data sent to the controller, and the network lifetime was reduced by up to 80\% compared with the static scenarios.},

A stochastic model for studying the cascading failure dynamics of cyber-physical power systems is proposed, the aim being to examine the impacts of uncertainties on the system&#39;s vulnerability to cascading failure. This model retains the structural and operating characteristics of cyber-physical power systems. Topological failure and communication operational failure described by data traffic model are considered as being deterministic, whereas grid operational failure described by probabilistic load flow model is considered as being stochastic. Stochastic methods are used to select the failure-prone components and to determine the time of failure of each selected component. Moreover, the effects of load uncertainty and heavy load demands on the system&#39;s vulnerability to cascading failure are studied. Simulation results indicate that the failure propagation of a cyber-physical power system is the result of repeated mutual triggering between the power network and the coupled communication network. In addition, the increased load uncertainty can cause cascading failure, and the higher the load uncertainty the more severe the blackouts. Moreover, higher load demand makes the coupled system more vulnerable to cascading failure.},

Therefore, an accurate prediction model is required to forecast and adopt with the complicated signals. In this article, an accurate prediction method trained with improved wavelet transform (IWT) to decompose the original signal to subsignals, new feature selection based on the maximum dependence, maximum relevancy, and minimum redundancy to filter the signal and select the best candidate inputs and a synthetic forecasting engine with minimum forecasting error is proposed. The proposed method of forecasting engine composed two-dimensional convolution neural network (TDCNN) and trained by improved optimization algorithm based on particle swarm optimization. The proposed improved optimization algorithm will fine-tune the weights of TDCNN to increase the prediction accuracy of the forecast engine. The training optimization processes and effectual fast classification are the main duty of the proposed intelligent algorithm. The efficiency of the suggested prediction approach is widely evaluated and compared to other prediction approaches using the practical power market data. A simulation study is conducted over the trained model and the results are discussed in detail. Obtained numerical results and also analysis in short-term and long-term forecasting horizons validate the high performance and advantages of the introduced approach.},

In order to improve the active safety of cruise control in such a random traffic environment, this article proposes a connected cruise control (CCC) framework considering merging behavior probability of side vehicles. The control strategy of the framework first uses vehicle-to-vehicle communication and radar recognition algorithm to detect the surrounding vehicle targets. Then, the merging potential of the side vehicle is determined through the combination of fuzzy support vector machine and sliding window detection. Afterward, a cruise distance strategy considering the cutting-in probability of merging behavior is proposed and applied to the CCC system to realize the early braking of the main vehicle. Finally, the longitudinal control of the host vehicle is realized by the acceleration control, considering both the time delay and feedback error. The effectiveness of the proposed systematic control framework is verified through not only simulation but also field test. Results show that our method can accurately detect the lane change intent of the side vehicle, thus realizing braking of the host vehicle in advance when the side vehicle changes lane.},

Because conventional control structures require implementation of higher control level, subsystems that do not include them cannot be added in a microgrid. However, there are many subsystems in the field that do not support higher control level, which hinders microgrid scalability. For such subsystems to perform these functions, their local controller should be modified, which requires a lot of time and economic effort. In this article, by adding a new controller that performs higher control level without changing the local controller of subsystems, a structure to expand the scalability of a dc microgrid is proposed. The proposed flexible control structure consists of a local controller of subsystems, a flexible controller that performs higher control level, and microgrid central controller. A new communication network is required between local controller and flexible controller. However, due to a communication delay, the overall system stability is reduced. Therefore, problems related to the additional communication network were analyzed and a compensator was designed to overcome these issues. Through the flexible control structure, a subsystem that does not support higher control level can be added to dc microgrid.},

We implement a method based on spatial branch-and-bound to solve the problem on a case study network from the literature and an operational network part of an urban water system in the U.K. Finally, we validate the improvement in network resilience resulting from the addition of new connections by performing an a posteriori critical link analysis, using the hydraulic resilience measure of reserve capacity.},

Hence, the FI methods in the multisource, unbalanced, and weak distribution system is a challenge. In this article, the entire network is divided into the number of zones with each phase representing the two-port network. Further, the adjoint network matrices are formed for each of the two-port networks. The Tellegen&#39;s theorem based on adjoint circuit concept is then, used to identify the open-circuit section or the faulted node in the network using the input and output port information only. The voltage and current phasor information of the ports are acquired from the phasor measurement units based on the DFT. The methodology has been extensively verified on the IEEE-13 and IEEE-34 bus distribution systems integrated with the DGs, for all types of open and short circuit faults, with very encouraging results, with the real-time digital simulator.},

In this article, we tackle this problem and present a novel mechanism using behavioral features for version identification of (un)packed malware. Our basic idea involves focusing on intrafamily clustering. We extract the so-called family feature sets, i.e., hybrid features specific to each family. Our intuition is that family feature sets may achieve higher accuracy in clustering than common feature sets, and unpacked malware found in or relevant to such a cluster can result in the lineage inference of family members using traditional inference methods. We conduct experiments with two datasets, 8928 malware samples from VXHeavens and 3293 samples by manual analysis, composed of packed malware in a large portion. The results demonstrate that we can accurately classify samples into malware families based on the hybrid features we choose. In addition, we can also effectively extract family feature sets from 37 feature categories using forward stepwise selection. For intrafamily clustering, we employed the agglomerative clustering algorithm and observed that using family feature sets is significantly more accurate than using common feature sets, which facilitates higher accuracy lineage inference of packed malware.},

  abstract     = {Smart grid as the future of power system improves efficiency, flexibility, and reliability by employing the information and communication technologies. However, these new technologies cause some challenges in security issues in the smart grid. In addition to the active and passive attacks in the communication link, such as tampering and eavesdropping, the physical attacks can also be performed on smart meters. In the absence of hardware protection, physical attacks could easily disrupt the major performance of the system. On the other hand, the security schemes must be designed as lightweight as possible according to the constrained resource of the smart meters. To solve the mentioned problems simultaneously, this article proposes a secure and lightweight protocol based on physically unclonable function for communication between the neighborhood gateways and smart meters. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme not only resists against the all possible cyber and physical attacks, but also provides confidentiality, integrity, and mutual authentication. Moreover, the comparative performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme is efficient in terms of usage of storage space, communication overhead, and computational cost.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a vision-based perception system of using a monocular camera to detect the high-level features in the form of road markers and driving lanes for providing reliable visual measurements. Road markers and driving lanes are chosen because of their visually distinctive appearance compared to other objects as well as being easily annotated in the predefined digital map. For road-marker recognition, a template-matching-based method is applied to recognize the marker type and to estimate the corresponding position and orientation as well. For driving-lane detection, the proposed gradient orientation consistency combining the inverse perspective mapping spatial constraints is used to initialize the clearly visible lanes in the initial detection. Finally, the well-known particle filter is employed to integrate the visual information, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and global position system (GPS) data complementarily for correcting GPS errors. In particular, the lane measurement and road-marker measurement provide the lateral offset and relative position information, respectively, with respect to the ego vehicle. The IMU is used to estimate the dynamic behavior of the ego vehicle. The proposed vehicle localization system is evaluated in the real driving scenario of the standard campus environment within varying illumination conditions. The experiment results show that the lane-level localization accuracy is achieved by detecting road markers and driving lanes robustly.},

  abstract     = {In engineering systems with uncertain parameters, it is crucial for system analysis and control to analyze the relationship between these uncertain parameters and system outputs (or states). Nevertheless, the acquisition of this parameter-output function, termed parametric problem in this article, is not easy because it is usually a complicated implicit nonlinear function. Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), based on the generalized Fourier expansion, is a state-of-the-art method for both parametric problems and uncertainty quantification. Its basic idea is to approximate the implicit parameter-output function with a globally optimal explicit polynomial function, which remains accurate in the case of strong nonlinearity compared with the local Taylor expansion. This article provides a review of PCE and its applications in parametric problems. In terms of PCE theory, a rigorous and complete framework of PCE is established and a detailed review of typical PCE methods is presented. In terms of applications, two kinds of general parametric problems, namely parametric nonlinear algebraic equations and parametric differential equations, as well as their examples in some engineering fields, are introduced. Furthermore, some worthwhile future works are presented at the end of this article, which may facilitate the development of PCE.},

  abstract     = {Software-defined storage (SDS) is an abrupt technology that aims to address the explosive data proliferation and storage management complexity through the separation of control and data path, which are tightly bounded in the traditional storage area network (SAN) model. In SDS, the centralized controller manages and controls the overall storage services and operations. However, the centralized controller approach raises the scalability and single point of failure flag. In such a paradigm, the controller placement is an important activity. A random placement of controllers suffers from unpredictable delay in a large enterprise. Multiple SDS controllers mitigate the single point of failure and provide redundancy. We propose a method called controller placement based on the center of gravity (CPCG) to solve the optimal placement controllers&#39; locations to reduce the delay. CPCG incorporates different coordinates and analyzes their density (the number of attached devices to a switch) to suggest new optimal sites. For the least number of SDS controllers, we propose an areawise optimal placement location strategy; the areawise approach mitigates workload processing from the central controller and also provides a scalable and reliable storage system. Experiments show that the optimal placement drastically reduces delay and, hence, boosts scalability.},

  abstract     = {Malfunction of critical components in the power system can lead to large scale cascading failures and blackouts. Identifying critical components and taking protection on them can prevent the above problem effectively. In this article, investigating from the sight of network dynamics, a critical node identification method of complex power systems is proposed to find the nodes that have a great influence on the controllability and observability of the power system. First, based on electrical betweenness, a directed network model of power systems is proposed, which solves the problem that assessment results are not accurate because the traditional network model only represents the structural characteristics of power systems at a certain time. Then, combining structure controllability theory and the electrical characters of power systems, the electric cactus structure is established to provide a theoretical basis for assessment indexes. The node number of electric cactus is defined as the electric control capability index (ECCI), which measures the node&#39;s influence on the controllability of power systems. Besides, based on the duality principle and ECCI, the electric observe capability index is defined to measure the node&#39;s influence on the observability of power systems. Combining the two capability indexes, the electric dynamic characteristic index is defined. Finally, the method has been demonstrated on the IEEE 118-bus system. The results show that the identified nodes have a strong impact on the controllability and observability of the IEEE 118-bus system.},

Two novel-layered relaying strategies, namely NOL compress-forward (NOL-CF) and NOL decode-forward (NOL-DF) coding, concatenated to the SR source coding scheme are outlined. The network parameters are jointly optimized, to derive optimal end-to-end system performance. Taking the expected distortion (ED) as the end-to-end system performance metric, the explicit analytical solution achieving optimal ED under the proposed NOL-CF scheme with two layers is derived. For the NOL-DF coding, the numerical analysis demonstrates the merits of the proposed scheme, which dynamically adapts the transmission to the instantaneous channel realization in the absence of channel knowledge at the source node. The superiority of the proposed layered coding over several available nonorthogonal multiple access relaying schemes is demonstrated for Gaussian channels. Also, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed relay-assisted NOL codes to improve the ED over Rayleigh fading channel.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the detection and location of the bias load injection attack (BLIA) in smart grid. As one of typical false data injection attacks (FDIAs), the BLIA aims at destroying the vulnerable generator load. In particularly, the BLIA can bypass the traditional bad data detection techniques, by compromising the measurable sensor-data estimation. Because of this reason, the emergency of BLIA brings enormous threat to the security of smart grid. To address this problem, a detection and location framework against BLIA consisting of three steps is proposed. In the first step, we propose a topology structure-based subregion division algorithm to reduce the complexity of attack detection in the large-scale grid system. In the second step, taking the stealthy characteristics of the BLIA into account, a robust adaptive observer-based detection algorithm is proposed. Through of capabilities of observers, we can estimate the physical dynamics accurately. To detect the BLIA quickly and avoid missed alarm, we compute the adaptive threshold as a substitute for the precomputed threshold, by taking the model linearization error and external disturbance into account. In the third step, we propose a logical judgment matrix to address the sensor attack undetectability problem under structure vulnerability, based on the combinations of all observable sensors. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed detection and location framework is illustrated, by using detailed case studies on the IEEE 55-bus smart grid system.},

Many existing approaches in data mining and analytics have limitations, such as only the binary attribute is considered within a transaction, as well as all the objects/items having equal weights or importance. To solve these drawbacks, a novel utility-driven data analytics algorithm named HUPNU is presented in this article. As a general utility-driven uncertain data mining model, HUPNU can extract High-Utility patterns by considering both Positive and Negative unit utilities from Uncertain data. The qualified high-utility patterns can be effectively discovered for intrusion detection, risk prediction, manufacturing management, and decision-making, among others. By using the developed vertical Probability-Utility list with the positive and negative utilities structure, as well as several effective pruning strategies, experiments showed that the developed HUPNU approach with the pruning strategies performed great in mining the qualified patterns efficiently and effectively.},

  abstract     = {In mobile crowd sensing, task allocation is of vital importance, and it has attracted much attention in recent years. Though there have been many studies focusing on task allocation, rare works took sensing duration of tasks into consideration. However, sensing duration plays a key role for the success of many sensing tasks. For example, when the crowd sensing system needs to monitor the crowd flow in locations of interest, it is better to allocate this task to workers who can record a video of certain duration rather than those who can only take a picture. In this article, we try to solve this problem by designing a duration-sensitive task allocation model, where each task is associated with a specific sensing duration. The model aims at maximizing the number of completed tasks under the constraints of sensing duration and task capacity of each worker. To find an efficient task allocation scheme for the model, we design a utility function that can reflect the probability of task completion by using the exponential distribution. Then, an efficient greedy heuristic is proposed based on the utility function. Extensive evaluations based on the simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline methods.},

In present article, a robust V-f controller based on decentralized output-feedback optimal linear quadratic regulator principle is proposed. As state-feedback is not involved, it avoids the usage of any estimator or observer, which makes it computationally more efficient. Moreover, its decentralized structure works on local parameter measurements that eliminate expensive communication infrastructure, making it economical. All possible uncertainties from both source and load sides, neighboring bus parameters are considered for V-f regulation using the resistive-droop mechanism that is more accurate for low voltage resistive network. For this purpose, a novel lower-order simplified small-signal MG model including two PV-battery with exclusive parallel RLC loads and LV network is used, which accounts for intermittency as variable dc-bus link dynamics. The whole MG model is segregated into two subsystems with inclusion of interconnection dynamics. The viability of proposed controller is verified by comprehensive tests, viz., variable solar irradiance, voltage set-point tracking under continuous-bounded and large-scale load perturbations, nearby bus parameter disturbances using hardware-in-the-loop simulations with real-time digital simulator and MATLAB via dSPACE controller.},

The inner precoder in cascaded precoding depends on the spatial covariance matrix of the massive MIMO channel and can be the same for the users that are close to each other. When the users are close to each other, high-quality D2D links can be expected among the users and the users can form a virtual MIMO receiver via D2D links. Since the users may require different services, the required transmission rates of those users can also be different. To improve the overall user experience, utility functions are adopted in this article and two D2D-enabled user cooperation schemes, including the data-symbol-information exchanging and receive-signal-information exchanging, are proposed, which can allocate the overall transmission rate among the users adaptively in terms of the required transmission rates of different users.

  abstract     = {In a wireless channel, shadow fading along with multipath effect causes random fluctuations of the received signal strength at the receiver. Several composite fading distributions are available for modeling the randomness. Among them, Lognormal-based models are unable to give a closed-form expression of the composite distribution, but Gamma-based model overcomes the problem faced by the former one. However, the Gamma-based model comes with a complicated mathematical function. To get rid of that, mixture of Lognormal (MoLN) distribution is used in this article. Maximum-likelihood approach is used for parameters estimation with the help of the expectation maximization algorithm. Simulation results have been provided in order to show the accuracy of the proposed mixture model. The first-order statistics of both the envelope and signal-to-noise ratio of a wireless channel are represented by a simple mathematical form. Several performance metrics, used in a wireless system, are expressed in a closed form for the MoLN distribution. The fitness of MoLN distribution is tested. Quantitatively, by measuring metrics like mean square error and Kullback-Leibler divergence, it has been shown that MoLN distribution is a suitable candidate to represent the composite wireless channel accurately.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the engineering community realized the potential for additive manufacturing (AM) to be a game-changer in product development. Nevertheless, it is not yet possible to fully take advantage of this technology because it implies a different approach to engineering design. The dependencies of AM on related technologies, such as material modeling, design tools, computing, and process design represent a challenge for engineers. A comprehensive system engineering approach is needed to address the introduction of AM in new design projects. This article proposes a systems design approach to evaluate the use of AM in the development of new systems at the early stage of design. The methodology aims to provide a preliminary estimation of performance, cost, and time of parts manufactured using additive techniques. The article introduces a set of design drivers and criteria to standardize the design process and support the manufacturing technique decision-making process. The methodology is experimentally tested and validated by evaluating tradeoffs for two different case studies considering different engineering parameters. The analysis of the results shows a good consistency between framework predictions and experimental evidence, with an uncertainty level lower than 5\%. The reliability of obtained results is discussed.},

Multiple-association technique promises diversity gains for 5G. However, existing multiple-association schemes are centralized, which have high signal overhead and depend on the reference signal receiving power, and cannot adapt to the fluctuating traffic of users. Therefore, it calls for a new distributed multiple-association scheme. We model the multiple-association problem as a state-based potential game (SPG). With the aid of SPG, the association policy that we designed could drive the ultradense networks to evolve toward the global optimization in the flow level performance.

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous vehicle routing problem with time windows (HVRPTW) aspect of hazardous material (HazMat) transportation is studied in this article. Given the multiobjective nature of HazMat transportation, a three-objective optimization model is defined for HVRPTW in HazMat transportation. The objective is to determine fleet size and routes so as to meet all given constraints as well as to minimize the objectives of the total traveling cost, the transportation risk, and the average vehicle redundancy. A load-variant HazMat transportation risk assessment model considering vehicle type and waiting time is presented to describe the transportation risk. A variable neighborhood search-based hybrid multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (VN-HMOEA) is proposed for solving the problem. The proposed VN-HMOEA integrates a two-phase push forward insertion heuristic (TP-PFIH) for initial population construction, specialized evolutionary operators for optimizing different objectives and a VNS metaheuristic for local search exploitation. The algorithm is tested on the modified Solomon benchmark instances for HVRPTW. Experimental results show that the proposed VN-HMOEA is competitive in terms of convergence and diversity. We also find that multiobjective fashion is of great significance for transportation risk mitigation to provide a set of nondominated solution rather than a single solution.},

  abstract     = {Smart grid (SG) can automatically collect a large amount of data of different power parameters through different sensors, which has become the future trend of power systems, especially for real-time monitoring needs. However, due to the limitation of detection technology and measurement cost, direct measurement of SG topology is difficult. Thus, reconstructing the topology of SG through measurement data is important yet challenging. In this article, we leverage a graph theory-based power network model and propose to transform the SG topology reconstruction (SGTR) problem into a sparse recovery problem. By exploiting the framework of compressed sensing, the network structure can be reconstructed from a small number of observations. In order to enhance the reconstruction performance, we extract three underlying features of the SG, namely, the symmetry feature, diagonal feature, and cluster feature. Thus, the symmetric reweighting of modified clustered orthogonal matching pursuit method was proposed to integrate these three features simultaneously to improve the performance of SGTR. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments based on the MATPOWER benchmark toolbox. Compared with some state-of-the-art methods, we find that the reconstruction performance of the proposed method is obviously improved. In addition, based on the reconstructed SG topology, a sparse solution based on QR decomposition was also proposed to locate the power line outages accurately.},

To overcome this drawback, a novel adaptive current regulator is employed for the grid interfacing voltage source inverter. In addition, a high-gain dc-dc converter with a Kalman-based maximum power point tracking algorithm is designed to achieve the high voltage level at the common dc bus. To determine three-phase reference currents, the proposed adaptive current regulator is designed by using a recurrent neural network trained with the Hebbian least mean square weight updating algorithm. They are used to generate the three-phase compensating currents for suppressing the harmonics present in the system. The proposed method has several merits, such as better harmonic mitigation ability, adaptive behavior, improved stability, and lesser settling time, as compared with the conventional PI controller. The system performance with the proposed current control regulator is analyzed via MATLAB/Simulink. Comparative analysis via simulation platform assures the improved performance in terms of power quality, settling time, and stability of the proposed controller. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated under several transient conditions by developing a laboratory scale prototype model with the dSPACE control desk.},

  abstract     = {In distributed storage systems, fault-tolerant methods such as replication or erasure coding are adopted to guarantee data reliability. These methods ensure that data could be recovered via a redundancy mechanism when any storage node suffers a failure. However, this redundancy mechanism often incurs nontrivial bandwidth overhead to transmit quantities of replicas and blocks. Prior methods focus on how to reduce the network cost through careful scheduling. In this article, we aim to improve the transmission efficiency from an orthogonal dimension, i.e., optimizing the storage locations according to the characteristics of data center networks. We focus on server-centric data centers (such as BCube), where any pair of nodes are interconnected with multiple redundant paths. Thus, transmissions for replicas or blocks can be significantly speeded up via utilizing the redundant paths concurrently. Inspired by this insight, we design the node-disjoint storage strategy and the nested node-disjoint storage strategy for the multireplica storage system and the erasure-coded storage system, respectively. Evaluations indicate that our methods can save 46.6\%-62.1\% of the transmission time in the multireplica storage system and 71.5\%-80.8\% of the transmission time in the erasure-coded storage system, compared with conventional methods adopted in current storage systems.},

This article proposes a new traveling-wave (TW) based protection scheme to detect and locate faults in HVdc grids. In contrast to the existing TW-based protection and fault location approaches, the proposed scheme, first, utilizes only the first locally measured TW after the inception of a fault, and, second, focuses on the frequency content and polarity of the TW, rather than its arrival time. The direction of the TW is identified based on the pattern of the current TW waveform. A frequency spectral ratio of the current TW is proposed to identify the fault zone and fault location with high accuracy. The proposed method ensures a detection speed of 50 μs on overhead lines and 500 μs on underground cables. A remote backup scheme is coordinated with the primary protection and operates within 1.05 ms, which meets the speed requirement of HVdc grids. The performance of the proposed scheme has been, first, assessed using the CIGRE B4 HVdc test grid under various conditions, and, second, compared to existing single- and two-terminal TW methods.},

However, to prevent interference to the PU, the SU cognitive radio needs to detect the presence of the PU at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), due to multipath and shadowing on its way to the SU. Wideband spectrum sensing is considered here. The main contribution of this article is a blind algorithm for blindly sensing PU signals, of varying bandwidths, at very low SNRs. A novel oblique projection (involving the oversampled received signal) is used. The effect of PU signal bandwidth on the performance of the blind spectrum sensing algorithms is investigated in this article, which has not been done earlier. Unlike existing blind spectrum sensing algorithms, whose performance depends on the bandwidth of the PU signal, the oblique projection-based novel method adapts itself to the varying bandwidths of the PU signal to maintain the constant level of superior performance for all bandwidths of PU signals; this is solely due to the oblique projection sensing method, which also exploits the correlation between the PU signals on the different receiver oversampled branches.},

The only requirement to perform this online estimation is the voltage measurement at the electrical board panel of the end-user building. The proposed method combines digital filtering, statistical process, and transient analysis to make possible the accurate identification of the corrective actions introduced by the voltage regulation system of the distribution network. Hence, this identification permits the estimation of the aggregated load profile. The method provides real-time information that can be used by the end-user or an automated energy management system to initiate demand response actions depending on the state of the grid, e.g., shaving, shifting, or modulation of the local load. Experimental data of three different locations permitted the validation of this novel approach, which enables the implementation of grid-friendly home energy managements systems with DSM functions at a very low cost for the utilities and end-users.},

  abstract     = {To improve the energy-saving supervision level of urban buildings and reduce the urban energy consumption, this article proposes an intelligent energy-saving supervision system of the urban buildings based on the Internet of Things (IoT). Regarding the advantages and applications of the IoT, a layered framework of the intelligent energy-saving supervision system that integrates the IoT is constructed. In this framework, three key system layers, including the data acquisition based on the IoT, the data integration based on cloud computing, and the intelligent service based on data prediction, defect management and differential management, are separately implemented. On that basis, a case study is performed on a large public building named Campus Library of the South China University of Technology. After the three-year application in an intelligent and real-time supervision manner, the annual energy consumption of the studied building is reduced by 35\%, which validates the practicability and effectiveness of the system proposed in this article.},

  abstract     = {In an aggregate signature scheme, n signatures on n different messages from n users can be combined into a single signature. By verifying the signature, the verifier believes that n users did generate the n corresponding signatures. In the recent decade, numerous certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) schemes have been introduced. There are two issues with these schemes. First, it was in the random oracles model (ROM) that the security proofs of these schemes were given. ROM is an idealized model. A signature scheme is not necessarily secure in real life even if it has proven to be safe in ROM. Second, the number of hash-to-point operations increases linearly with the number of signers in these schemes, so that are not suited for the computation-constrained devices (such as mobile devices). In this article, a new certificateless signature scheme is constructed. Based on it, a new CLAS scheme is proposed. Under the hypothesis that it is hard to solve a computation Diffie-Hellman problem, two schemes are proved to be secure in the standard model. The CLAS scheme needs only three pairing operations and does not need a hash-to-point operation, taken into account the computation cost, it is more efficient than previous CLAS schemes.},

These improvements in network performance spearheaded a vast amount of research in D2D, which identified significant challenges that need to be addressed before realizing their full potential in 5G networks, and beyond. Toward this end, this article proposes the use of a distributed intelligent approach to control the generation of D2D networks. More precisely, the proposed approach uses Belief Desire Intention (BDI) intelligent agents with extended capabilities (BDIx) to manage each D2D node independently and autonomously, without the help of the base station. To illustrate the above, this article proposes the DAIS algorithm for the decision of transmission mode in D2D, which maximizes the data rate and minimizes the power consumption in the network, while taking into consideration the computational load. Simulations show the applicability of BDI agents in solving D2D challenges.},

  abstract     = {The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) has prodigious plausibility in reducing green house gas (GHG). But EVs acceptance is, however, hindered by several challenges; among them is their avidity for quicker charging at lower price. This article considers a photovoltaic (PV)-powered station equipped with an energy storage system (ESS), which is assumed to be capable of assigning variable charging rates to different EVs to fulfill their demands inside their declared deadlines at minimum price. To ensure fairness, a charging rate-dependent pricing mechanism is proposed to assure a higher price for enjoying a higher charging rate. The PV generation profile and future load request are forecasted at each time slot, to handle the respective uncertainty. An integer linear programming (ILP)-based centralized system is first proposed to minimize the charging price per EV. Due to the larger computational time, we subsequently present two game theoretic algorithms, i.e., game 1 and game 2. In game 1, players are oblivious of upcoming charging requests, whereas in game 2, players consider the future anticipated load to select their charging strategies. The games are shown to converge to a Nash equilibrium. The average unit price of game 2 is shown to be the same as the one of the optimal solution and takes considerably less computation time than the centralized method.},

  abstract     = {In an untrusted relay network where a destination transmits a jamming signal to prevent an untrusted relay from recovering the data sent by a source, we consider imperfect channel reciprocity (ICR) between the relay and the destination. This ICR prevents the destination from removing jamming interference perfectly, meaning that transmit power of the jamming signal has a significant impact on the secrecy rate. In this article, we present a system model of an untrusted relay network with ICR, and verify that the secrecy rate is concave with respect to the jamming power. We derive an asymptotic optimal jamming power to maximize the secrecy rate in closed-form and propose an adaptive scheme for jamming power control (JPC). Numerical results show that the proposed JPC scheme achieves a near-optimal secrecy rate, as well as outperforming conventional schemes by controlling the jamming power adaptively. In particular, we note that to improve the secrecy rate, it is advantageous to reduce the jamming power to decrease the residual jamming interference as the reciprocity error increases or the channel between the relay and the destination improves.},

Here, adopting a graph-theoretic approach, this problem is solved for general nonlinear (and also structure-invariant) systems, and a P-order solution is proposed. In this direction, the dynamical system is modeled as a directed graph, called system digraph, and two types of graph components are introduced, which are tightly related to structural controllability. Two types of nodes, which are required to be affected (or driven) by an input, called driver nodes, are defined, and minimal number of these driver nodes are obtained. Polynomial-order complexity of the given algorithms to solve the problem ensures applicability of the solution for analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. The structural results in this article are significant as compared with the existing literature, which offer approximate and computationally less-efficient, e.g. Gramian-based, solutions for the problem, while this article provides an exact solution with the lower computational complexity and applicable for controllability analysis of nonlinear systems.},

It derives the capacity of a time-limited (TL) system across a mask-constrained channel contaminated by interference and by additive white Gaussian noise, where doubling the channel capacity requires only a fixed multiple increase in average received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This is in contrast with BL systems, which require a geometric multiple increase in SNR. The second contribution is practical. It takes advantage of the theory established in the first objective to design a novel TL system. This article shows several designs of the novel system for a centralized multiple access (MA) wireless network, which outperform current MA networks by an order of magnitude, including one design that is shown to meet future 5G specifications without requiring mm-wave bands.},

This article proposes two variant modeling patterns which, when used in the right context, can reduce complexity, eliminate many opportunities for error, and minimize development costs and maintenance effort. The 150\% pattern, already commonly used in industry, capitalizes on commonality among variants. The encapsulation pattern promotes model organization and understandability. This article also introduces four comparison criteria-number of variation points, number of shared model elements, human readability, and model maintainability-that a system architect can use to determine which pattern is best suited to model a certain product family. The 150\% pattern is found to be best to be used for product lines with high commonality among variants, whereas product lines whose variants exhibit much variety and are managed by multiple development teams are best modeled using the encapsulation pattern. A parking brake product family is used to illustrate each modeling pattern and provides a sample context against which to use the comparison criteria.},

The IoT services composition, therefore, becomes an important challenge that aims at creating added-value services by combining several services offered by thousands of smart devices in the IoT environment to meet the user&#39;s QoS requirements. In this context, an improved teaching learning-based QoS-aware services composition algorithm (ITL-QCA) is proposed to find a very close to the optimal composition in a reasonable amount of time. Unlike the evolutionary computation-based and swarm intelligence-based approaches, the proposed services composition algorithm is characterized by a few tuning parameters and a high exploration capability of the search space of compositions. This allows obtaining compositions with a high optimality in terms of QoS and without requiring some hard tuning parameters. The simulation results show clearly that the ITL-QCA algorithm performs better in terms of the composition optimality and has a reasonable execution time in a large-scale environment compared to other services composition approaches proposed in the literature.},

The objective function is formulated as a cost-based multivariable constrained nonlinear convex programming problem. Other than planning costs, the objective function also includes per day running or operational costs such as unit commitment costs as well as the switching costs associated with the dispatchable units. The overall problem is simulated under MATLAB environment. Quantitative results indicate the impact of operational paradigm along with the planning of an MG in the form of cost analysis with different reliability conditions. An assessment of results in tabular form is presented, which incorporates the optimal sizing of MG under the different system reliability conditions and constraints.

  abstract     = {In this article, energy-efficient resource allocation in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) cooperative wireless networks is studied. With the transferred power, the SWIPT relays are adopted to improve the energy efficiency at the destination node. Two typical relay structures, decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF), are exploited for the optimal relay selection and power allocation with a power splitting SWIPT architecture. Nonconvex energy efficiency optimization problems are formulated for both DF and AF relay types. Based on the SNRs at the destination node, closed-form expressions of the optimal power splitting ratios are provided for DF and AF relays, respectively. With the optimal power splitting ratio, relay selection schemes based on full and partial knowledge of the channel state information are derived. Moreover, a novel power allocation scheme is proposed and illustrated based on the property of the simplified optimization problem with the power and quality of service constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation scheme achieves the maximum energy efficiency with low computational complexity, in which the proposed relay selection outperforms the typical relay selection schemes in terms of energy efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Effective routing design can significantly improve the whole network performance. In order to achieve the global best network performance, the problem of routing can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem. A delay- and interference-aware routing (DIAR) method using optimization is proposed in this article to find effective routes in a wireless mesh network. With the rapid development of wireless communication, next-generation networks urge shorter delay. DIAR aims at selecting routes with minimum end-to-end delay for several concurrent data flows. Delay is derived according to interference, bandwidth, and the probability of transmission failure. Then, the relationship between delay and the number of interfering nodes is built for the first time, which makes the estimation of delay more simple. When solving the optimization problem, an improved genetic algorithm is proposed to balance load. Besides, DIAR considers dynamic network condition caused by selecting different paths to transmit packets and evaluates the network condition while finding the solution of routing. The paths with least end-to-end delay will be finally chosen as the solution. Simulation results show that DIAR can obtain better network performance.},

The proposed approach characterizes the uncertainty of demands, wind power, and DTRs in each representative day by a polyhedral uncertainty set. Additionally, the k-means clustering technique is used to obtain upward/downward variations of correlated uncertain parameters in each representative day and to construct the uncertainty set. The proposed model is inherently intractable as it includes infinite constraints modeling enforced techno-economic limitations for all realizations of uncertain parameters. To resolve this limitation, the proposed intractable model is recast as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming problem using affine policies. The proposed approach is implemented on the Garver 6-bus and IEEE 73-bus test systems. Simulation results illustrate its flexibility, practicality, and tractability.},

The pattern is defined as the mapping scheme of packet onto a resource block (RB) that consists of multiple resource elements (REs). The patterns are randomly selected by active satellite machine-type-communication terminals (SMTs) from a set of available patterns, and are employed to differentiate signals of different SMTs sharing a RB. Message passing detection algorithm is employed to decode multiple superimposed packets, which enables multiple packet reception capability in the RA scheme. The proposed RPM can be combined with contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (CRDSA), which generates RPM-CRDSA protocol. In this protocol, the interference cancellation technique can be carried out across RBs to remove the received signals that are already decoded, which further improves the throughput. The performance of RPM-CRDSA is evaluated via mathematical analysis and computer simulation. The probability of preamble collision and an upper bound of throughput are derived, respectively. Simulation results show that the peak normalized throughput of RPM-CRDSA with $N = 4$ REs can reach 2.03 b/symbol, which largely outperforms traditional protocols.},

  abstract     = {Impulsive noise, a common impediment preventing the system from achieving error-free transmission, is significant in many wireless and power line communication environments. Although the performance of several mitigation techniques for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multicarrier communication systems impaired by memoryless impulsive noise are widely acknowledged, we note that OFDM is outperformed by its single-carrier counterpart when the impulses are very strong and/or they occur frequently, which is likely to exist in contemporary communication systems including smart grid communications. On the other hand, many communication technologies used in the smart grid do not employ OFDM and likewise, the assumption of memoryless noise is not valid for such communication scenarios. Memoryless noise models cannot take into account one of the main features of the actual noise, i.e., the time-correlation among the noise samples. The aim of this article is to compare and analyze several mitigation techniques such as clipping, blanking, and combined clipping-blanking to mitigate the noxious effects of bursty impulsive noise for low-density parity-check coded single-carrier communication systems. Moreover, we propose a log-likelihood ratio (LLR)-based impulsive noise mitigation for the considered scenario. In this context, provided simulation results highlight the superiority of the LLR-based mitigation scheme over the clipping/blanking schemes.},

The proposed optimal scheme is designed with a two-stage control algorithm based on VET, forecasted solar insolation, and SoC to easily cope with the load demand variation between low and high prices. In this case, the MPC is implemented to predict the SoC in the PV-battery hybrid system by directly calculating it in the first stage while predicting the values of solar irradiance, load consumption, and electricity price. Furthermore, the proposed MPC is used to account for forecasting errors and acts under the given limits to minimize errors and compensate reactive power during the scheduling process. To validate the performance of the proposed control scheme, the PV/battery system is modeled and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink package. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimal control scheme has better performances under various scenarios such as parameter uncertainties and sudden changes.},

The concept of power system resilience has been introduced for focusing on high-impact and low-probability (HILP) events such as a hurricane, heavy snow, and floods. Power system resilience is the ability of a system to reduce the likelihood of blackout or wide power outages due to HILP events. Indeed, in a resilient power system, as the severity of HILP events increases, the rate (but not the amount) of unserved loads diminishes. Suitable measures for managing power system resilience can be classified into three categories in terms of time, known as “resilience-based planning,” “resilience-based response,” and “resilience-based restoration.” The most widely used approaches, methods, and techniques in each of these categories, as well as the future trends for improving the power system resilience are reviewed in this article. The challenges of resilience in power systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources are also discussed in each of these categories.},

Although the attenuation coefficient in the foggy channel follows the simple Gamma distribution, the distribution of its channel state is quite complicated similar to the well-studied Gamma-Gamma turbulence channel. Furthermore, existing literature suggested schemes that require feedback of the channel state information (CSI) to improve the outage performance of the OWC system under foggy conditions. In this article, we study the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ergodic rate, and energy consumption performance of OWC systems under foggy conditions. First, we show that a single-aperture OWC system suffers significantly from the fog attenuation by deriving analytical expressions on the ergodic rate and energy consumption. Then, we consider a multiaperture OWC system equipped with an opportunistic receiver beam selection (RBS) scheme. The RBS scheme is based on the simple selection combining diversity algorithm, which does not require the knowledge of CSI. We analyze the proposed scheme by deriving computable bounds on the average SNR, ergodic rate, and energy consumption using system parameters and show the performance improvement of the RBS scheme comparing the single-aperture system. We demonstrate the performance of the considered scheme and validate derived expressions using computer simulations.},

The proposed approach employs a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model, a fuzzy observer, and a model predictive scheme to alleviate the effects of the 5G-network-induced delays and data loss of the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator links on the dc MG plant response. By employing the so-called time-stamp technique and network delay compensator (NDC), the delays are computed, and the data loss effects are compensated, thus improving the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller. In addition, a time-delay-independent observer is proposed to estimate the states of the constant power loads (CPLs) and the power buffer, based on the measured information. Due to the usage of two NDCs, the presented approach is robust against the network delays and results in a small computational burden. To show the merits of the proposed approach, it is applied to a dc MG that feeds two CPLs. Results show the simplicity of designing the observer-based controller and better robustness against the network delays, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, software-in-the-loop simulations are presented to prove the practical applicability of the proposed controller.},

In this article, we propose an attentive-deep-interest-based model to fill these gaps. Specifically, we capture the interest sequence in the interest extractor layer, and the auxiliary losses are employed to produce the interest state with deep supervision. First, we use the bidirectional long short-term memory network to model the dependence between behaviors. Next, an interest evolving layer is proposed to extract the interest evolving process that is related to the target. Then, the model learns highly nonlinear interactions of features based on stack autoencoders. An experiment is conducted using four real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 1.8\% improvement in the Amazon datasets than the existing state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of information technology and the continuous upgrading of special equipment, such as sensing and control, the application of industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs) has received great attention. Within the IIoTs, a large amount of sensitive data needs to be transmitted in time. Therefore, protecting data security and user privacy has been a key issue. In this article, the concept of public key anonymous aggregation encryption (AAE) is proposed for the first time. The sender of the message encrypts n different messages into one ciphertext using the public keys of n different receivers. After receiving the ciphertext, the receiver decrypts the ciphertext using his private key to get the corresponding message. The messages obtained by different receivers are different, and the identity of the receiver is kept secret to anyone including other receivers. A concrete AAE scheme then is constructed, which is proved to be secure in the standard model based on the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem. It does not require pairing operations, so it is more efficient than previous public encryption schemes and is more suitable for IIoTs.},

  abstract     = {A novel scheme is suggested for change detection and fault classification in ac microgrids (μGs) with different operating modes. The proposed method utilizes a Teager-Kaiser energy operator based approach for analyzing the current-based signal to detect changes in the μG. The current-based signal is a summation of squared three-phase currents (SSC), measured at one end of a line in the μG. Since μGs have different operating modes, a proper signal should be defined to have some valuable signatures of the changes in different conditions. The SSC signal is constant during normal conditions of the grid-connected and islanded μG, whereas in any possible change condition experiences considerable variation. After the detection, the faulty phase is determined using three similar indices, derived from the squared currents. These indices are the ratios of squared currents for each phase with half-cycle window length, before and after the change detection. The proposed protection scheme is able to handle both operation modes of the μG. The proposed technique is evaluated in a MATLAB/Simulink simulated network and laboratory small-scaled test bench. The results confirm high accuracy and quickness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed methodology is compared with some other similar methods.},

  abstract     = {For a mechatronic system, the lack of robustness is mainly due to an ignorance of variability, which is unavoidable in every designed system at all stages of system development and during its life cycle. In fact, the inherent imperfections of manufacturing processes and operational variations such as material wear or multiphysical effects (thermal, vibrations, etc.) involve parametric variations, which can degrade the proper system function. To ensure a high level of quality and to improve design robustness, the deviations between actual and target definition should be restricted by specified tolerances. Moreover, it is important to understand the relationship between parameter deviations and system behavior. Thus, in this article, a variational approach is proposed to identify performance sensitivity to parameter deviations in a mechatronic system and to determine influential parameters that affect significantly the proper functioning of the system and its behavior. Furthermore, this approach is used to specify the admissible parameter deviations for which the given specifications can be guaranteed. The complete approach is applied to an example in the aeronautic field: an electromechanical actuator driving an aircraft primary flight control surface (aileron).},

Two new optimization algorithms for this optimum selection of OGSs are proposed. The algorithms take into account the monthly variability of cloud coverage, take advantage of locations in different hemispheres, and select OGSs, which are within the visibility area of the satellite for longer time. The methodology for calculating the single and joint cloud free line of sight considering the integrated liquid water content statistics, the time dependent elevation angles and the MEO satellite movement are presented.

The optimization problem is formulated as a binary integer linear program and is proved to be NP-hard. Accordingly, we propose two efficient heuristic algorithms to solve it. The first one is centralized and relies on complete information, whereas the second one is distributed and is based on a reinforcement learning approach. The proposed distributed learning algorithm aims to find the best association for each user based on its past experience, automatically and independently from others.

However, it is not usual that works encompassing many operational aspects, such as multiple operational objectives, settling time, and an unlimited number of crudes, to blend in any tank. This article proposes a new algorithm that integrates linear and grammar-guided genetic programming concepts with a quantum-inspired approach to create programs that represent a crude oil refinery scheduling solution. The fitness function comprises four objectives that guide the evolution based on importance predefined by the decision maker. We propose a success ratio to evaluate the algorithm performance considering 50 runs for each case. A final solution is considered a success if two more important objectives are optimized.

Our computational experience reproduces these two features as different aspects of the same phenomenon. The optimal set of key members and their spheres of influence are identified in real-life networks and synthetic ones. For the former, community structures are consistent with existing knowledge about the instances. For the latter, network underlying organization is known a priori and it is perfectly uncovered.

Gaussian Process (GP) regression is the state-of-the-art machine learning approach that resolves the issue. This article proposes two novel nonparametric strategies for NLOS target tracking, namely Echo State Network (ESN) and Echo State Gaussian Process (ESGP), both of which offers significant enhancement to the tracking performance compared to GP regression. Moreover, ESN is much more computationally efficient than GP regression and ESGP also provides a measure of confidence on the tracking results.

  abstract     = {While orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been studied for a decade, the study of nonorthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (NOFDM) in the underwater acoustics (UWA) communication has never been reported, to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, we investigate the NOFDM technique for the UWA communication considering the doubly dispersive channel. The main feature of the NOFDM is that it involves more closely packed subcarriers compared to the OFDM, which results in higher spectral efficiency. However, this transmission suffers from severe intercarrier interference. Since, we are considering the doubly dispersive channel, intersymbol interference is also encountered due to the multipath propagation. Therefore, the traditional receiver of the NOFDM system in the UWA channel tends to have high computational complexity. Considering this problem, we design a receiver for the NOFDM system, where the basis expansion model is used along with the compressed sensing channel estimation technique, i.e., orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), which can effectively reduce the computational complexity. However, while implementing this technique in the real sea environment, the problem of long delay/Doppler spread is encountered due to guard intervals. Therefore, we propose the use of a time-domain equalizer to mitigate the effect of long delay/Doppler spread. Simulation and experimental results based on the bit error rate demonstrate the performance degradation due to severe interference in our proposed receiver. On the contrary, the mean-square-error performance shows that our proposed receiver with the OMP channel estimation outperforms the OFDM receiver. Similarly, higher spectral efficiency gain is attained due to the closely packed subcarriers.},

  abstract     = {This position article addresses resilience in complex engineering and engineered systems (CES). It offers a synthesis of academic thinking with an empirical analysis of the challenge. This article puts forward argumentations and a conceptual framework in support of a new understanding of CES resilience as the product of continuous learning in between disruptive events. CES are in continuous evolution and with each generation they become more complex as they adapt to their environment. While this evolution takes place, new failure modes arise with the engineering of their resilience having to evolve in parallel to cope with them. Our position supports the role of an overarching complexity science framework to investigate the resilience of CES, including their temporal evolution, resilience features, the management and decision layers, and the transparency of boundaries between interconnected systems. The conclusion identifies the value of a complexity perspective to address CES resilience. Extending the latest understanding of resilience, we propose a circular framework where features of CES are related to a resilience event and complexity science explains the importance of interconnections with external systems, the increasingly fast system evolution and the stratification of heterogeneous layers.},

More specifically, this article formulates the dynamic operation of ES devices in power transmission networks as a continuous-time optimal control problem, where the Lagrange multiplier trajectories of nodal power balance constraints are defined as continuous-time locational marginal prices (LMPs). In addition, the adjoint functions associated with ES state equations are calculated in closed-form, which define the locational value of stored energy (LVSE) in ES devices. The notion of LVSE is, then, leveraged to define incremental charging utility and discharging cost rates of ES devices, which pass on the spatio-temporal values of ES devices to the continuous-time LMPs. The numerical results of implementing the proposed continuous-time model on a test 3-bus power system and the IEEE-Reliability Test System highlight its effectiveness in calculating the value of ES energy shifting and congestion relief services in transmission networks.},

We propose a process framework for the identification of the desired characteristics as QAts of interest to be balanced against selected performance measures. We show the extension of QAts to operational activities to be accounted for within the architecture and design techniques for employment against an as-is SoS architecture. We show how the operational activities and design techniques can be mapped to metrics used to compare alternative design configurations. These design configurations are then quantified in terms of the metrics for later comparison. We illustrate the framework using a generic DoD satellite communications (SATCOM) case study. Although our focus here is on a SATCOM example with a selected sub-et of attributes, the framework can be extended to address multiple similar issues across a multidomain space.},

Analysis of the current operating state and prediction of plausible future insecurity is crucial for real-time decision-making and implementation of necessary control strategies to ensure secure operation of bulk power systems. On-line security assessment demands low complexity and computational time. The traditional methods of assessment of dynamic security of electric power systems often prove to be inadequate for online and real-time conditions due to their high complexity and long computation time. This article proposes a pattern recognition approach to dynamic security analysis for large and complex power systems using ensemble decision tree to form reliable decision rules for fast and accurate prediction of power system&#39;s operating states in a real-time and on-line environment. An ensemble security predictor (ENSP) was developed and trained to act as “dynamic security state predictor” to predict and classify power system&#39;s dynamic operating states into secure, insecure, and intermediate transitional classes. Two different case studies were performed on IEEE 118-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed method on systems of varying size and complexity. While prediction accuracy of some of the single-learner classifiers decreased considerably when implemented on a large sized system, the performance of ENSP declined marginally, and the results were acceptable for very large sized systems.},

This article introduces a new security management system (SMS) for an industrial steam turbine. As such, the most probable threats, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attack, deception attack, and replay attack in various sensors and actuators of the steam turbine system, are considered. Then, a new SMS system consisting of an attack detection unit and an attack isolation unit is designed. The attack detection unit utilizes a dynamic neural network to detect any potential attack in the system using the concept of residual generation. The attack isolation unit identifies the type of attacks using an integrated feature selection strategy and support vector machine classifier through multisensor information. Several case studies are investigated to evaluate the proposed SMS. The test results show the effectiveness of the proposed SMS with multisensor information when compared to SMS without multisensor array.},

An artificial noise transmission scheme is used by CBS to protect the data against the eavesdropping security attacks at the cost of extra power consumption. To improve the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), we propose a SEE maximization (SEEM) scheme by exploiting the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdroppers under the secrecy rate (SR) constraints of the PBS-PU and CBS-CU channels, the quality-of-service requirement of the PU, and the transmit power constraint of the CBS. When the eavesdropping links&#39; instantaneous CSI are unknown at the legitimate transmitters (i.e., PBS and CBS), we propose another SEEM scheme based on the statistical CSI of the eavesdropping links. Since the formulated optimization problems with fractional objective functions are nonconvex and mathematically intractable, we first transform them into equivalent subtractive problems, and then, employ the difference of two-convex functions approximation method to arrive at approximate convex problems. In addition, new two-tier optimal BF algorithms are proposed. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and performance gains of our proposed SEEM schemes over conventional SR-only maximization and EE-only maximization schemes.},

  abstract     = {Today, countries are engaged in the cyber-arms race. With over 16 K new hardware/software vulnerabilities reported in 2018 alone, an important question confronts senior government decision makers when their cyber-warfare units discover a new vulnerability. Should they disclose the vulnerability to the vendor who produced the vulnerable product? Or should they “stockpile” the vulnerability, holding it for developing exploits (i.e., cyber-weapons) that can be targeted at an adversary? Choosing the first option may be important when the affected company is a corporation in the nation state that discovers the vulnerability and/or if that nation state would have a big exposure to that vulnerability. Choosing the second option has obvious advantages to the discovering nation&#39;s defense. We formulate the cyber-competition between countries as a repeated cyber-warfare game (RCWG), where two countries (players) compete over a series of vulnerabilities by deciding, at the time of vulnerability discovery, 1) whether to exploit or disclose it and 2) how long to exploit it if they decide to exploit. We define the equilibrium state of the RCWG as a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, and propose a learning-while-competing framework to compute the pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the formulated RCWG. Although testing our results with real data in the murky world of cyber-warfare is challenging, we were able to obtain real statistics from other sources and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm through a set of simulation results under different scenarios using these third-party statistics. We also report on our DiscX system that can help support government decision makers in their decision whether to disclose or exploit a vulnerability that they find.},

The voltage-dependent nature of loads is taken into account to further reduce the operating cost by managing the voltage levels. Branch and cut method is applied to handle the integrality constraints associated with the operation of DCDs. A globally convergent trust region algorithm (TRA) is applied to solve the integer-relaxed problems at each node during the branching process. The TRA subproblems are solved using interior point method. To reduce the branching burden of branch and cut algorithm, before applying TRA at each node, a simplified optimization problem is first solved. Using the convergence status and value of objective function of this problem, a faster decision is made on stopping the regarding branch. Solving the simplified problem obviates the application of TRA at most nodes. It is shown that the method converges to the optimal solution with a considerable saving in computation time according to the numerical studies.},

In this article, we present an automated multirobot control technique to find and spatially characterize general scalar field fronts. This is achieved with a multirobot system that adaptively sizes, orients, and translates based on data sampled by each robot in order to span the width of the front, and to move longitudinally along the front, reversing direction when the end of the front is reached. This span and scan functionality allows the cluster to spatially characterize the front&#39;s full extent and to enable comprehensive scientific study of its associated phenomenon. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive, adaptive multirobot front-following control strategy proposed for general front structures, and initial verification of its capability is provided through both simulation of behavior on a large-scale front and experimentation with a simple, small-scale indoor multirobot testbed.},

In the proposed algorithm, the position information of the GNSS, the velocity information of the DVL, and the attitude information of the CNS are introduced as measurement information to correct the divergence error of SINS. The federated filter is exploited for its flexibility and capability in fault toleration. To amend fault and recover information in local filters, a simplified state Chi-square test (SSCST) is utilized as the fault detection, isolation, and recovery procedure. Meanwhile, a new adaptive information sharing factor algorithm based on the results of SSCST and the residuals between the actual observations and the predicted observations is designed, which can adaptively reflect the performance of each local filter. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed integrated navigation and positioning algorithm can be improved and the system remains stable even when the error occurs.},

  abstract     = {As freshwater resources progressively decline, desalination capacities around the world are projected to increase. However, high electricity consumption costs hinder the broader development of desalination plants. A promising solution to offset a portion of these costs is to enable water distribution system operators (W-DSOs) to offer the flexibility of their water desalination plants in electricity markets. This article proposes a model to integrate the available flexibility of water desalination plants in W-DSOs operation and optimize their participation in electricity demand response (DR) and frequency regulation markets. The proposed model co-optimizes the operation of desalination plants with variable speed pumps and water storage tanks in order to optimally allocate the available WDS flexibility between the day-ahead energy and frequency regulation markets. The proposed model takes into account the hydraulic operating constraints of the WDS, thus ensuring the delivery of DR and regulation services in the markets while supplying the water demand at the desired pressure. In addition, the proposed model considers the unavailability of freshwater resources when providing flexibility services to the grid, thus enabling W-DSOs to balance their profits against water shortages. The numerical studies, conducted on a test 15-node water network, show that the proposed model effectively utilizes the operational flexibility of desalination plants to offer DR and regulation services in the markets, considering the hydraulic constraints of the WDS, freshwater availability conditions, and desalination plants’ freshwater recovery rates.},

This article proposes a covert communication scheme that allows D2D communication links to transmit covert signals (e.g., privacy sensitive data) to ensure a low probability of detection. We allocate transmit powers of cellular and D2D noncovert signals following a fading D2D channel to add the uncertainty in adversary&#39;s background noises. With the help of base station, cooperative power domain nonorthogonal multiple access and successive interference cancellation are used to decode covert signal. Depending on whether a D2D transmitter has the knowledge of adversary&#39;s detection threshold, we derive minimum error probability to measure the covertness performance. Furthermore, we evaluate covert throughput, which is defined as a maximum average transmission rate of covert signal, subject to a given covertness performance.},

The proposed scheme is based on comparison of phase angle of superimposed positive sequence component of current, with a preset threshold. The threshold value is decided by performing various simulations on standard test systems along with appropriate validation through analytical analysis. The performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated on different faults and severe stressed conditions by modeling IEEE-14 and IEEE-39 bus test systems in real-time digital simulator (RTDS/RSCAD) environment. The simulation results indicate that the presented scheme is able to distinguish symmetrical faults from severe stressed conditions effectively due to substantial change in the value of phase angle of superimposed positive sequence current. The threshold values utilized in the presented technique remains almost same for transposed/untransposed and uncompensated/compensated transmission networks. Comparative evaluation of the presented scheme with the existing scheme clearly indicates its superiority in differentiating symmetrical fault under severe stressed conditions.},

  abstract     = {To increase distributed energy resource (DER) utilization while reducing their negative influence, this article proposes an increment-exchange-based decentralized multiobjective optimal power flow (MO-OPF) algorithm for distribution grids with high-DER integration. In the MO-OPF model, the network operator and DER owners pursue their own operational and economic objectives while ensuring that voltages and branch power limits are satisfied throughout the network. The proposed algorithm enables the solution of the MO-OPF problem in a decentralized manner, without exposing any DER&#39;s private information to the network operator. Its core idea is to use the quadratic functions of coupling variables&#39; increments to describe the impact of DER owners on the network operator; then the network operator computes variables&#39; increments by solving accumulated quadratic programming problems. The resulting method can provide the same evenly distributed Pareto-optimal solutions as the centralized model, and it has plug-and-play features and scalability properties. Case studies on an IEEE 33-bus and a real 266-bus distribution system are carried out to demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithm.},

The method consists of two steps: first, a matrix of desired distances between all bus-pairs is computed based on base voltages and branch reactances and, second, coordinates that minimize the errors between desired and actual distances are found. The parallelization used in the latter step is particularly beneficial for interpreted languages; it is shown that layouts for relatively large systems (a few thousand buses) can be produced within seconds on a standard laptop computer using Python or Matlab. Predefined coordinates for selected buses can optionally be given as input. This can be useful, e.g., when one wants to retain some geographical aspects of the system or wish to compare a full and reduced network model. Although the focus here is on power systems, the algorithm can also be used for other types of networks.},

This article investigates the network performances due to uncoordinated DG and EV distribution. It also considers power quality-related performances such as the neutral current, energy loss, voltage imbalance, and bus voltage as a multiobjective optimization problem. The differential evolution optimization algorithm is employed to solve the multiobjective optimization problem to coordinate EV and DG in a distribution grid. This article proposed a method to coordinate EV and DG distribution. The proposed method allows DSOs to jointly optimize the phase sequence and optimal dispatch of DGs to improve the network&#39;s performance. If the network requires further improvement, the EV charging or discharging rate is coordinated for a particular location. The efficacy of the proposed method is tested in an Australian low-voltage distribution grid considering the amount of imbalance due to higher penetration of DG and EV. It is observed that the proposed method reduces voltage unbalance factor by up to 98.24\%, neutral current up to 94\%, and energy loss by 59.45\%, and improve bus voltage by 10.42\%.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology enables bidirectional charging of electric vehicle (EV) and facilitates power grid ancillary services. However, battery pack in EV may develop in-cell dynamic variations over time. This is due to the structural complexity and electrochemical operations in the battery pack. These variations may arise in V2G systems due to: first, additional charging and discharging cycles to power grid; second, external shocks; and third, long exposures to high temperatures. A particular source of these variations is due to faulty sensors. Therefore, it can be argued that the battery packs in EV are highly reliant on the monitoring of these in-cell variations and their impact of propagation with each involved component. In this article, a prediction-based scheme to monitor the health of variation induced sensors is proposed. First, a propagation model is developed to predict the in-cell variations of a battery pack by calculating the covariance using a median-based expectation. Second, a hypothesis model is developed to detect and isolate each variation. This is obtained by deriving a conditional probability-based density function for the measurements. The proposed monitoring framework is evaluated using experimental measurements collected from Li-ion battery pack in EVs. The in-cell variation profiles have been verified using D-SAT Chroma 8000ATS hardware platform. The performance results of the proposed scheme show accurate analysis of these emerged variations.},

To address this problem, we analyze the positive correlation between the service-time and access loads based on queuing theory, and build a multigranular service-time series according to variations in the volume of information contained at different time granularities. Furthermore, we propose a new wavelet decomposition (WD) based support vector regression (SVR) and moving average (MA) (WD-SVR-MA) model based on service-time decomposition theory. In order to predict the service-time accurately using our method, subsequences with nonstationary long-term trends and subsequences with stationary random fluctuations are extracted from the service-time series by WD, and predicted using the combined SVR and MA model. We compared the performance of the proposed method with other six models in experiments. Thick granularity and thin granularity service-time series were extracted from the log files of the “Tianditu” web map service platform. The proposed multigranular WD-SVR-MA model provides a variety of multigranular prediction results, demonstrating the superior performance and robustness, which are suitable for different scenarios.},

We use the advantage of OFDM signals and present an adaptive structure to match the complex weights of OFDM signal with the radar scene for making complete use of the transmission power. The interference reflections are utilized rather than eliminating them to design the weights of the transmitted OFDM signal. The optimization algorithm for designing transmitted signals is based on adaptive learning whose essential information is obtained by a feedback between receiver and transmitter. This feedback includes essential target and interference characteristics which extracted from the reflected echoes. Based on changes in interference features, the weights of the transmitted OFDM signal on each subcarrier are designed and transmitted in the next coherent processing interval. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach achieves a higher rate of performance compared to nonadaptive waveform design approaches.},

We implement CreditBank based on the Xen and Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisors and evaluate its performance.

  abstract     = {In a power system with high penetration of renewable power sources, gas-fired units can be considered as a back-up option to improve the balance between generation and consumption in short-term scheduling. Therefore, closer coordination between power and natural gas systems is anticipated. This article presents a novel hybrid information gap decision theory (IGDT)-stochastic cooptimization problem for integrating electricity and natural gas networks to minimize total operation cost with the penetration of wind energy. The proposed model considers not only the uncertainties regarding electrical load demand and wind power output, but also the uncertainties of gas load demands for the residential consumers. The uncertainties of electric load and wind power are handled through a scenario-based approach, and residential gas load uncertainty is handled via IGDT approach with no need for the probability density function. The introduced hybrid model enables the system operator to consider the advantages of both approaches simultaneously. The impact of gas load uncertainty associated with the residential consumers is more significant on the power dispatch of gas-fired plants and power system operation cost since residential gas load demands are prior than gas load demands of gas-fired units. The proposed framework is a bilevel problem that can be reduced to a one-level problem. Also, it can be solved by the implementation of a simple concept without the need for Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Moreover, emerging flexible energy sources such as the power to gas technology and demand response program are considered in the proposed model for increasing the wind power dispatch, decreasing the total operation cost of the integrated network as well as reducing the effect of system uncertainties on the total operating cost. Numerical results indicate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model under different working conditions.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an economic model predictive control (EMPC) algorithm for reducing losses and increasing the resilience of medium-voltage electricity distribution grids characterized by high penetration of renewable energy sources and possibly subject to natural or malicious adverse events. The proposed control system optimizes grid operations through network reconfiguration, control of distributed energy storage systems (ESSs), and on-load tap changers. The core of the EMPC algorithm is a nonconvex optimization problem integrating the ESSs dynamics, the topological and power technical constraints of the grid, and the modeling of the cascading effects of potential adverse events. An equivalent (i.e., having the same optimal solution) proxy of the nonconvex problem is proposed to make the solution more tractable. Simulations performed on a 16-bus test distribution network validate the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {The rate loss is an important issue in multiuser beamspace multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) millimeter-wave systems. In such systems, multicluster channel propagation results in quantization error (QE), and consequently, each active user suffers a significant rate loss. A conventional single beam selection (SBS) scheme is used in an equivalent beamspace MIMO channel to reduce the number of radio frequency (RF) chains required. However, this scheme does not properly mitigate the QE due to the limited number of channel propagation clusters per user. In addition, optimally selected RF chains are operated at the same number of precoded data streams. As a result, each active user inherently loses a huge number of data streams when utilizing the conventional SBS scheme. Therefore, we propose a novel hybrid beam selection scheme in an equivalent beamspace MIMO channel to enable multiple beam group selection and to achieve a reliable channel cluster for every active user, which directly aids in the mitigation of the QE. The numerical result is verified using computer simulations in a millimeter-wave MIMO downlink channel environment.},

Unfortunately, most existing approaches focus primarily on the first two issues. However, during the stroke rehabilitation process, occlusion leads to incorrect judgements even for medical staff. In order to tackle these three important issues simultaneously, we propose a heterogeneous sensor fusion framework composed of an RGB-D camera and a wearable device to consider occlusion and provide robust joint locations for rehabilitation. To fuse multiple sensor measurements when compensating for occlusion, we apply heterogeneous sensor simultaneous localization, tracking, and modeling to estimate the locations of joints and sensors and construct an upper extremity model for occlusion situation. Virtual measurements based on this model are used to estimate the joint&#39;s location during occlusion, and a virtual relative orientation technique is applied to relax system limitations regarding orientation. Experimental results using the proposed approach with synthetic data and data collected from ten subjects show a 4.6 cm error on average and about 15 cm error on average during occlusion. This constitutes a more robust approach for stroke patients which takes into account these three important issues.},

The increased penetration of the high sampling frequency phasor measurement units (PMUs) enables using PMU data to analyze power system events, and thus enhances power system visualization, monitoring and control. At the same time, the risks associated with cyberattacks on power systems increase. A malicious cyberattack on PMUs, aiming at generating fake transient data, may lead to incorrect actions that jeopardize system reliability. Therefore, it is critical to distinguish between fake data and real data when analyzing transient events. Utilizing PMU measurements, this article develops a data-driven approach, based on text-mining methodologies, for classifying transient events and identifying fake events caused by false data attacks. The developed methodology provides credible information regarding the cause of various events, and facilitates postevent decision-making to prevent potential cascading failures. Case studies, performed on the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems, show that the developed approach is efficient in classifying false data and identifying different transient events regardless of the system topology, loading conditions, or the placement of PMUs.},

Naturally, the security of the data transmission in VANET has become one of the urgent tasks of researchers. Many privacy-preserving authentication protocols for VANETs have been presented. However, heavy computations and security flaws exist in them. Thus, we put forward a lightweight authentication protocol in a suitable communication model for VANET that meets the privacy protection needs, with only hash functions and exclusive-OR operations. Formal security analysis using BAN logic shows that our protocol achieves the security goals. Proverif is used to verify the security of the protocol and the results show that the privacy can be guaranteed under the simulated attacker. Moreover, through security properties analysis, our protocol is robust enough to get rid of common attacks and keep the communication data secretly. The performance comparison results show that our protocol is lightweight and efficient. Furthermore, we simulate the network with SUMO and NS-3, and all show that our protocol is efficient and practical for VANETs.},

Based on this motivation, the main contribution of this article is secure consensus control of MASs in the presences of uncertain nonlinearities in agents models. An MAS is considered consisting of a set of normal agents and a set of attacked malicious agents. A criterion is developed under which each normal agent at each time instant selects safer interaction links to avoid divergence from a consensus/agreement state in the presence of the unknown malicious agents. Accordingly, a network of nonlinear robust controllers is proposed such that under the selection criterion and in the presence of uncertain nonlinearities in the agents models, consensus among the normal agents is guaranteed. Numerical examples validate the accuracy of the proposed consensus control scheme.},

In this study, a branch exchange technique with an optimization method is used to determine the best network arrangement. Simulation results are implemented in different scenarios. In each of the scenarios, power quality indices and network losses before and after the optimization are compared. The results indicate that by using the proposed method, the rate of power quality indices and the losses in the case study are reduced.

To realize a multinode charging, an anchor optimization strategy to optimize the position of anchor point in the cell is proposed. Then, in order to solve the path planning problem of MD, a discrete fireworks algorithm (DFWA) based on population entropy (PE-FWA) is proposed.

The HIAF have the same V-I characteristics as HIF, but the enormous amount of heat generation is a significant concern to differentiate between them. Moreover, there are different types of arc which may occur depending on the arcing conditions and arcing surfaces. In this article, arc due to leaning-tree on a medium-voltage distribution line and the arc in between sphere-gaps are considered as the main event of analysis. An empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based approach is used along with artificial neural network (ANN) for the analysis of real-time arc signals. The result obtained by the application of EMD and ANN on arc voltage signals successfully detects and classifies the arcing events by their predominant harmonic signatures. A comparison of EMD results with other techniques is presented. Arc in soil and wet-sand is also considered for the validation of the proposed algorithm for other arcing surfaces.

The contribution of this article is twofold: First, an efficient computer vision technique is proposed to identify areas with high density of low mobility or stationary users. This is done using a multistep process, which includes image acquisition, classification, and crowd density estimation. Next, an accurate mathematical model is presented for joint optimization of drone base stations placement and user assignment. The goal here is to maximize the number of serviced users with minimum number of drones, while satisfying practical network constraints. An optimal solution to such a biobjective optimization problem has complexity exponential to the network size. Furthermore, a low complexity heuristic is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Complexity analysis of the proposed solution is then carried out. Simulation results for a number of practical network scenarios demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a performance comparable to the optimal solution.},

Miscommunication occurs when communication results in a “deficiency” or “problem” that hinders parties from fulfilling their individual or collective values. A recent study demonstrated widespread miscommunication in a Fortune 500 engineering firm about the definition of “an estimate” in a complex system design context. Building on that work, this article used a Monte Carlo simulation (8800 runs) of an agent-based model to demonstrate how systemic design process miscommunication may affect complex system performance. Each run of the simulation created a unique 1000-artifact system using a network generation algorithm and converged its design through optimization. Systems where estimates communicated “current” designs outperformed systems where estimates communicated “future” projections of their designs instead. Varying the fraction of the population, which uses each definition of an estimate varied system performance and uncertainty. Whether related to estimate definitions or more generally, this article demonstrates that miscommunication may affect system performance.},

Here, we address these problems by incorporating strong-motion seismic data and changing processing parameters accordingly, which extends the upper limit of applicable magnitudes to M9. In a simulated process, this earthquake is properly determined as thrust faulting with M8.6 offshore northeast Japan within 431 s of the first phase arrival. We also evaluate its performance. After improvements, four recent large earthquakes (M7.0-7.9) were properly processed in real time. The successful determination ratio is 100\% for events with Japanese seismic intensity ≥6 Lower, and 100\% for events with M&gt;7 except nearly simultaneous events. Source parameters with and without fixed horizontal locations are provided within 100-250 and 100-600 s of the first P arrival, respectively. This system is valuable for disaster mitigation because it rapidly provides information for use in tsunami warning and early damage assessment.},

Indeed, according to a recent Gartner study, 50 billion connected objects will be deployed by 2020. IoT will make our cities and daily applications smart. However, IoT technologies also open up multiple risks and privacy issues. Due to hardware limitations of IoT objects, implementing and deploying robust and efficient security and privacy solutions for the IoT environment remains a significant challenge. One-time password (OTP) is an authentication scheme that represents a promising solution for IoT and smart cities environments. We extend the OTP principle and propose a novel approach of OTP generation that relies on elliptic curve cryptography and isogeny in order to ensure IoT security. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach with a real implementation and compared its performance with two other approaches namely, hash message authentication code-based OTP and time-based OTP. The performance results obtained demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in terms of security and performance.},

  abstract     = {The intermittency in weather complicates the task of determining the optimal setting of protective relays in hybrid photovoltaic (PV)-wind-based microgrids. Classical overcurrent relays quite often maloperate during fluctuations in wind speed and solar irradiance. Motivated by the significance of reducing the sensitivity of microgrid protection against weather intermittency, this article proposes a protection scheme based on the combined framework of stochastic modeling of weather intermittency using probability distribution function and ensemble-based classifier. Considering the possible similar weather scenario to which both the distributed energy resources are subjected to, the covariability has been considered to develop the joint probabilistic model of variation in wind speed and solar irradiance. The model derived using the historical data allows incorporating the weather intermittency in the formulation of the protection algorithm. The data generated under intermittency are processed using a wavelet transform to derive discriminatory attributes. Using the derived attributes, a rotation forest-based classifier has been developed to perform fault detection/classification and faulty section identification. The scheme has been validated for a wide range of weather and fault scenarios. The comparison of the proposed scheme with other reported techniques reflects its significance in providing resilient and robust protection to the microgrid against weather intermittency.},

The application of these technologies in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) reduces the dependence on battery energy. However, there are few studies on the energy supply strategy for a whole WSN system. In this article, using a tree-based WSN, we propose a novel energy supply strategy for a whole system by combining SWIPT and EH from both RF and ambient energy sources. To this end, the sensing data transmission schedules for all sensor nodes are derived and then, the frame structure and operation are analyzed in real time. Our extensive simulation results prove that the implementation of the novel energy supply system in WSNs can provide stable data delivery and guarantee a perpetual energy supply for WSNs if the parameters are carefully designed based on our proposed principles.},

We use directional probabilistic sensors, and combine probabilistic and directional sensing model features to characterize the quality of coverage more accurately in an energy efficient manner. Based on the analysis of the collaborative detection probability with multiple sensors, we formulate the minimum energy connected target ε-probability coverage problem, aiming at minimizing the total energy cost while satisfying the requirements of both coverage and connectivity. By a reduction from a unit disk cover, we prove that the problem is nondeterministic polynomial (NP)-hard, and present an approximation algorithm with provable time complexity and approximation ratio.

The absolute and normalized channel-power-based scheduling schemes are adopted when channel state information (CSI) is available at the relay node. In the absence of CSI, we consider the random scheduling scheme, where user pairs are selected randomly. To characterize the residual self-interference (RSI) at the full-duplex relay and user nodes, the fading-channel-based approach is used, and RSI is modeled as a Rician-distributed random variable. Using the Gaussian-Chebyshev approximation, expressions for the outage probability and the average rate are derived for the adopted scheduling schemes, and their performance is compared with the hybrid scheduling scheme assuming independent and nonidentically distributed channels. The analytical results are validated through simulations.

From the location-tracking history, the resident&#39;s daily activities and social interactions can be inferred. In our experiments, the proposed system obtains promising results.

Among these sensors, LiDAR is probably the most critical and a high-end LiDAR can cost several tens of thousands USD. High cost of sensors can be a formidable barrier to the proliferation of autonomous vehicles. This article proposes the idea of installing LiDAR sensors on roadside lamp posts for sharing among passing vehicles. This can avoid installing expensive sensors onboard each vehicle. Due to limited computation resources at lamp posts, the task of processing sensor data into environment maps for broadcast to vehicles are performed at edge-cloud servers. This article develops a scheme to identify which edge-cloud servers to host the virtual machines for which lamp posts, so that the total computation and communication cost can be minimized. The proposed scheme exploits reuse of existing data at servers for lower cost. The scheme is formulated as a mixed integer program, which is NP-hard. Therefore, we further propose an iterative algorithm with LP-relaxation to find good approximate solutions to the optimization. Extensive evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. As an example, for a system with 50 lamp posts, the proposed algorithm can find solutions in less than 5 s while solving the original optimization using exhaustive search takes more than 24 h.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a single-stage hybrid photovoltaic (PV)-fuel cell (FC)-based grid-integrated system with Lyapunov function-based controller design to obtain optimal power extraction from hybrid renewable sources without maximum power point tracking (MPPT) application. The proposed Lyapunov controller performs MPPT function, improves power quality, and forces inverter to inject sinusoidal current to the utility grid. In this proposed approach, the higher switching frequency has been reduced by employing LCL filter inclusion compared to the two-stage hybrid power system. This proposed single-stage system has low cost and improved power quality at the point of common coupling and employed controller injects stable power to the utility grid. In this article, a hybrid overall distributed-particle swarm optimization-based MPPT is employed with FCs and integrated CUK converter. The effectiveness of the employed Lyapunov function-based controller has been tested with dSPACE (DS1104) real-time platform for single-stage hybrid grid-connected power system under varying operating conditions that have high efficiency, reduced harmonic distortion in grid current with the simpler employed power converter. Experimental responses confirm the effectiveness of the proposed controller, which transfers the hybrid power from PV and FC to the utility grid through a single stage.},

Sliding mode control, multilayer neural network, and adaptive robust techniques are employed to design a formation controller for underwater vehicles. After that, a Lyapunov-based stability analysis is proposed to guarantee that all variables are uniformly ultimately bounded in the closed-loop control system. The following advantages of this approach are highlighted: 1) the proposed control strategy only depends on the measurements of line-of-sight and angle sensors; no other information about the leader vehicle is required; 2) a continuous function is designed to replace the signum term in the control system, which greatly reduces the inherent chattering of sliding mode controller; 3) the proposed controller does not rely on any prior knowledge about hydrodynamic damping and external disturbances, which is easily implemented in practice. Finally, the numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {Energy-efficient wireless system design has gained considerable attraction owing to the widespread proliferation of wireless devices. The next-generation wireless systems should also be spectrally efficient to sustain the tremendous demand for wireless services. Full-duplex (FD) systems have the potential to double the spectral efficiency (SE) of current half-duplex communication systems. The major challenge in FD systems is the suppression of strong self-interference (SI) imposed by the transmit signal on its receiving antennas. However, SI can also be utilized for recycling of energy by exploiting the radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) techniques, which is commonly referred to as self-energy recycling (S-ER). S-ER improves the overall energy efficiency (EE) of the system via recycling a portion of transmitted power. In this article, we evaluate the EE for a downlink FD nonlinear multiuser multi-input-multi-output (MU-MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system in the presence of S-ER. The proposed analytical formulation consists of closed-form derivation for EE and SE of the aforementioned system. Furthermore, we have also obtained the outage performance and based on this performance proposed a methodology to allocate the antennas for S-ER while satisfying the quality of service. It has been observed that reserving few antennas for S-ER improves the EE albeit with a slight degradation in SE due to reduced array gain. Consequently, with S-ER, the tradeoff between the SE and EE has been studied for a nonlinear MU-MIMO-OFDM system. Analytical derivation for EE, SE, and outage are followed by simulations for corroborating the proposed analysis.},

This article proposes a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) SLAM algorithm for an AUV equipped with a mechanically scanning imaging sonar (MSIS) that has a very slow scanning frequency. To tackle the issues of scan distortion and sonar data sparseness caused by the slow-sampling MSIS, the core of the algorithm is a carefully designed sliding window-based scan forming module. Then the formed scans are fed into the modified RBPF to build a consistent grid-based map thus localizing the AUV accurately. Extensive simulation and experiments are carried out to verify the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing ones in terms of the level of map consistency with the environment as well as the accuracy of pose estimation.},

  abstract     = {Systems engineering processes (SEPs) coordinate the effort of different individuals to generate a product satisfying certain requirements. As the involved engineers are self-interested agents, the goals at different levels of the systems engineering hierarchy may deviate from the system-level goals, which may cause budget and schedule overruns. Therefore, there is a need of a systems engineering theory that accounts for the human behavior in systems design. As experience in the physical sciences shows, a lot of knowledge can be generated by studying simple hypothetical scenarios, which nevertheless retain some aspects of the original problem. To this end, the objective of this article is to study the simplest conceivable SEP, a principalagent model of a one-shot, shallow SEP. We assume that the systems engineer (SE) maximizes the expected utility of the system, while the subsystem engineers (sSE) seek to maximize their expected utilities. Furthermore, the SE is unable to monitor the effort of the sSE and may not have complete information about their types. However, the SE can incentivize the sSE by proposing specific contracts. To obtain an optimal incentive, we pose and solve numerically a bilevel optimization problem. Through extensive simulations, we study the optimal incentives arising from different system-level value functions under various combinations of effort costs, problem-solving skills, and task complexities. Our numerical examples show that, the passed-down requirements to the agents increase as the task complexity and uncertainty grow and they decrease with increasing the agents&#39; costs.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the impact of interharmonics generated in photovoltaic (PV) integrated systems on phasor measurement unit (PMU)-assisted zone-3 protection scheme (Z3PS) is investigated. Generally, PMUs integrated with conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm are employed to compute time-synchronized voltage and current phasors. However, the presence of interharmonics in PV integrated systems may force to cease the proper performance of Z3PS since DFT algorithm integrated with PMUs fails to identify and eliminate closely spaced interharmonics resulting in incorrect computation of phasors. This phenomena further leads to improper estimation of apparent impedances by relays. To overcome this issue, a phasor signal processing model (PSPM) is proposed where a preprocessing filtering step involving signal processing by an estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) or matrix pencil (MP) algorithm is added before PMUs. Proposed PSPM helps in eliminating noise and closely spaced interharmonics present in the signals and consequently, enhances the performance of PMU-assisted Z3PS. Integration of PV to IEEE 39-bus system is done in PSCAD/EMTDC software whereas ESPRIT and MP algorithms are implemented in MATLAB. Comparative analysis with exiting methods are carried out for systems operating under different conditions to examine the performance of the proposed Z3PS.},

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are paving new ground with increasing levels of automation and usage in applications with complex environments, posing greater challenges in terms of safety and reliability. The increasing complexity of CPS environments, tasks, and systems leads to more uncertainties. Unless properly managed, these uncertainties may lead to false detection of real fault condition of a system, which in turn may affect decision making and potentially cause fatal consequences. In order to implement safety-critical missions, such as autonomous driving, it is essential to develop a reliable monitoring and assessment service dealing with the complexity and uncertainty issues. In this article, we propose a fault detection function based on Bayesian inference, which combines empirical knowledge with information of the specific system. By considering uncertainties as possible causes for false detection, various uncertainties during the detection process are analyzed, and the ways to quantify and propagate them are explored. As a result, probabilistic inference is achieved for distinguishing system faults from uncertainties, which contributes to more reliable detection results regarding system faults under dynamically changing environments. A case study on an microelectro mechanical system (MEMS) accelerometer is conducted and the result shows that the fault detection function effectively distinguishes system faults and uncertainties arising from the environment.},

This article proposes an integrated framework to convert weather forecast into appropriate information for preventive operation during hurricanes so that the power outages induced by hurricanes can be reduced. To achieve this goal, first, a structural model of the transmission towers is developed to estimate failure probabilities based on the wind speed. These probabilities are then integrated within a day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment framework to guide preventive operation. The resulting day-ahead schedule will be more reliable as it will rely less on the elements that are likely to fail. Simulation studies, conducted on the IEEE 118-bus system affected by synthesized Irma and Harvey hurricanes, showed that the proposed framework was able to prevent 33\% to 83\% of the blackouts. Further research is required to investigate the impacts of flooding, damage to the distribution network, and weather forecast uncertainty.},

Under an angle-based channel state information (CSI) error model, we formulate an optimization problem with the aim to maximize the minimal worst-case achievable secrecy rate among all SUs, while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for each SU, the interference limit for a primary satellite earth station, and the power consumption limit for the base station. To handle the intractable problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on a series of approximations and a concept of the convex hull. Specifically, the former is for jointly designing secure beamformers and power splitting ratios, and the latter is for ensuring robustness to the angle-based CSI uncertainty. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity of this algorithm and extend the proposed scheme for solving a weighted sum secrecy rate maximization problem. Numerical results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme compared to the existing approaches, and obtain an insight into different robust designs.},

The need for efficiency is at the core of tradespace exploration, where a large region of the solution space needs to be explored before anchoring to a specific solution or solution set. In conceptual design and systems architecture, solutions are modeled by leveraging independent models that are connected by an overarching model. In designing verification strategies, however, verification activities cannot be modeled independently of the overall strategy in which they are used. As a result, probabilities associated with the confidence generated by each verification activity, need to be elicited for each candidate verification strategy individually. This requires, in principle, to generate a specific model for each solution in the solution space, which may hamper efficiency. In this article, we show that Bayesian inference can be used to overcome this limitation. In particular, the proposed process in this article uses only one elicitation activity for an overarching verification strategy and then leverages Bayesian inference to determine automatically the probabilities of other verification strategies in the solution space.},

Employing a relay node to extend the lifetime of critical node is an important problem in network lifetime maximization, whereas energy consumption of relay node is also a limiting factor. Consequently, maximizing the lifetime of critical node and minimizing consumption of relay node are the two main conflicting objectives that are met by applying the multiobjective optimization. To transform the above objectives into a single objective, weighted sum method is applied, which uses weights. Moreover, the RNP problem investigated in this article is a nonconvex problem, which difference convex algorithm (DCA), is developed in order to compute the optimal solution. Application of DCA offers the advantage of finding a global optimal solution. Simulation results backed by theoretical analysis confirm that the proposed approach is superior to the relay node adjustment method in terms of extending the network lifetime and efficiency, whereas their computational complexity is the same.},

  abstract     = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technology to efficiently improve the achievable rate of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) enabled visible light communication (VLC) systems. Nevertheless, for conventional MIMO techniques such as spatial diversity (SD) and spatial multiplexing (SMP), the working mode of each LED transmitter is independent of users&#39; spatial positions. In this article, we propose and investigate three user-centric MIMO techniques, including SD/SMP switching, adaptive SMP (aSMP), and SD-aided aSMP (SD-aSMP), for achievable rate improvement of indoor MIMO-VLC systems, by exploiting users&#39; spatial positions as a new degree of diversity. The analytical and simulation results show that the achievable rate of a 4 × 4 MIMO-VLC system in a typical indoor environment can be significantly improved by applying the user-centric MIMO techniques compared with the conventional ones. More specifically, SD/SMP switching can enjoy both high diversity gain of SD and high multiplexing gain of SMP at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions, while aSMP mitigates the adverse effect of noise amplification in conventional SMP and SD-aSMP can benefit from additional diversity gain. Furthermore, we also show that the proposed user-centric MIMO techniques outperform conventional MIMO techniques under the condition of only slightly increased computational complexity with limited feedback information.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a procurement-based user association scheme for LTE-advanced HetNets. The proposed scheme enables LTE macrocell (LMC) to leverage capacity from femtocells (FCs) and fulfill the excess demand of the registered LMC (rLMC) users. Additionally, we propose an energy-efficient and quality- of-service (QoS)-ensured resource allocation scheme for rLMC users. Although the existing solutions capacitate 2G/3G-based cellular networks to leverage resources from complementary networks, such as WiFi, they are not well suited for LTE-advanced networks because of the different architectures. Moreover, the existing solutions are centered on rate-adaptive resource allocation, which is limited in capability of offering guaranteed bit rate (GBR) services to the rLMC users. The proposed scheme has manifold notable features. First, unlike the existing solutions, it implicitly ensures QoS of offloaded rLMC users. Second, it encourages competition among FCs, which results in cost-effective user association for LMC. Third, it is adaptive to the stochastic nature of users&#39; demands. Finally, for data rate calculation, we use lookup tables in 3GPP standards for LTE-advanced. This makes the approach practically implementable in LTE-advanced HetNets. Numerical simulations of the proposed solution and the corresponding insights of the results justify the suitability of the proposed scheme for LTE-advanced HetNets.},

The first module plans each AUV&#39;s path under the BMC protocol, respectively, along which the AUV will avoid obstacles and navigate to the destination with the minimum time through the ocean current. Incorporating the cooperative constraint of simultaneous arrival, the second part chooses the AUV path with the maximal voyage time as a benchmark, and replans other AUVs&#39; paths using the BMC method until their corresponding voyage time is approximately equal to the benchmark.

Unlike others, we treat the objectives simultaneously as a multiobjective problem without preferences and analyze the opportunity of feasible tradeoff improvement in an objective space for communication over block-fading Rayleigh channel. We consider the improvement relative to the referent case that includes the current practice, where decision space consists of packet length, the maximal number of allowed transmission attempts (MNATA), and transmission power. Our hypothesis is that we can improve the tradeoff by modifying decision space and mapping functions from decision to objective space. We consider three modification techniques applied singly and jointly: Introduction of the expected MNATA as a real variable; Pareto optimal control of transmission power and transmitter power consumption; and introduction of the new decision variable-transmission rate. We show by mathematical modeling and numerical evaluation based on SI4455 transceiver that Pareto fronts (PF) attained by the application of techniques at least weakly dominate the referent PF; PF set cardinality can even be doubled; the joint application of techniques improves EE, reliability objectives, averaged over the entire PF, by approximately 49\% and 74\%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Spectrum sensing is important for a cognitive radio (CR) system to protect primary users (PUs) from harmful interference. At present, most of the existing sensing schemes are proposed in Gaussian noise environments. Nevertheless, a CR system actually also suffers from non-Gaussian noise, such as man-made impulsive noise, ultrawideband interference and co-channel interference. In this article, to handle the degradation of detection performance in non-Gaussian impulsive noise environments, a robust spectrum sensing scheme named hyperbolic tangent-based energy detector (HT-ED) is proposed. The hyperbolic tangent function is applied to suppress the impulsive noise by the nonlinear behavior, but without restraining the normal noise by the linear behavior. This property enables the new method to achieve the good detection performance in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise environments. In addition, it is similar to an energy detector, the new detector does not need to know the characteristics of the PU&#39;s signal. The performance analysis of the proposed HT-ED scheme is also presented. The simulation results show the HT-ED is robust against impulsive noise, which is modeled as Laplace or α-stable noise. Moreover, the HT-ED provides a superior detection performance compared with the other existing relative methods in a wide range of non-Gaussian noise.},

  abstract     = {Based on directional modulation (DM), robust beamforming matrix design for sum secrecy rate maximization is investigated in this article in multiuser systems. First, in case of random estimation error of direction angles toward eavesdroppers, a Von Mises distribution-sum secrecy rate maximization (VMD-SSRM) method is proposed to maximize the sum secrecy rate. Semidefinite relaxation and first-order approximation based on Taylor expansion are employed to solve the optimization problem in VMD-SSRM. Then in order to optimize the sum secrecy rate in the case of the worst estimation errors of direction angles, a maximum angle estimation error-SSRM (MAEE-SSRM) method is proposed. The optimization problem is constructed based on the upper and lower bounds of the estimated eavesdropping channel related coefficient and then solved by the change of the variable. Simulation results show that our two proposed methods have better sum secrecy rates than the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, when the estimation error of direction angle toward each eavesdropper is random but within a certain range, the secrecy performance of our VMD-SSRM method is better than that of our MAEE-SSRM method. On contrary, when the direction angle estimation error reaches its maximum, our MAEE-SSRM method performs better.},

The major steps of the modeling method utilized include define problem, define context level, define technical requirements, define logical level, and define physical level.

  abstract     = {Small cell densification is one of the effective ideas addressing the demand for higher capacity in cellular networks. The major problem in such networks is the limited capacity of wireless backhaul links. Caching the popular files in the memories of small cell base stations (SBSs) is an effective solution to this problem. One of the main challenges in caching is choosing the files to be stored in the memory of SBSs, especially when some SBSs have overlapped coverage. In this article, we propose a new caching scheme by exploiting the concept of graph coloring. To this end, we model the network scenario by a graph. This graph is divided into four subgraphs, i.e., placement, access, SBS, and delivery graphs. Through some modifications to the SBS graph, we convert it to a graph that can be colored. Then, we propose a graph coloring-based scheme to cache the popular files. We also derive a lower-bound for the hit rate improvement of our scheme compared to the conventional scheme which caches the most popular files anywhere. We evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme through simulations. Our results show that by employing the proposed scheme in a typical network, the load on the backhaul links is reduced significantly in average compared to the conventional scheme and some previously proposed schemes.},

The loss of connectivity often leads to degrade performance and inability to fulfill the application mission. To address this issue, several proposals have been made in the literature where node mobility is exploited to re-establish connectivity. These proposals, however, focus on minimizing the number of mobile nodes and the traveled distance cost while ignoring important factors, such as robot battery level, network lifetime, and environmental conditions, that may limit or hinder the whole recovery process. To overcome these limitations, we present a distributed node repositioning algorithm based on fuzzy logic. We evaluate our approach via extensive simulations and prototype experiments using Khepera IV robots. The results demonstrate superior performance to that of contemporary approaches.},

The cable connection system should ensure the collection of electricity successfully and reduce the cable cost optimally. Cables are prohibited from crossing restricted land areas, such as reserves, oil wells, and rocky areas. Therefore, in this article, a restricted area is added to the planning area of onshore wind farms. To obtain more accurate final optimized results, we consider topographic factors of onshore wind farms in the optimization process. The algorithm used for cable connection optimization is the dynamic minimum spanning tree. Results indicate the nonnegligible effects of the restricted area and topographic factors on the cable connection topology. The total cable cost savings can exceed 1.8\% compared with the reference cable connection topology, in which the topographic factors and restricted area are not considered.},

  abstract     = {Recently, radar frequency bands have been considered as promising candidates for cognitive radio (CR) owing to their low utilization. From a temporal access perspective, a substantial number of spectral opportunities could be exploited if CR users could achieve rotational synchronization with radar. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has been focused on this synchronization issue. In this article, we propose a rotational synchronization scheme between radar and CR networks to opportunistically access the radar band. First, we propose a framed structure with sensing and transmission phases reflecting the rotational characteristics of radar. Second, we provide a cooperative synchronization algorithm. To determine the appropriate spectrum sensing timing in the proposed frame, we use a statistical approach via maximum a posteriori estimation considering the sensing abilities of CR users. We analyze the synchronization error of our proposed scheme via simulations.},

So, uRET is designed for reliable event transport from sensors to a cloud server. A proof of concept prototype is implemented for field tests by APIs of common map platforms.

  abstract     = {This article designs a joint decision model to solve cell formation and product scheduling problems together in cellular manufacturing systems. Multifunctional machines and multiskilled workers need to be grouped and assigned to work cells. Because of the latter&#39;s learning and forgetting effects, the production rate of each operation that requires the same machine function and is handled by the same pair of a machine and worker is different. Each product with an operation sequence is allowed to move from one machine to another for processing its subsequent operation, which may reduce product processing time at the expense of additional product movement time. In order to solve this intertwined optimization problem, an improved bacterial foraging algorithm (IBFA) is proposed to minimize makespan. In IBFA, a bacterium returns to the best position, once a worse tumble or swimming result occurs. Each bacterium can, thus, always go ahead toward favorable positions in the chemotactic procedure. In IBFA&#39;s reproduction strategy, half of the best bacteria are retained; while new bacteria are produced via crossover operations, and selectively retained. Through this method, high-quality and diversified population is produced. Moreover, in the reproduction and elimination-dispersal strategies of IBFA, the best bacterium can be retained to the subsequent generation through a population sorting method. Computational experiments and t-test are conducted to show that the proposed algorithm has the better performance than the classical one, genetic algorithm and two hybridized bacterial foraging algorithms given the same computational budget.},

  abstract     = {Underground coal mines are susceptible to many kinds of hazards. Mine fire is one of the most vulnerable threats that leads to loss of human lives and other resources inside the mines. Hence, continuous monitoring of underground coal mines is very important for early detection of mine fire. Nowadays, wireless sensor networks are being widely used for monitoring underground coal mines. However, the collected data from sensor nodes are inaccurate in nature, and there is a need for analyzing such data for taking preventive measure. In this article, we propose an optimized fuzzy logic-based fire monitoring system for wireless underground sensor network, which strengthens reliability of making decision in preventing mine fire. However, storing of large fuzzy rule set in the memory constraint sensor nodes and their traversal for every sensor reading are very challenging. Therefore, we use the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm to optimize the proposed fuzzy system that eliminates redundant rules but preserves event detection accuracy of the monitoring system. The proposed system is simulated using BPSO algorithm and Fuzzy Logic Toolbox inbuilt in the MATLAB. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the existing monitoring systems for underground coal mines.},

The first two subsystems are used to develop the elevator systems, and the third subsystem is used to receive requests issued by the passengers. These three subsystems work in parallel, and communicate with each other through sending and receiving messages. ElevatorTalk can connect to a real elevator system to serve as the elevator management center. It can also emulate the existing elevator systems with different car scheduling algorithms. We propose an intelligent aggressive car scheduling with initial car distribution (ACSICD) algorithm in ElevatorTalk. Our paper indicates that ACSICD has better waiting/travel/journey time performance and/or accuracy than the previous proposed algorithms. We also show that in our approach, the car scheduling decision can be quickly made with 0.2010 ms, and therefore good performance in the time complexity is achieved.},

In contrast, an iterative maximum likelihood estimate of the nanomachine location is computed herein.

Further, the nanomachine localization is performed, when the locations of the receiver nanomachine are both known and unknown.

  abstract     = {Indoor localization has attracted more and more attention because of its importance in many applications. One of the most popular techniques for indoor localization is the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based fingerprinting approach. Since RSSI values are very complicated and noisy, conventional machine learning algorithms often suffer from limited performance. Recently developed deep learning algorithms have been shown to be powerful for the analysis of complex data. In this paper, we propose a local feature-based deep long short-term memory (LF-DLSTM) approach for WiFi fingerprinting indoor localization. The local feature extractor attempts to reduce the noise effect and extract robust local features. The DLSTM network is able to encode temporal dependencies and learn high-level representations for the extracted sequential local features. Real experiments have been conducted in two different environments, i.e., a research lab and an office. We also compare the proposed approach with some state-of-the-art methods for indoor localization. The results show that the proposed approach achieves the best localization performance with mean localization errors of 1.48 and 1.75 m under the research lab and office environments, respectively. The improvements of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods range from 18.98\% to 53.46\%.},

  abstract     = {Human tracking is of key importance to a variety of applications. Different from the previous approaches requiring the targets to carry electronic devices, this paper proposes a device-free tracking method based on WiFi channel state information (CSI) through deep neural networks (DNN) and particle filtering (PF). In the area covered with WiFi, human movements may cause observable variations of WiFi signals. By analyzing the CSI fingerprint patterns and modeling the dependency between CSI fingerprints and locations through DNN, the proposed method is able to localize the targets according to the measured CSI fingerprints through DNN regression. Localization with DNN is accurate for static targets, yet unable to form reasonable trajectories of moving targets. This paper proposes to apply PF on DNN localization results and form the walking trajectories of the targets. To avoid the trajectories to cross obstacles, map matching is integrated to constrain the unreasonable transfer of particles, which further improves the precision of trajectories. To combat with environmental variants, fine tuning on DNN is proposed to enhance the adaptivity of the method. Extensive evaluations in two representative scenarios with only one pair of WiFi transmitter and receiver achieve the high accuracy of around half a meter and precise trajectories as well as adaptation to environmental variants.},

To achieve the goal, two algorithms are proposed in ideal channel and shadow-fading channel, respectively. Specifically, in ideal channel, maximum movable distance is defined and its important features are introduced, then the concept of critical point and its related proposition are given accordingly. Subsequently, an algorithm is proposed to derive the real resolution limit in ideal channel. For the case of shadow-fading channel, based on stochastic channel model, first, at each time instant, the random variables are turned into definite values, then, the instant resolution limit is computed, and finally, the expectation of resolution limit can be calculated. Simulation results demonstrate the correctness of our derived resolution limit.

The design can be easily deployed to different environments, such as nuclear power plants and bridges, while also being less expensive to create and maintain. However, a crucial point to be improved is the system performance, which is related to the low image processing frequency that largely increases the time needed to autonomously inspect a real structure. A new embedded and more efficient crack detection and crack measurement apparatus based on a field-programmable gate array was developed to optimize the on-board image processing. Thereby, the hardware architecture, software design, and database schematic were redesigned in order to update the autonomous robot system for inspection.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) make mobile base stations possible in future wireless communication systems. In this article, we propose to employ a UAV-enabled base station to serve multiple users in a nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network. We consider two practical goals. The first one is to minimize the transmit power of the UAV subject to the minimum achievable rate requirements, and the second one is to maximize the achievable rate of a specific user subject to the minimum achievable rate requirements of other users. Because of the NOMA scheme, our optimizing variables consist of the decoding order, the transmit power allocation, and the position of the UAV. For both problems, given a decoding order, we propose globally optimal solutions to the joint optimization problems of the power allocation and the position of the UAV. By searching all possible different decoding orders, we obtain globally optimal solutions to both problems. Numerical results show that our proposed joint optimization algorithms perform better than the orthogonal multiple access scheme and the NOMA scheme with the fixed UAV position.},

Interaction between humans and robots depends on the reliability of the robotic vision systems. The variation of camera sensors and the capability of these sensors to detect many types of sensory inputs improve the visual perception. The analysis of activities, motions, skills, and behaviors of humans and robots have been addressed by utilizing the heat signatures of the human body. The human motion behavior is analyzed by body movement kinematics, and the trajectory of the target is used to identify the objects and the human target in the omnidirectional (O-D) thermal images. The process of human target identification and gesture recognition by traditional sensors have problem for multitarget scenarios since these sensors may not keep all targets in their narrow field of view (FOV) at the same time. O-D thermal view increases the robots&#39; line-of-sights and ability to obtain better perception in the absence of light. The human target is informed of its position, surrounding objects and any other human targets in its proximity so that humans with limited vision or vision disability can be assisted to improve their ability in their environment. The proposed method helps to identify the human targets in a wide FOV and light independent conditions to assist the human target and improve the human-robot and robot-robot interactions. The experimental results show that the identification of the human targets is achieved with a high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Connected cruise control (CCC), as an approach to regulate vehicle&#39;s longitudinal motion in car-following platoon scenarios, can improve the safety and efficiency of the traffic flow. In order to make it available for extensive information sharing among vehicles, wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is exploited in the vehicular platoon. However, time delays caused by wireless communication may result in significant degradation of system stability. In this article, considering arbitrary V2V communication delays, an optimal longitudinal control algorithm is proposed for the CCC vehicle with the goal of minimizing the deviations of vehicle&#39;s headway and velocity. In the proposed scheme, the vehicular platoon is modeled as a discrete-time system based on vehicle&#39;s error dynamics, and the optimal-state feedback control problem is designed as a cost function represented by a sum of platoon states in a quadratic form. A backward recursion method is used to iteratively derive the optimal control strategy, namely the acceleration for CCC vehicle, based on the current platoon states and previous control signals. In addition, the stability analysis shows that the system is asymptotically mean square stable under the control of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm provides better system performance and stability.},

Many previous works used the notation of infinitesimal rigidity to define the communication topology in formation control, but the global stability is difficult to achieve without leaders. To overcome this shortage, the maximal clique graph is used to define the topological relationship between agents. By minimizing the designed cost function, a novel distributed bearing-only formation controller is designed. Then, the close-loop system can achieve the global stability due to the existence of common agents between the maximal cliques under the designed controller. Besides, the global collision avoidance control strategy is also investigated with assistant distance measurement, which can prevent collisions between agents during the whole formation process. In addition, the embedded rotation angles between the final formation and the target formation are presented to optimize the motion process in real time. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the designed controllers.},

However, to date, the controllability of underactuated microsystems had hardly been addressed. This article thus investigates the system local controllability. This result highlights the necessity for the agents to operate in close vicinity to achieve trajectory tracking along an admissible reference trajectory whose choice is discussed.

Addressing this issue, the article proposes a novel drone-based cellular infrastructure to revive necessary communications for out-of-coverage user equipment (UE) which is in the disaster area. In particular, a matching game algorithm is proposed using one-to-many approach wherein several drone small cells (DSCs) are deployed to match different UEs to reach a stable connection with optimal throughput. In addition, a medium access control framework is then developed to optimize emergency and high priority communications initiated from the rescue workers and vulnerable individuals. The simulation results show that the throughput for the out-of-coverage UEs are significantly improved when the DSCs are deployed in public safety network while the channel access delay is also notably reduced for emergency communications within the affected areas.},

In such a case, the problem has nonconvex and nondifferential characteristic. In this article, a two-stage model is proposed to handle the nonconvexity and nondifferentiability of valve-point effects in cost functions of power-only units. The proposed model obtains a convex feasible operating region in the first stage using a linear approximation model. In addition, an equivalent formulation is proposed in the second stage to handle the nondifferentiable term of valve-point effects using the obtained convex feasible operating regions.

Hence, the conventional reliability evaluation approaches based on mean time to failure may introduce inaccurate inputs for decision making in planning and operation of microgrids. In this article, different approaches are employed for evaluating the reliability of microgrids with non-constant failure rates. The obtained results indicate that the system reliability remarkably depends on the failure characteristics and considering mean or steady-state probabilities instead of failure statistics may introduce erroneous reliability prediction results.

Among them, the random communication failure (RCF) is common and harmful. To realize the stable operation of IMG and the rational sharing of reactive power under the consideration of this problem, a cyber-physical cooperative hierarchical control strategy is proposed in this article, which include cyber and physical layers in control structure. In these two layers, the main designs are as follows. In the cyber layer, to solve the RCF problem, we have designed the corresponding observer, controller, and prediction compensation part; and to improve the frequency stability, a secondary control method is designed. In the physical layer, to share reactive power reasonably, a reactive power control method based on synchronous voltage regulation is proposed; to suppress the possible disturbance in the data used in the physical layer, a novel sliding-mode controller is designed; and to improve the voltage stability during adjusting power, a voltage compensation strategy is proposed.

  abstract     = {Countries around the world suffer the dramatic impact of earthquakes and other natural hazards reflected in casualties, infrastructure damage, service interruptions, and recovery costs. Although disaster exposure consciousness of electric power systems has increased in recent years, mitigation and adaptation actions, such as reserve scheduling and infrastructure investments, are usually performed without quantitative tools to account for the underlying stochasticity of these events. This article first discusses why an integrated assessment, which incorporates sources of uncertainty (risk) and manages the time-dependency of the recovery process (resilience), should be used to assess the impact of seismic events on electric power systems. Thereafter, a probabilistic methodology that considers the hazard, vulnerability, operation, and recovery of the system is presented. As a case study, the probabilistic seismic resilience of the electric power system of Northern Chile is assessed using different risk measures, including expected annual loss, value at risk, and conditional value-at-risk. Finally, a novel criticality assessment based on these metrics is developed to demonstrate that, for certain networks such as the study case, retrofit of selective components can notably improve the resilience of the complete system to seismic events. For example, if one specific component from the 152 components of the study system is assumed invulnerable, expected annual interruption costs decrease by 8\%.},

  abstract     = {In power system state estimation, the robust least absolute value robust dynamic estimator is well known. However, the covariance of the state estimation error cannot be obtained easily. In this article, an analytical equation is derived using influence function approximation to analyze the covariance of the robust least absolute value dynamic state estimator. The equation gives insights into the precision of the estimation and can be used to express the variances of the state estimates as functions of measurement noise variances, enabling the selection of sensors for specified estimator precision. Simulations on the IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus, and 118-bus systems are given to illustrate the usefulness of the equation. Monte Carlo experiments can also be used to determine the covariance, but many data points are needed and hence many runs are required to achieve convergence. Our result shows that to obtain the covariance of the state estimation error, the analytical equation proposed in this article is four orders of magnitude faster than a 10 000-run Monte Carlo experiment on both the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus systems.},

  abstract     = {Resource additions to electric power grids are planned in advance to maintain reliability of electric power supply. This is achieved by performing reliability studies for calculating reliability indices at the planning stage to ensure that the required levels of reliability will be met. This article proposes a new state classification approach to calculate power system reliability indices using a combination of multilabel radial basis function (MLRBF) networks and importance sampling (IS) within the framework of Monte Carlo simulation process. Multilabel classification algorithms are different from single-label approaches, in which each instance can be assigned to multiple classes. This characteristic gives MLRBF the capability to classify composite power system states (success or failure), at the bus as well as system level. Bus level indices provide useful reliability information for locational reliability, which allows more rational and equitable distribution of resources. MLRBF classification does not require optimal power flow (OPF) analysis; however, OPF is required for the training and cross-entropy optimization phases. This article shows that the scope and computational efficiency to evaluate reliability indices can be significantly increased if the proposed MLRBF classifier is used together with well-known variance reduction technique of IS. As the classifier is trained to recognize the reliability status of a system state, it can also be used in operational planning when a number of scenarios need to be evaluated in a short time for their ability to satisfy load. The proposed method is illustrated using the IEEE reliability test system for different load levels. The outcomes of case studies show that MLRBF algorithm together with IS provides excellent classification accuracy in reliability evaluation while substantially reducing computation time and enhancing the scope of evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Electrical power demands have increased significantly over the last years due to rapid increase in air conditioning units and home appliances per domestic unit, particularly in Iraq. Having an uninterrupted power supply is essential for the continuity of power-generated home services and industrial platforms. Currently, in Iraq, electrical power interruption has become a big concern to the utility suppliers. Despite successive attempts to put an end to this dilemma, the issue still prevails. One of the main factors in power outages in local zones is persistent faults in distribution transformers (DTs). DT is considered one of the main elements in the electrical network that is essential for the reliability of the grid supply. Due to the internal lack of monitoring system and periodic maintenance, DT is relentlessly subject to faults due to high overhead utilization. Therefore, in order to enhance the grid reliability, transformer health check, and maintenance practices, we propose a remote condition Internet of Things monitoring and fault prediction system that is based on a customized software-defined networking (SDN) technology. This approach is a transition to smart grid implementation by fusing the power grid with efficient and real-time wireless communication architecture. The SDN implementation is considered in two phases: one is a controller installed per local zone and the other is the main controller that is installed between zones and connected to the core network. The core network consists of redundant links to recover from any future fails. Furthermore, we propose a prediction system based on an artificial neural network algorithm, called distribution transformer fault prediction, that is installed in the management plane for periodic prediction based on real-time sensor traffic to our proposed cloud. Moreover, we propose a communication protocol in the local zone called local SDN-sense. The SDN-sense ensures a reliable communication and local node selection to relay DT sensor data to the main controller. Our proposed architecture showcases an efficient approach to handle future interruption and faults in power grid using cost-effective and reliable infrastructure that can predict and provide real-time health monitoring indices for the Iraqi grid network with minimal power interruptions. After extensive testing, the prediction accuracy was about 96.1\%.},

Understanding the interplay between grid, generators, and loads is crucial for efficient and robust planning and management of electrical networks. Using the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian, we show that we can express power flows on the basis of Laplacian eigenvectors and reveal the dominant modes for nodal voltages and branch powers. The bus voltages are dominated by low rank modes. The power in the lines depends on the nodal distribution of generators/loads, the line impedances, and the gradient of the eigenvectors across the branches. The most loaded lines and their associated dominant mode are then identified. A modification of the bus powers is finally proposed to better share the load between the lines and, hence, to decrease the system vulnerability. Results provided for several IEEE transmission test systems prove the relevance of the approach and suggest practical guidelines to improve the operation of power systems.},

In this paper, a demand response exchange (DRX) market is introduced to counterbalance the deviations, where both upward and downward DR resources are considered and the DRX market price is determined by the bids of DR customers. In addition, to examine impacts of the DRX market on strategic behaviors of participants in the DA market, a joint equilibrium model of the DA market and the DRX market is proposed. Specifically, in the DRX market, DR customers compete by submitting their bids in the form of supply functions when the RGs&#39; total actual output is less than the cleared quantity from the DA market, while the demand function bid mode is applied for DR customers when the RGs&#39; total actual output is greater than the cleared quantity from the DA market. Monte Carlo simulation and scenario reduction techniques are employed to deal with uncertainties of the actual output of RGs. Moreover, the equilibrium model is converted into a convex optimization problem for the solution, and the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the DA market and DRX market are theoretically demonstrated. Due to information asymmetry in practice, a distributed algorithm is applied to find equilibrium outcomes. Finally, numerical examples are presented to verify the reasonableness and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms.},

This article applies energy storage (ES) to reduce system peak and the congestion by the robust optimization, considering the uncertainties from the ES state-of-charge (SoC), flexible load, and renewable energy. First, a deterministic operation model for the ES, as a benchmark, is designed to reduce the variance of the branch power flow based on the least-squares concept. Then, a robust model is built to optimize the ES operation with the uncertainties in the severest case from the load, renewable energy, and ES SoC that are converted into branch flow budgeted uncertainty sets by the cumulant and Gram-Charlier expansion methods. The ES SoC uncertainty is modeled as an interval uncertainty set in the robust model, solved by the duality theory. These models are demonstrated on a grid supply point to illustrate the effectiveness of a congestion management technique. Results illustrate that the proposed ES operation significantly improves system performance in reducing the system congestion. This robust optimization-based ES operation can further increase system flexibility to facilitate more renewable energy and flexible demand without triggering the large-scale network investment.},

The new planning model considers the technical constraints of both electricity and natural gas systems. A two-stage planning approach is proposed to determine the optimal site and size of CHPs. In the first stage, a long-run incremental cost matrix is designed to reflect CHP locational impact on both natural gas and electricity network investment, used as a criterion to choose the optimal location. In the second stage, CHP size is determined by solving an integrated optimal model with the objective to minimize total incremental network investment costs. The proposed method is resolved by the interior-point method and implemented on a practically integrated electricity and natural gas systems. Two case studies are conducted to test the performance for single and multiple CHPs cases. This paper enables cost-efficient CHP planning to benefit integrated natural gas and electricity networks and network users in terms of reduced network investment cost and consequently reduced UoS charges.},

This is because the enhanced system configuration description language (SCL) files cannot be exchanged with each DG while this is not an issue for substation modeling. Also, this would result in multiple copies of enhanced SCL files and is not feasible to implement. Thus, there is a need to develop a process for configuring IEC 61850 based communication networks at the microgrid level. This paper proposes a central configurator and a step-by-step configuration procedure for modeling microgrids according to IEC 61850. Such a configurator assists in connecting IEDs in different locations and updates the system with the new deployment. The process is shown with a centralized microgrid protection scheme by employing a microgrid-level system configurator.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new approach for determining the impact of lightning strike currents on transmission network elements failures, based on fuzzy logic (FL) and expert systems. The location of lightning strike is determined by means of lightning location system (LLS) and failures in the transmission network, sorted by type of the equipment, are obtained from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The input data set includes two sets. The first set consists of lightning strike locations and current values between the cloud and the ground. The second set consists of current values from SCADA system before and after the fault, protection tripping information, and the state and position of the switches. The proposed FL-based solution is based on a fuzzy decision-making system (DMS), including both data sets in order to provide a power system operator (PSO) with a precise and accurate decision needed in time of emergency. The described model has been tested for functionality and correct results have been obtained, which confirms the membership function (MF) assessment and proves the efficiency and authenticity of the proposed DMS.},

  abstract     = {In microgrid (MG) modeling, the renewable energy sources (RESs) are mostly represented by the detailed small-signal modeling (SSM) of its interfacing inverter. In these models, the input dc-bus link voltage is assumed to be constant. However, due to generation intermittency of RESs, viz., solar photovoltaics (PV) or wind turbines, this assumption is not appropriate. Also, the effects of storage devices are ignored. Now, this detailed SSM of inverters alongside loads and network gives a system of systems architecture to the MGs, modeling of which leads to a higher-order system with a large number of states. In this work, the SSM of a standard MG system is developed using simplified lower-order models of solar PVs and batteries that incorporate generation uncertainties by considering the dynamics of both input dc and output ac terminals of the inverter. The obtained reduced order model is computationally more efficient. The MG test system includes two PV sources having dedicated parallel RLC loads and low voltage feeder. The proposed model is validated by performing comprehensive time and frequency domain analysis for transient and steady-state operations by MATLAB based simulations and hardware-in-loop tests using the real-time digital simulator (RTDS) and dSPACE processor board.},

Due to the inherent nature of these events, as high-impact low-probability (HILP) events, selection of an appropriate method that can provide the effects of weather conditions on the power system behavior still remains a significant challenge. Resilience is a new concept that focuses on mitigating the destructive effects of such disastrous events on power systems. This article provides a fundamental framework for quantifying and modeling of power systems resilience, with focus on high wind incidence. The algorithm composes of four steps. In the first step, the prerequisites of the analysis are described. Disaster modeling is carried out in step second and the transmission line status and system topology obtaining are outlined in the third step. In the last step, based on optimal power flow tracing, a novel resilience index is introduced based on axiomatic design concepts. The core of the main algorithm involves a novel matrix-based approach to count automatically all possible routes from generators to loads, considering load importance, before and after a disruption. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by the IEEE 14-bus system. The proposed methodology is original and a comprehensive approach.},

This paper presents an integrated unbalanced T&amp;D analysis framework using an iteratively coupled cosimulation approach. The unbalanced T&amp;D systems are solved separately using dedicated solvers. An iterative approach is developed for T&amp;D interface coupling and to ensure convergence of the boundary variables. To do so, analytical expressions governing the T&amp;D interface are obtained. First-order and second-order convergent methods using fixed-point iteration (FPI) method and Newton&#39;s method, respectively, are proposed to solve the system of nonlinear T&amp;D interface equations. The proposed framework is tested using an integrated T&amp;D system model comprised of 9-bus IEEE transmission test system integrated with a real-world 6000-bus distribution test system. The results show that the proposed framework can model the impacts of system unbalance and increased demand variability on integrated T&amp;D systems and converges during stressed system conditions. As expected, Newton&#39;s method converges faster with a fewer number of iterations as compared with FPI method and the improvements are more pronounced during high levels of system unbalance and high loading conditions.},

The proposed model is formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem in view of economic and environmental contemplation. Therefore, the minimization of MG total annual cost and total annual emission are considered as the primary objectives. This paper mainly analyzes the benefits of DSM assistance in the process of residential MG joint planning and operation optimization. The proposed bi-objective optimization problem is converted into a single-objective optimization problem and the single-objective problem is solved using a mixed integer linear programming method. To investigate the impacts of DSM on the MG planning and operation problem, the proposed model is applied to a residential MG consisting of 1000 smart homes with different DSM participation levels. The simulation results show that the proposed model is an efficient tool for residential MG planning and operation optimization from the perspective of economic and environmental considerations.},

Indeed, the suggested hysteresis controller causes to deliver the maximum extractable kinetic energy of DFIGs to the grid and consequently further enhance the power system frequency. This is accomplished using different frequency deviation indices, which determine the size of power mismatch and lead to an appropriate frequency response by the DFIGs. The operational constraints of the DFIGs are taken into account in the design procedure of the controller. The proposed controller implies negligible implementation cost and its parameters must be chosen considering a compromise between the amount of DFIGs&#39; provided power during the frequency support period and the subsequent wear and tear due to the frequency response. Extensive time domain simulations on an IEEE 9-bus test system verify the efficiency of proposed controller.},

To resolve this issue, we propose a circumstance-independent policy that can effectively address the different network circumstances even with a single policy. Thus, contrary to the conventional RL approaches, the proposed policy can be easily applied in the practical system. We then develop a deep RL algorithm to learn it. Through simulation results, we show that a single proposed policy can be used over different circumstances, and it achieves a close performance to the circumstance-dependent policy for each circumstance, which learns the optimal policy for the corresponding circumstance.},

On the other hand, by taking the characteristic of leaf-spine DCN into account, we prove that the optimal construction of multicast tree in leaf-spine DCNs is equivalent to the well-known problem of minimum set cover, distinguished from the conventional wisdom that models the problem as a general-purpose directed minimum Steiner.

The mechanism of our strategy is to implement the best resource allocation on the basis of the information in the tracking recursive manner, aiming at improving the overall tracking accuracy. By integrating with the information reduction factor, we derive the predicted conditional Cramér-Rao lower bound (PC-CRLB) in clutter, which offers a more accurate measure of target state estimate than the standard posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound. Then, the sum of weighted PC-CRLBs is utilized as the optimization criterion to guide our JSSPA strategy. It is shown that the optimization model is a nonconvex problem that involves three variables, and a two-stage local search-based algorithm is proposed to solve it. Numerical simulations verify the tracking performance improvement by the proposed method, compared with four other resource allocation strategies.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the power control scheme in an uplink clustering network when the vehicle density is high. In the dynamic communication environment, the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channel model is proposed to evaluate the extra Doppler shifted impact on the uncertain channel gains. Since the mobile wireless channels are fast time varying and the vehicle mobility is usually high, a robust optimization problem is formulated to maximize the network-wide sum rates constrained with the predefined outage probability. To perform the optimization, the original problem with probability constraints is first converted to the deterministic problem, using the known statistical characteristics (i.e., the mean and variance of V2V channel gains). Second, the successive convex approximation is proposed to transform the nonconvex problem into the convex problem. Third, the dual decomposition is used to determine the optimal solution. Finally, an iterative algorithm is used to determine the optimal transmission power of each user. The proposed framework is evaluated using numerical simulations with different V2V configurations. The numerical simulation results show the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed algorithm when applying on dynamic vehicular network scenes.},

  abstract     = {Load balancing between adjacent base stations (BSs) is important for balancing load distributions and improving service provisioning. While load balancing between any given pair of BSs is beneficial, cascade load sharing can cause network-level instability that is hard to predict. The relationship between each BS&#39;s load balancing dynamics and the network topology is not understood. In this seminal work on stability analysis, we consider a frequency reuse network with no interference, whereby load balancing dynamics does not perturb the individual cells&#39; capacity. Our novelty is to show an exact analytical and also a probabilistic relationship for stability, relating generalized local load balancing dynamics with a generalized network topology, as well as the uncertainty we have in load balancing parameters due to noisy channel or network sensing. We prove that the stability analysis is valid for any generalized load balancing dynamics and topological cell deployment, and we believe this general relationship can inform the joint design of both the load balancing dynamics and the neighbor list of the network. The probabilistic framework provides uncertainty quantification and stability prediction for Digital Twins of wireless infrastructure.},

We compare m-ESCAP with the conventional m-CAP and a compressed nonorthogonal version of m-CAP (m-SCAP) in terms of measured bit error rate (BER) performance, bit rates, and spectral efficiencies. We show that the m-ESCAP system offers improvement in the bit rate of ~10\% and 20\% compared to the m-CAP and m-SCAP, respectively, and in the spectral efficiency of ~20\% compared to m-CAP. These gains are achieved at the cost of increased BER, which, however, remains below the 7\% forward error correction limit.},

However, the openness of cooperative spectrum sensing makes it susceptible to Byzantine attack, also known as spectrum sensing data falsification. Byzantine attack has been widely studied as a serious threat to cooperative spectrum sensing, which hugely degrades the cooperative sensing performance. Extensive studies have focused on how to mitigate the adverse effect of Byzantine attack on cooperative spectrum sensing. In this article, we first conduct a generic soft Byzantine attack on the basis of the soft combining. By analyzing Byzantine behavior, we provide a comprehensive investigation into attack cost and attack benefit from the malicious perspective, and propose the cost-benefit tradeoff problem under the generalized attack model. Then, we verify the existence of the tradeoff, which is a fundamental issue involved in Byzantine attack, however, ignored by most of the previous studies. Besides, an in-depth analysis on attack risk is done with taking into consideration trust value based cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm, in terms of covertness.},

Each tier&#39;s mmWave base stations (BSs) are randomly located and they have particular spatial density, antenna gain, receiver sensitivity, blockage parameter, and pathloss exponents. Our model takes account of the maximum power limitation and the per-user power control. More specifically, each user, which could be in line-of-sight (LOS) or non-LOS to its serving mmWave BS, controls its transmit power such that the received signal power at its serving BS is equal to a predefined threshold. Hence, a truncated channel inversion power control scheme is implemented for the uplink of mmWave cellular networks. We derive closed-form expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) outage probability for the uplink of the multitier mmWave cellular networks, which we later degrade to the single-tier network. Furthermore, we analyze the case with a dense network by utilizing the simplified model, where the LOS region is approximated as a fixed LOS disk. The results show that imposing a maximum power constraint on the user significantly affects the SINR outage probability in the uplink of mmWave cellular networks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, based on the exponential synchronization of double-layered networks composed of multiple subnets, we bring forward a chaotic secure communication scheme, which is robust to different network sizes, time-varying delays, and stochastic noise. Cluster analysis is used to process the nodes with different dynamics, such that the subnets in the transmitter and receiver are one-to-one correspondence and constitute subnet pairs, while the node size of each subnet can be inconsistent. Each subnet pair is only accountable for encrypting/decrypting a part of information. There are many encryption/decryption units and they are operating in parallel, which can not only indicate the complex characteristic of different nodes but also speed up the information encryption/decryption. The proposed scheme applies the chaotic signals yielded by many chaotic systems as key sequences, such that the key space can grow with node sizes in the transmitter. This scheme is not subject to the constraint on the amplitude of the original message and chaotic signal, the influence of time-delay and stochastic noise, and it shows that only the nodes with large degrees need to apply controllers in restoring the original information. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation manifest the feasibility and validity of the given scheme.},

  abstract     = {In opportunistic spectrum access, each secondary user selects a channel from a pool of multiple channels based on their local observations. The challenge here is to learn the best channel in terms of availability, as the channel availability statistics are unknown. In order to learn these unknown statistics, a novel decentralized multiuser learning technique termed as DSEE for channel selection in dynamic networks (DSEE-CSDN) has been proposed. DSEE-CSDN allows secondary users to enter the network during different time slots. Thus, the number of secondary users is not known beforehand. Moreover, the availability status of different independent channels is considered to be changing according to the two-state restless Markov chain model, which, in practice, is more realistic as compared to independent and identically distributed channel state model. Thus, the problem is formulated as a stochastic multiuser restless multiarmed bandit. The proposed algorithm achieves system-wide order-optimal performance under self-play. Results indicate that DSEE-CSDN is able to achieve a logarithmic order of regret. Furthermore, collisions and switching cost are just around 5\% and 2\% of total time slots, respectively. Also, DSEE-CSDN can achieve probabilistic fairness in channel selection without any preagreement among users.},

Toward this, we consider two scenarios: 1) the signal reaches the reference MT directly by penetrating the building where it is located and 2) the communication is assisted by a relay placed on the rooftop of the building that conveys through a waveguide the desired signal to an indoor transmit antenna located at the floor where the reference MT is located. By using a stochastic-geometry-based framework, we derive for both scenarios, analytical expressions for the coverage and average rate, which exhibit a good match with respect to the simulations. In addition, from these expressions, we gain important insights regarding the performance comparison of the two scenarios. In particular, it is analytically proved and validated by the simulations that relaying notably enhances the performance of the low-rate MTs even under substantial waveguide losses. However, for such losses, the average rate in the relaying case can become worse than the case without relays.},

To integrate these services of multiple devices with variable rates, group orthogonal-orthogonal frequency division multiple access (GO-OFDMA) is an efficient multicarrier scheme.

Further challenges of this proposed architecture are integration of multiple user data with variable rates in the baseband transmitter and decoding of multiple user data within the same class at the baseband receiver. To validate the GO-OFDMA baseband transmitter and receiver, the transmitted and received bits in real time are captured using chipscope analyzer. The bit error rate and peak-to-average power ratio performance of the proposed architecture are presented.

An optimization problem is formulated to maximize SU throughput under a constraint of minimum PU throughput (due to quality-of-service). As the optimization problem is NP-hard, we decompose the problem into two subproblems by introducing an auxiliary variable, i.e., the consumed energy at PU, and the subproblems are decoupled by minimizing the PU consumed energy. A three-step resource allocation scheme is then proposed to solve the optimization problem with low complexity.

Different from the previous relevant work, we consider a multiuser system scenario, where a full-duplex mode worked in the multicell base stations, and maximum-ratio combining/maximum-ratio transmission is applied at the receiver end. Then, we derive the asymptotic uplink and downlink sum rate by utilizing the large number theorem and considering the performance comparison between the perfect and imperfect channel. In addition, the impact of the Doppler shift on the system performance (e.g., the uplink and downlink sum rates) is analyzed via the simulation results.},

  abstract     = {In cognitive radio networks, the identification of a primary user (PU) with the help of spectrum sensing is very important for a secondary user (SU), such that interference free transmission can be performed. In recent times, the cooperative spectrum sensing that improves the reliability of the decisions made about the presence of a PU and overcoming hidden terminal problem by obtaining sensing results from different sensors is gaining much attention. However, the selfish SUs are sometimes not willing to cooperate. This paper proposes a contract theory-based approach, which is an incentive design mechanism where the participants are offered appropriately designed reward to encourage cooperation. The secondary base-station (BS)-SU interaction is modeled as a labor market using contract theory. Contract theory helps in analyzing the case of incomplete information where the BS is not aware of the SU&#39;s private information. Further, the contract is formed in such a way that only the limited number of noncorrelated SUs can participate in sensing such that unnecessary energy consumption is reduced. Simulation results show that the contract can effectively incentivize SU&#39;s cooperation, and outperforms the considered benchmark scheme in terms of PU detection probability.},

  abstract     = {Full-duplex (FD) relaying is more spectrally efficient compared to its counterpart, conventional half-duplex (HD) relaying, since it allows simultaneous transmission and reception in the same frequency channel. Working in FD relaying scheme results in relay self-interference (SI) signal that degrades the system performance. Furthermore, in a multicell scenario, the FD relay is also subject to interrelay interference (IRI) and relay-to-destination interference (RDI) coming from co-channel relays in adjacent cells. Conventionally, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming (BF) is adopted to mitigate either the SI, IRI, or RDI but not all of them simultaneously. In this article, beamforming (BF) matrices at the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relays are designed jointly to mitigate the SI, IRI, and RDI signals based on channel alignment and nullspace projection. In addition, joint power allocation for the source and relay is performed for maximizing the system performance in terms of ergodic capacity. Numerical results demonstrate and verify that the proposed scheme can achieve better outage probability and ergodic capacity compared to baseline schemes. Our findings reveal that MIMO FD relaying significantly improves the system performance compared to its counterpart conventional MIMO HD relaying.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses a single cell system employing sectorization using nonorthogonal-multiple access (NOMA) and employing cooperative relaying to forward signal to the cell-edge users. In a conventional fixed sectorization, if the density of cellular users has to be variable throughout the cell, the region with the higher density of users experiences poor service. This conventional fixed sector approach is inefficient in distributing the transmitter power efficiently to all the users. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive sectorization approach, aiming to provide all the users fair services, irrespective of their position in the cell. In the adaptive sectorization, the sector-angle and the transmission power of each sector antenna is adaptively chosen according to the density of the users in the cell. The paper also proposes the angle selection scheme for finding the coverage range of the relay equipment and adaptive NOMA technique. In adaptive NOMA scheme, the downlink system adaptively changes its working modes based on the relay equipment power, for optimizing system energy efficiency and reducing power consumption of the cell-edge users. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and show that the adaptive sectorization scheme can achieve a higher energy efficiency performance than fixed sector approach, in the considered network.},

All derivations are verified by simulation results, which show that the proposed security scheme achieves higher probability of nonzero secrecy capacity, lower secrecy outage probability, and delivers superior secrecy throughput comparing with the conventional phased-array communication scheme. This implies that FDA provides superiority for physical-layer security communication in the range dimension, whereas in the angle dimension, we show that the performance comparison between the two schemes significantly relates to the angle difference of the desired and eavesdropper direction.},

In order to harness the NC benefits, a more complicated problem called routing, spectrum, and network coding assignment (RSNCA) has to be solved, and in this article, we propose a priority-based multiobjective design for the RSNCA problem aiming at maximizing the network throughput in the constrained bandwidth capacity and simultaneously minimizing the spectrum link usage for accepted demands. The multiobjective design is based on the weighting method, and we present a rigorous analysis on the impact of weight coefficients to the priority of constituent objectives. The efficacy of our design proposal is benchmarked with reference ones based on the traditional single-objective model and for both coding and noncoding approaches on various realistic topologies. It is highlighted that the application of NC brings about considerable throughput enhancement, and furthermore, the multiobjective RSNCA design is highly more efficient than the single-objective RSNCA, as up to more than 50\% saving on spectrum link usage could be attained.},

A system that should provide an opportunity for rapid testing and implementation of management modules to the IoT developer community working on taking advantage of the SDN benefits. Therefore, this paper proposes a generic and modular WSN management system based on SDN (SDNMM). SDNMM introduces the concept of management modularity using a management service interface (MSI) that enables management entities to be added as modules. The system leverages the use of SDN in WSNs and by being modular it also allows for rapid development and implementation of IoT applications. The system has been built on an open source platform to support its generic aspect and a sample resource management module implemented and evaluated to support the proposed modular management approach. Results show how adding a resource management module via the MSI improved packet delivery, delay, control traffic, and energy consumption over comparable frameworks.},

The framework is described in detail covering different data-, control-, and application-plane implementations, and includes a novel addressing scheme and packet format. It also uses a centralized routing protocol, located at the SDN controller, based on the shortest path algorithm. We compare our approach with the routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL), which uses a distributed routing protocol. Hardware tests were carried out in a dynamic environment, with multiple sources of interference for different payload sizes to evaluate the impacts and practicality of SDN in WSNs. The performance comparison shows that the proposed SDN management system for IP-enabled WSNs using a centralized routing protocol outperforms the RPL protocol in terms of round-trip time, jitter, memory consumption, and packet loss rate (PLR), despite the control overhead introduced.},

To realize the online fault diagnosis, a method robust to speed fluctuation and background noise is necessary. In this paper, an iterative generalized demodulation with tunable energy factor (IGDTEF) is proposed, which can map the time-varying trajectories of interest components to their corresponding energy factors. To exploit it in the online fault diagnosis, a phase function estimation strategy is further developed. First, the optimal frequency band of the raw signal is identified by fast kurtogram and then a bandpass filter is designed to separate the impulsive component. Second, Hilbert transform and short-time Fourier transform are applied to the filtered signal jointly obtaining the envelope time-frequency representation (TFR). Then, the instantaneous fault characteristic frequency (IFCF) is estimated roughly by applying an amplitude-sum-based peak search to the TFR. Next, the phase functions of the IFCF, the potential modulation rotating frequency, and their harmonics are calculated. Finally, the IGDTEF is performed to the filtered signal and then fast Fourier transform is applied to the demodulated signal generating the demodulation spectrum. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated by simulated and experimental data.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-wideband (UWB) channels include many multipath components and thereby introduce a strong intersymbol interference (ISI) for high-rate communications. Hence, in such cases, a high-performance low-complexity detection is required to cancel ISI. Since monobit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are simple and consume less energy, they are increasingly used in UWB communication systems. However, since monobit digitization is a nonlinear operation, ISI removal after monobit digitization becomes a difficult task. In this paper, a near-optimal two-stage algorithm is proposed to iteratively detect the noise-and-ISI-contaminated monobit digitized UWB signals. Moreover, a novel theoretical framework for bit-error-rate (BER) evaluation is developed which guarantees a real-valued BER and doubles the speed of the numerical calculations by using the conjugate (Hermitian) symmetric property of the characteristic function. Computer simulations have been employed to validate the theoretical analysis and the approximations used therein. Both simulation and theoretical results show that the monobit receiver employing the proposed algorithm only incurs about 0.9 dB performance loss compared to the optimal monobit receiver. Moreover, the resistance of the proposed algorithm to error propagation is validated.},

Magnetic induction (MI) based communication is recently explored technique for such type of media, which exhibits several promising characteristics, such as constant channel behavior, less propagation delay, and stealth underwater operations. In every wireless sensor network (WSNs), energy is a main constraint. The overall energy consumption of the network can be significantly reduced by clustering technique. The efficacy of clustering technique can be further improved by the incorporation of cooperative communication and energy harvesting (EH) techniques. This paper proposes cooperative communication over Rayleigh fading channels, EH-enabled energy-efficient design, and EH-enabled tree-based waveguide topology in MI-based clustered nonconventional WSNs. Furthermore, we perform an analytical modeling to find the total energy consumption and throughput of the network in three different media (dry soil, wet soil, and sea water).},

In the system, due to RF-EH, the effects of link scheduling for each D2D link on the system performance, i.e., average sum rate and average total harvested energy, become much more complicated compared with conventional D2D communication without RF-EH. To address such complicated effects in a distributed manner, we study a centralized optimal link scheduling algorithm, which aims at maximizing the weighted sum of average sum rate and average total harvested energy, while satisfying the quality of service (QoS) requirements of D2D links. We then abstract the scheduling principles in the optimal algorithm, and propose a distributed scheduling algorithm for D2D communication with RF-EH, EHLinQ, which realizes the principles in a distributed manner. Moreover, we extend EHLinQ to a power beacon (PB) aided D2D communication system in which a PB transmits RF signals dedicated for RF-EH. The extended EHLinQ allows the PB to determine its own PB scheduling considering the QoS satisfaction of D2D links. Through simulation results, we show that EHLinQ outperforms conventional algorithms, while closely meeting the QoS requirements.},

  abstract     = {In fifth-generation technology, device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaid with a cellular network provides a feasible solution for proximity-based wireless applications and services. D2D communication allows a direct connection between two devices without traversing through the base station. It can potentially reduce the data traffic in the cellular networks with improved spectral and energy efficiency. However, interference management is a primary concern when D2D links utilize the same resources occupied by cellular users. In this paper, we propose a location-based power control approach to mitigate the severe interference components for underlaying D2D communication cellular network for multicell scenario. Moreover, outage analysis for the cellular user as well as D2D user is carried out by using the tools from stochastic geometry. Outage performance is further improved by employing a cooperation approach that also enables D2D user&#39;s power saving. Further, area spectral efficiency (ASE) analysis is performed using the proposed power control and cooperation approach for the overall system model. We obtain the optimal D2D user density to maximize the ASE. Finally, the numerical results are presented to validate the analytic observations of the proposed framework.},

In this article, we find the optimal static policies of nodes in order to minimize the sum of the average transmission delays, while the average transmission delay of each node is constrained. The static policy of each node specifies the probability of accepting an unsuccessfully transmitted packet of the other node and how the node prioritizes its transmissions. We show that in the optimal policies, just the node with the better link to destination may relay the packets of the other node. We derive optimal acceptance probability of the relaying node in closed form, and show that it should transmit the packets of the other node first. Moreover, we prove that the noncooperation policy is optimal if the ratio of successful transmission rates of nodes does not exceed the Golden ratio. We also show that FD capability of nodes is helpful only when full-acceptance is the optimal policy. Efficiency of the attained optimal policy is illustrated by numerical results.},

Nevertheless, most of the work reported in the literature ignores the radio frequency impairments such as carrier frequency offset (CFO), which is known to be of significant impact on OFDM. Consequently, this paper considers the performance evaluation of precoded OFDM (P-OFDM) in the presence of CFO. The performance of the considered P-OFDM is evaluated in terms of the signal-to-interference plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and BER. Various channel models are considered and closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the exact SINR. The obtained analytical results, corroborated by simulation, show that P-OFDM is substantially more sensitive to CFO compared with conventional OFDM. Generally speaking, if the normalized CFO is about 18\%, then OFDM will outperform P-OFDM for most practical channel models. It is also interesting to note that the subcarriers in P-OFDM may experience different SINRs, which is not the case for conventional OFDM. The paper also considers the SINR of OFDM after the equalization process. The obtained results show that ignoring the impact of the equalization process results in inflated SINR degradation.},

Each SU generates a binary local decision, which is then transmitted either directly or via the assistance of intermediate relays to a cognitive radio base station (CRBS), where the global decision is made. The fusion process at the CRBS is performed using the local binary decisions made by the individual SUs. The local binary decisions at the relays and CRBS are regenerated based on dynamic thresholds, which are chosen to minimize the probability of the spectrum sensing error (PSSE) by considering the imbalanced nature of the spectrum occupancy, as well as the reliability of the decisions made by the SUs. The PSSE performance is derived where a closed-form analytical expression is obtained. The analytical results corroborated by Monte Carlo simulation show that using adaptive detection can reduce the PSSE significantly as compared to the conventional detection approach.},

The most successful anytime-reliable transmission systems developed so far are based on channel codes and channel coding theory. In this paper, another focus is proposed, placing the stress on the waveform level rather than just on the coding level. This alleviates the coding and decoding complexity problems faced by other proposals. To this purpose, chaos theory is successfully exploited in order to design two different anytime-reliable alternatives. The anytime-reliability property is formally demonstrated in each case for the AWGN channel, under given conditions. The simulation results shown validate the theoretical developments, and demonstrate that these systems can achieve anytime reliability with affordable resource expenditure.},

Both instantaneous and statistical security-reliability tradeoffs are taken into consideration. For instantaneous model, the security and the reliability are characterized by the secrecy rate and the data rate, respectively. We aim at maximizing the tradeoff function of a tradeoff factor subject to a total transmit power constraint. For statistical model, the security and the reliability are characterized by the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the data outage probability (DOP), respectively. An SOP optimization problem is developed with a DOP constraint and a total transmit power constraint. For both the problems, closed-form solutions are achieved.

Such a hybrid network is of particular interest to rural and remote areas served with slow DSL connections not being able to deliver bandwidth-demanding services. The framework addresses practical resource allocation challenges encountered by such hybrid systems, notably on the need to tackle different dynamics of the wireline and wireless channels, and to accommodate subscribers&#39; diverse traffic demands. We introduce the concept of throughput gap (TG), which plays a pivotal role in forging efficient internetwork resource allocation for the hybrid network while facilitating coexistence of legacy DSL modems. Specifically, underutilized LTE resource blocks are opportunistically scheduled as an add-on, on an on-demand basis, to fill the TG of the hybrid modem. Based on this concept, the resource allocation problem is formulated as a system throughput maximization problem, subject to resource availability, TG fulfillment, user admission, transmit power, and physical resource block allocation constraints. We decompose this difficult mixed-integer programming problem into three subproblems that can be solved sequentially. Efficient numerical algorithms are proposed to solve these subproblems, which map to different layers of the LTE protocol stack, and are coupled through signaling exchanges to solve the master problem, resulting in a cross-layer design. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides converged network operators a cost-effective alternative to increase the throughput of slow DSL connections when the need arises by leveraging existing LTE infrastructure.},

Numerical analyses show that under the hardness of a noisy environment, the OCDM scheme is able to soften the impulsive noise effects better than previous schemes. Also, the OCDM scheme yields better results when the channel length is unknown, in comparison to Hermitian symmetric OFDM and single carrier-cyclic prefix schemes.

In this article, we present an in-depth quantitative evaluation of commodity IEEE 802.11ad devices by forming a 60-GHz WLAN with two docking stations mimicking as access points (APs). Through extensive experiments, we provide important insights about directional coverage pattern of antennas, communication range, and cochannel interference and blockages. We are able to measure the IEEE 802.11ad link alignment and association overheads in absolute time units. With a very high accuracy (96\%-97\%), our blockage characterization can differentiate between temporary and permanent blockages caused by humans in the indoor environment, which is a key insight. Utilizing our blockage characterization, we also demonstrate intelligent handoff to alternate APs using consumer-grade IEEE 802.11ad devices. Our blockage-induced handoff experiments provide important insights that would be helpful in integrating millimeter wave-based WLANs into future wireless networks.},

  abstract     = {The smart grid (SG) modernizes the aging power grid by using two-way reliable communications dedicated to adaptive energy management. To achieve this goal, smart utility networks (SUNs) are used to efficiently connect the SG devices. However, the SUNs are designed to work on unlicensed frequency bands and are very sensitive to interferences from other networks operating in the same band, such as wireless local area networks (WLANs). Therefore, in this paper, the effect of the WLAN interferers on the SUN transmission is investigated and we show that by detecting the initial transmission offset of each WLAN transceiver using energy sensing, the activity of the interferers can be predicted with high accuracy. Furthermore, we prove that the SUN data bit error rate is time dependent and that each SUN bit has a different bit error rate expression depending on its time offset. These expressions are derived analytically and verified by Monte Carlo simulations. In fact, these expressions can be used by the SUN devices to enhance their communication links in the presence of WLAN devices by using adaptive transmission techniques to avoid the interference.},

Our previous work proposed an AN scheme that allocates some of eigen-subchannels to transmit AN signals for improving secrecy rates. Nevertheless, our previous work considered only uncorrelated MIMO Rayleigh fading channels. In fact, the correlations among antennas exist in realistic scattering channel environments. In this paper, we extend our previous AN scheme to spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels at both legitimate receiver and eavesdropper sides and derive an exact theoretical expression for the ergodic secrecy rate of the AN scheme, along with an approximate analysis. Both numerical and simulation results show that the proposed AN scheme offers a higher ergodic secrecy rate than the existing schemes, revealing a fact that the correlation among eavesdropper&#39;s antennas can potentially improve the secrecy rate of an MIMO system.},

Such a network consists of some distributed secondary users (SUs) and a hybrid access point (H-AP) as a secondary network which is in the vicinity of a primary network. In this model, H-AP and SUs can operate in two modes which are an in-band full-duplex (I-FD) mode and the half-duplex (HD) mode. In the former mode, the network is called FD-CWPCN-FD while for the latter mode the HD-CWPCN-HD is used. An underlay spectrum sharing model is also considered. The goal is to maximize the sum-throughput of SUs by optimal selection of allocated time and energy to SUs in both I-FD and HD modes. By using convex optimization techniques and proposing an algorithm that is called H-AP-based joint optimal time and power allocation, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the optimal allocated time and energy. Numerical results illustrate when the transmitted power from H-AP is low or self-interference cancellation in H-AP is more accurate, FD-CWPCN-FD has higher sum-throughput than HD-CWPCN-HD.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the developments of wireless communication technologies, mobile health (M-Health) has been postulated as a promising means to improve healthcare quality and save lives in emergencies. However, using wireless communications in M-Health faces the following challenges. First, the wireless transmission may generate electromagnetic interference (EMI) and trigger critical malfunctions to the medical devices. Second, different types of M-Health applications and time-varying patient conditions require dynamic quality of service (QoS). Third, energy efficiency (EE) should be optimized to guarantee the reliability of M-Health services, considering the limitations of the existing battery technologies. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the joint channel and power resource allocation problem for vehicular M-Health communications. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) to maximize the system EE with the consideration of EMI constraints on medical equipment and dynamic QoS requirements of medical users. To find possible solutions, we reformulate the MINLP problem by relaxing the integer variables and transforming the objective to convex forms. Based on the dual-decomposition method, we first obtain the optimal power allocation and then recover the channel allocation variables to integers. To satisfy the QoS requirements, we develop two channel allocation strategies, i.e., the QoS fulfillment strategy and the QoS compensation strategy. The swap-blocking allocation concept is introduced to guarantee the optimality of the obtained solutions. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation scheme improves the system EE and service satisfaction degree.},

  abstract     = {The cognitive infrastructureless network has received significant attention to reduce signaling load in next-generation networks, which are expected to be ultradense with very high peak rate but relatively lower expected traffic per user. Research in this area has evolved from the distributed algorithms requiring prior knowledge of the number of secondary users (SUs) U to the existing algorithms, which can estimate U independently by counting the number of collisions. The major drawback of these algorithms is the large number of collisions leading to wastage of power and bring down the effective life of battery operated SUs. In this paper, we develop algorithms that learn faster and incurs fewer collisions. We assume unknown U with two types of networks: fixed U (i.e., static networks) and time-varying U (i.e., dynamic networks). Proposed algorithms are based on the multiplayer multi-armed bandit (MAB) approach. We show that the proposed algorithms offer constant regret (i.e., throughput loss) with high probability and sub-linear regret in static and dynamic networks, respectively. Theoretical analysis, simulation, and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in terms of vacant spectrum utilization, regret, and the number of collisions. Fewer collisions significantly increase the operational life of SUs.},

However, existing solutions do not solve all the problems, some schemes are not scalable, once the system is deployed, it is unable to add new meters to the system, in some schemes, the electricity consumption data are encrypted using the utility supplier&#39;s public key, if the utility supplier accidentally obtains the encrypted data, it is able to decrypt the data.

This may eventually raise a concern on the performance and security of these energy utilities. To resolve this issue, an inoculated subobserver-based fusion filter is proposed. It improves the resilience against malicious attacks in combined cycle power plants with desalination units, which are usually functioning in a closed-loop environment and infected with injected attacks. A time-delay-based state representation is considered for the system. To access latency in a closed-loop environment, a subsystem-based set of subobservers are introduced. Information from each sensor is then gathered using the interacting-multiple-model-based fusion process. The stability of the system has been proved and kept in-check at two different implementation levels of the procedure using functional equivalence and Lyapunov stability criteria, respectively. Performance evaluation is then conducted on a water-level system. Results show that the proposed scheme accurately extracted the system parameters from the contaminated measurements in the presence of multiple system disturbances and cyber intervention.},

Attackers can falsify the sensor measurements employed for AGC operation causing service outage and infrastructural damage. In this article, a method is developed to detect and mitigate possible cyber-attack schemes such as false data injection and denial-of-service attacks targeting the AGC systems. The proposed method is termed as cyber-attack detection and mitigation platform (CDMP) and utilizes the forecasted data of area control error for identification and mitigation of attacks. The CDMP strategy involves three stages for optimal operation and identifies any arbitrary false data injected to the grid. For the investigation, three area system with multiple generations and distribution companies under bilateral trading is considered. The test model is also equipped with inertia emulation technique supported by battery management system. It is because the modern power system is advancing toward inverter-dominated system from synchronous-based system due to high penetration of renewables. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified using rigorous simulation results.},

In this article, the generator terminal bus frequencies (approximately representing respective rotor speeds) are estimated by PMUs and their differences are considered as input control signals to WAPSSs. In case if the communication constraints associated with transfer of estimated frequencies are not addressed properly then they may reduce the damping capability of WAPSSs. In this context, simple and time-efficient techniques are proposed to compensate time-delay and to predict input signals in case of data drops and attacks for improving the performance of WAPSSs. A cryptographic security by means of hashed algorithms is provided to remote signals for the detection of occurrence and period of cyber-attack. The parameters of WAPSSs are tuned using a hybrid optimization algorithm. The efficacy of proposed technique is validated on IEEE 39-bus system operating under different conditions.},

  abstract     = {Data mining is widely applied to establish connections among the items in massive datasets nowadays. Association rule mining is one of the most popular methods to perform data mining, and a fundamental part of this is frequent itemset mining. Big-scale data are uploaded to the honest-but-curious cloud service provider (CSP). Therefore, it is imperative to protect the raw data from being obtained by the CSP and the third parties. Furthermore, because supermarket transactions are sparse, they are not suitable to be mined using the same methods used for most of the other data. The methods used for ordinary data will cost more computation power if they are applied on this special dataset. In this paper, we propose an efficient protocol to evaluate whether an itemset is frequent or not under the encrypted mining query on supermarket transactions. To improve the mining efficiency, we design a blocking algorithm. In this algorithm, we separate the encrypted transactions into blocks and only calculate bilinear pairings on ciphertexts of part blocks instead of all ciphertexts, which helps cut down the computation cost of the mining process. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our protocol by conducting theoretical analyses and simulator experiments in the aspects of computation cost, security, correctness, and running time. The results demonstrate that our protocol can output a correct mining result and clearly outperforms the previous solution in the aspect of efficiency under the same security level.},

  abstract     = {The radical advancement in web services has drawn more attention toward intensifying the security of numerous applications that interact and serve the Internet users. In order to access the different applications on the web, users need to disclose their personal credentials such as username and password to the servers to get authenticated. This private information should be prevented from being exploited due to different security attacks that will result in illegal activities. Securing the systems from several attacks is vital. In comparison to all the security attacks, insider attacks are devastating due to the privilege the insiders of an organization possess to breach the information, which results in irrecoverable damage to both user and the organization. Numerous protocols were proposed to secure the system from insider attacks but proved to be inefficient. This article puts forward a novel authentication protocol for insider attacks based on a robust cryptographic algorithm, ECC. The informal security analysis of the protocol reveals that the proposed protocol is not only immune to insider attacks but also prevents several attacks. It shows that the protocol is relatively better than other existing protocols in terms of computational cost and communication overhead with high level of security.},

  abstract     = {As we acknowledge that vehicle-to-grid (V2G) network holds obvious predominance in economic benefits, it attracts wide attentions of power system and electric vehicle (EV) users. However, lots of security issues hinder its further development. For example, many existing V2G schemes use the bilinear pairing to implement authentication protocol, resulting in high computational costs. In addition, the system master key in the existing V2G scheme is generated independently by a trusted third party, so the system master key is vulnerable to leakage if the third party is compromised by the adversary. In this article, we propose a novel privacy-preserving authentication scheme for V2G networks. Specifically, this scheme employs the nonsupersingular elliptic curve to construct a lightweight authentication protocol for EV and smart grid. Meanwhile, system master key in the proposed scheme is generated by the key agreement protocol, i.e., a protocol that is constructed using a secure two-party computation between the third party authority and the dispatching center. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is provably secure under the random oracle model. Compared with related schemes, the proposed scheme can not only improve the authentication efficiency of V2G networks, but also prevent internal attacker. Experimental results indicate that our scheme is of practical significance for V2G networks.},

We use a novel multilayer, automated, and multistage deep residual network for the anomaly detection in the biomedical signals. Generally, the biomedical datasets have class imbalance problem; hence, we leverage the concepts of undersampling techniques to address this issue. The proposed algorithm is validated on the publicly available benchmark MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and CHB-MIT Scalp databases. The results show a significant improvement in terms of the sensitivity of 90\% and 97.1\% for supraventricular and ventricular beats for best fold, respectively. The accuracy obtained is at par with most of the state-of-the-art methods, and in particular, for the supraventricular beats, the proposed method outperforms all but one state-of-the-art method. The advantage of the proposed method is that it gives reliable results with EEG samples of small duration and, as opposed to other state-of-the-art methods, it does not involve any preprocessing, hence computationally efficient. Additionally, the proposed algorithm provides 81\% sensitivity for seizure detection in EEG signals, which is comparable to existing deep learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is becoming more and more popular due to its key features like scalability, flexibility, and monitoring. SDN simplifies the network management and enables innovations in the network architecture and protocols. However, this flexible architecture also makes it vulnerable to different types of attacks, such as flooding, spoofing, and denial-of-service (DoS). Among these attacks, the DoS attack has the most severe impact as it can overwhelm the major components of SDN to degrade its performance. In this paper, we propose a simple and lightweight detection and mitigation system (DAISY) to secure SDN from DoS attacks by blocking malicious traffic from the attacker, after analyzing the collected statistics. The proposed system specifically blocks malicious traffic rather than blocking the whole port or a host. In addition, it unblocks a port or a host when there is no more malicious traffic originating from it. We evaluate our proposed system by comparing it with other approaches, and the simulation results show increased performance of SDN with DAISY in terms of CPU usage, response time, control channel bandwidth, packet delivery ratio, and flow requests sent to the controller.},

The protection of a content against unauthorized access requires consumer authentication and involves the conventional end-to-end encryption. However, in ICN, such end-to-end encryption makes the content caching ineffective since encrypted contents stored in a cache are useless for any consumers except those who know the encryption key. For effective caching of encrypted contents in ICN, we propose a secure distribution of protected content (SDPC) scheme, which ensures that only authenticated consumers can access the content. SDPC is lightweight and allows consumers to verify the originality of the published content by using a symmetric key encryption. SDPC also provides protection against privacy leakage. The security of SDPC was proved with the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and Scyther tool verification, and simulation results show that SDPC can reduce the content download delay.},

By employing a classical additive hardware distortion model, the joint hardware impairment effects brought by both access points (APs) and user equipments have been taken into account, whereas the eavesdropper is assumed to be equipped with perfect hardware. Thereby, we derive a closed-form lower bound for the ergodic secrecy rate in the presence of imperfect channel state information. To obtain further insights, we investigate asymptotic secrecy performance under different hardware scaling factors. It proves that the hardware-quality scaling effect vanishes as the number of APs increases in the considered secure cell-free massive MIMO system with active attack. Furthermore, by using continuous approximation and path-following algorithms, the optimal power allocation scheme is obtained to maximize the achievable secrecy rate. Numerical results validate the derived results and the efficiency of the proposed power allocation scheme.},

In such an environment, the malicious injection of data has the potential to cause severe consequences. Classical residual-based methods for bad data detection are unable to detect well designed false data injection (FDI) attacks. Moreover, most of the works on FDI attack detection are based on the linearized DC model of the power system and fails to detect attacks based on the AC model. The aim of this paper is to address these problems by using the graph structure of the grid and the AC power flow model. We derive an attack detection method that is able to detect previously undetectable FDI attacks. This method is based on concepts originating from graph signal processing (GSP). The proposed detection scheme calculates the graph Fourier transform of an estimated grid state and filters the graph&#39;s high-frequency components. By comparing the maximum norm of this outcome with a threshold, we can detect the presence of FDI attacks. Case studies on the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method is able to detect a wide range of previously undetectable attacks, both on angles and on magnitudes of the voltages.},

  abstract     = {Opinion maximization in social networks is an optimization problem, which targets at determining some influential individuals (i.e., seed nodes), propagating the desired opinion to their neighbors, and eventually obtaining maximum opinion spread. Previous studies assume that influence power of one individual is mainly calculated by using some network structure properties and once the opinion of one individual is determined, its opinion usually keeps unchanged. However, in the real scenario, the influence power of one individual may be unknown and should be closely associated with the dynamic opinion formation process. In this paper, we propose a novel Influence Power-based Opinion Framework (IPOF) to solve the opinion maximization problem, which is composed of two phases: 1) influence power estimation, and 2) elimination of influence overlapping (EIO). Specifically, we design the exponential influence power and estimate the unknown parameter of influence power through maximum likelihood estimation due to its simplicity, practicability, and superior convergence in large samples. To generate the opinion series dynamically, the weighted voter model is proposed by leveraging influence power and intimate degree. Moreover, we also prove that the likelihood function is concave by using Hessian matrix. To determine the initial seed nodes and facilitate large opinion propagation, influence power-based EIO algorithm is proposed. Experimental results in six social networks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

To mitigate the IFA, interest Negative ACKnowledgments (NACK) may be one of the best countering candidates in NDN, yet does not attract enough concerns. In this paper, we first present a more powerful type of IFA using interest packets with real names rather than spoofed ones to confuse detections. Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of interest NACK on mitigating IFA via a modified susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model. In this quantitative analysis tool, we introduce a variable curing parameter to accurately characterize the impact of interest NACK on chosen NDN routers. Moreover, we derive the upper bound for the infection fraction of NDN routers with and without interest NACK, and deduce the relationship between the fraction of total infected nodes and those with NACK implementation. In addition, the accuracy of the proposed model is verified by extensive simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to theoretically analyze the NDN NACK mechanism on mitigating IFA via the epidemic theory.},

  abstract     = {A region-based querying has been widely used to update the freshness of query result and reduce the query traffic in diverse wireless networks. Most prior querying approaches implicitly assume infrastructure-based networks but we need to relax this assumption by considering limited coverage or even unavailability of the network. In this paper, we propose an elastic validity region and its corresponding query operation, called MQry, in an infrastructure-less network with mobile point-of-interests (POIs). Due to the mobility of nodes and POIs, it is challenging how to efficiently build and update a validity region. Each query replying node that contributes in building an initial validity region judiciously switches its monitor operation on the queried POI. The query issuing node adjusts the current validity region to reduce the number of redundant queries without hurting the freshness of queried result. The query operations of both query issuing and replying nodes are depicted using finite state machines for clarity. We conduct extensive simulation experiments using the OMNeT++ for performance evaluation and comparison with four existing schemes. The simulation results show that the MQry can adaptively change the size of validity region and be a viable querying approach in infrastructure-less networks.},

  abstract     = {Digital signature schemes have been extensively studied in the literature, where a large number of such schemes with different properties have been designed for different applications. For example, identity-based signature (IBS) schemes can efficiently map a user&#39;s digital public key to his/her real-world identity (e.g., e-mail address). However, existing implementations of IBS schemes are not generally designed for white-box security (WBS), particularly concerning the protection of the private key when special attackers have full access to the execution environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first white-box implementation for the classical Shamir&#39;s IBS scheme. The basic idea is to utilize a mathematical transformation for embedding private key into some special tables, such that the original private key could be “invisible” during the execution process. We then analyze the security requirements achieved in our implementation, including the conventional black-box security under the random oracle model and WBS (e.g., key recovery attack resilience). This is the first IBS scheme implementation that satisfies WBS. It is also shown from the simulation that the implementation incurs a constant computational cost, which is realistic in deployments where a high security level is required.},

In contrast to previous work, our mechanism integrates fresh rekeying and masking techniques at an interval, where these techniques are driven by the maximum number of side-channel leakage traces required toward a successful embedded attack. Hence, the mechanism tracks the effect of attacks on the number of traces, and consequently applies rekeying at suitable intervals to reduce the computational/communication overhead, while increasing the attack cost. The mechanism scalability was evaluated against an advanced attack model based on machine learning methods that reduces significantly the number of traces required for a successful attack under masking implementation.},

To solve the challenge, in this paper, a novel algorithm is presented on the multiagent information gathering problem. First, the physical environment is modeled as an undirected graph, where information obeying the multistate Markov chain is distributed in each vertex. Each agent is allocated in a designated area, where the objective of the team is to gather as much valuable information as possible. Second, this problem is formulated as the factored multiagent partially observable Markov decision process. Furthermore, a scalable centralized online planning algorithm is proposed by iteratively computing patrolling routes for each agent in a greedy fashion. These patrols are bounded optimal in specific conditions. In addition, we evaluate the algorithm on multiagent information gathering scenarios empirically by benchmarking it against some state-of-the-art online planning solvers, i.e., partially observable Monte Carlo planning and factor-value partially observable Monte Carlo planning. Experimental results show that the algorithm typically performs at least 9.04\% better than these solvers in the four-agent patrolling problem with coupling degree being three, and can scale up to 100 agents with complex coupling relationships.},

Public verification allows anyone to check the integrity of remote data so that it has a wider application in public cloud storage. Private verification just allows the data owner to verify the data integrity, which is mainly applied for the verification of secret data. However, in many real applications, the data owner expects a specific user to check the files in cloud storage, whereas others cannot execute such work. It is obvious that neither public verification nor private verification can satisfy such a requirement. To solve this issue, Ren et al. provided a designated-verifier provable data possession (DV-PDP) protocol. Unfortunately, the DV-PDP is insecure against replay attack launched by the malicious cloud server. To overcome this shortcoming, we present a new RDPC scheme with the designated verifier, in which the data owner specifies a unique verifier to check the data integrity. Based on the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption, we prove the security for our RDPC scheme in a random oracle model. The theoretical analysis and experiment results indicate that our scheme has less communication, storage, and computation overhead while achieving high error detection probability.},

Traditional IFA detection methods are simply based on the PIT expiration rate or the Interest satisfaction rate, which cannot distinguish the IFA from other attack approaches. Besides, the traditional threshold-based methods are easily affected by the value of the thresholds. In this article, we propose an IFA detection mechanism based on the support vector machine (SVM), which can detect the IFA timely and accurately. In order to improve the accuracy of the attack detection, we present to use the entropy of the Interest names, the satisfaction rate of the Interests, and the usage of the PIT as the extracted features in the SVM classifier.

To overcome these drawbacks, in this article, we develop a Bayesian-inference-based sliding window trust model to identify and weed out independent and collaborative probabilistic SSDF attackers without any prior knowledge of the attack behaviors. Based on this model, the trust value of each SU is obtained by combining the weighted intermediate sensing information from multiple small sliding windows. A sigmoid-log-function-based scheme is introduced to mitigate trust value fluctuations caused by different attacking probabilities. Finally, extensive simulation results show that compared with existing schemes, the proposed approach can identify probabilistic SSDF attackers effectively and isolate them with a higher detection rate across a wide range of attacking scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Geo-Social Networks (GSN) significantly improve location-aware capability of services by offering geo-located content based on the huge volumes of data generated in the GSN. The problem of user location prediction based on user-generated data in GSN has been extensively studied. However, existing studies are either concerning predicting users’ next check-in location or predicting their future check-in location at a given time with coarse granularity. A unified model that can predict both scenarios with fine granularity is quite rare. Also, due to the heterogeneity of multiple factors associated with both locations and users, how to efficiently incorporate these information still remains challenging. Inspired by the recent success of word embedding in natural language processing, in this paper, we propose a novel embedding model called Venue2Vec which automatically incorporates temporal-spatial context, semantic information, and sequential relations for fine-grained user location prediction. Locations of the same type, and those that are geographically close or often visited successively by users will be situated closer within the embedding space. Based on our proposed Venue2Vec model, we design techniques that allow for predicting a user’s next check-in location, and also their future check-in location at a given time. We conduct experiments on three real-world GSN datasets to verify the performance of the proposed model. Experimental results on both tasks show that Venue2Vec model outperforms several state-of-the-art models on various evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we show how the Venue2Vec model can be more time-efficient due to being parallelizable.},

For privacy concerns, several research works on ranked multi-keyword search over the encrypted cloud data under multiple data owner model have been developed. However, most of these schemes are vulnerable to keyword guessing attacks and equivalence test attack. Besides, they cannot accurately return the top-k ranked search results from the encrypted data of different data owners to the data users. Obviously, these drawbacks may incur leakage of privacy-sensitive keyword information and the inaccuracy of returned search results. Therefore, in this article, we first propose a novel efficient ranked multi-keyword retrieval scheme with keyword privacy for multiple data owners, which empowers the cloud server to perform multi-keyword search over the cloud data and then, return the top-k ranked search results to data users without leaking any keyword and trapdoor information. Additionally, we show through rigorous security analysis that our scheme is secure against the attacks launched by inside attackers and outside attackers. Finally, the performance evaluation indicates that our scheme has more satisfactory features than the existing ranked multi-keyword search schemes.},

Edge computing can potentially enhance the computational capabilities of a network, and microservice can help the network adapt to various mobile-health applications. In such a network, we present the design of its architecture, the allocation of its resources, as well as the management of its data. Specifically, we address a three-tier network architecture for mobile-health applications from the perspectives of communication, computation, as well as service. Also, we discuss the issues of resource allocation within the network in order to optimize its performance.

  abstract     = {Recently, one of the most popular technologies of the modern era, the Internet of Things, allows the deployment and usage of various real-time test beds in various smart applications. One such application is the e-healthcare, in which patients&#39; healthcare related data are transmitted to the nearest base station and then to a local or remote server as per the requirements. The data related to patients&#39; health are sensitive and need special protection, therefore, the integrity and authentication of the sources of data generation are paramount concerns. However, several authentication or signature schemes that have been introduced in the past for this purpose are ID-based or having certificate-less settings. In these settings, a central authority, known as a trusted authority (TA), creates and distributes the secret key of every user. Thus, knowing the secrete key by the TA is called key escrow problem. But, these proposed schemes suffer from key distribution problems, which limit their applications in various applications. To mitigate these issues, this paper presents a certificate-based pairing free aggregate signature scheme (CBPFAS). The proposed scheme uses the merits of public key cryptography (PKC) and identity-based PKC (IDBPKC). The scheme is proven to be unforgeable, assuming the hardness of elliptic curve discrete log problem (ECDLP). The performance analysis shows that the proposed CBPFAS scheme executes in $0.78(n+1)$ ms in comparison to $9.63+1.17$n ms in [1], $9.63+0.78$n ms in [2], $9.63+3.39$n ms in [3], and $9.63+1.17$n ms in [4]. From these results, it is concluded that the proposed pairing free certificate-based aggregate signature scheme performs better than its counterparts.},

A hierarchical framework with a built-in Gaussian Markov random field model is proposed to provide adaptive sampling for efficient field reconstruction. In the proposed framework, a nonmyopic planner is operated at a sink to navigate the mobile sensing agents in the field to the sites that are most informative. Meanwhile, a myopic planner is carried out on board each agent. A tradeoff between computationally intensive global optimization and efficient local greedy search is incorporated into the system. The mobile sensing agents can be scheduled online through an anytime algorithm to visit and observe the high-information sites. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are used to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed planner in model exploitation and adaptive sampling for environmental field mapping.},

This paper presents an alternative solution to this problem, using site-based voter information push to the center, with reduced communication complexity, using a unique sampling technique. This technique is utilized to come up with a winner or an approximate winner with very high probability for Approval-based and Scoring-based rules. The site-push algorithm introduced here has been validated with correctness results, and has also been analyzed for different scenarios to see the improvement in the number of messages initiated, in comparison to the center-based pull algorithm considered for a checkpoint-based protocol. The effect of this algorithm is to reduce the communication complexity by a factor of (1 + log k/log n/k) in comparison to the center-pull algorithm (where k is the number of voting sites, and n the number of voters), which leads to a large reduction in communication complexity in democratic election scenarios. Also, to analyze other scenarios, simulation results are presented to show how the algorithm fares under randomized voter assignment, with variations in the value of total voters, total sites and the approximation parameter ϵ.},

Rapid connection and disconnection with the access points (APs) impact the performance of quality-of-service to indoor train communication. To ensure a high-data-rate delivery and highly reliable connection to the Internet for end-users, we propose a novel method of handling packet flows in HST communication networks based on software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization. Our proposed combination of technologies is called smart virtualization. The approach in this paper is based on making decisions to change the paths of packet flows between the APs, depending on the use of a triggering signal to initiate layer 2 handover. This packet path switching is controlled by an SDN controller. Our proposed approach operates by sending train information via a train head triggering signal for proactive registration in advance when the train enters an overlap area of AP signals. The suggested software-defined network has been emulated and performed by using the Mininet simulator and the MATLAB platform. After extensive testing, the obtained results that were supported by the triggering signal have an efficient reduction in delay and packet loss than the obtained results without using triggering signal. The average control delay time was reduced by nearly 45\%, and the retrieved data were roughly 90\% of packet loss when adopting the triggering signal system.},

  abstract     = {Software-defined networking decouples the control plane and data plane, which grants more computing power for routing computations. Traditional routing methods suffer from the complex dynamics in networking, and they are facing issues such as slow convergence and performance decline. Deep learning techniques have shown preliminary results on solving the routing problem, and bringing more accuracy, precision, and intelligence compared with traditional modeling techniques. However, the existing deep learning architectures are not built to learn from the crucial topological relations between forwarding nodes, which restricts the model&#39;s ability to handle different network conditions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based intelligent routing strategy with revised graph-aware neural networks, which learns topological information efficiently. In addition, a set of features suitable for network routing are designed so that the networking state are well represented upon each routing decision. In experiments, the performance of the proposed work is demonstrated with a real-world topology and the production level software switches. The execution time is evaluated on various kinds of network topology and different network scales. Also, the simulation result shows that the proposed work is more accurate and efficient compared to the state-of-the-art routing strategy.},

  abstract     = {Vehicles can be easily tracked due to the proliferation of vehicle-mounted global positioning system (GPS) devices. VTracer is a cost-effective mobile system for online trajectory compression and tracing vehicles, taking the streaming GPS data as inputs. Online trajectory compression, which seeks a concise and (near) spatial-lossless data representation before revealing the next vehicle&#39;s GPS position, is gradually becoming a promising way to alleviate burdens such as communication bandwidth, storing, and cloud computing. In general, an accurate online mapmatcher is a prerequisite. This two-phase approach is nontrivial because we need to overcome the essential contradiction caused by the resource-constrained GPS devices and the heavy computation tasks. VTracer meets the challenge by leveraging the idea of mobile edge computing. More specifically, we offload the heavy computation tasks to the nearby smartphones of drivers (i.e., smartphones play the role of cloudlets), which are almost idle during driving. More importantly, they have relatively more powerful computing capacity. We have implemented VTracer on the Android platform and evaluate it based on a real driving trace dataset generated in the city of Chongqing, China. Experimental results demonstrate that VTracer achieves the excellent performance in terms of matching accuracy, compression ratio, and it also costs the acceptable memory, energy, and app size.},

The method is based on a set of simultaneous probabilistic finite-state machines (SPFSMs). It can evaluate the OE of the whole system and subeffectiveness of subsystems simultaneously. This makes it convenient to analyze the main OE influencing factors and to provide effectiveness improvement plans. To achieve this, the traditional probabilistic finite-state machine (PFSM) model of the whole system is decomposed into a set of PFSM models of subsystems. This makes it possible to consider more influencing factors of both friendly and hostile forces, without a sharp increase in the model size. To make the method applicable universally, this article proposes a complete theoretical system of SPFSM sets, including the definition and properties. And to reflect the random property of system inputs, a set of input probabilities is added to traditional PFSM definitions. Based on this theory, this article gives concrete OE evaluation methods and steps. A simulation example of an antiship missile is given and analyzed to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {A final solution must be selected from a set of Pareto optimal solutions in the end when a multiobjective optimization problem is solved. Such selection becomes much more complicated for systems engineering when it involves multiple decision makers (DMs). This article proposes a weight induced norm (WIN) approach to group decision making from a systems engineering perspective. The importance of DMs and their preferences on objectives are associated with weighting coefficients using existing transformations. The weights are used to define a norm, introducing the concept of distance. Solution quality is assessed in the objective space. The final solution is the one that corresponds with the vector closest to a normalized ideal vector. Theoretical analysis is conducted to show a number of superior features of the WIN approach: backward compatibility, weighted-sum equivalence, Pareto compliance, invariability in normalization, and pairwise consistency. Numerical analysis illustrates that the WIN approach can produce a final solution reflecting the DMs&#39; importance and their preferences adequately; the WIN approach to solution selection can be interpreted using geometrical or algebraic arguments, which facilitates the DMs&#39; understanding of the decision process; it can readily distinguish the best solution from the remaining ones to avoid ambiguity.},

  abstract     = {Managing the lifecycle of the elements of a complex and safety-critical system, from conceptual design to support in operation, is still a relevant challenge in the industrial domain. Starting from research and engineering activities, up to production and delivery, the need of maintaining the trace of dependence, changes, and possible updates regarding the final product is a crucial aspect for success. Particularly, conceptual and preliminary design activities are affected by a high level of uncertainty and a certain degree of project instability, usually caused by the need to explore alternative solutions and variants. Different tasks are performed concerning the identification of system requirements, functional and physical behavior using model-based design (MBD), and model-based systems engineering, which, generally, are subjected to extensive trade studies aimed at identifying the best solution. In this context, this paper presents how model-based digital twin and threads concepts will likely change the way in which the MBD process is managed, overcoming the issues associated with federated IT infrastructures and with tools integration. Notably, lifecycle and nonlifecycle related interoperability aspects are described, with particular focus on the exploitation of standards for lifecycle collaboration and heterogeneous simulation. The design of an ice protection system for a regional aircraft is selected as case study, starting from the work performed by the authors within the EC-funded research project CRYSTAL.},

It describes the proposed approach and provides lessons learnt to generalize ESE to any specific engineering discipline of interest. A mapping between the learning objectives of ESE and the CDIO education framework is proposed. It extends the concept of hands-on SE education. It will be useful to educators interested in novel approaches to SE education and to experiment new ways to deliver a subject that is traditionally believed difficult to teach in university.},

  abstract     = {Projections indicate a high-risk water stress level (+80\%) in the Western Cape province of South Africa by 2040. The reassessment of water management is paramount in ensuring water security for the generations to come. Water management approach, which recognizes the value of alternative water sources such as Urban Wastewater recycling (UWWR) amid shrinking surface water supplies is of critical importance. This management process mimics natural systems, placing the focus on stakeholder engagement and meaningful public participation. The objective is to ensure a vibrant economy, social equity, and protection of water resources for current and future generations. This paper&#39;s main goal is the assessment of the impact of UWWR on water availability in the Stellenbosch urban water system. Vensim PLE 7.2 systems dynamic modeling tools constructed the qualitative and quantitative systems dynamics models. The results from the simulation indicated that UWWR in Stellenbosch has a significant potential of augmenting water supplies over a period of ten years. Of the three scenarios investigated, the 50\% reuse scenario projected the best option for augmenting water supplies. In addition, results extrapolated from availability index graphs, depicted a water availability index, which is greater than 1 for every UWWR scenario investigated, i.e., 10\%, 30\%, and 50\%, a positive result which supports the decision for UWWR in Stellenbosch as a water augmentation option.},

  abstract     = {Systems are getting increasingly complex and challenging to design. For safety-critical systems, the integration between model-based systems engineering and model-based safety assessment to improve the choice of the system architecture since the early design stage becomes a necessity. One of the integration solutions is to generate fault trees (FTs), either static or dynamic, directly from the system description. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the generation of the dynamic fault trees (DFTs) of the systems that contain redundancies, which is widely used in safety-critical systems to enhance their reliability. The goal of this paper is, first, to propose a redundancy profile and, second, to automatically generate the DFTs from system models. Since errors are propagated via input and output ports of the components, the generation process starts with a depth-first search graph traversal through the systems modeling language internal block diagram of the system. This diagram is considered as a multidirected graph in order to detect the external inputs, the nonredundant components, the switch components, and the redundant components of the system. Then, the redundancy information incorporated in the system model is used to generate the appropriate combinations of the FT. This FT is represented in a suitable format that can be studied using FT analysis tools, for both qualitative and quantitative safety analyses.},

This paper studied sortie scheduling for carrier aircrafts from the perspective of the whole scheduling and dispatch process. According to the process of sortie on flight deck, the sortie task was abstracted into six virtual stages, namely, deck-disposed, taxiing to preparing spot, taxiing from preparing spot to catapult, preparation on the catapult, takeoff, and cooling and recovery for the jet blast deflectors, and, the corresponding machines were also defined, respectively. The constraints were expressed, and the sortie scheduling model was build based on hybrid flexible flowshop scheduling. In addition, the one-sided symplectic pseudospectral method and the proposed collision avoidance strategy based on priority principle were combined to realize the collaborative trajectories planning of taxiing for multiple aircrafts. To obtain the optimal or near optimal solution, the double-layer genetic algorithm was proposed. Finally, the experiments were carried out based on the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier; the sortie task of 8 aircrafts under unknown conditions of deck-disposed and 13 aircrafts with fixed deck-disposed were studied, respectively. Experimental results show that the established model can well describe the sortie of aircraft, and it meets all constraints and actual requirements, which shows that the proposed method and the model can be used for sortie task effectively.},

The primary goal of this article is to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The performance was evaluated in Monte Carlo runs in a target tracking scenario. A mission with multimissile trying to intercept a single flying threat is assumed in this scenario. The interceptors are using nonhomogeneous sensors to measure the location of the threat continuously. Each missile computes its state prediction and shares it with its neighboring missile only. However, the shared information is applied to arbitrary nonuniform time delay. The entire group of missiles must reach a consensus on the target&#39;s location. The performance is evaluated in terms of overall estimation error, conflict resolution, and time to reach a consensus. Different scenarios are also simulated to examine the effectiveness of the number of missiles performing observation, the delay value, and sensor uncertainty in the overall system stability. Moreover, the tradeoffs of using the algorithm are identified.},

  abstract     = {To enhance the mission success rate, the multi-agent system (MAS) often adopts a formation form to shuttle over complex terrain. Compared with obstacle avoidance in other multi-agent coordinated missions, multi-agent formation (MAF) obstacle avoidance is more challenging because agents must both avoid obstacles and subsequently return to their intended positions in the original formation at a uniform speed. Aiming at the three-dimensional complex obstacle environment, the fluid methodology is extended to the application of the formation issue for the first time. In this paper, an MAF obstacle avoidance framework built upon model-based interfered fluid dynamical system (MIFDS), which is the most representative algorithm in fluid methodology, is proposed. The proposed MIFDS is modified to be more in accordance with the kinematic performance of agents than traditional IFDS by introducing the kinematic model and constraints. Moreover, on the basis of MIFDS and the virtual leader formation structure, a novel original fluid speed adjustment strategy in MIFDS, which is the core to solve the formation issue, is designed to balance obstacle avoidance and formation reconfiguration. Finally, receding horizon control is introduced to further guarantee the performance of obstacle avoidance and motion safety. Simulations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Cyber physical systems (CPSs) are characterized by behaviors emergent from the interactions of software systems with physical systems. Many complex CPSs utilize “independent monitoring” of the system behavior for any undesirable effects so that appropriate mitigation actions can potentially be taken. Typical independent monitoring systems for CPSs focus only on the violation of specified constraints that are detected “after-the-fact,” and any preemptive attempts to prevent the violation are handled by the core software systems. In this paper, we propose an independent health monitoring mechanism as a human-recognizable measure of trustworthiness of the system. Specifically, this mechanism not only detects actual violations of constraints but also calculates the possibility to violate the constraints. The proposed health monitor has two components: 1) health measurement functions that are specific and tailored to each component of a CPS and 2) a probabilistic health-state determination that is generic and directly derived from Bayesian estimation methods. The implementation and performance of the proposed monitoring mechanism were demonstrated with an autonomous vehicle self-navigating to a free parking space in MATLAB/Simulink simulations, which showed that the mechanism was able to promptly and accurately estimate the health state of the monitored system and help prevent accidents/catastrophes.},

The CFG contains the temporal-spatial characteristics of fault chains, which is able to facilitate the cascading failure analysis in network science and statistics perspectives. For characterizing the vulnerability of lines and transmission networks, indices based on the CFG are proposed, where the line vulnerability is presented as propagation vulnerability. The characteristics of the proposed CFG and the mechanisms of cascades are revealed based on the properties of multiorder topology. Through simulations based on standard test and real systems, the validity of the proposed CFG and indices are verified. The results show that the vulnerability distribution of lines is highly heterogeneous, and the vulnerability of lines appears assortative correlation, which indicates that successive failures between two lines with high vulnerability are easy to occur in high probability. The results also show two vulnerability characteristics of transmission networks, the constancy of the vulnerability correlation and the vulnerability mitigation. The proposed method greatly reduces the number of upgrades of lines and can effectively prevent cascading failures.},

  abstract     = {Space modulation techniques (SMTs) are multiple-input multiple-output based communication systems that recently gained definitions for a family of hardware implementations. As such, several new components, such as radio frequency (RF) switches, combiners, and splitters, are needed to efficiently implement variant SMT transmitters. Besides, existing techniques for channel estimation and frame synchronization need to be redesigned considering the specific nature of SMT operation. In order to make these implementations realizable, various studies need to be conducted to analyze system performance and potential hardware effects. Modeling SMTs using simulation can provide an appropriate medium to achieve that exactly. Moreover, modeling hardware using simulations has been proven already in the past, to reduce development cycles and to minimize costly mistakes. In this paper, a baseband modeling framework for a family of eight SMT transmitter hardware system models is defined and explained. The models are based on Simulink and leverage the RF Blockset toolbox. The bit error performance of the models is also verified against analytical bounds.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of technology as a fundamental centerpiece in everyday life has allowed for more connections and human groups than ever before. Each of these groups faces decisions that impact all members, ranging from the type of food to order for an event to relocating a company&#39;s headquarters. Traditionally, groups might make a decision by asking members to vote or by having a committee make an executive decision. However, these traditional means do not handle situations with many possible solutions well, nor leverage the experience of the group members. Humans are not the only, nor even the first creatures to make group decisions. We can look to social insects which make decisions for colonies of up to tens of thousands of individuals. Drawing inspiration from how honey bees, (Apis mellifera), find new nest sites, the bee-inspired evaluation (BIE) algorithm was developed. This mechanism was modeled and shown that simulated groups make decisions that average within 0.2\% of the optimal choice. Simulated groups consistently made less error-prone decisions using the BIE algorithm when compared to a simple majority voting system.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a path-based modeling framework for the distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) problem. The framework maps the decision variables-on/off status indicators for the paths-into linear expressions for the network flows and reliability indices. These linear expressions are suitably deployed for DFR optimization, where reliability can feature either as an objective or as a constraint. Additionally, the usual objective of loss minimization can also be incorporated, leading to a multi-objective DFR optimization framework. In its most general form, the proposed framework is a mixed-integer quadratic programming formulation, and can be solved using existing solvers. The paper makes three other important contributions: first, a probabilistic approach is adopted to validate the approximation of load point failure rates as the sum of failure rates of upstream components; second, a graph algorithm is proposed for identifying topologies with best reliability; and third, simulation studies with representative loading patterns are used to identify the appropriate choice of loading conditions for optimizing overall active power losses. Application of the proposed framework to standard test systems demonstrates its ability to optimize network losses or reliability or both. Numerical results also show the effect of topology and loading conditions on the performance of optimized topologies.},

First, the intermittent behavior of renewable sources (solar irradiance, wind speed) and load demands is modeled through scenario-tree technique. Then, a network frame is recast using mixed-integer linear programming, which is solvable using efficient off-the-shelf branch-and cut solvers. Additionaly, this article explores the impact of wind and solar power penetration on the active and reactive distribution locational prices within the distribution market environment with integration of ANM schemes and DR.

An important aspect of intelligent energy monitoring system is load disaggregation. The proliferation of direct current (dc) loads has spurred the increasing research interest in extra low voltage (ELV) dc grids. Artificial intelligence, such as deep learning algorithms of stacked recurrent neural network (RNN), improved results on a variety of regression and classification tasks. This paper proposes a 1-D convolutional stacked long short-term memory RNN technique for the bottom-up approach in load disaggregation using single sensor multiple loads ELV dc picogrids. This eliminates the requirement for communication and intelligence on every load in the grid. The proposed technique was applied on two different dc picogrids to test the algorithm&#39;s robustness. The proposed technique produced excellent result of over 98\% accuracy for smart loads and over 99\% accuracy for dumb loads in ELV dc picogrid.},

Safety in such environments is challenging and extremely important due to the high complexity of the working space, the radioactivity, and the stress that people experience. The safety system we propose consists of three sub-systems: a data acquisition (DAQ) system, a control system (CS), and a remote monitoring system (MS). The DAQ system acquires data wirelessly from various environmental and biological sensors installed in the outfit of the user. The CS controls and creates alerts to warn the user in case of emergency. The MS is developed to remotely supervise the health status of the personnel and provide real-time guidance during the performance of complex activities inside the ATLAS cavern. Radiation background monitoring is also achieved through the MS via the communication of the DAQ system with a gamma camera placed in the cavern. This system is developed to supervise multiple interventions and communicate with numerous users in real time, and it is adaptable to various extreme environmental conditions.},

A system dynamic (SD) model is applied to predict the physical fate and properties of spilled oil in this paper, since oil weathering processes affect each other after spillage. The major oil weathering processes, spreading, evaporation, dispersion, emulsification, dissolution, biodegradation, and oil properties, dynamic viscosity, dynamic density, and oil-water interfacial tension, are included in the SD model and simulated later.

The US auto insurance industry was chosen as a major industry that will be impacted by autonomous vehicles&#39; impacts and consequences. Consumer choices, product familiarity, and acceptance are modeled to represent purchasing behavior. Vehicle crash rate and loss ratio are considered to calculate the insurance industry&#39;s premium collections. Different scenarios are quantified and discussed.

Critical activities are those that lead to greater rework, involve close coordination or interdependence between development units, or produce task volatility. For example, the product development processes of the Ford Motor Company have several activities that are sensitive to information variability which can lead to higher task volatility or higher probability of rework. It is important to identify such activities early to ensure that the requirements for these activities are met and risk mitigation efforts can be planned. Analysis of the results from a variety of process architectures across a range of systems engineering domains shows that the proposed algorithm is more effective in identifying these critical activities than existing network ranking algorithms.},

In such applications, the integration of individual maps generated by heterogeneous sensors is a critical problem, especially the fusion of sparse and dense maps. This paper proposes a general multi-level probabilistic framework to address the integrated map fusion problem, which is independent of sensor type and SLAM algorithm employed. The key novelty of this paper is the mathematical formulation of the overall map fusion problem and the derivation of its probabilistic decomposition. The framework provides a theoretical basis for computing the relative transformations amongst robots and merging probabilistic map information. Since the maps generated by heterogeneous sensors have different physical properties, an expectation-maximization-based map-matching algorithm is proposed which automatically determines the number of voxels to be associated. Then, a time-sequential map merging strategy is developed to generate a globally consistent map. The proposed approach is evaluated in various environments with heterogeneous sensors, which demonstrates its accuracy and versatility in 3-D multirobot map fusion missions.},

  abstract     = {Cosimulation is an important system-level verification approach aimed at integrating multidomain and multi-physics models during complex system development. Currently, the lack of integrating system development process with cosimulations leads to gaps between them, decreasing the effectiveness and efficiency of system development. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) tool-chains have been proposed to facilitate the integration of complex system development and automated verification using a model-based approach. However, due to the lack of formal and structured specifications, development information sharing is difficult for supporting MBSE facilitating automated cosimulations. In order to formalize cosimulation in an MBSE tool-chain, a scenario-based ontology is developed in this paper, using formal web ontology language (OWL). Ontology refers to a specification expressing the cosimulation implementations as well as the development information represented in the models supporting the MBSE. It is illustrated by a case study of a cosimulation based on Simulink. Protocol and resource description framework (RDF) query language (SPARQL) and semantic query-enhanced web rule language queries are proposed for evaluating the ontology&#39;s completeness and logic for supporting cosimulations. The result demonstrates that the scenario-based ontology formalizes the information related to automated cosimulation development and configurations while using the proposed MBSE tool-chain.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, inexpensive memory has resulted in large router buffers installed in the Internet, leading to high queueing delay and delay variation. This phenomenon is recently termed “bufferbloat.” Active queue management (AQM) algorithms play an important role in combating bufferbloat, but none of them has been widely deployed due to complicated parameter tuning. Moreover, the parameters of AQM algorithms are usually fixed, making them difficult to adapt to changing network environments. In this paper, we propose a framework to adaptively and stably control queueing delay based on network conditions, so as to combat bufferbloat. Specifically, we use controlled delay (CoDel), a recently proposed AQM, in our framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that develops an analytical model for the CoDel system and derives necessary and sufficient conditions for its stability. Based on the stability analysis, we propose adaptive CoDel with interval tuning (ACoDel-IT) and adaptive CoDel with target and interval tuning (ACoDel-TIT) algorithms, to improve the system stability and performance by automatic parameter tuning. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that ACoDel-IT and ACoDel-TIT effectively stabilize queueing delay, whereas ACoDel-TIT further improves link utilization and reduces packet drops, compared to other representative AQM algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Understanding earthquakes and volcano eruptions phenomena require the analysis of large amounts of subsurface data. Currently, data collected from these events need post-processing in an off-line mode due to hardware limitations and strong bandwidth constraints. Furthermore, analytics may take days, even weeks, in being processed after collection. In some cases, underground structures require previous studies and subsurface knowledge from experts to establish certain input parameters. By leveraging current IoT technologies, we introduce an autonomous seismic imaging system (ASIS), a real-time system for monitoring and generating analytics of seismic data based on a sensor network. ASIS processes real-time analytics near where the events are generated (fog computing) to mitigate bandwidth limitations. Calculations for earthquake detection, location, and magnitude are processed in situ. ASIS allows monitoring sensor status, visualizing the data of each sensor, and generating two dimensional/three dimensional (2-D/3-D) subsurface structures. The system is able to learn the underground structure by taking advantage of ambient noise data analysis, which significantly reduces the need of initial parameters. We incorporated a renewable energy source to extend sensor functionality, and we made the system self-healing and fault-tolerant. Indoor and outdoor evaluation of the system showed the error of earthquake detection is 13.7 ms and the spatial location accuracy is 5.1 ft.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this paper is to create and test an integrative framework for performance analysis of disaster management system-of-systems (DM-SoS). Effective disaster management systems and processes are critical for saving lives and protecting properties. However, the lack of integration between heterogeneous systems and entities involved in disaster management impacts coordination and operational efficiency. Greater integration and coordination among multiple heterogeneous entities is essential in improving performance and achieving network-centric disaster management. To address this gap, this paper, first examines the dimensions of analysis and a framework for a system-of-systems assessment of disaster management. In the proposed framework, the main entities include stakeholders, operations, resources, information, and infrastructure. Second, a metanetwork framework was employed to capture the network interactions among various types of entities. Then, measures of network efficiency (e.g., operational and coordination efficiency) were used to identify critical entities and evaluate the effectiveness of system integration strategies. The application of the proposed framework was shown in a case study of disaster management processes in the 2017 Hurricane Harvey. The findings highlight the importance of the SoS approach for evaluating the performance of disaster management processes under different disaster-induced perturbations (e.g., resources limitation, infrastructure disruptions, and lack of information). The findings also identify ways to improve system integration and coordination among various heterogeneous entities interacting in networks.},

  abstract     = {Systems engineering traditionally approaches the design of systems through determination of requirements for and implementation of a system. The system is conceived as something to enable achievement of an effect with the tacit assumption that the system to be designed must achieve technical performance, including availability characteristics, which enable delivery of the whole of the intended effect. This approach determines the technical requirements of the system to ensure achievement of the system purpose under assumptions about how the system, or fleet, would be deployed to provide the intended service. Usually, cost is addressed after requirements, either to find the cheapest method to achieve the requirements or as one dimension of a trade-space analysis. In this paper, we explore a different philosophy for finding the system requirements; starting with the required system level service provision, but agnostic about the technical quality needed. We investigate a trade-space including the life cycle cost (LCC) of service provision as a contribution to determining subsystem requirements. We model the life cycle, for many variations of technical composition, using a Monte Carlo method, and show that a trade-space of LCC and requirements is likely to produce a cheaper solution than starting with sub-system requirements.},

This paper proposes a loosely coupled cloud robotic framework based on web service composition, which can organize multiple resources including robot nodes and cloud nodes to exchange messages through the abstract interface and fulfill complex robotic applications. Furthermore, the resource-deployment method is designed for the proposed framework to organize resources, so that the user overall quality of service requirements can be satisfied. Besides, we propose the concept of “user sensitivity” and cloud-priority strategy. Finally, we propose novel algorithms called GICA-CP and GICA motivated by imperialist competition for the resource-deployment method under the proposed framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively allocate resources and enhance the cloud resource ratio in cloud robotic workflows.

This paper presents a new fast-forward, cost-effective, and thorough enough framework to quantify resilience of a complex socio-technical system. The approach extends the functional resonance analysis method (FRAM) with a numerical method for the quantification of the analysis (Q-FRAM). In particular, it has been extended and operationalized the qualitative concepts of functional variability and dumping capacities into a method in which key performance indicators are derived from the model and aggregated into four indicators representing the FRAM resilience cornerstones (anticipate, respond, monitor, learn) through a bottom-up hierarchical approach. Finally, the four indicators are composed in a unique system resilience index that expresses the total variability present in the system at instant t. A numerical example of the use of the framework is provided together with a validation based on a comparison of the proposed approach with the current landscape.},

CBM represents the interarea tie-lines capacity reserved in order to have access to external generation in an event of power supply shortage. This paper proposes a new technique for CBM evaluation using graph theory concepts. The proposed technique can be used as an effective tool to solve the CBM problem for large multiarea power systems which are not fully connected and may have multiple deficient areas, unlike previous approaches which considered only fully connected areas with only one deficient area.

The inverter control strategy is implemented by a space vector modulation hysteresis current controller to get quality inverter current by tracking accurate reference sine-shaped current. The ANFIS-PSO-based MPPT method has no extra sensor requirement for measurement of irradiance and temperature variables. The employed methodology delivers remarkable driving control to enhance PV potential extraction. An ANFIS-PSO-controlled Zeta converter is also modeled as an impedance matching interface with zero output harmonic agreement and kept between PV modules and load regulator power circuit to perform MPPT action. The attainment of recommended hybrid ANFIS-PSO design is equated with perturb and observe, PSO, ant colony optimization, and artificial bee colony MPPT methods for the PV system.

  abstract     = {Grid frequency support is one of the most challenging problems, since minor variations in it may lead to huge financial losses. This problem becomes even more challenging with the horizontal and vertical expansion of modern cloud data centers (DCs). In the past, several efforts have been made to manage frequency deviations using flywheels, commercial buildings, electric vehicles, and renewable energy resources. However, these are not adequate due to their complex operations. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we propose the usage of cloud DCs and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units for the effective frequency regulation. This is achieved by designing a 2-layer hierarchical control scheme for optimal segregation of the regulation signals amongst the DCs and UPS batteries. The proposed scheme determines the scheduling policy for jobs at DCs; along with the charging and discharging cycles of the UPS batteries. The job scheduling is carried out with respect to MapReduce tasks in accordance with the regulation signals with minimal service level adherence violations. Additionally, the sustainability of DCs is also supported through active participation of UPSes during peak hours. The overall frequency support problem in the considered setup involves multiple objectives under multiconstraint environment. Thus, it has been divided in two subproblems, which are addressed individually using either integer linear programming or mixed integer linear programming. In a nutshell, the proposed scheme serves dual purposes, i.e., manages frequency fluctuations and sustains DCs during peak hours. It has been validated using data traces taken from OpenCloud Hadoop cluster and Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland. The results obtained prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for frequency support and DC&#39;s sustainability.},

  abstract     = {The reliable supply of electricity plays a key role in the contemporary way of life. In order to provide more benefits to the population, electric networks are getting bigger to produce more energy. This growth, while necessary, brings problems in operation and maintenance, since the networks are more complex. This complexity requires that network security analysis should be performed in real time to avoid decision errors when disconnecting a device from the network or predicting the possibility of operating output from an undersized device. In this article, an intelligent system for contingency selection in the static security analysis of electric power systems is proposed. The severity of contingencies indication is the first step to develop control actions and maintain the system operation integrity. We propose and evaluate the contingency selection as a combinatorial optimization problem, employing an ACO metaheuristic to model the situation. The system is evaluated over the IEEE 30-bus network and a real 810-bus network, considering double outages of branches. Results show an accuracy close to five-nines for severing contingencies.},

In this manner, the metaheuristic and the deterministic parts share their advantages so that their combination leads to a significant tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. In addition, different objective functions for each part are introduced. For various conditions, the proposed method is applied to the eight-bus transmission and 33-kV distribution part of the 30-bus IEEE power system. Next, the superiority of the proposed algorithm over other researches is verified by the observation that the results are in the range of dual setting schemes.},

  abstract     = {The presence of phasor measurements in ac systems provides a range of protection techniques based on sequence components and phase comparison to discriminate the fault. However, the absence of phasor measurements in dc system reduces the available alternatives for fault detection. In addition, the presence of low fault tolerant converters, large range of fault impedance and varying grid conditions demands sensitive and selective protection schemes. In this regard, several recent works have suggested a communication-based primary protection due to its high sensitivity to faults. However, with a failure in the communication network, the primary protection will also fail to detect a fault. This paper proposes a backup scheme to isolate the faulty section, even in the case of a communication failure. In the literature, overcurrent- and undervoltage-based backup protection schemes are suggested along with unit primary protection. In the presence of low fault tolerant converters and variable fault resistances, the traditional backup schemes may not work well. This paper proposes a new fault detection method for backup schemes, which utilizes only the locally measured current signal, and uses both derivative and integral characteristics of current to ascertain the occurrence of a fault. The proposed method is capable of detecting the fault accurately and within the required time. The performance of the proposed scheme has been assessed on a ± 600 V TN-S grounded dc microgrid under various conditions using hardware-in-loop simulations on real-time digital simulator.},

Demand response management plays a key role in achieving the objective of balancing electricity supply and demand efficiently. It also helps leveling consumption during peak hours. To do so, this paper proposes a game theoretic model for the multiperiodic smart grid demand side management problem with shifted demand. The proposed model has two major sets of players: Homeowners and electricity providers. We develop a 0-1 mixed linear programming approach to compute the Nash equilibria of the proposed game. We analyze the structure of the Nash equilibria to maintain the viability of the smart grid infrastructure. We also discuss the order relations between the users and the providers utility coefficients. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on smart grid demand response synthetic data with different size. The obtained results demonstrate the scalability of the proposed game model.},

Simultaneous with this increase in renewables with energy storage, the incidence of disturbance events such as extreme weather that cause significant faults and failures on the power grid is also expected to increase. This research optimizes the architecture of energy storage systems on the electrical power grid for resilience to faults caused by extreme disturbance events under a high penetration scenario for rooftop photovoltaic generation. A grid fault model was applied to simulated generation and demand data to determine the application of storage on the grid that maximizes grid resilience to faults. Failures were simulated at multiple locations on the grid model and combinations of storage architectures were applied to determine the application strategy of energy storage that maximized the resilience of the grid.},

In this trend, security constrained economic dispatch as well as operating reserve in both normal and N - 1 contingency condition are considered. To address the computational complexity associated with the SCRM problem, the distributed-SCRM (D-SCRM) is proposed. In the suggested method, the power system is decomposed to several subsystems called zone. These zones are interconnected via some tie-lines. By defining two virtual generation units at the middle of each tie-line, all neighbor zones become isolated. This causes the main SCRM problem to be converted to some subproblems. To solve these subproblems, some initial values are first dedicated to the virtual generation units. Next, the independent SCRM subproblems are solved simultaneously using the genetic algorithm (GA). The objective function is then calculated for the main problem and the virtual values are updated using the GA again. This process continues until the global optimum is obtained. IEEE 24-bus, 39-bus, and 118-bus test systems are considered to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Results confirm the effectiveness of proposed algorithm.},

To consider uncertainties, the nonlinear uncertain model of the BILPC is derived and linearized based on Lie derivative concept. As a new point of view for dynamic modeling of BILPC, it is indicated that each nonlinear uncertain BILPC model can be represented by two decoupled subsystems. Then, a virtual robust state feedback controller is designed to independently control each of these subsystems with disturbance rejection capability. The gains of the state feedback controllers are obtained using Ackerman pole placement method. To approximate the unknown inputs/unmodeled dynamics, which are needed in the design process of the state feedback controllers, a high-gain proportional-integral (PI) observer is designed. The high gains of this PI observer are determined using linear quadratic regulation method. Simulation results and comparative studies support the efficacy of the proposed control approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a nonlinear control strategy for the suppression of large voltage-current transients in a dc microgrid (dc-MG) with a high penetration of constant power loads (CPLs). The voltages and currents in a dc-MG experience significant transients during large changes in the CPLs with their nonlinear voltage-current characteristics. Herein, an auxiliary nonlinear stabilizer is designed for a super-capacitor (SC) module for actively stabilizing a dc-MG. Due to the limitations in the energy of the SC module; a fuel cell (FC) stack is paralleled with the SC module in the form of a hybrid SC/FC unit to provide the steady-state power demand of dc-MG. The proposed controller is designed using Lyapunov theory and is robust with respect to the output current transients imposed on power converters from the rest of the dc-MG. In the presented control strategy, only one-generation unit is designed and implemented in the form of a hybrid SC/FC unit to suppress the large transients. The proposed stabilizer in the SC module operates based on local information. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy has been validated in a multisource dc-MG using time domain simulations carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software environment.},

Within this framework, the power exchanges between the microgrids are regulated through a contribution-based scheme, through which the microgrids are prioritized based on their previous contributions to the coalition and their current power demands. The approach thereby provides an effective incentivizing mechanism for the microgrids in the form of priority, for their continued active participation in the coalition. Several case studies and comparative evaluations are shown to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

On the other hand, each ESS has distinct characteristics that make them suitable for specific applications in the MG. The suitable cooperation among them can ensure reliable operation of the MG. Moreover, it affects the operation of ESSs and their lifetime. In this paper, cooperation between two types of ESSs (flywheel and battery) is studied. The flywheel ESS, which has high power density, is used during MG transient responses, and the battery ESS responds to long-term load changes. A new control method, based on droop equations, is proposed for each ESS unit. Then, the genetic algorithm is used to obtain the optimal controller coefficients. The simulation results show suitable cooperation between ESS units and stable operation of the MG.

Current detection solutions are either too sensitive to load variations causing false positives or are too slow to detect faults before the equipment is damaged. This paper proposes a framework and case examples for fault detection based on features derived from the wavelet transform of the grid current. The algorithm is intended to control new high-speed dc breakers (such as assembly HVdc breaker) for improved fault protection. This paper customizes the detection strategy to specific fault frequencies using multiresolution analysis, whose magnitudes are significant in the vicinity of the fault, and are attenuated at remote grid terminals. A model of a three-terminal MT-HVdc system is developed in power systems computer aided design/electromagnetic transients including dc. The results have been post processed in matrix laboratory and simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution for preventing dc faults on an HVdc system.},

  abstract     = {This paper discusses the effect of nonlinear loads of some equipment on the islanded microgrids. The nonlinear load with active and reactive power is considered, which highly threatens the stability of the microgrids. Moreover, a wind turbine, which is a nondispatchable distributed generation (DG), is included as a power fluctuation source in the microgrid. The maximum power point tracking is integrated to ensure that the wind turbine generator operates at its maximum power level. In order to enable efficient power sharing among DG units, active power-frequency droop control is adopted for a microgrid with three DG units. In particular, a single input interval type-2 fuzzy integral (SI-IT2-FI) controller is implemented for the self-frequency recovery control of the microgrid to restore the frequency deviation within the desired range from its nominal value. In this way, by varying an adjustable design parameter which shapes the footprint of uncertainty, the SI-IT2-FI controller with different control surfaces generation is developed. In order to ascertain the efficiency of the SI-IT2-FI controller, the output responses in the absence and presence of wind turbine are compared with the P-f droop control. Total harmonic distortion is adopted as the harmonic metric to investigate the impact of the nonlinear loads at the test microgrid. Finally, in order to ascertain the feasibility and applicability of the proposed technique, a software-in-the-loop real-time simulation using dSPACE 1202 board is carried out. The simulation outcomes of the islanded microgrid confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {The building integrated photovoltaic (PV) central inverter architecture comprises various PV module configurations. The PV module configurations are vulnerable to shading effects and cause mismatching power losses. To reduce the detrimental impact of shading and mismatching on energy production, the PV distributed-maximum power point tracking (D-MPPT) architecture has been proposed. In this architecture, an individual dc-dc converter with an MPPT controller is integrated to each PV module for extracting the maximum power. This topology is referred to as module-integrated-converter (M-I-C). In the conventional PV D-MPPT architecture, the output terminals of M-I-Cs are connected either in series or parallel configuration only. The conventional configurations of M-I-Cs have the drawbacks of cross-coupling effects, lower conversion efficiency, two-stage voltage conversion, etc. This paper proposes the total-cross-tied (T-C-T) configuration of string-integrated-converters (S-I-Cs) to overcome the drawbacks of M-I-C configurations. The detailed mathematical analysis of the proposed T-C-T configuration of S-I-Cs is also presented in this paper. The perturb and observe MPPT technique is used for extracting the maximum power. The performance of the proposed T-C-T configuration of S-I-Cs is analyzed under various partial shading conditions and also compared with the PV central inverter architecture as well as with conventional M-I-C configurations.},

  abstract     = {The growing penetration of renewable energy sources in electricity generation will bring challenges to the power grid operations due to the intermittency and fluctuation of renewables. In this article, we employ an energy storage system (ESS) in a grid-connected renewable energy system (RES) to serve the electrical load from the power grid. We study the control algorithms of the ESS to smooth the renewable generation and analyze the tradeoff between the ESS size and the system performance, i.e., renewable utilization and operation cost. We provide performance guarantees of the proposed algorithms and propose an optimization framework to configure the ESS. To analyze the reliability of the RES, an analytical framework using the Markov modulated fluid queue is devised. It is shown in our simulation studies that the devised power output smoothing algorithm outperforms other existing algorithms in terms of operation cost under different sizes of ESSs. We also find that, to satisfy the renewable utilization requirement, the required ESS size blows up with both the amplitude of fluctuation and the intermittency level of the profile gap between the renewable generation and the load.},

For faster power sharing, high droop gains are required, but increasing the droop gains degrades the system stability. Hence, there is a tradeoff between the faster load sharing and system stability. An answer to the given problem is presented in this paper by developing a PSS for inverter-based microgrid. The proposed stabilizer provides sufficient damping to the low-frequency oscillation even at higher value of droop gains which are usually unstable otherwise. The PSS designed in this paper is a generalized one and a step-by-step method to select the PSS parameters is also presented.

  abstract     = {Coupling dc microgrids in close vicinity can minimize the total operating cost by full utilization of the generated power of the power systems. A fully distributed, consensus-based, and resilient hierarchical control scheme is proposed in this article to optimize the total generation cost of multiple dc microgrids by equalizing incremental costs of all distributed generators (DGs). The proposed scheme uses a sparse communication network in a fully distributed manner, which operates based on the neighbor-to-neighbor output feedback without requiring a central controller. In the proposed control scheme, optimal power sharing among DGs within a dc microgrid is met via the secondary controller. Additionally, the elimination of voltage deviation is accomplished in the secondary level without any influence on the optimal power sharing. The tertiary controller is responsible to realize optimal power sharing among dc microgrids. Simulation results illustrate the capability of the proposed strategy in equalizing incremental costs, not only among all DGs within a dc microgrid, but also among all dc microgrids. The performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated by simulating multiple dc microgrids considering intermittent renewable DGs in PLECS software environment.},

Communication assisted grid synchronization methods employing optimal current control strategy need to be applied to attain both voltage and frequency stabilities after the interconnection. The objective is to simulate, analyze, and compare communication assisted current control techniques namely natural reference frame control and proportional reference frame control techniques in three-phase grid connected converters. The best control strategy is selected to achieve secure and smooth synchronization of the microgrid. The conventional control techniques have been modified to achieve load compensation, power quality, and stability. Two microsources are synchronized to the ac distribution system, wherein the phase template of the grid is passed through the reliable, fast, and fault tolerant controller area network. The performance of the two schemes is compared based on the power quality standards, stability, computational burden, and implementation difficulties.

In order to achieve the optimal solution, a modified binary gray wolf optimization (MBGWO) algorithm has been proposed.

Furthermore, the proposed method has been employed for service restoration considering voltage regulation and peak demand reduction under faulty condition. For validation, the performance of the proposed algorithm has been tested on balanced as well as unbalanced distribution systems. The test results demonstrate the significance of the DNR associated with VVC devices and PVSI for energy savings under different load models.

The integrated multistatic radar and communication system is capable of fulfilling the requirements of both radar and communication subsystems. The key tenet of the integrated system is to minimize the total power consumption by optimizing the transmit power allocation at each transmitter for radar waveforms and information signals, which is constrained by a predetermined target detection performance for the RR and a desired information rate for the CR. Since the analytical closed-form expression of the probability of detection is not tractable, its upper bound is derived. We analytically show that the resulting optimization problem can be reformulated as two subproblems, which can be solved by an efficient solution procedure based on the approach of linear programming and the Karush-Kuhn-Tuckers optimality conditions. Simulation results are provided to show that the LPI performance of the integrated multistatic radar and communication system can significantly be enhanced by employing our proposed LPI-OPA scheme.},

This filter reduces the number of required sensors from six sensors to only two sensors. Moreover, it reduces the noise effect on the estimated parameters. The paper also develops and utilizes an advanced exponential sliding mode control (SMC) to improve the dynamic and steady-state performance of the control scheme. The DPC scheme is utilized to control the injected power of the distributed generation system to the power grid (distribution system) in a grid-connected mode. The presented concept of the direct power scheme is modified to cover the injected power to the unbalanced power grid as well. In this case, the NS current is estimated and its detrimental impact on the injected power is well mitigated. To prove the meritorious performance of this presented control scheme, the utilized filter is compared to Kalman filter, and virtual-flux technique for power estimation. Moreover, the developed exponential SMC is also compared to the adaptive SMC, power-rate SMC, and proportional-integral controllers. The overall performance of the suggested control scheme along with the presented recursive filter is verified using simulation results for the entire power grid in a grid-connected mode. The applications presented in this paper highlight the advantage of using the newly developed filter, SVSF, to accurately estimate some parameters in power systems and consequently reduce the number of required sensors (measuring devices).},

The second-level control holds the voltage stability in emergency conditions. The control rules in this level are intended to restore the system voltages as soon as possible, minimize the total number of costly control actions, and prevent conflicts between different controllable devices. In the second-level voltage control, the solution speed is of utmost importance.

FSs are responsible for disconnecting unfaulted islands from faulty network to reduce energy not supplied (ENS). Directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) are employed to send trip signals to FSs. In most of the DGs optimal allocation studies, the switches are assumed to operate correctly. This assumption might not be correct due to the delayed operation of the DOCRs. Few studies offer restricting minimum allowable size of DGs or allowable location of DOCRs to guarantee correct operation of DOCRs. These additional constraints limit the search space which causes nonoptimal answers. Here, the impact of actual operation of DOCRs is considered directly in calculation of ENS and hence in the final objective function. Also, a modified formulation for ENS in order to include cases where DGs capacity is not sufficient for supplying island loads is developed. Simultaneous allocation of DGs, FSs, and DOCRs to minimize cost of energy losses, ENS, and environmental costs are proposed. A multistate model that combines all possible operating conditions of DGs and load levels is utilized. Different cases are simulated in 33-bus, 69-bus, and 118-bus systems to evaluate the proposed method.},

Following the IEEE Standard 1547.4-2011, the operation and control of large distribution networks can be enhanced by dividing these networks into multiple virtual microgrids. The proposed planning framework incorporates the necessary conditions for microgrids to operate efficiently in grid-connected operating mode and successfully during islanding. To obtain a robust design, the clustering process considers three objectives: maximizing the self-adequacy of the designed microgrids, maximizing microgrid islanding success probability, and a combination of both targets. For this purpose, the PG&amp;E distribution system with 69 buses is selected as a test case. Backtracking search optimization algorithm, a probabilistic load flow approach, and graph-based theories are used to accomplish this research. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the self-adequacy and the islanding success probability objectives in the clustering process. Compared with other strategies present in the previous literature, the proposed framework results in more self-sufficient and successful islands assessed in terms of active and reactive power adequacy as well as voltage constraints. Next, the effects of increased penetration level of DGs and installation of both distributed energy-storage units and distributed reactive sources on the design process are examined. Finally, a comparison with other microgrid design objectives applied in previous researches reveals that the resultant design is sensitive to the system&#39;s reliability, security, and economic requirements.},

The power circuit employs a PV module-driven MLI, connected to the load/grid through a three-phase transformer having open winding on the MLI side. The control scheme is developed to supply real power even with the variable load and solar irradiance levels. The proposed control can ensure real power stable across the dc-link capacitors of the inverters, as well as satisfy the transient performance indexes of the PV stand-alone system. The dc-link voltage level of the MLI is well maintained throughout the operation to achieve desired power for delivery point by the designed scheme. The control scheme performance is established to be adequate in the simulation environment under different operating conditions.

Real-time results have been validated on a laboratory MLI PV-stand-alone system.

  abstract     = {In order to protect the privacy of individual data, meantime guaranteeing the utility of big data, the privacy preserving data aggregation is widely researched, which is a feasible solution since it not only preserves the statistical feature of the original data, but also masks single user&#39;s data. With smart meter owning the capability of connecting to Internet, the aggregation area extends to the virtual area rather than a traditional physical area. However, in a virtual aggregation area, the users&#39; membership maybe frequently changes, if while executing the aggregation protocol for the traditional area, the overhead is not ignorable. In this paper, the homomorphic encryption and ID-based signature are employed to design a dynamic membership data aggregation (DMDA) scheme, which reduces the complexity on a new user&#39;s joining and an old user&#39;s quitting. In addition, the operation center obtains the sum of the data in the virtual aggregation area, meantime knows nothing about single user&#39;s data. Comparing with traditional privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme, DMDA is more suitable for next-generation smart grid and other Internet of Things environments.},

  abstract     = {Increasing penetration of photovoltaic can cause high voltage variation that needs to be mitigated; this has been the focus of recent studies for many volt-ampere reactive (VAR) control strategies. Though voltage-variation mitigation is very important, it is also important to minimize power loss throughout the distribution when voltage variation is no longer an issue. Therefore, a complete adaptive sequential strategy for VAR control in distribution networks with solar energy is developed in this paper. In this adaptive sequential scheme, a two-way switch is designed to work with two operational modes: 1) voltage-variation minimization mode (V_Mode) aimed to minimize voltage variations along the distribution network and 2) power-loss minimization mode (P_Mode) aimed to minimize power loss. According to the operator needs for different situations, this two-way switch can be used to satisfy either the V_Mode or P_Mode requirements in a control loop fashion. Simulations are conducted with defined parameters in a radial distribution network. By comparing with no control (or baseline) in simulation, we show that the two-way switch works well in balancing the user needs (requirement) for the purpose of minimizing voltage variation and power loss in order to gain higher energy savings over a specified time duration.},

In order to overcome some of the limitations observed in the standard variant of MSO, minor corrections are also suggested. On the other hand, a new optimization problem is formulated for optimal deployment of dispatchable distributed generations and shunt capacitors while simultaneously optimizing the tap positions of on-load tap-changing transformers, already deployed in grid substations. The objective of this work is to minimize the cost of annual energy loss and node voltage deviations over multiple load levels. The proposed model is implemented and solved for two benchmark test distribution networks of 33 and 118 buses. The suggested corrections are also validated by comparing the performance of the proposed approach with standard MSO and other available optimization methods. The simulation results show that the developed model optimally utilizes the existing distribution system resources and generates higher deployment benefits at lesser DER penetration as compared to the planning model which ignores these resources.},

  abstract     = {The high-impedance faults (HIF) occurring on distribution lines go undetected by the conventional relays due to their low current magnitude. In addition to low current, HIFs also exhibit typical characteristic features, such as randomness, nonlinearity, etc., which are similar to the characteristics of the switching events, such as harmonic load switching. The advent of distributed generators (DG) into the distribution system, changes the current contribution through the substation, which also affects the HIF detection. This paper presents an intelligent HIF detection technique for distribution lines incorporating the DGs. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) is used to extract the input patterns. The commonly used empirical mode decomposition has limitation of modal aliasing that is overcome by VMD. VMD decomposes the signal into different modes that are further converted to singular values so as to obtain the analytic signal. These are finally used as an input to an efficient classifier known as the support vector machine, to create an intelligent classifier. The proposed methodology is verified on a modified IEEE 13-bus feeder for various events considering the changes in DG parameters and also the noise levels.},

The proposed methodology uses two different probabilistic models of HFs to assess HFs&#39; impact on cascading events.

It is also observed that inclusion of self-monitoring and control features in digital relays significantly reduces the risk of wide-area blackouts.

A dynamic load model is integrated with the DistFlow equations to describe the transient behavior of the real/reactive power, voltage, and loads. Based on this model, the proposed controllers utilize PV inverters to optimize performances of the grid by absorbing/injecting the reactive power. These controllers are particularly efficient to handle unexpected abnormal power loads. For demonstrations, a bidirectional, single branch distribution circuit with extremely high power load is used to test and compare our controllers with existing approaches, including the volt-ampere reactive control scheme specified by the IEEE Standard 1547 and adaptive method. The results show that our controllers indeed reduce the power loss compared with other methods and keep the voltage within the desired range.},

Iterative approaches were employed to solve the problem, which may fail to provide a solution under certain circumstances such as bad initial point. In this paper, a solution methodology that is capable of providing a reliable solution to the power flow problem is presented. First, by exploiting sparsity in the power network, a convex relaxation for the problem is presented using the first order of the Lasserre hierarchy of moment relaxations. Then, a distributed approach using Jacobi-proximal alternating directions method of multipliers (JP-ADMM) is implemented to efficiently solve the power flow problem. To solve the sub-problems within JP-ADMM approach, the second order of the Lasserre hierarchy of moment relaxations is employed.

The mismatch in load and generation is estimated using the disturbance observer and is used as a supplement to the classical integral controller to vary the set points of various controlled DERs. Since the disturbance-observer-based approach is an algorithm based on local frequency measurement, it reduces the capital expenditure in implementing additional sensors. Further, in case of microgrids, the communication infrastructure is mostly built with public networks, which can introduce random delays. Therefore, the performance of the proposed scheme is also tested in the presence of random communication delays. A sensitivity analysis is also presented to show that the performance of the proposed control scheme is much better than the integral controller even when there are variations in the system parameters. Finally, the proposed approach is tested in a laboratory-scale microgrid setup in which the frequency of a synchronous generator is controlled using the disturbance-observer-based approach. The results obtained in the experimental setup show that the proposed approach can be easily implemented in a real system in order to achieve adequate frequency control.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an optimal robust state estimator using maximum likelihood optimization with the t-distribution noise model. In robust statistics literature, the t-distribution is used to model Gaussian and non-Gaussian statistics. The influence function, an analytical tool in robust statistics, is employed to obtain the solution to the resulting maximum likelihood estimation optimization problem, so that the proposed estimator can be implemented within the framework of traditional robust estimators. Numerical results obtained from simulations of the IEEE 14-bus system, IEEE 118-bus system, and experiment on a microgrid demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed estimator. The proposed estimator could suppress the influence of outliers with smaller average mean-squared errors (AMSE) than the traditional robust estimators, such as quadratic-linear, squareroot, Schweppe-Huber generalized-M, multiple-segment, and least absolute value estimators. A new approximate AMSE formula is also derived for the proposed estimator to predict and evaluate its precision.},

  abstract     = {The intermittent photovoltaic (PV) units significantly affect the performance of distribution systems, and they often cause several operational problems, most importantly, voltage rise/drop. At high PV penetration, excessive tap movements of transformers and high curtailed PV power are expected to completely solve the voltage violation problem. In this paper, we propose an optimal voltage control method for distribution systems considering the number of tap movements of transformers and the active power curtailment of PV units. The objective function of the proposed method comprises: 1) voltage drop violation, 2) voltage rise violation, 3) tap movement rate (TMR) of transformers, and 4) curtailed power of PV (CPPV). A multiobjective grey wolf optimizer integrated with a Lévy mutation operator (GWO-Lévy) is formulated to accurately solve the voltage control problem. A 24-h simulation is performed on the 119-bus distribution system with PV and different types of loads. The performance of GWO-Lévy is compared with three other optimizers, finding that it achieves the best performance. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for solving the voltage violation problem with PV while simultaneously optimizing TMR and CPPV.},

Differently from existing studies that focus on the impact of extreme weather on individual power plants, this article quantifies the resilience of thermal power generation to extreme temperatures and the different levels of water availability from a system-level perspective. This article starts by introducing the fundamental engineering models of thermal power plants&#39; cooling systems. A system-level quantification methodology is then proposed, which also introduces a multicoordinate resilience-oriented metric that assesses system vulnerability through the concepts of conditional value-at-risk and its rate of change in response to changes in the considered weather conditions. The numerical results obtained using a simplified version of the British transmission system not only demonstrate that the proposed framework is well suited to quantify the system-level resilience of the test system to extreme temperatures and different levels of water availability and scarcity but also highlight the benefits of using the newly defined resilience metric in such studies.},

  abstract     = {The electrification of transportation sector represents a promising approach to reduce transit-related greenhouse gas emissions. However, both transportation and power utility sectors retain various challenges in facilitating the seamless integration of battery electric bus (BEB) fleet systems. Among those challenges, the lack of appropriate simulation tools to model, design, and optimize BEB fleet systems is the most salient. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new mathematical formulation to model BEB fleet systems. The model considers the operational requirements of public bus transit systems and the energy consumption characteristics of BEBs. The proposed transit model is then integrated with the power distribution system model to develop an integrated utility-transit problem formulation for the optimal design of BEB systems. The formulated optimization problem aims at determining the optimal configuration parameters of BEB fleet systems that include the bus battery capacity, chargers rated power, and the total number of installed chargers in the charging station. The developed utility-transit model is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) and is solved using the Basic Open-Source Nonlinear Mixed INteger Programming (BONMIN) optimization solver. Real-world transit system data are used to validate the efficacy of the proposed integrated utility-transit model. The simulation results indicate that consideration of both power distribution and transit networks operation requirements significantly impact the choice of the BEBs configuration.},

  abstract     = {Conventionally, base stations of off-grid telecommunication (telecom) towers are powered by diesel generator, which results in high operating cost and carbon emission. Hence, the photovoltaic (PV) wind battery based hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) is proposed for off-grid telecom towers in rural areas. However, owing to high capital cost and intermittent nature of renewable energy resources, optimal sizing of HRES is inevitable to have economical and reliable power supply. An index named excess energy generation (EEG) is developed to reduce the surplus renewable energy, which cannot be sold to grid in off-grid towers. Therefore, three objective functions are formulated viz., loss of power-supply probability, cost of electricity, and EEG, which are incommensurate and contradictory in nature. Thus, a discrete multiobjective grey wolf optimization (DMGWO) algorithm is developed for the optimal sizing of HRES. DMGWO utilizes the concept of internal archive to store nondominated solutions and enables fast convergence rate without premature termination as a result of inherent leader selection mechanism. A practical approach is adopted in optimal sizing by considering wind capacity as discrete variable, which is handled by the corrective algorithm embedded in DMGWO. The intermittency in source and variability in telecom load is incorporated using probability distribution functions. The Euclidean distance approach is adopted to find the solution (configuration of PV panels, wind turbines, and battery) from the optimal Pareto front obtained from DMGWO. Also, sensitivity analysis is carried out to observe the effect of the design variables on the objective functions.},

Although considerable advances in power grid flexibility assessment have been made, modeling the effect of temporal correlations associated with wind generations on the system flexibility provision capability has remained a challenge. This paper proposes a novel UC-time-scale security-constrained affinely robust formulation for wind-originated uncertainty sets in order to evaluate the system flexibility capacity over time. An efficient model based on duality theorem and affine policy is proposed to assess a secure region in response to uncertain wind generation scenarios. A framework using a combination of column and constraint generation and alternative direction algorithms is then developed to solve the proposed optimization model. The impacts of the sequential nature of wind generation, a type of dynamic uncertainty set, on the worst cases of generating units&#39; time-coupled ramping constraints are effectively captured to investigate how they contribute to the optimal allowable uncertainty set. Furthermore, the relationship between dynamic uncertainty set boundaries and the imposed re-dispatch costs are numerically investigated. Numerical experiments on the modified IEEE 73-bus test system reveals the efficacy of the suggested model and the proposed solution technique.},

A solution introduced in many voltage control schemes is DG active power curtailment. However, this measure has a negative effect on both DG revenue and DG investment. This paper proposes the use of existing system resources to mitigate the voltage rise problem. Based on the big bang-big crunch optimization and the reactive power compensation method, the new technique controls the distribution system voltage profile while avoiding DG active power curtailment. The proposed method minimizes voltage deviations by determining the regulator taps and reactive power contributions of both the capacitors and the DGs. The approach is implemented online by a central control unit that optimally determines appropriate control decisions and then communicates them to the voltage regulators, capacitors, and DGs. Eliminating the voltage deviation problem associated with the network installation of DGs provides a cost-effective means of increasing DG penetration. The new algorithm was implemented and tested on the 33-bus test feeder. The results demonstrate the effective control of the voltage profile and fast convergence speed provided by the developed technique.},

The nominal power load data from California independent system operator is used to simulate dynamics of the system with DistFlow equations. Since power consumptions in fact may deviate from nominal values, an estimator is further developed to reconstruct the state variables and power loads from measurements. The integration of the MPC and estimator forms a closed-loop control framework and enables the system to quickly recover from undesired disturbances by effectively changing the real and reactive powers provided by PV cells. We use a bidirectional, single branch distribution circuit to demonstrate the performance of proposed scheme. The results show that our MPC indeed reduces power loss and keeps the voltage within a desired bound.

A data center network (DCN) connects tens or hundreds of thousands of servers in the data center and uses a traffic control scheme to enable the data transmission among servers. Various new applications in cloud present new requirements on traffic control of DCNs, such as low latency and high throughput. Existing traffic control schemes in DCNs suffer from the complicated kernel processing and cannot satisfy the requirements. Remote direct memory access (RDMA), which bypasses the kernel processing to enable fast memory moving across a network, is recognized as a promising solution. In this article, we present a survey of traffic control schemes for traditional RDMA, traditional DCNs, and RDMA-enabled DCNs and explain their limitations. We also differentiate the existing schemes from congestion control, performance, and components.

More particularly, we derive a lower bound on the OP in closed-form, as well as the asymptotic OP and diversity order. We also investigate the throughput in the delay-limited transmission mode in terms of deriving corresponding expression. It is observed that the performance of system is limited by RHIs and ICSI, which results in error floor for the OP and zero diversity order. In addition, a key conclusion is that by carefully selecting the ratio factor between the energy harvesting and information transmission phases, the throughput can be maximized.},

In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments to explore the characteristics of the phase offsets. The real experimental results reveal that the phase offsets are actually deterministic. We explain such a phenomena via the circuit design of WiFi chips. We also show that the phase offsets are even the same among different chips. With extensive experiments, we obtain and report the measured phase offset values for the commodity Intel 5300 and Atheros AR9380 WiFi chips. With the observation illustrated in this paper, the calibration of the phase offsets can be simplified greatly.},

  abstract     = {Network slicing is an emerging paradigm aiming to provide use case tailored virtual networks. However, it poses new challenges for slice resource assignment. Specifically, new admission control policies are required to model delay-tolerant slices. Fair admission of requests from different willingness-to-pay subscribers while maximizing resource monetization is another major problem. This paper proposes a novel slice admission model with delayed admission and quota constraints to maximize the monetization and minimize the service agreement violation. We investigate a tradeoff between the monetization and the admission rate, that rise due to quota-driven resource allocation. We map the slice admission to the multiple knapsack problem, formulate an integer programming model, and present a partially adaptive greedy (PAGE) algorithm to tackle this combinatorial optimization problem. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the PAGE over classical heuristics.},

  abstract     = {In a wireless power transfer (WPT) system in which multiple receivers are lined up on one side of a transmitter, the farthest receiver can experience difficulty receiving the required power from the transmitter because most of the power tends to be transferred to the nearest receiver. It is therefore necessary to find some means for providing sufficient power to charge the farthest receiver, in order to complete the charging of all the receivers within a reasonable time. In this paper, we propose two fast WPT methods: equal power distribution (EPD), and sequential power distribution (SPD). EPD allows all receivers to receive the same power by adjusting their load resistances and thus completing their charging at the same time, while SPD sequentially charges receivers in order according to location, and incorporates each charged receiver into the relay to assist with charging the next receiver. We analyze the charging times of the two methods based on equivalent circuit models and validate them using experiments by fabricating resonators. The analysis and experimental results show that the proposed EPD and SPD decrease the system charging time considerably compared with the conventional method in which there is no control.},

The proposed protocol divides the lifetime of files stored on the cloud into several time periods, and each time period is further divided into several refreshing periods. The auditing secret key is updated in each time period, and secret values used to update the auditing secret key change in every refreshing period. These two update operations are completed by the client and the third party auditor (TPA). This protocol is secure against the adversary as long as the client and TPA are not compromised in the same refreshing period. Security proof under random oracle model proves the protocol is secure, and the experimental results indicate that the performance of the protocol is acceptable.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the deployment and usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor and track a geographical region have been increased exponentially. The network infrastructure designed to deploy UAVs consists of sensors, actuators, and other communication smart devices for data collection and processing. As security and privacy is one of the challenging tasks in such an environment, so to design an efficient and secure data dissemination scheme is a challenging task due to limited storage and computation power of UAVs. To mitigate various attacks in such an environment, several efficient signature schemes were proposed in the literature. However, none of these schemes work well due to high computation and communication costs. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a short proxy signature (CB-PS) scheme in certificate-based setting. Due to implicit usage of certificates, CB-PS solves inherent key escrow of ID-based designated verifier proxy signature. It also eliminates the necessity of secret key distribution in ID-based schemes. The proposed CB-PS scheme is adaptively unforgeable in a random oracle model. It is also efficient with respect to both signature length and computational complexity. The comparison of computational costs reveals that the proposed scheme consumes the least cost 15.45 ms in comparison to the costs of existing competitive schemes.},

However, the computational time and resources required to rigorously analyze the capacity offered by a base station (BS) equipped with a large number of antenna elements increase with the increase of the number of antenna elements in the array. In this paper, we present a novel approximation approach for modeling large microstrip antenna arrays in BSs of massive MIMO systems. The approach subdivides an M × N array into columns, rows, rectangular, or square subarrays, each consisting of a group of elements. The coupling is rigorously taken into account within each subarray, but it is ignored between subarrays, using just an array factor instead. Results are demonstrated for an 8 × 8 = 64 element patch array. It is shown that the difference in the capacity evaluated using rigorous electromagnetic simulations and the proposed approach is less than 0.79\% using the 2 × (8 × 4) approach for both the suburban macrocell model of the Extended Spatial Channel Model (SCME/suburban macro cell (SMa)) outdoor propagation model and three-dimensional independent identically distributed model with a significant reduction of 44\% and 50\%, respectively, in computational time as compared to the full-wave antenna array modeling approach.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce and characterize a new filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) architecture, based on flexible zero padding (FZP), suitable for applications obeying stringent latency requirements. FZP conveniently distributes zeros between transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) waveforms, and covers cyclic prefix (CP) and zero padding (ZP) as special extremal cases, providing, in this way, a bridge between classical CP-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and ZP-OFDM. It has the merit of being the only possible architecture that guarantees optimum confined and autonomous transmission and reception of each OFDM symbol within the symbol period, leading to a minimized latency. We assess the best achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) performances, of all possible FBMC configurations, obeying the FZP architecture, through a systematic optimization of their Tx and Rx waveforms, using the ping-pong optimized pulse shaping (POPS) algorithm. We also assess the whole communication link performance, in terms of raw and coded bit error rate (BER), for several representative FZP configurations. It turns out that the medium alternative between CP and ZP, which evenly distributes FZP between the Tx and Rx waveforms, does not provide a significant improvement in signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and BER, for slightly time dispersive channels, but brings more robustness to time synchronization errors. The conducted study shows that conventional CP-OFDM remains an interesting alternative since it leads to an insignificant degradation in SIR, compared to the optimal FZP configuration, while providing a decorrelated noise at the receiver, beneficial for short coded packets.},

Hence, this type of cryptosystem has found tremendous applications in data sharing in cloud computing, email forwarding, securing file systems, and so on. In practice, proxy re-encryption has to support verification of ciphertext to reduce the users’ computational burden. The ciphertext verification can be achieved through a public, private, or delegatable manner. Delegatable verification is more generic in that it can be easily converted into the other two verification methods. However, almost all existing schemes with delegatable verifiability only achieve replayable chosen ciphertext security. Hence, in this paper we propose a more secure proxy re-encryption scheme with delegatable verifiability. Specifically, we utilize a short signature scheme to prevent an attacker from forging a valid ciphertext, and prevent an attacker from forging a signature. As a result, our scheme is secure against chosen ciphertext attacks under the standard model.},

Nevertheless, the physical cell identifications (PCI) are extremely limited, thus it is difficult to reasonably allocate the limited PCIs to the massive SCBSs, which greatly affect the quality of service (QoS) for users in hot areas. In this paper, a PCI allocation and reuse scheme based on the maximum degree first coloring (MDFC) algorithm is proposed to allocate the limited PCIs for SCBSs in hot areas. Moreover, the K-means clustering algorithm is adopted to divide and identify different hot areas with the mobility data of massive users, which also contributes to the allocation of PCIs. The proposed scheme reduces the rate of PCI conflict and confusion, and improves the users’ QoS. Simulation results show that the MDFC algorithm has better PCI allocation efficiency, and shorter PCI allocation time.

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications have been considered as a key technology to enable very high data rate in the fifth-generation applications. Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems with hardware efficient analog/digital hybrid beamformer architecture have been widely considered to overcome the severe propagation loss of the mmWave channels. However, physical layer security in the mmWave wiretap MIMO systems and secure hybrid beamformer design have not been well investigated. In this paper, we consider the problem of the hybrid beamformer design for the secure transmission in mmWave wiretap MIMO systems in order to protect the legitimate transmission from eavesdropping. We aim to develop efficient secure hybrid beamformer design algorithms for both codebook-free and codebook-based analog beamformer schemes with either high-resolution or low-resolution phase shifters. Particularly, when eavesdropper&#39;s channel state information (CSI) is known, we first propose a joint analog precoder and combiner design algorithm that can prevent the information leakage to the eavesdropper. Then, the digital precoder and combiner are computed based on the obtained effective baseband channel to further maximize the secrecy rate. If prior knowledge of the eavesdropper&#39;s CSI is unavailable, we develop an artificial-noise-based hybrid beamforming approach, which can disrupt eavesdropper&#39;s reception while maintaining the quality-of-service of the intended receiver at a prespecified level. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed secure hybrid beamformer designs under different availabilities of eavesdroppers CSI.},

  abstract     = {In this last decade, the use of social networks became ubiquitous in our daily life. Twitter, one of the famous social networks became a rich source of discussed topics. The users in Twitter express their sentiments or points of view by tweets concerning different topics in variety of fields, such as politics, commercial products, etc. These important information are exploited by sentiment analysis tools. Clustering algorithms are one of the used solutions to discover the sentiment provided by users in tweets. However, knowing that the users sentiments are generally divided into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral, it was mandatory to find a strong clustering algorithm, which leads to a good clustering performance and produce an appropriate number of clusters in an acceptable run time. To achieve this goal, we combine in this paper two well-known clustering methods: K-means and DENCLUE (DENsity-based CLUstEring) with its variants. This combination allows to exploit the precise number of cluster from K-means and the clustering performance from DENCLUE and its variants. Experimental results on four Twitter datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithms against the state-of-the-art methods to provide a tradeoff between clustering performance, number of returned clusters, and runtime.},

In this, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication enables users to exchange meaningful information with nearby vehicles directly. In general, vehicles move faster on the highway rather than the intersection road environment, and thus, a robust system is required to communicate efficiently and securely. Recently, researchers have designed various message dissemination schemes, but different concerns (i.e., security threats, more execution time, high communication overhead, and storage cost) are present in these systems, and it leads to unreliability for on-the-fly communication. Therefore, in this article, we propose an efficient and secure V2V data transmission protocol using a one-way hash function to send valuable information at the receiver side quickly. The results present that the suggested scheme performs better in execution time, storage cost, communication overhead, and energy consumption compared to the existing V2V protocols. Further, the proposed method resists various security attacks, i.e., modification, impersonation, replay, man-in-the-middle, stolen on-board-unit, password guessing, and concatenation.},

This paper compares one-time-slot ANC (1TA) TWR, in which each node operates in IFD mode, with two-time-slot ANC (2TA) TWR, where each node is in in-band half-duplex mode. In addition, achievable sum rate of the 1TA-TWR is derived with adverse factors such as direct link interference as well as self-interference (SI), which is induced by IFD signaling. This paper proposes an iterative optimal power allocation (OPA) method to maximize the derived end-to-end sum rate, which is based on Lagrangian and Newton-Raphson algorithm under total power constraint. Numerical results elucidate the efficiency of the 1TA-TWR over the 2TA-TWR as the following: the 1TA-TWR based on the OPA becomes more and more viable than the 2TA-TWR based on existing OPA, as the relay node goes into the center of two source nodes, the link channel gain of mutual source nodes increases, and the SI channel gain approaches noise floor level.},

In the first scheme, a multiantenna source communicates with multiple relays and the destination by applying SSK-MBM, i.e., by altering the activated antenna and the on/off status of radio-frequency mirrors. Moreover, multiantenna relays have the capability of hybrid relaying, which means that the relays that correctly decode the source&#39;s signal take part in the transmission by applying the SSK-MBM technique; however, the relays that erroneously decode the source&#39;s signal amplify and forward their received signal to the destination. In the second scheme, we consider a novel cooperative SSK-MBM scheme with a hybrid relay selection in which a multiantenna source communicates with a selected relay and the destination by applying SSK-MBM. Error probability expressions for the proposed schemes are derived. Comprehensive computer simulations show that the derived analytical expressions are in agreement with the numerical results and show that the performance of hybrid relaying scheme is superior to that of the decode-and-forward as well as the amplify-and-forward techniques. It is shown that the proposed SSK-MBM systems outperform the conventional cooperative single-input multiple-output and spatial modulation systems for particularly high modulation orders and sufficient number of receive antennas at the destination.},

Virtualization of network resources (e.g., infrastructure and spectrum) brings several advantages. One key advantage is that various network operators can robustly share their virtualized network resources to extend coverage, increase capacity, and reduce costs. However, inherent features of wireless communications, e.g., the uncertainty in user equipment locations and channel conditions, impose significant challenges on virtualization and sharing of the network resources. In this context, we propose a novel three-layered virtualization framework, based on a matching game model and stochastic resource allocation.

In C-RAN systems, baseband units (BBUs) are centralized in a BBU pool and remote radio heads (RRHs) are connected with the BBU pool through front-haul links. The BBU-RRH peer switching scheme is quite a key point in C-RAN especially for fast switching scenarios. A typical C-RAN system based on software defined radio (SDR) and virtual machine migration is introduced as the system model. Then we analyze the factors, including packet delay, and power consumption, that influence the performance of a C-RAN system. We conclude backlogs, idle computation resources, and switching costs could reflect the system performance adequately. They can evaluate radio resource usage, computation resource usage, and extra computation resource usage, respectively. Based on the evaluation model, the optimization algorithm is studied. In this paper, we propose a method to find the optimized load range for the BBUs. Taking switching quality into consideration, we propose a scheme that can adjust the BBU working load dynamically in an optimized range with less switching cost. The system performance variation under different switching intervals is also investigated. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed optimization scheme is validated by simulation results.},

The functions that express the relationship between the input radio frequency power and the output direct current harvested energy of the EH circuits are usually assumed to be linear in recent SWIPT works, while the nonlinear function is suitable for practical data. In a SWIPT IC system, two important targets are sum harvested energy maximization and harvested energy efficiency maximization at the PS receiver, and they are investigated under linear/nonlinear EH models. Thus, some nonconvex resource allocation problems with the two targets and linear/nonlinear EH models are formulated to jointly optimize beamforming vectors at the transmitters and the PS ratios at the receivers. By exploiting a successive convex approximation method and a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, iterative algorithms are proposed to obtain local optimal solutions. Interestingly, the optimal solution to the subproblem is proven to satisfy the rank-1 constraint of the SDR technique. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate effective performance from the proposed solutions, in comparison with some special schemes.},

Specifically, we address the transmit covariance design from the multiple-objective optimization perspective in order to simultaneously maximize the total harvested energy of energy receivers in WET and the secrecy rate of information receiver in WIT. To deal with the challenging multiple-objective optimization problem (MOOP), we first find the Utopia point of the MOOP. Then, we transform the original MOOP into two different single-objective optimization problems (SOOPs) via the weighted sum and the weighted Tchebycheff approaches, respectively. The two SOOPs are, however, nonconvex and nonsmooth. We further develop two iterative algorithms to tackle them, respectively. For comparison, a distributed transmit covariance design based on the Nash equilibrium is also proposed. Simulation results are finally presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and illustrate the tradeoff between the total harvested energy and the secrecy rate.},

However, the contemporary measurement chain and the communication network are far from ideal. Therefore, it is essential to identify the impact of the availability and quality of the synchronized measurements, on the wide-area controller&#39;s performance. This paper examines the effect of measurement errors and delays/dropouts on the damping capability of the wide-area controller. The measurement errors considered in this paper are according to the dynamic compliance requirements of the PMU during disturbances as it is imposed in the IEEE Synchrophasor Standard C37.118.1-2011. The delays are separated into measurement and feedback delays. The results indicate that delays along with dropouts deteriorate significantly the WAC performance, while the consideration of only the measurement errors (steady state and dynamic) in the simulation environment has a minor effect on its operation. For this reason, a linear predictor is proposed to compensate effectively and timely all the system&#39;s delays. The case studies are conducted on the IEEE 39-bus system and evaluated through the Prony analysis tool.},

  abstract     = {Intermittently connected mobile networks (ICMNs) are kinds of delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) in which the topology of mobile network changes frequently, the network is sparse, and end-to-end connection is hard to establish. However, as nodes in DTNs may often have limited energy, the performance of the network will be inevitably affected. Particularly, the message delivery ratio will be decreased when some of the nodes are out of energy and unable to participate in relay process. In order to make effective use of resources, we take this into consideration and propose the social similarity and optimized resource (SSAOR) protocol. According to the position relationship between the source and the destination nodes, SSAOR uses two different strategies to determine the order of forwarding messages. If they belong to the same community, the source node forwards message, copies to the relay node with the shorter encounter interval and the higher social friendship rank similarity with destination nodes. Otherwise, the source node forwards message copies to the relay node with the higher weight “betweenness” similarity and the shorter waiting encounter time similarity with destination nodes. In addition, we propose a buffer management method for dynamically distributing message copies to reduce network overhead, due to the fact that only a small number of copies can be successfully delivered. Finally, the simulation results show that SSAOR achieves a higher delivery ratio and lower overhead ratio, compared to other protocols within resource-constrained network situations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose general service-oriented end-to-end energy and delay models. They facilitate the evaluation of new schemes, by enabling flexible allocation of processing functions at multilayer radio access network. These models describe the underlaying processing of communication function (PCF)&#39;s complexity and the induced bandwidth. We also introduce the concept of processing interference and link it to the average PCF option of the competing users at the cloud. The proposed framework shows the possibility to compensate the delay or energy degradation, e.g., due to radio environment, by reallocating processing parameters, e.g., allocation of PCF or number of virtual central processing units (VCPUs). Several conclusions are inferred from the system&#39;s evaluation. For instance, at low modulation index (MI), the behavior of overall energy consumption is dominated by PCF energy, not the transmission energy, whereas, at high MI, the behavior of overall energy consumption is dominated by transmission energy. Centralization of PCF reduces the impact of processing interference (of competing users) on the targeted service&#39;s delay from 11 to 2 ms, and service&#39;s energy consumption from 18 to 2 J. We further evaluate the impact of PCF on the decision of offloading the service, to be computed at the cloud.},

  abstract     = {Data sharing is a convenient and economic service supplied by cloud computing. Data contents privacy also emerges from it since the data is outsourced to some cloud servers. To protect the valuable and sensitive information, various techniques are used to enhance access control on the shared data. In these techniques, Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) can make it more convenient and secure. Traditional CP-ABE focuses on data confidentiality merely, while the user&#39;s personal privacy protection is an important issue at present. CP-ABE with hidden access policy ensures data confidentiality and guarantees that user&#39;s privacy is not revealed as well. However, most of the existing schemes are inefficient in communication overhead and computation cost. Moreover, most of those works take no consideration about authority verification or the problem of privacy leakage in authority verification phase. To tackle the problems mentioned above, a privacy preserving CP-ABE scheme with efficient authority verification is introduced in this paper. Additionally, the secret keys of it achieve constant size. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme achieves the selective security under the decisional n-BDHE problem and decisional linear assumption. The computational results confirm the merits of the presented scheme.},

A straightforward way to deal with this problem is to restrict the application permissions. However, the restriction not only prevents the undesirable operations from leaking privacy but also prohibits the desirable operations from utilizing private data. Our goal is to get both of the points: ensuring the user&#39;s privacy by preventing undesirable private-data transmissions and enduring no degradation on the desirable application functionalities. We propose SieveDroid, a fine-grained runtime privacy control framework. SieveDroid addresses two key challenges of intercepting the undesirable private-data transmissions: revealing how private-data transmissions occur to end-users and setting privacy control rules which intercept the undesirable private-data transmissions at runtime without interfering with desirable ones. We evaluate SieveDroid by using Android malware samples and real applications from the Android market. The results demonstrate that SieveDroid reveals the undesirable operations precisely and concisely and it can effectively intercept the undesirable data transmissions. Besides, desirable functionalities in 98\% of the tested applications are not affected.},

In this paper, we address the energy-efficient joint scheduling and resource management in UAV-enabled multicell networks, where multiple UAVs act as aerial base stations (BSs) to serve ground devices. We devise the scheduling and resource management that jointly solve the problem of optimizing the UAVs&#39; locations and resource management, in order to maximize the network energy efficiency (EE). Accordingly, we propose two approaches: a coordinated approach, where all UAVs coordinate with each other to achieve the overall network EE with sharing their information and decision, and an uncoordinated approach, where each UAV selfishly maximizes its own EE without sharing its information and decision. We transform the coordinated optimization problem into a convex form, and adopt the noncooperative game theory to model the uncoordinated formulation. Moreover, we extend the two approaches to time-varying UAV-enabled systems to handle the dynamic environments. Simulation results evaluate the performance of the proposed coordinated approach and the uncoordinated approach under both dynamic and stationary cases, and reveal the respective advantages of the two approaches.},

Dedicated frequency allocation is performed for micro- and femtocell users though the leader of each femtocell group allocates frequencies to its follower femtocells based on auction game.

From relay to destination in these schemes, the data packet includes two parts: data transmission and channel estimation. Closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio for the three structures are derived. Using these expressions, achievable rate and bit-error-rate are derived. Different parameters are examined.

Certificateless signatures that can provide an authentication mechanism for the data seem to be a viable option to this problem. Nevertheless, the certificateless signature scheme proposed so far is either easy to be broken or inefficient. In this paper, a pairing-free and provably secure certificateless parallel key-insulated signature (CL-PKIS) scheme is put forward for securing the communication in the IIoT environment. Unlike previous work in this field, our scheme not only uses elliptic curves to maintain higher efficiency, but also implants key-insulated primitive to reduce the risk of key exposures. Besides, our scheme provides a parallel mechanism to make it more suitable for the IIoT environment, which was not available in previous solutions. Finally, the security of our CL-PKIS scheme is proved under the discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model.},

  abstract     = {The major challenge encountered by battery-driven wireless local area networking devices is to conserve their energy for prolonged operation. This paper presents an energy-efficient medium access mechanism called group control slot allocation (GCSA) protocol for cognitive radio (CR) networks. GCSA utilizes the group priority allocation algorithm to allocate stations (STAs) into groups; subsequently STAs that have traffic buffered in an access point are assigned to a higher priority group. A management frame, namely group monitoring pointer, optimizes the sleep-awake cycle of the STAs by allocating transmission opportunities to groups based on their priority. GCSA employs publisher-subscriber and point-to-point messaging models for communication between the base station and STAs, respectively. Performance analysis of GCSA demonstrates that increasing the number of STAs which enter into sleep mode augments the percentage of energy saved. The overall system-level results show that energy saved is around 20\% higher for GCSA than the IEEE 802.11e standard hybrid coordination function power-saving mode. Since GCSA benefits from history-assisted-led spectrum sensing, the paper also presents the relationship of the local storage of CRs with respect to history and suggests a hybrid approach as best option to keep a balance between the sensed data and its sharing with analytical engine database for history enrichment leading toward improved energy efficiency.},

Second, further developing this 2 × 1 ST OFDM, both novel 4 × 1 and 4 × 2 STF OFDM architectures and computing algorithms are developed, specifically at a code rate 3/4. Third, four orthogonal transforms, Walsh-Hadamard, Slant, Harley, and Haar, are employed as the precoder to form four different 4 × 1 and 4 × 2 precoded STF OFDM systems, respectively. All four precoded systems improve the bit error rate (BER) without expanding power or bandwidth in comparing with the regular 4 × 1 and 4 × 2 STF OFDM schemes. Simulations indicate that the precoded 4 × 2 STF OFDM system has the best BER; the 4 × 2 STF OFDM system, the precoded 4 × 1 STF OFDM system, the 4 × 1 STF OFDM system, and the 2 × 1 ST OFDM system follow in order due to the achieved diversity order in fading channels.

  abstract     = {Although the openflow-based software defined network (SDN) architecture can ease the workload of network control and management and separate it from the switch/routing operations, a computation-resource limited controller can still be congested by heavy flows and then experiences serious delay. To enhance network scalability and reduce computation delay on SDN networks under Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, a hierarchical edge-cloud SDN (HECSDN) controller system design is proposed with three features. First, by sharing computational resources in the edge and the cloud, the system architecture provides a flexible mechanism for devices to allocate their computational tasks according to traffic loads. The second feature is to design a queueing model of the proposed architecture. The model description of the networking architecture enables the network designers to quickly estimate the performance of design without considerable time and cost in experimental setups. Third, derived from the queueing model, an efficient load-balancing algorithm satisfying QoS requirements or fairness allocation for different applications in the HECSDN architecture is proposed. This newly-developed multi-tier controller system has been proved to be effective even when working on a large-scale SDN, without sacrificing the overall performance. Moreover, this system stays highly stable in transient periods even under highly fluctuating flow arrivals.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a multi-input multioutput (MIMO) nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network consisting of one source and two legitimate users (LUs), so-called near and far users according to their distances to the source, and one passive eavesdropper, over Nakagami-m fading channels. Specifically, we investigate the cases where the signals of the far user might or might not be successfully decoded at the eavesdropper and the near user. Thus, we aim to design a transmit antenna selection (TAS) secure communication protocol for the network; where, two TAS solutions, namely Solutions I and II, are proposed. Specifically, Solutions I and II focus on maximizing the received signal power between the source and the near user, and between the source and the far user, respectively. Accordingly, exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability of the LUs and the overall system are derived. Our analytical results corroborated by the Monte Carlo simulation indicate that the secrecy performance could be significantly improved by properly selecting the power allocation coefficients and increasing the number of antennas at the source and the LUs. Interestingly, solution II is shown to provide a better overall secrecy performance over solution I.},

The development of recommendation methods and techniques has driven many real-world recommendation applications. Desirable recommendations are vital both to the target users and the recommended items. Mining meaningful interest information from different time spans is crucial for recommendation precision. In this paper, the relations between different time spans are adopted to construct the signed networks and imitate users interest changes. First, we initially utilize temporal score information to divide different time spans. Then, the signed networks are formed at different time steps referring to users interest changes. Furthermore, considering the characteristics of signed networks, we define a new similarity measurement to grasp the common interest between two adjacent signed networks. A new adjacent matrix is obtained by weighting the network adjacent matrices of different time steps. According to the constructed dynamic evolutionary clustering model in a signed network, the nodes are divided into different clusters. Finally, the predicted ratings are calculated in each subclass instead of the entire system, which reduces the computational cost greatly. The extensive simulations are conducted based on two real-world datasets, Movielens and CiaoDVD, for demonstrating that the recommend accuracy is significantly improved using our scheme.},

The objective of the design is to maximize the lifetime of the network operation for a given network topology and a bound of the total transmission time of all links. Initially, each node is set to transmit at the most energy-efficient transmission rate, which is derived using an underwater acoustic channel model. A constrained least square problem then is formulated which yields an analytical solution of the optimal network flow at each link that maximizes the network lifetime. If the timing constraint is not met, a new iteration will begin with the restriction on per-node energy consumption incrementally relaxed. Usually, the algorithm converges within a couple of iterations. Two design examples, a linear configured network, and a rhombus configured network are used to demonstrate the design procedures.

However, the operation of these applications remains a challenge for users with ID since they may not have the sufficient cognitive proficiency to cope with the application interface. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based context-aware AAC system. Our system facilitates daily communication for nonverbal school children with moderate ID in order to address their learning and communication needs. We have piloted and evaluated our system at a special education school in Hong Kong. Our technical contribution is twofold. First, we introduce BLE technology to the AAC field and show its effectiveness on users with ID. Second, by converting conventionally standalone AAC software into a service system and empowering it with Internet of Things functionality, we open up many new opportunities brought by the system-of-systems (SoS) paradigm for the intellectually disabled population.},

We model the channel errors by using the norm bounded model, and aim to maximize the worst-case EE by jointly designing the precoders of the sources and relay, and the power splitting ratio of the relay under the worst-case transmit power constraints at the sources and relay. To solve the robust EE optimization problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm based on the weighted minimum mean-square-error method, where the S-procedure and sign-definiteness lemma are employed to eliminate the channel errors. To balance the performance and complexity, we propose a channel diagonalization algorithm based on the generalized singular value decomposition, which has lower complexity.

  abstract     = {Hybrid analog and digital structure with reduced radio frequency (RF) chains is a key enabler to reach a compromise between system complexity and performance in future fifth-generation high-frequency communications. A fully connected architecture that each antenna connects to all RF chains has been proven to achieve similar performance compared to a traditional full-digital system where the number of RF chains is equal to the number of antennas. However, such a structure is difficult for practical implementation owing to the problem of circuit layout for high-frequency antenna array structures. Therefore, a subconnected alternative where each RF chain only connects to a disjoint subset of antennas becomes more attractive. In this paper, we study the system with the subconnected subarray architecture employed by both the transmitter and the receiver, and aim to maximize the sum-rate by taking joint precoding and combining into consideration. We propose two schemes, named joint-SIC and MU-SIC, for single-user and multi-user communications, respectively. Moreover, we provide an upper bound of the sum-rate achieved by such a subconnected subarray structure. The simulation results show the fast convergence and effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

Approaches based on information centric networks (ICN), where moving devices forward collected data, have been proposed for opportunistic scenarios but to date, the dynamics of the delivery process in ICNs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we build a family of Markovian models for the delivery process of ICNs in opportunistic scenarios, that allow us to derive the end-to-end delay distribution and the storage ratio in terms of the encounter rate of the moving devices. Furthermore, we investigate how prefetching mechanisms affect the delivery process compared to conventional ICNs. The proposed models are fully validated in a computer simulation environment and demonstrate that the utility of delivery with prefetching reaches its peak in a short time and then decreases at a high rate. Our Markovian models can provide both the insight and quantitative estimations that are needed to design practical ICNs in opportunistic scenarios.},

Additionally, live VM migration has been adopted to perform load balancing by moving VMs across distinct hosts. However, co-located VMs that show significant positive correlations on their CPU utilization patterns are at a higher risk of triggering overloading events and incurring performance degradation, even when their host is operating below its critical limits. To address this problem, a VM consolidation mechanism inspired by host-switching behaviors in symbiotic associates is proposed in this paper. In the proposed mechanism, hosts and VMs in Cloud data centers represent symbionts in an ecosystem. Two heuristic functions, inspired by host susceptibility and symbiotic coefficient among symbionts, are proposed to yield better resource utilization via VM consolidations.

To efficiently utilize the harvested energy of the BSs, we study adaptive traffic management (TM) and energy cooperation (EC) that aim at minimizing the on-grid energy consumption, while guaranteeing minimum average throughputs. To achieve this, we develop an adaptive TM and EC algorithm that jointly decides the energy sharing among BSs, the user association to BSs, and the sub-channel and power allocation in BSs. Within the algorithm, a network scheduling problem, which is mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP), should be solved in each timeslot. To efficiently solve it, we develop a network scheduling algorithm applying generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) that optimally solves the MINLP problem. In addition, we also develop a heuristic network scheduling algorithm that has a much lower computational complexity than the GBD algorithm, while providing comparable performance. Through the numerical results, we show that our algorithms always outperform the algorithms that use only one of TM or EC regardless of the system conditions.},

  abstract     = {Creative integration of smarter machines with new emerging information and communication technologies in manufacturing industry allows collaborative automation between machines and promises greater production flexibility and product variability. The ubiquitous machine-to-machine messaging, intermachine understanding, and system modeling are key enabling techniques to empower machine interoperability for flexible manufacturing systems. However, the heterogeneities in machine part platforms, production strategies, and product variability keep the rich sensing and communication-intensive subsystems from seamless integration. By highlighting the specificities of industrial networks, this investigation aims to gain manufacturing flexibility by constructing a collaborative-automation-based industrial network from the system and software perspective, focusing on: 1) the modeling of machine interactions in communication-intensive industrial networks; 2) machine modularization and decentralized structure for production-line-scale efficiency; 3) ubiquitous messaging and understanding for machine interoperability; and 4) model-based management for application-level adaptation and flexibility. The presented technical solutions have been implemented in the PickNPack food manufacturing line, and the results demonstrate their feasibility.},

  abstract     = {In high-speed wireless communication systems, direct-conversion transceivers (DCTRs) are in demand due to low implementation cost of analog front ends. However, the DCTRs are more susceptible to radio frequency impairments like in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) imbalance. This has been shown to significantly limit the spectrum sensing (SS) capability of a secondary user to find spectrum holes. Another source of performance limitation in multiantenna cognitive radio (CR) systems is the uncalibrated receivers across the antennas. Unlike previous works, which considered these two impairments separately, we model the received signal as a single-input multiple-output CR system in the presence of transmit (TX) and receive (RX) I/Q imbalances and when the receiver is uncalibrated across the antennas. In such a scenario, we model the SS problem as a composite binary hypothesis testing problem, apply the likelihood ratio test principle, and develop a new robust SS approach. The performance of the proposed SS algorithm is evaluated using extensive Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the superiority of the proposed detector in comparison with the existing SS algorithms in the literature. The obtained results indicate that the proposed SS algorithm has constant false alarm rate property with respect to any nonuniform noise variance uncertainties as well as RX I/Q imbalance parameters, thereby being a robust and blind detector.},

  abstract     = {Wireless communication for high-speed railways (HSRs) has received considerable attention in recent years. The fast time-varying and doubly selective fading properties of channels pose a substantial threat to the link performance. Meanwhile, the nonnegligible Doppler frequency offset (DFO) resulting from the high-speed motion induces intercarrier interference. In this paper, we propose an angle-domain channel tracking and hybrid beamforming scheme for HSR by investigating the time and spatial properties of channels. A large-scale uniform linear antenna array is applied at the base station to provide high spatial resolution. The DFO is compensated through beam alignment and capturing the precise angular information from signals. Then, the spatial beam gain is tracked during the angle-of-arrival time, which can be used to reconstruct the full-dimensional channel state information. Finally, the hybrid beamforming is used to realize data transmission. The key idea of tracking is, applying a linear Kalman filter to modify the time-varying beam gain, while the main idea of hybrid beamforming is utilizing nonorthogonal beams to compress the channel dimension and decrease the computational complexity. The superiority of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulations.},

Accordingly, closed-form expressions are derived for the end-to-end outage probability (OP), Ergodic capacity, and average symbol error rate (ASER) are provided. The provided expressions are very important in predicting the channel/link quality in the network such that practical multihop communication protocols (channel assignment, multihop path selection, power control, etc.) can be effectively designed. The derived expressions are numerically validated against well-known fading channel models (Rayleigh and η-μ) by setting the appropriate α, η, and μ values. We evaluate the effects of the fading parameters and number of hops on the system performance. Results indicate that a DF-based multihop technique can significantly enhance the end-to-end ASER and OP performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper models the cyber-social system as a cyber-network of agents monitoring states of individuals in a social network. The state of each individual is represented by a social node, and the interactions among individuals are represented by a social link. In the cyber-network, each node represents an agent, and the links represent information sharing among agents. The agents make an observation of social states and perform distributed inference. In this direction, the contribution of this paper is threefold: First, a novel distributed inference protocol is proposed that makes no assumption on the rank of the underlying social system. This is significant as most protocols in the literature only work on full-rank systems. Second, a novel agent classification is developed, where it is shown that the connectivity requirement of the cyber-network differs for each type. This is particularly important in finding the minimal number of observations and minimal connectivity of the cyber-network as the next contribution. Third, the cost-optimal design of the cyber-network constraint with distributed observability is addressed. This problem is subdivided into sensing cost optimization and networking cost optimization, where both are claimed to be NP-hard. We solve both the problems for certain types of social networks and find polynomial-order solutions.},

  abstract     = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, due to the limited computing power of terminal equipment, edge-cloud computing is a good solution for sharing the computation resources. Terminals can offload partial computations to the edge servers for energy saving and reduce the data transmission delays since the edge servers are usually deployed near the terminal devices. However, in the existing solutions, there is still a lot of unnecessary data transmission when the data used in the offloading jobs of several terminals are related. Adding a shareable cache to the edge server and allowing different computing jobs to share the related data can further reduce the data transmission cost and job delay. In this paper, we study the computation offloading method with cached data and propose a novel cache-aware computation offloading strategy for edge-cloud computing in IoT. First, we formulize the cache-aware computation offloading location problem, our goal is to minimize the equivalent weighted response time of all jobs with computing power and cache capacity constraints. Then, we derive the global optimum solution based on transforming the problem to the transportation problem. Next, since the terminal device is difficult to obtain global status information, we propose an online computation offloading strategy, which is convenient in practical deployment. Finally, experiments show that our online offloading strategy approximates the global optimal solution and it reduces the weighted response time by about 26.13\% on average compared to other competing algorithms.},

However, how to smartly schedule the packet transmission in CIoT systems is still a key challenge, that is, how to design a smart agent to realize the intelligent decision making and effective interoperability. In this paper, we model the system state transformation as a Markov decision process, and an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on a fuzzy normalized radial basis function neural network (called AC-FNRBF) is proposed to efficiently solve the intelligent transmission scheduling problem in CIoT systems under high-dimensional variables. The proposed AC-FNRBF algorithm can better approximate both the action function of the actor and the state-action value function of the critic without requiring the system prior knowledge, and a new reward function is established to maximize the system benefit, which jointly takes the transmission packet rate, the system throughput, the power consumption, and the transmission delay into account. Moreover, the AC-FNRBF has the ability to adjust its learning structure and parameters in dynamic environments. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves higher transmission packet rate and system throughput with lower power consumption and transmission delay, compared with other existing reinforcement learning algorithms.},

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), as a crucial basis of IoT, have been applied in many fields like smart health care and smart transportation. With the development of WSNs, data security has attracted more and more attention, and user authentication is a popular mechanism to ensure the information security of WSNs. Recently, many authentication mechanisms for wireless medical sensor networks (WMSNs) have been proposed, but most of the protocols cannot achieve the features of local password change and forward secrecy while resisting stolen smart card attack. To enhance the security based on previous work, an ECC-based secure three-factor authentication protocol with forward secrecy for WMSN is proposed in this paper. It utilizes a fuzzy commitment scheme to handle the biometric information. Meanwhile, fuzzy verifier and honey_list techniques are used to solve the contradiction of local password verification and mobile device lost attack. The security of our protocol is evaluated by provable security, Proverif tool, and information analysis. Besides, the comparisons with the relevant protocols are given, and the results indicate that our protocol is robust and secure for WMSN systems.},

However, real-time hardware realization of multicarrier systems is limited by a large number of arithmetic units for inverse fast Fourier transform and pulse-shaping filters. In this paper, we aim to propose a low-complexity and reconfigurable architecture for a baseband UFMC transmitter. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed architecture is the first reconfigurable architecture that has the flexibility to choose the number of subcarriers in a subband without any change in hardware resources. In addition, the proposed architecture selects the filter from a group of filters with a single selection line. Moreover, we use a commercially available field-programmable gate array device for real-time testing and analyzing the baseband UFMC signal. From the extensive experiments, we study the occupied bandwidth, main-lobe power, and sidelobe power of the baseband signal with different filters in real-time scenarios. Finally, we measure the quantization error in baseband signal generation for the proposed UFMC transmitter architecture and find comparable with the error bound.},
