In this paper, a nonlinear disturbance rejection control method is investigated in a composite design manner for an oil-fired drum-type boiler-turbine unit. A baseline exponentially stable feedback controller is first designed, and then a high-order sliding mode observer is utilized to estimate and thus to compensate unknown lumped disturbances. It is shown that the obtained results for the boiler-turbine unit can be extended to a wide class of nonlinear systems. More interestingly, the finite-time stability of the closed-loop systems can be rendered in several cases. Finally, some numerical simulation scenarios are conducted on the boiler-turbine unit to demonstrate the claimed control performance.},

  abstract     = {Differentiating muscle fatigue induced hand tremor of surgeons into different discernible levels is important in laparoscopic surgery. Systematic clustering can be used as a method to assess the risk of hand tremor which can largely affect the surgical performance. The prime challenges lying here are the detection of fatigue onset and classification of fatigue induced tremor level in dynamic laparoscopic tool manipulation. Conventionally, muscle fatigue is assessed with frequency domain analysis of the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal, where the detection process is predominantly valid only for isometric contraction of muscles. Conventional methods cannot be used for assessment of fatigue level in case of dynamic activities as the task itself modulates the frequency content of the myoelectric response. In this paper, we have proposed a novel polynomial Hammerstein model-based clustering of fatigue induced tremor, employing sEMG, and joint torques. The sEMG signal, containing muscle fatigue information, gets fused in this model dynamically through a Kalman filter. Model parameter-based clustering of the fatigue induced tremor level was implemented on eight subjects. Optimal number of cluster centers were found to be appropriately coherent with the fatigue inducing task epochs of the experiment. In spite of the subjective variations, the model parameter-based clustering method was able to differentiate among the fatigue-inducing tasks for all the subjects. We have concluded that this model-based clustering can successfully differentiate between different levels of the fatigue induced tremor in dynamic activity of laparoscopic tool manipulation.},

It is shown that the impulsive control with a suitable impulsive strength can stochastically stabilize the underlying systems. With the symmetry and irreducibility of the switching topologies, and the obtained stochastic stability criteria, sufficient conditions are derived to determine the mean square exponential synchronization of the underlaying networks via the single pinning impulsive controller, which are given with algebraic inequalities and M -matrix. The almost surely exponential synchronization is also analyzed. Two examples are given to verify the validity of the theoretic results presented.},

For applications under complex uncertainty, it is desirable that we provide a systematic way for users to identify reliable information. In our approach, the similarity uncertainty for different kinds of data sets is defined according to the Shannon entropy theory. Then, similarity constrained models are designed to guarantee superior learning performance under uncertainty. Experiments using both simulation data set and several public data sets, can clearly demonstrate significant improvements of the proposed method under large uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {When dealing with complex nonlinear signals in intelligent system, by defining the inner product of two data vectors in the feature space, the kernel function can reflect the nonlinear mapping relationship between reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and original data space. Therefore, by implementing classical linear adaptive filtering in RKHS space, the filtering operation can be expressed as a special relation of inner product with kernel function, which is referred to as “kernel trick.” As long as these algorithms can be expressed in the form of inner product, not only the convex least squares problem can be solved iteratively, but also the nonlinear adaptive filtering algorithms can be obtained, which have both general approximation characteristics and convexity. Therefore, the combination of kernel method and adaptive filtering algorithm is realized. On the other hand, since the Gram matrix is used, the dimension of kernel adaptive algorithm is determined by the number of data samples. When the number of observation sample point is increasing, the size of the state space increases exponentially with the growth of the dimension. Thereby, the kernel adaptive algorithm should solve the problem of online sparsification to avoid “curse of dimensionality.” As part II, based on online sparse kernel learning and the classical adaptive filtering algorithm, the kernel adaptive algorithms and online sparse algorithms are investigated in this paper. The main works of this paper have two aspects. First, combined with classical adaptive algorithm and kernel feature mapping, this paper investigates the basic concept of kernel adaptive algorithm and the realization mechanism of four kernel adaptive algorithm intensively: 1) kernel least mean squares; 2) kernel recursive least squares; 3) kernel affine projection algorithm; and 4) kernel principal component analysis. Second, in order to reduce the computational complexity, this paper studies some online sparse algorithms which include novel criterion, approximate linear dependency, sliding window, coherence criterion, surprise criterion, and so on. Finally, this paper summarizes the essence of existing conclusions of above algorithms and perspectives the future research direction.},

Considering that each agent can only exchange binary symbolic sequence with its neighbors due to bandwidth constraints, we adopt the probabilistic quantization approach in the distributed consensus controller design. Compared to the existing works, the main contribution is that we use distributed observer-type controllers to inhibit the impact of quantization noises in agent states. First, we study the observer-type protocols with total quantized communications, where the relative-state information of each agent is quantized. The quantized consensus can be achieved, and the upper bounds of steady-state errors in the mean-square sense are also characterized, which are related to the scale of networks, the control parameters, the quantization levels, and the structures of agents. Further, we extend the controller design based on total quantization to the partial quantization case where only the neighbors&#39; information is quantized.},

First, a set of personal archives are maintained to evolve the search process instead of a population with a fixed size, and a truncation procedure is used to enhance selection pressure. Second, multiple biased mutation operators incorporating the target solution quality are proposed, and an adaptive selection method is adopted to allocate the mutation operators to solutions.

By choosing proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, utilizing the characteristic of hyperbolic tangent functions and adopting the function separation technique, difficulties of controller design that introduced by the time-varying delays can be dealt with properly. Moreover, all unknown nonlinear functions are lumped together and approximated by the NN. Additionally, any information over the boundedness of dead-zone parameters is not needed in the process of controller design. The control scheme proposed in this paper ensures the boundedness in probability of all signals in the closed-loop system, besides, excellent performance of arbitrarily small tracking error will be achieved by selecting control parameters appropriately.

Though the environmental processes spatially and temporally vary, the proposed approach of choosing sensor positions is proven not to be affected by time variations, which significantly reduces computational complexity of the optimization problem. The sensor deployment optimization problem is then solved by a practical and feasible polynomial algorithm, where its solutions are theoretically proven to be guaranteed.

  abstract     = {Humans can adapt to complex environments by voluntarily adjusting the impedance parameters and interaction force. Traditional robots perform tasks independently without considering their interactions with the external environment, which leads to poor flexibility and adaptability. Comparatively, humans can adapt to complex environments by voluntarily adjusting the impedance parameters and interaction force. In order to solve the problems of human-robot security and adaptability to unknown environment, a human-inspired control with force and impedance adaptation is proposed to interact with unknown environments and exhibit this biological behavior on the developed dual-arm exoskeleton robots. First, we propose a computationally model utilizing the sampled surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals to calculate the human arm endpoint stiffness and define a co-contraction index to describe the dynamic behaviors of the muscular activities in the tasks. Then, the obtained human limb impedance stiffness parameters and the sampling position information are transferred to the slave arm of the exoskeleton as the input variables of the controller in real-time. In addition, a variable stiffness observer is used here to compensate for the errors of the calculated stiffness by sEMG signals. The experimental studies of human impedance transfer control have been conducted to show the effectiveness of the developed approach. Results of the experimental suggest that the proposed controller can achieve human motor adaptation and enable the subjects to execute a skill transfer control by a dual-arm exoskeleton robot.},

Generally, with the help of label information, supervised learning methods have more flexible structure and better result than unsupervised learning. However, supervised learning is infeasible for clustering task. In this paper, to fill the gap between clustering and supervised learning, the proposed clustering methods introduce the exemplars discriminative information into a supervised learning. To build the effective objective function, a strategy for reducing intracluster distance and increasing intercluster distance is introduced to form a unified optimization objective function. With initially setting the clustering centers, the data that near the centers are selected as exemplars to indicate the ground truth of different classes. Discriminative learning is then introduced to learn the partition hyperplane and classify all the data into different classes. New clustering centers are calculated for selecting new exemplars alternately. Using the proposed algorithms, the unsupervised K -means clustering problem is effectively solved from the perceptive of optimization. Feature mapping is also introduced to improve the performance by reducing the intercluster distance. A novel framework for exploring discriminative information from unsupervised data is provided. The proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art approaches on a wide range of benchmark datasets in terms of accuracy.},

Numerous RMP schemes have been established in previous studies wherein simulations are assumed to be free of noise. However, noise is ubiquitous and can severely affect RMP schemes to the point of causing failure. This paper attempts address the limitations imposed by noise by providing the first RMP scheme with inherent noise-suppression capability. The new RMP scheme for redundant robot manipulators in a noisy environment is proposed on the basis of an equality criterion that is robust against additive noise. The equality criterion is established by incorporating the proportional and integral information of the desired end-effector path. The proposed scheme is reformulated as a quadratic program and is calculated by using a recurrent neural network. Comparative simulation results obtained with PA10 and four-link robot manipulators illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed RMP scheme over the traditional RMP scheme.},

  abstract     = {Computing time-varying linear systems is widely encountered in engineering practice and scientific computation. Dynamic neural networks, as a class of modeling approaches, have been intensively explored in recent decades for solving linear equations. The time-varying nature of this problem and the noisy workspace for many engineering practice require two features of practical design: 1) fast convergence in time and 2) robustness against noises and disturbance. Existing solutions usually decouple the problem into two steps by designing a fast-convergent neural controller and then topped with an additional low-pass filter to reach noise robustness. However, due to the interplay of the mentioned two dynamical parts, the overall system may lose stability if the parameters are not well tuned. In this paper, we establish the first dynamical neural model for simultaneously achieving fast-convergence, particularly finite-time convergence, and noise-robustness, with the capability to reject the unknown noise when it is constant or varies slowly. To do so, a superior design formula activated by noise-tolerant nonlinear functions is proposed to enhance the capability of zeroing neural networks (ZNNs), achieving denoising and finite-time convergence in a unified design. According to this design formula, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) with finite-time convergence and inherently noise-suppression performance [thus termed the finite-time robust RNN (FTRRNN)] is developed and applied to robotic motion tracking illustrated via time-varying linear equation system solving. Furthermore, theoretical analyses on the global stability, the finite-time convergence and the denoising ability of the proposed design formula and the corresponding FTRRNN model are presented in details. The upper bound on the convergence time is also analytically derived. A numerical example is supplied to verify the superior property of the FTRRNN model to the ZNN model according to the results of computing time-varying linear equation system in the presence of additive noises. Finally, an application to robotic motion tracking is presented to show that the presented FTRRNN model can successfully realize the ellipse-path tracking control of a planar two-link manipulator in front of the external disturbances, while the conventional ZNN model fails under the same conditions.},

Then, intermittently the integral control strategy K I (t) is implemented between impulsive time intervals for improving the state convergence. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the closed-loop performance. In addition, a memory controller K D is introduced to tackle the stabilization problem of system with signal transmission delay. Furthermore, a distributed time-varying delay δ k (t) is defined in the impulsive control-based system. Considering discrete and distributed time-varying delays concurrently, the ITD stability criteria are deduced to guarantee the H ∞ performance on uncertain system with exogenous disturbance.

This method involves solving the dynamic optimization problems online, whose objective functions measure the differences between the predicted and observed variables on each time horizon. In this method, the sensor placement is also discussed, and we determine the sensor locations depending on a model-free optimization technique.

In contrast to some previous publications, the sample period is no longer fixed and the transition probability matrix of Markovian switching topology is uncertain. This issue which is of practical and theoretical significance is further investigated when the sampled data controller of each agent is suffered from distinct time-varying input delay. Quite different with the related studies, a maximally allowable input delay upper bound is replaced by the permissible input delay interval. Furthermore, the corresponding consensus is elegantly obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

Accordingly, this paper presents an integrated framework called HCN operational capability disintegration based on link prediction (OCDLP) for modeling and solving the disintegration problem regarding the operational capability of an HCN. More specifically, a heterogeneous network model of a combat network under incomplete information is first established, considering different types of functional entities and information flows. Based on this model, a link prediction model is then applied to recover the original combat network structure while taking advantage of the observed information. Next, a disintegration evaluation metric of the operational capability of an HCN is elicited to evaluate the attack efficiency after a link prediction. Last, the reliability and effectiveness of the OCDLP are illustrated through a case study. The results provide useful insight into the operation guidance and design of a more resilient CSoSs.},

In this paper, a collaborative learning-based clustered LS-SVM method is proposed for modeling of nonlinear processes that are subject to noise or outliers. First, a large-scale dataset is divided into several subsets and the data distribution of each subset is estimated. A robust LS-SVM is then developed to represent each subset using this distributional information. A global model is further constructed through integration of all submodels, whose continuity and smoothness are ensured by the development of the collaborative learning technique. As a result, the proposed method considers both the nonlinear distribution of data and the robustness of each submodel, and ensures the continuity and smoothness of the global model. Thus, it can effectively model nonlinear data that is subject to either noise or outliers. As further validation of this approach, both artificial and real cases demonstrated its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {A great deal of research is being conducted to define control strategies that involve a level of sparsity either in the communication network, number of sensors, or the number of active actuators during the control process. These sparse control strategies are typically formulated as an optimization problem that has a criterion with a component associated with the dynamics of the controlled system, and a component based on the ℓ 1 -norm that induces sparsity on the optimization variables. Although this approach addresses the problem of obtaining sparse approximations, solving this optimization problem can be seen as a design process that is conducted simultaneously along with a variable selection process that does not take into account the inherent structural relationships between the components of the networked system to be controlled, such as spatial relations associated with the physics of the system or communication constraints. In this paper, we incorporate the concept of structural sparsity into the mathematical framework of control design in networked systems. Under this extended framework, it is possible to define control strategies that lead to sparse designs considering a prior knowledge on the structural relations between the variables of the system. This can potentially improve the system&#39;s performance, the consistency of the solution with physical constraints, and the interpretability of the design. First, we show how structural sparsity inducing norms can be constructed as a combination of ℓ 1 - and ℓ 2 -norms, encoding structures, such as overlapping groups, nonoverlapping groups, and hierarchies. Also, we show how these norms can induce both individual and group variable selection. Then, we present two different control design techniques, where structural sparsity is induced during the design process: linear feedback control design and dynamic resource allocation. We show through practical applications and simulation results the usefulness of structural sparsity in the control system design process.},

The proposed algorithm can address unknown directed communication topologies and only requires limited communications and information exchanges among nodes in the networked system. Under the assumption that the communication graph is strongly connected, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is rigorously analyzed.

The convergence of the proposed QDDILC algorithms is strictly proved and the effects of output saturation and data quantification are also analyzed. It is shown that sensor saturation does not change the convergence property, thus it causes the convergence rate to slow down. For the QDDILC algorithm, data quantization will cause the tracking error to converge to a bound depending on the quantization level. However, the modified QDDILC algorithm, which using the different quantization scheme from QDDILC algorithm, can ensure that the tracking error converges to zero. Illustrative simulations are exploited to verify the theoretical results.},

The system is subject to reconfigurations, which are automatic operations allowing the addition and/or removal of tasks as well as their exchanged messages on the NoC. Consequently, any reconfiguration can violate real-time and energy constraints on cores as well as the NoC when the energy is unavailable until the next recharge. A novel periodic task model based on elastic coefficients and a new scheduling strategy are proposed to compute useful temporal parameters allowing for tasks and messages to meet the related constraints while controlling the communication cost on the NoC. This strategy is compared with an integer linear programming-based optimal solution, and a tool named OptimalMappingTasks is developed to run different simulations that prove the originality of this paper&#39;s contribution.},

Thus, it raises the necessity to develop a patient-friendly self-care system which can help both patients and medical professionals to ensure the state of the surgical wounds without any special medical equipment. In this paper, a surgical wound assessment system for self-care is proposed. The proposed system is designed to enable patients capture surgical wound images of themselves by using a mobile device and upload these images for analysis. Combining image-processing and machine-learning techniques, the proposed method is composed of four phases. First, images are segmented into superpixels where each superpixel contains the pixels in the similar color distribution. Second, these superpixels corresponding to the skin are identified and the area of connected skin superpixels is derived. Third, surgical wounds will be extracted from this area based on the observation of the texture difference between skin and wounds. Lastly, state and symptoms of surgical wound will be assessed. Extensive experimental results are conducted. With the proposed method, more than 90\% state assessment results are correct and more than 91\% symptom assessment results consistent with the actual diagnosis. Moreover, case studies are provided to show the advantage and limitation of this system. These results show that this system could perform well in the practical self-care scenario.},

It is important for retailers to determine whether to introduce this option in addition to the same-channel return option (SC) that requires online purchases to be returned online. To address such challenging issue, we consider a dual-channel retailer and develop theoretical models to derive the optimal return strategy and pricing decisions. To this end, two scenarios, i.e., the SC and CC scenarios, are considered. In the latter scenario, the SC is also allowed. We show that the retailer cannot always benefit from adopting the CC. Specifically, given that consumer online purchase hassle cost is sufficiently low, when the cross-selling profit is sufficiently high, the retailer is better off adopting this option, and vice versa. Adopting this option cannot always help increase the demand, but always increases the return quantity. We also find that the retailer is not always better off adopting a uniform or differential pricing scheme. Interestingly, the retailer benefits from offering a relatively low return service charge, especially when adopting the CC. Our numerical results further show that, the retailer benefits from adopting the CC when the return rate is relatively low or moderate, and vice versa.},

In this paper, we analytically explore the C2C-PE problem for digital products. To be specific, we consider the presence of a digital product developer (DPD) who develops and sells a product to consumers in the market. Consumers possess random valuation toward the digital product and the DPD needs to decide the optimal selling price for the product. We study the impacts brought by C2C-PE. We try to uncover whether (and when) DPDs and consumers will be benefited by the presence of C2C-PE. In the basic model, when all parties are risk neutral, we find that the presence of C2C-PE is always beneficial to the DPD and consumers. To show the robustness of results in the basic model, we further extend the analysis to cover a few cases and prove that this conclusion holds irrespective of the DPD&#39;s risk averse attitude, the consumers&#39; risk averse attitude, as well as whether the utility gained from C2C-PE is effort dependent or not. Hence, we conclude that C2C-PE, which seems to be harmful to DPDs, is in fact a beneficial scheme to both the DPDs and consumers.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid flow shop scheduling problems have gained an increasing attention in recent years because of its wide applications in real-world production systems. Most of the prior studies assume that the processing time of jobs is deterministic and constant. In practice, jobs&#39; processing time is usually difficult to be exactly known in advance and can be influenced by many factors, e.g., machines&#39; abrasion and jobs&#39; feature, thereby leading to their uncertain and variable processing time. In this paper, a dual-objective stochastic hybrid flow shop deteriorating scheduling problem is presented with the goal to minimize makespan and total tardiness. In the formulated problem, the normal processing time of jobs follows a known stochastic distribution, and their actual processing time is a linear function of their start time. In order to solve it effectively, this paper develops a hybrid multiobjective optimization algorithm that maintains two populations executing the global search in the whole solution space and the local search in promising regions, respectively. An information sharing mechanism and resource allocating method are designed to enhance its exploration and exploitation ability. The simulation experiments are carried out on a set of instances, and several classical algorithms are chosen as its peers for comparison. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a great advantage in dealing with the investigated problem.},

For most of them, researchers have supposed that shared and dedicated resources never fail. As any manufacturing practitioner knows, resource failures, e.g., defective parts, faulty sensors, blurred signals, and broken actuators, are a common problem. Hence, the robust supervision and control for a system with unreliable resources is necessary. In our previous work, we proposed a robustness intensification algorithm based on a deadlock avoidance algorithm to ensure that processes not requiring unreliable resources can operate smoothly. In this article, a new robust method, which combines the advantages of absorbing policies and distributing policies with the aid of critical regions, is developed. It includes two algorithms, i.e., a robustness algorithm for processes not requiring unreliable resources and an intensification algorithm for processes requiring unreliable resources. Compared with existing absorbing and distributing policies, the new robust method can increase the production rate while decrease the algorithm complexity for a system allowing flexible routes apart from each process stage acquiring more than one type of resources.},

With recent advances in new semiconductor materials, the circuit line width has continuously being shrunk down, which brings new challenges for manufacturers. They require that a wafer should be moved away from a processing chamber as soon as possible after its processing is finished. To ensure high-quality integrated circuits in a wafer, its post-processing residency time must be minimized. It is also highly desirable to maximize the throughput of robotic cluster tools. This article aims at scheduling such tools with multiple objectives subject to wafer residency time constraints. To do so, new algorithms are proposed to calculate robot waiting time delicately upon the analysis of particular events of robot waiting for dual-blade robotic tools and optimally schedule such tools.

Based on the platforms, ubiquitous enterprises could participate in and support cross-enterprise collaboration, so that their distributed manufacturing facilities and capabilities could be shared and utilized in the form of manufacturing services (MSs). However, in order to achieve the successful application of the platforms, how to settle the supply demand matching (SDM) of the distributed manufacturing facilities and capabilities in the form of MSs, namely, MSs-SDM, becomes one of the most urgent problems to be solved. In addition, the trend of manufacturing socialization makes this problem much more scalable. In this context, this article aims to establish a set of hypernetwork-based models for the scalable MSs-SDM problem at first. An enterprises collaborative network is derived which is the projection of the underlying MSs-SDM situation to the upper-layer enterprises. Second, a method according to the evaluation on the cross-enterprise collaboration is proposed for this problem. In which, the created utilities, the rates of service invocation, and task allocation from both the global view of the overall network and the local view of each participated enterprise are evaluated.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates an energy-efficient hybrid flowshop scheduling problem with the consideration of machines with different energy usage ratios, sequence-dependent setups, and machine-to-machine transportation operations. To minimize the makespan and total energy consumption simultaneously, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed. To solve this problem, a three-stage multiobjective approach based on decomposition (TMOA/D) is suggested, in which each solution is bound with a main weight vector and a set of its neighbors. Accordingly, a variable direction strategy is developed to ensure each solution along its main direction is thoroughly exploited and can jump to the neighboring directions using a proximity principle. To ensure an active schedule of arranging jobs to machines, a two-level solution representation is employed. In the first phase, each solution attempts to improve itself along its current weight vector through a developed neighborhood-based local search. In the second phase, the promising solutions are selected through the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution. Then, they attempt to update themselves with a proposed global replacement strategy via incorporation with their closing solutions. In the third phase, a solution conducts a large perturbation when it goes through all its assigned weight vectors. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the performance of TMOA/D, and the results demonstrate that TMOA/D has a very competitive performance.},

Facing fierce competition and high uncertainty of demands, shipping service providers often take risk-averse (RA) behavior when making decisions. In addition, due to the great impact on environment and society, some logistics shipping companies start engaging in corporate social responsibility (CSR). This article investigates the competition of two RA shipping service providers with one of them committing CSR effort. The conditional-value-at-risk is used to gauge the risk attitude of two players. The aim is to determine the optimal CSR effort and pricing decisions for two players under uncertain demand (UD). The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game model and the optimal decisions are obtained analytically. The effects of key factors, such as risk attitude, competitive intensity, cost coefficient of CSR effort on the economic outcomes, and social outcomes are analyzed in great detail. Results show that it is possible that one player&#39;s CSR effort could benefit both players to achieve a win-win situation. On the other hand, it is also possible that adopting CSR activities may reduce the total social welfare of the system in some situations. This article is among the first to tackle the optimal decision problem for competing logistics shipping providers considering CSR commitment and RA behavior simultaneously. Findings in this article can offer managerial insights for logistics shipping companies and the government into decision making and policy making.},

An important application of the CCVRP arises in the procurement of humanitarian aid when natural disasters occur.

Moreover, an effective perturb-based local search (PLS) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The proposed PLS algorithm starts from having a feasible solution. Regarding the PLS, the perturbing operators help to explore the searching space, while the six local search operators help to exploit the best solution within each searching basin. To test the performance, the proposed PLS is applied to a set of standard benchmark instances and compared with the recently published algorithms. Extensive computational studies reveal that the proposed PLS algorithm is able to attain better solutions with less computational time for most testing instances, and thus competes very favorably with the previously proposed approaches. A stability analysis is also presented to shed light on the robust behavior of the proposed algorithm. The results of the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests clearly show that the algorithms (our PLS and other published methods) have performed with statistically significant differences.},

  abstract     = {Air-cargo transportation has become increasingly important for global logistics systems nowadays. However, due to the intensive market competition and diverse uncertainties arising from demand and operating costs, the pricing decisions for air-cargo carriers are extremely challenging but underexplored. Besides, many airlines are holding risk-averse attitudes in decision making in order to survive in the highly volatile and competitive market. Therefore, in this paper, we apply the mean-variance theory to characterize the risk-averse behaviors of decision makers, and analytically derive the equilibrium prices for two competing risk-averse air-cargo carriers under demand and cost uncertainties. Then, we uncover how the crucial factors, like risk sensitivity coefficients, market competition, market share, demand uncertainty, and cost uncertainty, affect the carriers’ optimal prices. In addition, important cost thresholds and relative risk-averse attitude thresholds are identified. Our analytical results demonstrate the symmetry in the optimal prices and critical thresholds for the two carriers. Besides, we reveal the importance to consider both carrier’s own and the competitor’s risk attitudes and operating characteristics in decision making when market competition exists. Moreover, we reveal the direct and indirect impacts of risk attitudes on the optimal prices, thus highlighting the importance to integrate risk considerations into the optimal pricing decision framework. Finally, we show that market situations play a critical role in characterizing the effects of diverse parameters on the equilibrium prices, which should be carefully evaluated by decision makers in air-cargo carriers.},

  abstract     = {This article discusses the problem of how to efficiently build aircraft routes that better withstand potential disruptions, such as bad weather, technical problems, and passenger delays. This optimization problem is called robust aircraft maintenance routing problem (RAMRP). There are three approaches in the literature to deal with the RAMRP, such as the buffer time allocation approach (BT), the departure retiming approach (DR), and the scenario-based stochastic programming approach (SSP). Most of the previous approaches have some shortcomings in terms of fleet productivity and delay absorption. In addition, the majority of the RAMRP models overlook maintenance regulations, which result in the generation of infeasible routes. In this article, RAMRP is investigated with two main objectives. First, a novel robustness approach, called the turn-around time reduction approach (TRTR), that avoids the shortcomings of the existing approaches, is incorporated into RAMRP. The second objective is to develop an RAMRP model that simultaneously considers all maintenance regulations. The effectiveness of the proposed RAMRP model along with the TRTR is demonstrated using real data from a major Middle Eastern airline. The results reveal an improved performance of the TRTR over the BT by about 3.43\%-12.20\% and 2.5\%-13.58\%, while handling the expected propagated delay costs and fleet productivity, respectively. In addition, the results show that the TRTR is better than the SSP by about 2.07\%-18.82\%, while minimizing the propagated delay costs. Therefore, the TRTR has a great potential to be implemented in the actual industry.},

  abstract     = {Supply chain systems are network systems with several subchains each of which consists of facilities and distribution entities (suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers), and thus such systems can be viewed as multiagent systems. Consensus or coordination of multiple subchains is crucial for a stable market supply, especially in the case of some subchains suffering from production interruption, or losing connection with others, which become isolated subchains in some time period due to irresistible reasons. Once some unspecified isolated subchains appear, the topology structure of the system will be changed, and thus the multiagent-based supply chain system can be modeled as a switched system. This paper aims to investigate the problem of H ∞ consensus for multiagent-based supply chain systems under switching topology and uncertain demands. To achieve the consensus of the system, switching controller is designed in which both production rate and distributed consensus protocol are considered. Sufficient conditions are given such that the whole system reaches consensus and desirable attenuation of bullwhip effect with an average dwell time approach, which allows some subchains to be isolated in some time periods. Finally, a simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The proper supply of end-of-life (EOL) items plays a critical role in the success of remanufacturing systems. In many real-world practices, a remanufacturer has multiple links with independent third party collectors, while these links should be simultaneously coordinated. However, most previous studies mainly focus on reverse supply chain (RSC) coordination in a one-to-one setting (single link). Moreover, the competition among third party collectors affects the acquisition of EOL products and this is an important issue. In this paper, an RSC consisting of a single remanufacturer and duopolistic competing third party collectors is explored and a new mechanism is proposed to achieve channel coordination across multiple links. To be specific, we consider the case when the collectors compete on the acquisition prices offered to the consumers and the remanufacturer decides on the pricing and environmental effort decisions with two considerations: 1) increasing return of EOL items and 2) boosting demand of remanufactured products. The optimal decisions of RSC members and performance of RSC are analyzed under different behaviors of competing collectors. Moreover, a multilateral two-part tariff contract is proposed to coordinate the decisions across multiple links. The results indicate that the proposed contract improves not only profits of the remanufacturer and competing collectors but also the collection quantity of EOL items and demand of remanufactured products, which helps improve the environment.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, governments all around the world have implemented rules and launched legislation to enhance environmental sustainability. Supply chain systems are hence operated under different forms of legislation, such as the carbon tax or extended producer responsibility tax. In this paper, we examine the newsvendor model-based supply chain systems with the consideration of all common forms of environmental taxes. We highlight how the retailer&#39;s risk attitude and the number of consumer returns affect: 1) supply chain operations; 2) performances of the environmental taxes; and 3) supply chain coordination (i.e., optimization). To be specific, we derive the optimal inventory decisions of the retailer when she is risk neutral and risk averse, respectively. We then uncover how environmental taxes and consumer returns affect the retailer&#39;s optimal inventory decisions under different risk attitudes. We further explore the supply chain coordination challenge under three different contracts, characterize their flexibility in coordinating the channel and discuss the impacts of the environmental taxes and consumer returns on each coordination mechanism. Our analytical results show that the two-part tariff contract can achieve coordination for the case with a risk neutral retailer only, while markdown sponsor (MDS) contract and revenue-sharing policy (RSP) can achieve coordination for both risk neutral or risk averse retailer cases. Besides, we reveal that the examined contracts can coordinate the supply chain with a risk neutral retailer more flexibly than that with a risk averse retailer. Finally, by comparing between the MDS contract and RSP, we find that the environmental taxes and the consumer returns will affect the coordination mechanism differently toward the risk neutral and risk averse retailers. Impacts brought by the consumer returns are also explored.},

  abstract     = {Guidewire tracking is a clinical challenge in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The current practice of image-based and sensor-based tracking techniques is still limited by radiation exposure, contrast injection, device sterilization, and procedure safety. In this paper, an interventionalist-behavior-based data fusion framework is developed to provide a novel strategy for tracking guidewire motions in PCI. Four types of natural behavior were acquired from ten interventionalists while performing guidewire translation and rotation based on a simulation platform. Different numbers of behaviors are fused by a hierarchical framework with six local tracking models and three ensemble algorithms. After Gaussian mixture regression-based ensemble fusion, a three-behavior scheme can achieve average tracking errors of 1.07 ± 0.17 mm for guidewire translation, and 20.05 ± 3.36° for guidewire rotation. Relevant statistical analysis further reveals that this scheme outperforms the cases using fewer behaviors, and ensemble fusion brings significant error reduction compared with only local fusion. These meaningful results indicate the great potential of the proposed framework for promoting the improvement of guidewire tracking in PCI.},

The overall HOSMC scheme is constituted by three portions: 1) a switch-based quasi-optimal control law that ensures rapid finite-time stabilization of the origin, producing a nominally uncertainty-free system, based on a perturbed chain of integrators; 2) a DOB which estimates the lumped uncertainties with lower frequencies; and 3) an adaptive controller designed to deal with the fast-varying terms of these lumped uncertainties over the pass-band of the DOB. Since the adaptive controller and the DOB work in a cooperative manner, the only requirement is that the switching gain be greater than the bound of the DOB estimation error, instead of the bound of the lumped uncertainties. As a consequence, overestimation in the adaptive controller can be avoided by resorting to the equivalent control. Simulation results confirm the capabilities of the proposed control strategy.},

Based on additive couplings, several sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the synchronization of chaotic stochastic delayed coupled multilayer network. More specifically, on one hand, we obtain some sufficient conditions to guarantee that the stochastic multilayer network can be synchronized almost surely without control input. On the other hand, we propose three synchronization schemes by designing controllers. Scheme I: It is assumed that only a part of the nodes are allowed to be controlled directly. Scheme II: Control all nodes of the complex system by using only one controller. Scheme III: Pinning adaptive controller.

Considering that in practical applications, the congestion of the communication channels between systems and filters may cause data loss, therefore the packet dropouts are taken into account to make the issue under consideration more general. Meanwhile, it is generally known that the mode information of the system may sometimes not be accessed, so we consider the design of a unified filter including mode-dependent and mode-independent filters simultaneously. A white sequence that obeys the Bernoulli distribution is used to express the random switching of the filters. The main purpose of this paper is to find a suitable filter design method which ensures that the resulting error system is exponentially mean-square stable and extended dissipative. Sufficient conditions are established to make sure the solvability of the addressed problem. By using appropriate decoupling method, some conditions that could be readily solved are obtained. In order to explain the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method, two illustrated examples are given in the final part of this paper.},

Within the settings of specific hierarchical priors over the missing outputs, in this paper, we derive the posterior probability distribution over the uncertain variables including the missing outputs. Given that the posterior distribution is not analytically tractable, a hybrid learning procedure is designed for combining the variational inference with a gradient-based method to obtain optimal approximate posteriors. To verify the performance of the proposed method, a number of comparative experiments are conducted and analyzed by using the datasets (including artificial and real world ones) coming with different proportions of missing outputs.

A flat semi-dormant multicontroller (FSDMC) model is established on a special type of CPS platform named arbitrated networked control system with dual communication channels. A novel, quantitative, and formal definition of anelasticity for the FSDMC is proposed. A new finite capacity M/M/c queuing system with N-policy and asynchronous multiple working vacations of partial servers is established, and the FSDMC is modeled as a quasi-birth-and-death process to obtain the stationary probability distribution of the system. Based on the queueing model, we quantify various performance indices of the system to build a nonlinear cost-performance ratio (CPR) function. An optimization model is presented to minimize the CPR. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to find the optimum solution of the optimization model and obtain the optimal configuration values of the system parameters under stability condition. By changing the system parameters, the sensitivity of the system performance indices and the CPR are analyzed, respectively. The unexpected workload varies randomly over time. Thus, an M/M/1/K queue is constructed in a Markovian environment by employing a three-state, irreducible Markov process. In this queue, the conditional average queue length and the probabilities of the three-state process are calculated. Then, the anelasticity value of the system is precisely determined. When the average arrival rate exceeds the average service rate in the queueing system, an optimal CPR unchanged adaptive algorithm based on PSO is designed to dynamically adjust the controller service rate. Extensive numerical results show the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed techniques and exhibit that the system can maintain elastic invariance in adaptive adjustment parameters.},

Then, a hybrid multiobjective memetic algorithm is proposed for solving multiobjective PVRPTW. In the proposed algorithm, a two-phase strategy is devised to improve the comprehensive performance in terms of the convergence and diversity. In this strategy, several extreme solutions near an approximate Pareto front (PF) are identified at Phase I, and then the approximate PF is extended at Phase II. The proposed algorithm is extensively tested on both real-world instances and traditional instances. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two representative competitor algorithms on most of the instances. The effectiveness of the two-phase strategy is also confirmed.},

The concentration of this paper lies in deriving the design conditions for the desired resilient filter such that the filtering error system preserves asymptotic stability as well as the L ∞ -norm of the transfer function from the external disturbance input to the filtering error output is below a specified bound. The filter design conditions for guaranteeing the prescribed peak-to-peak performance of the filtering error system are provided by a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a simulation result is presented to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed filtering design for the parameter-controlled tunnel diode circuit.},

  abstract     = {In the normal image thresholding methods based on two-dimensional histogram, the edge information of the regions is not maintained because of the local averaging activity used. Moreover, the computation time increases with the increase in the level of thresholds. This paper focusses on retaining more edge information by calculating the image entropy along the diagonal regions of the gray level co-occurrence matrix inspired from the partitioned design structure matrix, which is a novel idea. In addition, the key to our success is the theoretical investigation of a novel diagonal class entropy (DCE) concept that utilizes the minimum area for computation. The benefits of the proposed method are: 1) improved results; 2) efficient to preserve more precise shape of the edges; and 3) the computation time decreases with the increase in the threshold levels. The optimal thresholds are obtained by minimizing the DCE using coral reef optimization (CRO). A first hand fitness function for multilevel image thresholding is derived. The fight for space and the efficient reproduction characteristics of the CRO makes it attractive for this application. Benchmark images from the Berkley segmentation dataset are taken to experiment. Our results are compared with other state-of-the-art thresholding methods. The results obtained are encouraging and may set the path for further investigation in the domain of multilevel thresholding.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a continuous-time multiagent system is proposed for solving optimal resource allocation problems with local allocation feasible constraints. In the system, all the primal agents are divided into different groups. We use dual variables which describe the dual agents to represent the groups of the original agents. The groups of dual agents are used to communicate with others on behalf of the primal agents to reduce communication costs. That is to say, primal agents aim to seek their own optimal solutions by using local information. And dual agents represent primal agents to communicate with other agents in different groups by using the whole group information. The two kinds of agents cooperate to find the optimal solution of the problem. In this way, we only need to know the connections of dual agents to design the multiagent network, and do not need to consider the connections of the primal agents. So the communication cost and the amount of variables will be largely reduced especially for large-scale problem. Furthermore, it is proved that the multiagent system can reach consensus with respect to the dual variables. At the same time, the primal variables are convergent to the optimal solutions of the optimization problem under some certain assumptions on the communication network. For large-scale problem if we take the groups as areas, then the system is suitable for multiarea problem. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed multiagent system.},

  abstract     = {In recent years there has been a noticeable increase in the number of available Big Data infrastructures. This fact has promoted the adaptation of traditional machine learning techniques to be capable of addressing large scale problems in distributed environments. Kernel methods like support vector machines (SVMs) suffer from scalability problems due to their nonparametric nature and the complexity of their training procedures. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient distributed implementation of a training procedure for nonlinear semiparametric (budgeted) SVMs called distributed iterative reweighted least squares (IRWLS). This algorithm uses k-means to select the centroids of the semiparametric model and a new distributed algorithmic implementation of the IRWLS optimization procedure to find the weights of the model. We have implemented the proposed algorithm in Apache Spark and we have benchmarked it against other state-of-the-art methods, either full SVM (p-pack SVM) or budgeted (budgeted stochastic gradient descent). Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy while controlling the size of the final model, and also offers high performance in terms of run time and efficiency, when processing very large datasets (the computation time grows linear with the number of training patterns).},

Based on the equivalency, a continuous ZNN model is proposed to solve the continuous DLDLS. For easier hardware realization, a new Zhang et al. discretization formula with high precision is proposed for the continuous ZNN model discretization, and the corresponding new discrete ZNN (NDZNN) model is proposed to solve discrete DLDLS. Note that the NDZNN model satisfies the requirement of real-time computation because it has the online ability to predict the solution for the future instant. Furthermore, the problems of robot manipulator control with additional restrictions (e.g., joint damage) are formulated as specific discrete DLDLS, and the proposed NDZNN model is employed to solve such problems. Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of NDZNN model.},

And the covariance intersection (CI) fusion rule is an effective tool to tackle with this phenomena. During the recent years, the related CI-based Kalman consensus filters (CIKCFs) have been adopted to deal with unknown correlations in sensor networks. However, a systematic stability analysis result for the general CIKCF in the time-varying system setting remains to be established. This paper is written for this purpose. First, a general CIKCF with full features of CI is presented. Accordingly, the conditions for CIKCF to reach consensus with varying weights are investigated. Furthermore, a novel detectability condition, i.e., collectively uniform detectability , is proposed to ensure the error covariances of the CIKCF are uniformly bounded. Based on this condition, the estimation errors are further proven to be exponentially bounded in mean square with the aid of the stochastic stability lemma .

Based on the well-known sufficient condition that the contact between the ground and the support leg is stable if the corresponding ZMP is always inside the supporting region, this paper aims at characterizing three types of the associated stability regions. More precisely, assuming no external force disturbances affecting the motion of the humanoids, the stability region of the initial CoM position and velocity values can be explicitly computed by solving a finite number of linear inequalities. The stability regions of time-invariant force disturbances such as impulsive force and constant force disturbances are also dealt with in this paper, where the former is exactly obtained through a finite number of linear inequalities while the latter is approximately derived by using an idea of truncation. Furthermore, time-varying force disturbances of finite energy and finite amplitude are concerned with, and their maximum admissible ${l} _{2}$ and ${l} _{\infty }$ norms are computed in this paper, where the former can be exactly obtained by solving the discrete-time Lyapunov equation while the latter is approximately derived through an idea of truncation. It is further shown for both the truncation ideas that the approximately obtained stability regions converge to the exact stability regions with an exponential order of ${N}$ , where ${N}$ is the truncation parameter.

The aim of this paper is to improve the performance of the conventional CSP method, which will be badly influenced by noises. The recently proposed quantized minimum error entropy (QMEE) criterion is applied to structure a new objective function instead of the L 2 -norm in the conventional CSP. Quantization is utilized to reduce the computational complexity. The new objective function is optimized by a gradient-based iterative algorithm. The desirable performance of the QMEE-based CSP method, namely CSP-QMEE, is demonstrated with a toy example and two real EEG datasets, including Dataset IIb of the brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) Competition IV (three channels) and Dataset IIIa of the BCI Competition III (60 channels). The new method can achieve satisfactory performance compared to existing methods on all datasets. The promising results in this paper suggest that the CSP-QMEE may become a powerful tool for BCIs.},

Moreover, an observer involving the quantized output signal and the saturated input signal is designed to reconstruct the unknown states. Then an adaptive output feedback tracking control strategy is developed for this class of systems, so that the system output follows satisfactorily a desired reference signal in finite time while all signals in the closed-loop systems are semi-global practical finite-time stable. Finally, two illustrative simulation examples are provided to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel method for supply chain network (SCN) design under uncertainty that jointly solves the candidate selection, the order allocation, and the transportation mode selection problems. In the proposed method, four steps are executed in cascade. First, a cross-efficiency fuzzy data envelopment analysis technique ranks the candidates of each SCN stage in a multiobjective perspective and under uncertain data. Second, a fuzzy linear integer programming model determines the supplies required from each actor by those belonging to the subsequent SCN stage. This step determines the best compromise between candidates&#39; efficiencies, estimated costs, and delivery time, considering stock levels and uncertain capacity of actors, while satisfying customers&#39; uncertain demand. The third step evaluates the efficiency of the transportation alternatives under uncertain data to optimally plan the transport chain. Finally, the fourth step measures the performance of the designed SCN. The method provides as a result an integrated, agile, and resource-efficient design of the SCN under uncertainty. Its application to a case study shows it is effective in selecting the SCN partners, assigning the corresponding order quantities, and delivering them to customers. Validation is obtained by comparison with well-known approaches and statistical analysis.},

The assumption of graphs that maps social interactions provides a useful approach for studying the dynamics in gaming systems, where its theoretical analysis is drop behind simulations. Here we perform analysis on game dynamics in a spatially distributed system situating on multiple-community networks. In the context of the three paradigmatic game prototypes (dominating games, coexistence games, and the coordination games), the stability of the equilibrium state emerging from this is provided. Further investigation on multicommunity system reveals that the community structure plays a key role in the stability of the strategy evolution. Besides, our explorations toward the multiple strategies adopted by the population whose interactions include n communities, certify that the payoff is crucial for individuals&#39; dominating superiority over others in the system. The results are expected to provide effective perspective to control the individual choice in large systems, and lend itself to multiple applications in control engineering perspective.},

  abstract     = {Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm that has been widely used for solving many real-world optimization problems. However, traditional GP can only solve a single task in one independent run, which is inefficient in cases where multiple tasks need to be solved at the same time. Recently, multifactorial optimization (MFO) has been proposed as a new evolutionary paradigm toward evolutionary multitasking. It intends to conduct evolutionary search on multiple tasks in one independent run. To enable multitasking GP, in this paper, we propose a novel multifactorial GP (MFGP) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to conduct multitasking GP using a single population. The proposed MFGP consists of a novel scalable chromosome encoding scheme which is capable of representing multiple solutions simultaneously, and new evolutionary mechanisms for MFO based on self-learning gene expression programming. Further, comprehensive experimental studies are conducted on multitask scenarios consisting of commonly used GP benchmark problems and real world applications. The obtained empirical results confirmed the efficacy of the proposed MFGP.},

We capture this problem through a dynamic game model in which each firm can endogenously choose its advertising strategy. Our results reveal a number of interesting findings. We show that the two firms would not choose mass advertising simultaneously but might adopt targeted advertising at the same time. Targeted advertising can hurt both firms even if it is more cost-efficient than mass advertising: when the marginal cost of advertising is moderate, the two firms may fall into the well-known trap of the prisoners&#39; dilemma. In another interesting finding, symmetric firms may employ asymmetric advertising strategies in equilibrium: when the advertising cost is sufficiently low, one firm chooses targeted advertising, while the other adopts mass advertising. In addition, while a fixed cost associated with acquiring the targeting capability weakens firms&#39; incentives to adopt targeted advertising, a large fixed cost might benefit firms in equilibrium.},

It is shown that the switching threshold plays an important role in increasing the number of stable equilibria and different multistability results can be obtained under different ranges of switching threshold. The results suggest that switched recurrent neural networks would be superior to conventional ones in terms of increased storage capacity when used as associative memories.

Different from previous slack variable methods, an advanced slack variable method without limitations is proposed for further making good use of available fuzzy weighting functions. Owing to the introduction of extended representations for homogenous polynomials, those strong limitations in recent literature are relaxed and thus the primary and secondary sequences of all normalized fuzzy weighting functions can be mapped to one augmented multi-indexed matrix for each homogeneous polynomial. Therefore, less conservative stabilization conditions can be provided as a result of these effective measures and thus a part of the online computational cost is transferred to the offline implementation. Finally, the benefits of the proposed method are illustrated by means of numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer (SMDO)-based robust backstepping cruise tracking control scheme with closed-loop finite-time convergence for flexible air-breathing hypersonic vehicles (FAHVs). In order to enhance the control system&#39;s robustness, a fixed-time SMDO is designed to compensate for the flexibility effects, model uncertainties, and external disturbances in FAHVs. In consequence, fixed convergence time of disturbance observation is achieved independently of initial estimation errors. Furthermore, velocity and altitude continuous finite-time tracking controllers are constructed by incorporating the SMDO and nonsmooth backstepping technique. To solve the problem of “explosion of complexity” in the conventional backstepping approach, nonsmooth filters are specifically constructed to generate the derivatives of virtual control laws. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is conducted to show the finite-time convergence of the closed-loop FAHV control system. Finally, several representative numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Matrix inversion ubiquitously arises in engineering. The so-called zeroing neural network (ZNN) is an effective recurrent neural network for solving time-variant matrix inversion. Without considering noises, the ZNN approach requires finite time or infinitely long time to converge to the exact solution. When perturbed by additive noises, the existing ZNN models exhibit limited ability to reject disturbances and are susceptible to be divergent. For instance, under time-variant bounded noises, steady-state residual errors of the existing ZNNs would be bounded. To make the steady-state residual errors arbitrarily small, infinitely long time is required and related design parameters must be set large enough or infinitely large, which is not realistic in practice. To overcome this situation, this paper for the first time systematically designs and analyses a finite-time convergent and noise-tolerant ZNN (FTNTZNN) that is capable of completely converging to the theoretical solution in finite time even under various types of noises. Theoretically, the finite-time convergence and disturbance-rejection properties of the FTNTZNN are rigorously proved. Comparative numerical results substantiate that the FTNTZNN model delivers superior convergence and robustness performance in solving time-variant matrix inversion and kinematic control of a robotic arm as compared with the existing ZNN models. The FTNTZNN model expands the current knowledge for designing neural-dynamic systems to solve matrix inversion, which can provide inspiration for other problems solving under noises.},

Besides, an efficient algorithm is designed to solve the portfolio optimization objective, which is applicable to large-scale and time-limited situations. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from real financial markets with diverse assets and different time spans are conducted.

The outlier mining module detects outliers from high-dimensional categorical datasets.

This paper proposes an optimization strategy for multirobot task allocation (MRTA) problems and makes efforts on offering multiple solutions with same or similar quality for switching and selection. Since the mentioned problem can be regarded as a multimodal optimization one, this paper presents a niching immune-based optimization algorithm based on Softmax regression (sNIOA) to handle it. A prejudgment of population is done before entering an evaluation process to reduce the evaluation time and to avoid unnecessary computation. Furthermore, a guiding mutation (GM) operator inspired by the base pair in theory of gene mutation is introduced into sNIOA to strengthen its search ability. When a certain gene mutates, the others in the same gene group are more likely to mutate with a higher probability. Experimental results show the improvement of sNIOA on the aspect of accelerating computation speed with comparison to other heuristic algorithms. They also show the effectiveness of the proposed GM operator by comparing sNIOA with and without it. Two MRTA application cases are tested finally.},

To achieve the mission, we develop a control law to make the USV approach the designated point (e.g., stern, left side, or right side, etc.) of the target as fast as possible. Once the USV reaches the designated point of the target, the USV checks whether the speed of the USV is fast enough to circle around the target. In the case where the circling maneuver is not feasible, the USV keeps following the designated point of the target. Once the USV determines that the circling maneuver is feasible, then we make the USV circle around the target for close monitoring, while maintaining a designated distance from the target.

  abstract     = {Cluster analysis is a data mining technique that has been widely used to exploit useful information in a great amount of data. Because of their evaluation mechanism based on an intracluster distance (ICD) function, traditional single-objective clustering algorithms are not appropriate for not-well-separated data. Specifically, they may easily result in the drop of the optimal solution accuracy on their late stages of search when dealing with the latter. To overcome the problem, in this paper a novel index reflecting the similarity of data within a cluster is presented and called intracluster cohesion (ICC). However, if a multiobjective method is used to cluster with ICD and ICC as the specified objectives, its clustering accuracy may depend on one&#39;s experience. Motivated by these, we propose an accelerated two-stage particle swarm optimization (ATPSO) in which K-means is utilized to accelerate particles&#39; convergence during the population initialization. Its clustering process consists of two stages. First, the main objective of minimizing ICD is to execute preliminary clustering; second, ICC is optimized to promote the clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments with the help of 17 open-source clustering sets in various geometric distributions are conducted. The results show that ATPSO outperforms PSO, K -means PSO (KPSO), chaotic PSO (CPSO), and accelerated CPSO in terms of accuracy, and its efficiency is approximate to that of KPSO. Its convergence trend indicates that the adoption of the proposed ICC contributes to the clustering accuracy. Remarkably, compared with the Pareto-based multiobjective PSO, ATPSO can detect clusters more accurately and quickly through the proposed two-stage search.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the deployment problem of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with mobile robotic sensor nodes for spatiotemporal monitoring. The proposed approach, deep reinforced learning tree (DRLT), utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve the efficiency of searching the most informative sampling locations. The parameterized sampling locations in an infinite horizon space are modeled according to their spatiotemporal correlations and subject to various constraints, including field estimation error and information gain. And the model-based information gain can be calculated efficiently over an infinite horizon. In this manner, the effectiveness of the sampling locations is learned through DRLT during the exploration by the robotic sensors. Then DRLT can instruct the robotic sensors to avoid unnecessary sampling locations in future iterations. Also, it is proved in this paper that the proposed algorithm is capable of searching for the near-optimal sampling locations effectively and guaranteeing a minimum field estimation error. Simulation based on national oceanic and atmospheric administration (NOAA) datasets is presented, which demonstrates the significant enhancements made by the proposed algorithm. Compared with the traditional approaches, such as the information theory-based greedy approach or random sampling, the proposed method shows a superior performance with regard to both estimation error and planning efficiency.},

  abstract     = {With the exponential growth of data and the high demand for the analysis of large datasets, the MapReduce framework has been widely utilized to process data in a timely, cost-effective manner. It is well-known that the performance of MapReduce is limited by its default configuration parameters, and there are a few research studies that have focused on finding the optimal configurations to improve the performance of the MapReduce framework. Recently, machine learning based approaches have been receiving more attention to be utilized to auto configure the MapReduce parameters to account for the dynamic nature of the applications. In this article, we propose and develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheme, named RL-MRCONF, to automatically configure the MapReduce parameters. Specifically, we explore and experiment with two variations of RL-MRCONF; one variation is based on the traditional RL algorithm and the second is based on the deep RL algorithm. Results obtained from simulations show that the RL-MRCONF has the ability to successfully and effectively auto-configure the MapReduce parameters dynamically according to changes in job types and computing resources. Moreover, simulation results show our proposed RL-MRCONF scheme outperforms the traditional RL-based implementation. Using datasets provided by MR-Perf, simulation results show that our proposed scheme provides around 50\% performance improvement in terms of execution time when compared with MapReduce using default settings.},

The main advantage of the switching-based formulation is its capability to determine both “when”&#39; to switch and “which” mode to switch on without the need to use the cycle-based average flow approximation typical of state-of-the-art formulations. In addition, the framework can handle different cycle times across intersections without the need for synchronization constraints and, moreover, minimum dwell-time constraints can be directly enforced to comply with minimum green/red times in each phase.

Initially, the GCC design is shown to be equivalent to an H ∞ state feedback control problem subject to a specific disturbance attenuation performance requirement. Then such an H ∞ control problem is regarded as a zero-sum game and reduces to seek the stabilizing solution of a parameterized algebraic Riccati equation (ARE). Furthermore, to solve the ARE approximately, a modified simultaneous policy update algorithm (SPUA) and the corresponding data-driven variant based on off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) and experience replay technique is proposed.

For the purpose of handling the problem of actuator faults and obtaining the event-driven approximate optimal guaranteed cost control approach for general nonlinear dynamics, the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is utilized to develop a sliding-mode control (SMC) strategy. To begin with, the unknown faults can be estimated by designing a fault observer. Meanwhile, an SMC technique is presented aiming at countering the effect of abrupt faults. In addition, the optimal performance of the equivalent sliding mode dynamics is considered, then an event-driven guaranteed cost control mechanism is implemented by using RL principle. In the control process, a general cost function, which has a simpler structure, is given to reduce the computation complexity. At the same time, a modified cost function is approximated to obtain optimal guaranteed cost control by using a single critic neural network (NN). In addition, a modified weight update law for critic NN is presented to relax the persistence of excitation (PE) condition. Moreover, a newly triggering condition, which is easy to be implemented, is designed, and the critic NN update law makes sure that the system states are stable. Furthermore, in light of the Lyapunov analysis, it is demonstrated that the developed event-driven control method guarantees the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) property of all the signals. Finally, three simulation results are given to validate the designed control method.},

First, a local Q-function is defined, which considers the local consensus error and the actions of the agent and its neighbors. Using the Q-function, it is convenient to get the derivatives with regard to the weights of the consensus control policies, even without the model of system dynamics. Then, with the defined local Q-function, a distributed policy iteration technique is developed, which is theoretically proved to be convergent to the solutions of the coupled HJB equations. An actor-critic neural network framework for implementing the developed model-free optimal consensus control method is constructed to approximate the local Q-functions and the control policies.

The existence conditions of a solution to the GARE are proposed and a lower bound is found for the discount factor to assure the stability of the H ∞ tracking control solution. The Q-function Bellman equation is then derived, based on which the reinforcement Q-learning algorithm is developed to learn the solution to H ∞ tracking control problem without knowing the system dynamics.

By transforming the unmatched uncertain term, the auxiliary system associated with the uncertain nonlinear system is established. The auxiliary system is divided into steady and transient parts, and the related controllers are separately solved, meanwhile the transient tracking error system is also obtained by introducing the reference system. A neural network-based adaptive dynamic programming method is used to get the approximately optimal tracking control law of uncertain nonlinear systems with a predefined cost function. Furthermore, the ultimately uniform boundedness of neural network weights and the stability of tracking error systems are both proved through Lyapunov theory. Two cases of nonlinear systems with unmatched uncertainties are investigated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust tracking control strategy.},

To begin with, we show that the decentralized ETC policy for the whole system can be represented by a group of optimal ETC laws of auxiliary subsystems. Then, under the framework of adaptive critic learning, we construct the critic networks to solve the event-triggered Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations related to these optimal ETC laws. The weight vectors used in the critic networks are updated by using the gradient descent approach and the experience replay (ER) technique together. With the aid of the ER technique, we can conquer the difficulty arising in the persistence of excitation condition. Meanwhile, by using classic Lyapunov approaches, we prove that the estimated weight vectors used in the critic networks are uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, we demonstrate that the obtained decentralized ETC can force the overall system to be asymptotically stable. Finally, we present an interconnected nonlinear plant to validate the proposed decentralized ETC scheme.},

The goal of the output regulation is to design a control law that can make the system achieve asymptotic stability of the tracking error while maintaining the stability of the closed-loop system. The solvability of the output regulation problem depends on the solvability of a set of matrix equations called the regulator equations. First, a restructured dynamic system is established by using the Smith predictor; then, an off-policy algorithm based on reinforcement learning is developed to calculate the feedback gain using only the measured data when dropout occurs. Based on the solution to the feedback gain, a model-free solution is provided for solving the forward gain using the regulator equations. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for discrete-time networked systems with unknown dynamics and dropout.},

We propose an efficient ℓ 1 -regularized recursive least squares-based online algorithm with O(n 2 ) complexity per time-step, termed ℓ 1 -RC. With the help of nested optimization decomposition, ℓ 1 -RC solves a series of standard optimization problems and avoids minimizing mean squares projected Bellman error with ℓ 1 -regularization directly. In ℓ 1 -RC, we propose RC with iterative refinement to minimize the operator error, and we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers with proximal operator to minimize the fixed-point error. The convergence of ℓ 1 -RC is established based on ordinary differential equation method and some extensions are also given. In empirical computations, some state-of-the-art ℓ 1 -regularized methods are chosen as the baselines, and ℓ 1 -RC are tested in both policy evaluation and learning control benchmarks.

In fact, we have to face the problem that the errors will disturb the dynamics and in turn identifying dynamics will generate errors. In order to prevent the effect of errors, in this paper, a single NN-based online PI algorithm is developed for the CT system, which is disturbed nonlinear ZSG. With plenty of online data, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation can be solved without complete dynamics. Then by the least-squares method, we can obtain the NN weights. Moreover, in the process of dealing with the undisturbed system, we find the way that obtains NN weights in this paper is equal to the way that obtains the optimal solution by the Gauss-Newton method. Based on the convergence of the Gauss-Newton method, we can efficiently obtain the optimal controller for the undisturbed system by utilizing online data. After getting the controller of the undisturbed system, it is time to take disturbance into consideration, so that we design a robust control pair to overcome the disturbance. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm, we design a set of simulations. The results verify that we can solve the disturbed nonlinear ZSG by this algorithm.},

Then, the VI method is proposed to solve the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation initialized with an arbitrary positive semi-definite value function. Compared with most existing works developed based on policy iteration, the initial admissible control policy is no longer required which results in a more free initial condition. The iterative process of the proposed VI method is analyzed and the convergence to the saddle point solution is proved in a general way. For the implementation of the proposed method, only one neural network is introduced to approximate the iterative value function, which results in a simpler architecture with less computational load compared with utilizing three neural networks.

Throughout this paper, the augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and the free-matrix-based integral inequality are used to realize less conservativeness. On the basis of these techniques, a less conservative criterion is first given. Then, by decomposing singular time-delay systems into differential equations and algebraic ones, state vectors of the systems are divided into two parts. To reduce redundant decision variables, each part of the state vectors is considered independently to construct a special augmented LKF with less decision variables. As a result, an improved criterion is deduced, and thus less conservativeness and less computational demand are achieved at the same time. Moreover, the presented state decomposition method provides a new research idea for singular time-delay systems not yet reported in the literatures. Finally, the above statements are demonstrated by a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {This paper concentrates on the issue of ${H} _{\infty}$ reliable bumpless transfer control for a category of switched systems (SSs) with state and rate constraints. The ${H} _{\infty}$ reliable bumpless transfer control problem refers to designing a collection of reliable controllers and a switching rule to ensure the SSs to satisfy the bumpless transfer performance and ${H} _{\infty}$ reliable property. First, a concept of the bumpless transfer performance for a system in this category with possible actuator faults is introduced. Then, by a multiple Lyapunov functions approach, a switching rule and a set of reliable controllers are co-designed to assess the disturbance tolerance capability with bumpless transfer performance and to solve the ${H} _{\infty}$ reliable bumpless transfer control problem of the system. Second, a criterion guaranteeing the bumpless transfer performance and ${H} _{\infty}$ reliable property of the system is established. The criterion allows each subsystem not to possess both the bumpless transfer performance and ${H} _{\infty}$ reliable property. Further, an algorithm is proposed to estimate the attraction domain of the system without disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented control scheme is verified by an example of controlling a turbofan model.},

  abstract     = {Rapid advancement in micro-electromechanical techniques leads to the wide application of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In a linear WSN (LWSN), all sensor nodes are arranged in a straight line to monitor health status of some linear infrastructure structure such as bridges, highways, pipelines, etc. To enhance reliability of the infrastructure monitoring services, LWSNs are often designed to incorporate a limited number of backbone nodes for transferring or relaying information, leading to a more complex hybrid structure. In this paper, a multivalued decision diagram (MDD)-based analytical approach is proposed to evaluate performance of an LWSN system with backbone nodes. Particularly, we model and analyze the probability that the hybrid LWSN performs at a particular performance level, which is characterized by the number of sensor nodes being able to reach the base station. A single compact MDD model is constructed by sharing all isomorphic submodel structures involved in different performance levels. The MDD model, once being constructed, can be reused for evaluation using different failure time distributions or mission time. A case study is presented to substantiate the application of the proposed MDD approach for developing the optimal backbone node allocation strategy to guarantee the reliability requirement on the infrastructure monitoring services.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous decision making is a critical and difficult task for intelligent vehicles in dynamic transportation environments. In this paper, a reinforcement learning approach with value function approximation and feature learning is proposed for autonomous decision making of intelligent vehicles on highways. In the proposed approach, the sequential decision making problem for lane changing and overtaking is modeled as a Markov decision process with multiple goals, including safety, speediness, smoothness, etc. In order to learn optimized policies for autonomous decision-making, a multiobjective approximate policy iteration (MO-API) algorithm is presented. The features for value function approximation are learned in a data-driven way, where sparse kernel-based features or manifold-based features can be constructed based on data samples. Compared with previous RL algorithms such as multiobjective Q-learning, the MO-API approach uses data-driven feature representation for value and policy approximation so that better learning efficiency can be achieved. A highway simulation environment using a 14 degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model was established to generate training data and test the performance of different decision-making methods for intelligent vehicles on highways. The results illustrate the advantages of the proposed MO-API method under different traffic conditions. Furthermore, we also tested the learned decision policy on a real autonomous vehicle to implement overtaking decision and control under normal traffic on highways. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The real-time data generated from various smart devices will be released and shared for public to obtain numerous benefits. However, it will lead to individual privacy leakage because of data mining or analysis. Currently, many existing privacy protection models either fail to be directly applied in real-time data release or are unsatisfactory in terms of data utility and privacy protection. Toward this end, based on m-signature and fuzzy processing, an anonymous privacy protection model, named PMF, is proposed in this paper. Specifically, for the proposed model there are five advantages: 1) PMF defines m-signature for making each bucket with at least m different sensitive values instead of generating any counterfeit tuples, which can not only resist h-difference attack but also improve practical value; 2) the buckets satisfying m-signature are variable over time, and this flexibility of m-signature can improve the efficiency of dynamic update; 3) PMF can effectively insert, delete, and modify real-time data for release; 4) PMF applies fuzzy processing to handle the tuples in the candidate list, which strikes a good balance between the utility of released data and privacy protection; and 5) PMF adopts greedy heuristic algorithm to process update operations, which greatly reduces the information loss of released data. Furthermore, PMF is obviously more secure than the existing models in the real-time data release. Finally, the results of the comparison experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets illustrate that PMF is superior to the existing models in terms of data utility and efficiency.},

In this paper, with consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a risk-based multistep dynamic decision-making approach for protecting ICSs is proposed. Following this proposal, multiple models, including multilayer Bayesian network, process model, and attack-defense strategy model are built first. On this basis, a state controller is designed to ensure the safe degradation/upgradation of ICSs. Finally, a game theory-based optimal defense strategy generation approach is presented. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation on a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that the proposed dynamic decision-making approach has the ability to generate the optimal defense strategy to minimize system loss.},

The proposed algorithm selects a best-subset of designs expected to optimize the system performance from a finite set of alternatives. Furthermore, the algorithm identifies the ranking of designs within the subset. To maximize the accuracy of the selection under limited simulation resources, the algorithm selectively and gradually increases the precision of the sample mean of each design by allocating the resources heuristically based on the evaluated uncertainty. The selected subset allows decision makers to efficiently choose the best design that optimizes the performance while satisfying the qualitative criteria. We exhibit various experimental results, including a practical case study, to empirically demonstrate the efficiency and high noise robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

In the traditional opinion model, however, each node is affected by all other nodes, including its friends. Furthermore, many traditional opinion evolution approaches are reviewed to see if all nodes (participants) can eventually reach a consensus. On the contrary, OOD is more focused on such details as concluding the overall trend of events and evaluating the support level of each participant through numerical simulation. Experiments show that OOD is superior to the improvement of the original Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model, HK-13 and HK-17, with respect to qualitative predictions of the evolution trend of an event. The quantitative predictions of the HK model cannot be used to make decisions, whereas the results of the OOD model are proved to be acceptable.},

Previous work on popularity prediction has focused on predicting the popularity volume of online contents, and at most, popularity burst and ignored the exploration of popularity evolution and the prediction of its stages. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose our method for the popularity stage prediction problem both at the microscopic level and macroscopic level. At the microscopic level, we first extract multiple dynamic factors and infer future evolution stage by considering the contributions of different dynamic factors. At the macroscopic level, we extract the overall evolution patterns of popularity stages and adopt a pattern matching-based method to predict future popularity stages. We evaluate the proposed approach using tweets in SinaWeibo, the most popular Twitter-like social media platform in China. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach in predicting popularity evolution stages.},

Social recommendation models utilize social information to reveal the impact of neighbors on user preferences, and this impact is often described by the linear superposition of neighbor preferences or by global trust propagation. Further exploration needs to be undertaken to determine whether the influence pattern of other users from online interaction behaviors is adequately described. In this paper, we introduce evolutionary opinion dynamics from the field of statistical physics into recommender systems, characterizing the impact of other users. We propose an opinion dynamic model by evolutionary game theory. To describe online user interactions, we define the strategies during an interaction between two users, and present the payoff for each strategy in terms of errors of estimated ratings. Therefore, user behaviors are associated with their preferences and ratings. In addition, we measure user influence according to their topological roles in the social network. We incorporate evolutionary opinion dynamics and user influence into the recommendation framework for the prediction of unknown ratings. Experiment results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of the-art models in terms of accuracy, and it also performs well for cold-start users. Our method reduces the divergence of user preferences, in accordance with online opinion interactions. Furthermore, our method has approximate computational complexity with matrix factorization, and results in less computation than state-of-the-art models. Our method is quite general, and indicates that studies in social physics, statistics, and other research fields may be involved in recommendation to improve the performance.},

The observer and controller gains are then obtained by means of an iterative linear matrix inequality procedure. A numerical simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed control design approach.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rapid technology advancement and market changes, products are becoming outdated and subsequently discarded faster than ever before. Recovery, recycling, and remanufacturing of end-of-life (EOL) products are getting more attention. Disassembly is indispensable to recycle and remanufacture EOL products, and a disassembly line is an efficient way to perform it. A disassembly line balancing problem (DLBP) aims at streamlining the disassembly activities such that the total disassembly time consumed at each workstation is approximately the same and approaching the cycle time. However, the assignment of disassembly operations to workstations in a disassembly shop should ensure the recovery of valuable components and reduce undesirable impact on the environment as much as possible. In this paper, a novel heuristic technique combining multicriterion decision making (MCDM) and general variable neighborhood search (GVNS) is proposed to solve the DLBP. Based on the characteristics of the DLBP, an innovative MCDM method based on fuzzy set theory, grey relational analysis, and Choquet fuzzy integral is developed to evaluate the performance scores and determine the ranking of disassembly tasks. Subsequently, an improved GVNS algorithm is employed to further balance a disassembly line with three objectives, in which a new metric is formulated to integrate with the ranking from MCDM. The proposed method not only takes a comprehensive objective system into consideration but effectively generates a good enough tradeoff disassembly solution. Finally, the proposed approach is illustrated with an example and compared with two other heuristics to show its efficacy in solving the DLBP.},

For that we propose the use of the maximin decision rule within the GMCR. More specifically, we consider a GMCR with two DMs and introduce the concept of Maximin h stability with horizon h for a given DM. The Maximin h stability concept was inspired by the notion of limited-move stability with horizon h present in the GMCR literature and it is adequate for modeling cautious DMs in conflicts where they have no knowledge about the other DM&#39;s preferences. We establish what is the relationship among the Maximin h stabilities for different horizons and the relationship among Maximin h stability and other GMCR stability concepts. Finally, we present an application to illustrate the proposed stability concept, namely, a neuroscience technological selection conflict in China.},

  abstract     = {To be able to describe more complex fuzzy uncertainty information effectively, the concept of q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) was first proposed by Yager. The q-ROFSs can dynamically adjust the range of indication of decision information by changing a parameter q based on the different hesitation degree from the decision-makers, where q ≥ 1, so they outperform the traditional intuitionistic fuzzy sets and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. In real decision-making problems, there is often an interaction phenomenon between attributes. For aggregating these complex fuzzy information, the Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) operator is more superior by considering interrelationships among attributes. In addition, the power average (PA) operator can reduce the effects of extreme evaluating data from some experts with prejudice. In this paper, we introduce the PA operator and the MSM operator based on q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs). Then, we put forward the q-rung orthopair fuzzy power MSM (q-ROFPMSM) operator and the q-rung orthopair fuzzy power weighed MSM (q-ROFPWMSM) operator of q-ROFNs and present some of their properties. Finally, we present a novel multiple-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method based on the q-ROFPWA and the q-ROFPWMSM operators. The experimental results show that the novel MAGDM method outperforms the existing MAGDM methods for dealing with MAGDM problems.},

The goal is to acquire ideal and satisfactory methods to set up the evaluation criteria for the role negotiation task. The main contributions of this paper include: 1) a method of generating the matrix of agent qualifications, with a discrete, usually, limited, and finite set of prespecified attributes and values; 2) the upper and lower thresholds of a role&#39;s ability requirements, which are critical parameters for a workable team and its performance; and 3) the potential influences of specialist agents and generalist agents on the group performance.

The learning algorithm is developed based on the deterministic policy gradient algorithm. By introducing an integral compensator to the actor-critic structure, the tracking accuracy and robustness have been greatly enhanced. Moreover, a two-phase learning protocol which includes both offline and online learning phase is proposed for practical implementation. An offline policy is first learned based on a simplified quadrotor model. Then, the policy is online optimized in actual flight. The proposed approach is evaluated in the flight simulator. The results demonstrate that the offline learned policy is highly robust to model errors and external disturbances. It also shows that the online learning could significantly improve the control performance.},

We take advantage of the SOM clustering and topology preservation in the perturbation detection. Swinging and recovery actions are generated from the same neural model using a multilayered multipattern central pattern generator.

To address them, this paper proposes an approach to support emergency resource management including both intraorganization private resource management and cross-organization public resource management. The former has been fully discussed in our previous work using E-net. To cope with the latter, this paper presents a novel type of Petri net that is extended with both time and resource factors to model cross-organization emergency response processes. Then, according to the resource requirement analysis, their worst, delayed, and best cases are obtained. Next, emergency resource conflict checking and four conflict resolution strategies are proposed to resolve the detected resource conflicts for the delayed execution case. This paper shows how to use different resolution strategies to construct the conflict-free model by designing corresponding resolution controllers. Finally, their performance is evaluated by a fire emergency response example.},

Also, wafer residency time constraint is critical for many wafer fabrication processes.

By refining the interleaving relation in a behavioral profile into six types, this paper proposes the notion of a relation profile based on behavioral profile. Based on the relation profile of a WF-net, behavioral relation matrix can be constructed. Additionally, we refine the complex correspondence and generate a group of behavioral relation submatrices from the behavioral relation matrix.

  abstract     = {State space techniques are one of the main approaches deployed for the analysis of concurrent systems. However, state space construction is stalled by a common phenomenon called the state explosion problem which makes it a tough task or even impossible when the state space computation demands prohibitive cost (time and memory). We limit general resource allocation systems (RASs) to a certain class whose state space can be hierarchically constructed, yet it comprises various enough types of real-world discrete event systems, such as automated manufacturing systems. This paper focuses on a class of RASs modeled with Petri nets (PNs), where, through pure algebraic operations, a novel method to compute the state spaces is proposed, which is motivated by the superposition property. Given a PN model of a system and a target resource configuration, we first propose a special initial marking called the initial basis marking and compute the corresponding reachability graph. Then, we increase the capacity of the resource places in an incremental way and generate the reachability graphs by taking advantage of the PN structure and the previously computed reachability graph until the capacity function of resources reaches the target resource configuration. A complete enumeration of reachable states can be obtained by a recursive scheme. Experimental studies also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in terms of computational cost and its high-potential to cope with the state-explosion problem.},

  abstract     = {The e-commerce business process net (EBPN) is a novel formal model for describing an e-commerce system and its interactive parts, such as shoppers, merchants, and the third-party payment platforms. Vulnerability analysis has a great impact on the trustworthiness of EBPN, which is an issue stemming from data inconsistency problems. Data inconsistency problems affect the consistency of the EBPN transaction analysis. The underlying causes of inconsistent data are closely related to concurrent operations, such as control flow and data flow. However, most of the existing detection methods have difficulties characterizing the vulnerabilities and interactions of control and data flows. In this paper, we propose a new method based on the dynamic data slice (DDS) that considers both transaction consistency and data state consistency. First, by analyzing control flow characteristics of EBPN, we obtain the dynamic slice. This dynamic slice is based on all paths of the EBPN reachability graph. Second, we perform the data inconsistency analysis by considering both transaction consistency and data-state consistency. Based on these, we construct a DDS to characterize the behavioral logic and the data-dependence information. The DDS acquires the dynamic data firing sequence. Based on that sequence and a given data marking, we can construct the DDSs for several types of EBPNs. Constructing the DDS can be completed in polynomial time. The DDS is designed to characterize the behavioral logic and data-dependence information. Based on these, we design a method to judge the data constraints. This method satisfies the EBPN need for transaction consistency by considering both the control and data states. In addition, according to the data-dependence information, we can lock the vulnerable regions caused by abnormal trading data in the system. Finally, we give a method to compute the vulnerability level.},

The proposed algorithm is an approximation algorithm and has polynomial computational complexity. The experimental verification shows a very high efficiency of the presented technique.

A reconfigurable system switches from a mode to another during its working process to adapt its behavior to the related environment. By including such a feature, RDECSs become complex and their verification is often expensive in terms of computation time and memory. In this paper, a new methodology for formal verification of RDECSs is proposed in order to ensure the correctness of these systems with a reduced cost (decreasing the verification time and memory occupation). The proposed contribution includes an improved modeling and verification of RDECSs. The modeling with R-TNCESs is enriched with all reconfiguration forms, and the verification involves an improvement method that avoids any redundancy and cancels unnecessary calculations. In addition, a visual tool called Rec-AG based on the proposed methodology is developed. The performance evaluation of this paper is achieved by measuring computation time and memory for several systems and different sizes of the problem.

We propose an extension of OCL named reconfigurable OCL for improving the specification and validation of constraints related to different execution scenarios of a system. An ROCL metamodel is proposed with formal syntax and semantics. This solution gains in terms of validation time and quick expressions of constraints.

Another key factor of successful decision-making in engineering projects beyond taking into account information from the project manager on the project management (PM) is to consider information from the systems engineer on the product development. This paper proposes a process to monitor engineering projects relying on a set of project performance indicators that integrate the views of both project manager and systems engineer. This process includes three main activities: 1) defining project performance indicators related to the processes described by international guides and standards; 2) valuating and weighting these indicators by consulting project managers and systems engineers; and 3) constructing a hierarchical framework of indexes to support project monitoring. This proposal thus refers to the practices described in PM and systems engineering norms and improves them by involving project managers and systems engineers into decision-making, with the goal to take more coherent decisions.},

  abstract     = {It has been an active research area to develop robust supervisory control policies for production systems with unreliable resources. So far, most methods for robust deadlock resolution apply only to systems without flexible routes, where each processing step of any part type requires a unique prespecified resource. In this paper, we address deadlock avoidance control problem in production systems with both failure-prone resources and flexible routings, which allow that a part has options when deciding the resource acquisition at each step. This paper presents properties that a controller with robustness must satisfy. Specifically, at any system reachable state, neither the failed resources nor part instances trapped in these resources should have too much detrimental effect on the other portions of the system. Thus, the full range of part types&#39; production could be assured at all time. After defining the notions of reduced system and reduced state with respect to unreliable resources, we identify and prove conditions for determining whether or not the state resulting from the occurrence of an event is feasible. Subsequently, we develop a method for robust deadlock avoidance, which uses the solutions to state safety checking problem for the reduced production system with only reliable resources. An illustrative example shows the effectiveness of this method. Finally, we conduct a comparison investigation of some representative approaches in the literature about robust supervisory control for deadlock resolution in resource allocation systems with routing flexibility.},

Almost all the existing related works are only concerned with the failure-prone AMSs in which each part stage utilizes only one unit of resources. While, in real-world AMS, it is often necessary to use multiple units of different resources to complete a part. This paper focuses on the robust control of such complex AMSs with a type of unreliable resources. General Petri nets are used to model all the behavior of such AMSs. By adding a control place to the Petri net models for each considered siphon, we develop robust deadlock controllers for the considered AMS. Such a robust controller ensures that the parts of all types can be processed continuously through any of its processing routes, even if one of the unreliable resources fails.

A robust system should be resilient to such failures. In this paper, resources are divided into reliable ones and unreliable ones. On the basis of the deadlock avoidance algorithm which is proposed for the problem of deadlocks, we propose a robust control algorithm in the paradigm of systems of sequential systems with shared resources, which can acquire and release resources in a multitype and multiquantity way. It is validated to be a polynomially complex robust control algorithm by the distributivity analysis.

The proposed A2G2V algorithm uses existing model-checking tools, an architecture description tool, and our own code to generate an attack graph that enumerates the set of all possible sequences in which atomic-level vulnerabilities can be exploited to compromise system security. The architecture description tool captures a formal representation of the networked system, its atomic vulnerabilities, their pre-and post-conditions, and security property of interest. A model-checker is employed to automatically identify an attack sequence in the form of a counterexample. Our own code integrated with the model-checker parses the counterexamples, encodes those for specification relaxation, and iterates until all attack sequences are revealed. Finally, a visualization tool has also been incorporated with A2G2V to generate a graphical representation of the generated attack graph.

Unlike the literature employing the FTC methods, the novel nonlinear fault compensate function with adjustable parameter factor, whose norm is used for approximation with fuzzy logic systems, is constructed based on the mean value theorem. Accordingly, a standard transformation scheme from the multi-input and single-output nonaffine nonlinear system to the corresponding affine nonlinear system is first to be given; then, the designed adaptation mechanism with state-dependent switching strategy can effectively eliminate the effects of multiple time delays and actuator faults, including outage and stuck modes. Furthermore, by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability analysis method, it is proved that the proposed adaptive switched controller can guarantee the states of the overall closed-loop systems to asymptotically converge to zero.

The proposed scheme detects and isolates faults in the actuators of the system in real-time without the need of controller reconfiguration in presence of faults in the actuators.

Structural faults correspond to specific sequences of events that should satisfy precedence conditions defined with patterns. Temporal faults are defined with time constraints that must be fulfilled by the firing durations. The probabilities of consistent trajectories are computed with a numerical scheme from the collected timed measurements. The advantage of the proposed scheme is that it can be used for a large variety of pdf that may be defined either with an analytical or a numerical description. It works also for various time semantics. Diagnosis in terms of probability for faulty patterns and temporal constraints is established as a consequence.},

  abstract     = {A pacemaker is an embedded device that is sited in the chest to regulate irregular heartbeats known as arrhythmias. Since such devices are directed by software, a software failure may cause a serious hazard such as patient death. Runtime monitoring and adaptation of the device software behavior offers a solution for preventing device hazards. We have already obtained some experiences from monitoring medical devices like: 1) insulin pump using fuzzy Petri net and 2) cardiac pacemaker using colored Petri-net (CPN) and hierarchical fuzzy CPN (HFCPN). However, these studies did not present an adaptation method for software runtime faults. This paper, extending our previous work, presents an automatic runtime method for continuous verification of the behavior of the implanted pacemaker using a software agent. The autonomy and the intelligence characteristics of the software agent are used to control the behavior of the cardiac pacemaker software by drawing inferences from a knowledge base where HFCPN is used by the agent as the inference engine. Compared to a flat inference engine, the HFCPN is able to cover the concurrent states initiated by input fuzzy values and improve the running time for finding a suitable rule by up to 92\%. In addition, the intelligent software agent checks the runtime operation accuracy of the pacemaker software in vital and unexpected situations, and redirects the software decision if it finds an unacceptable value. To demonstrate the HFCPN&#39;s behavior and decision-making in different situations, three different scenarios are presented.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, one new distributed load frequency regulation approach is proposed for smart power system operation under two specific practical constraints, including the limited communication resource and speed droop parametric uncertainty. To address these two constraints, the co-design of event-triggering communication scheme and distributed model-based controller is studied. Instead of using zero-order holders, the proposed model-based scheme is able to extend the maximum allowable time interval and thus reduce communication bandwidth usage. In the meantime, the proposed co-design scheme is able to get the model-based control parameters and event-triggering condition metrics simultaneously. This can loosen the conservation in the choice of control gains and event-triggering parameters faced by existing approaches where the control gains are fixed in prior. Comparisons on the multiple-area system confirm that this designed load frequency regulation method significantly reduces the number of required data transmissions without sacrificing the dynamic performance of the frequency and tie-line power. It is also shown that the proposed approach has great robustness to speed droop coefficient uncertainty.},

Since in this sliding surface, the sliding mode is asymptotic stable, the trajectories of the attitude control system remain ultimately bounded under the circumstance of disturbances and uncertainties.

Second, the estimates from the DEIFs are combined by covariance intersection (CI) to obtain an improved state estimate while still maintaining a consistent estimate. Thus, the DEIF and the CI methods form complementary advantages by satisfying the requirement of the consistency in the hierarchical estimation framework. Finally, both simulations and experiments of a target tracking example demonstrate that the proposed method is more suitable for applications to the maneuvering target tracking and it achieves a more satisfactory performance than the conventional DEIF method.},

During the data transmission through a network channel of limited bandwidth, for the sake of collision avoidance and energy saving, a dynamic event-triggered scheme is employed to schedule the data communication from the sensors to the designed estimator. First, for a given singular perturbation parameter (SPP), by constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii SPP-dependent functional, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the exponentially mean-square ultimate boundedness of the error dynamics of the state estimation. Furthermore, in the case that the SPP does not exceed a predefined upper bound, a design algorithm is developed for the desired state estimator ensuring that the error dynamics is exponentially mean-square ultimately bounded. In this case, by solving certain matrix inequalities, the estimator gain is characterized without needing to know the exact SPP (as long as it stays below the given upper bound). Moreover, the ultimate bound of the error dynamics is estimated. Finally, simulation results are given to confirm the validity and advantages of the proposed design scheme of the state estimator.},

Under the action of sampled-data control law, outputs of all RGs converge to the output of the leader. The closed-loop system of the leader and all RGs are be equivalently written as the interaction of an operator and a linear time-invariant system. The small gain theorem is utilized to calculate the upper bound of the sampling intervals. Furthermore, the integral quadratic constraints can provide the passivity-type property of the operator and give the less conservative results. Meanwhile, the AR can ensure that nonidentical node tracks its exosystem. Thus, all nonidentical nodes and the leader achieve output synchronization.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel event-sampled robust optimal controller is proposed for a class of continuous-time constrained-input nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics. In order to solve the robust optimal control problem, an online data-driven identifier is established to construct the system dynamics, and an event-sampled critic-only adaptive dynamic programming method is developed to replace the conventional time-driven actor-critic structure. The designed online identification method runs during the solving process and is not applied as a priori part for the solutions, which simplifies the architecture and reduces computational load. The proposed robust optimal control algorithm tunes the parameters of critic-only neural network (NN) by event-triggering condition and runs in a plug-n-play framework without system functions, where fewer transmissions and less computation are required as all the measurements received simultaneously. Based on the novel design, the stability of system and the convergence of critic NN are demonstrated by Lyapunov theory, where the state is asymptotically stable and weight error is guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the applications in a basic nonlinear system and the complex rotational-translational actuator problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

To solve the ETHJB equation, we present a single network adaptive critic design (SN-ACD). The critic network used in the SN-ACD is tuned through the gradient descent method. By using Lyapunov method, we demonstrate that all the signals in the closed-loop auxiliary system are UUB.

Therefore, the whole system has four asynchronous clocks, two quantizer updating clocks, and two sampling updating clocks. The main contribution of this paper is the proposed self-triggered and event-triggered control method based on these four clocks. The whole system is stabilized by two steps, i.e., system and controller synchronization, and controller stabilization. In the synchronization process, novel event-triggered and self-triggered samplings are proposed in terms of dynamic quantizer parameters. While in the stabilization process, event-triggered sampling is designed based on controller states and quantizer parameters. Moreover, it is proved that the Zeno behavior would not occur. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed method are illustrated by a numerical example borrowed from recent literature.},

First, a hybrid communication scheme including time-triggered control and periodic event-triggered control (ETC) is presented for the system under consideration. The major features of the proposed scheme include three aspects: 1) instead of a fixed switching process, the switching between two triggering methods is stochastic satisfying Bernoulli distribution; 2) the condition of ETC utilizes a more recently transmission data packet, which results in reducing the transmission frequency of sampled data than some existing ones; and 3) Zeno phenomenon can be excluded since the minimum interevent time is implicity denoted by the sampling period. Second, the closed-loop system subject to the hybrid communication scheme and network-induced delay is modeled as an uncertain stochastic system with an interval time-varying delay. Two theorems are presented for the robustly mean-square stability and guaranteed cost controller design of the derived system. Then, a minimization problem is proposed to optimize the upper bound of cost function, in which the trigger parameters and feedback gain can be designed simultaneously. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a practical inverted pendulum on a cart.},

One fundamental issue in coordinating and controlling a large group of distributed and networked agents is the influence of intermittent interagent interactions caused by constrained communication resources. Event-triggered communication scheduling stands out as a promising enabler to strike a balance between the desired control performance and the satisfactory resource efficiency. What distinguishes dynamic event-triggered scheduling from traditional static event-triggered scheduling is that the triggering mechanism can be dynamically adjusted over time in accordance with both available system information and additional dynamic variables. This article provides an up-to-date overview of dynamic event-triggered distributed coordination control. The motivation of dynamic event-triggered scheduling is first introduced in the context of distributed coordination control. Then some techniques of dynamic event-triggered distributed coordination control are discussed in detail. Implementation and design issues are well addressed. Furthermore, this article exemplifies two applications of dynamic event-triggered distributed coordination control in the fields of microgrids and automated vehicles. Several challenges are suggested to direct the future research.},

  abstract     = {It is generally accepted that the essential goal of many-objective optimization is the balance between convergence and diversity. For constrained many-objective optimization problems (CMaOPs), the feasibility of solutions should be considered as well. Then the real challenge of constrained many-objective optimization can be generalized to the balance among convergence, diversity, and feasibility. In this paper, a tri-goal evolution framework is proposed for CMaOPs. The proposed framework carefully designs two indicators for convergence and diversity, respectively, and converts the constraints into the third indicator for feasibility. Since the essential goal of constrained many-objective optimization is to balance convergence, diversity, and feasibility, the philosophy of the proposed framework matches the essential goal of constrained many-objective optimization well. Thus, it is natural to use the proposed framework to deal with CMaOPs. Further, the proposed framework is conceptually simple and easy to instantiate for constrained many-objective optimization. A variety of balance schemes and ranking methods can be used to achieve the balance among convergence, diversity and feasibility. Three typical instantiations of the proposed framework are then designed. Experimental results on a constrained many-objective optimization test suite show that the proposed framework is highly competitive with existing state-of-the-art constrained many-objective evolutionary algorithms for CMaOPs.},

The BRI is based on steady state visually evoked potentials, utilizing the multivariate synchronization index classification algorithm to analyze the human electroencephalograph (EEG) signals in such a manner that human intentions can be recognized and motion commands can be produced for the brain controlled robot. The entire system is semi-autonomous since the navigation of mobile robot is commanded by the BRI, and the low-level motion of the mobile robot is autonomous with a designed kinematic controller. By utilizing vanishing points and door plates as the environmental features, a global metric map of the environment has been built by a sequential SLAM algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is the combination of an artificial potential field (APF) and the brain signals, which builds up the relationship between the strength of EEG signals and the intensity of the potential field. Through the proposed EEG-APF method, motion commands that would plan an obstacle-free trajectory in un-structured environments, can be obtained.

  abstract     = {Ground reaction force (GRF) characteristics of amputee walking are important for the analysis of clinical gait data, and also to update model reference adaptive impedance (MRAI) controllers. GRF estimation is a better alternative than direct GRF measurement because of the disadvantages of load cells, such as high cost, integration difficulties due to weight and physical dimensions, the possibility of overload, and measurement noise. This paper presents four robust MRAI observer/controller combinations for GRF estimation-based control of a prosthesis and a legged robot model in the presence of parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics, in which the robot model is employed to mimic able-bodied walking. Since unknown GRFs can reduce the performance of prosthesis control systems, the proposed MRAI controllers are designed to compensate their effects. All four proposed observer/controller combinations enable the system to imitate the biomechanics of able-bodied walking as defined by mechanical impedance, and provide flexible and smooth gait. Lyapunov analysis of the observer/controller combinations is used to prove stability. The four MRAI controllers are compared with each other from the perspective of GRF estimation accuracy, prosthetic knee angle tracking accuracy, parameter estimation accuracy, control effort, and computational effort. Simulation results show that all four MRAI controllers achieve good tracking performance, stable limit cycles, and accurate GRF estimation.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides an approach to design robust smooth controllers that allow a plant belonging to a broad class of nonlinear uncertain systems, with possible real actuators and subject to bounded or rate-bounded disturbances, to track a sufficiently smooth reference signal with an error norm smaller than a prescribed value. The proposed control laws are based on the concept of majorant systems and allow one to establish asymptotic bounds for the tracking error and its first and second derivatives. The proposed controller design is based on two parameters: the first is related to the minimum eigenvalue of an appropriate matrix, which the practical stability depends on, and the second is determined by the desired maximum norm of the tracking error and its convergence velocity. If the trajectories to be tracked are not sufficiently smooth, suitable filtering laws are proposed to facilitate implementation of the control laws and reduce the control magnitude, especially during the transient phase. The obtained theoretical results are validated in two case studies. The first one presents a tracking control design for an industrial robot, both in the joint space and workspace, with and without real actuators or velocity measurement noise. The second one deals with tracking control design for a complex uncertain nonlinear system.},

In this paper, based on a new look at the Bayesian framework of data clustering, two new concepts are introduced and they correspond to a Bayesian information transmission system and its transmission learning. Facilitated by the new concepts, an exemplar-based transmission learning machine for clustering (ETLMC) is accordingly developed. As an attempt to explain the exemplar-based clustering behavior in a physics-based manner, ETLMC is well justified by revealing that the exemplar masses transfer between data objects during the clustering process can be governed by the proposed gravity enrichment effect rooted at Newton&#39;s law of gravity. Practically, ETLMC is distinctive in its easy implementation in terms of its global analytical solution, its fast exemplar finding for large scale data with arbitrary shapes, its easy parameter settings and its stable and efficient clustering results. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ETLMC, in contrast to a number of existing state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.},

For the convenience of digital implementation, this paper further investigates the approximate NOR problem of the SIP system in discrete-time framework. The key for solving the discrete-time NOR problem lies in how to solve a set of algebraic functional equations known as discrete regulator equations (DRE). Since the equations are very complicated, the accurate solution of the DRE can not be obtained. In this paper, we first show that the DRE associated with the SIP system are solvable by center manifold theorem and then use neural network approach to tackle with the tracking problem.

As ubiquitous time delays on communication links exist in communication networks, studying the effect of delays on the dispatch performance is of both theoretical merit and practical value for the efficient and stable operation of smart grids. In this paper, we consider a well-developed consensus-based ED protocol under constant time delays. We find that there always exists a sufficiently small learning gain parameter under finite constant delays such that the convergence of the consensus-based algorithm is guaranteed. Further, an analytical expression of the upper bound is established for the learning gain parameter, which is determined by the largest delay, the weight matrix and the parameters of generation cost functions. In order to guarantee the optimality of the final solution, we propose the updating rule for iterations when initial states are not received by their neighbors due to time delays. The optimality of the final solution under the proposed updating rule is analyzed. We validate our theoretical results through extensive simulation studies.},

To build a proper model for describing the behavior of EMSM, which is also convenient for the design of tuning strategy, a data-driven model composed of linear dynamic submodel as well as hysteresis submodel is developed. In the data-driven model, the deflection mechanism is described by a linear dynamic submodel while the hysteresis in EMSM is depicted by a nonsmooth hysteresis basis function submodel. Then, in order to compensate for the internal oscillation caused by both underdamping factor and hysteresis, a pseudo-feedforward oscillation compensator (PFOC) not relying on the inverse model is proposed. Then, the design procedure of the angle tuning strategy with the PFOC is presented. Afterward, the robust design of the angle tuning scheme is also studied to overcome the effect of compensation residual. Subsequently, the proposed scheme is applied to the angle tuning of EMSM.},

  abstract     = {In zero-shot learning, attributes play as a bridge from original images to class labels. Therefore, to achieve accurate zero-shot image classification, we mainly focus on improving attribute prediction accuracy by taking full advantage of prior information about attribute from two aspects. First, we present a new attribute classifier called deep attribute prediction (DeepAP) model by using supervised deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), where the attribute label information participates in the training of DCNNs. Unlike common DCNNs that are usually used to extract image features, the constructed DCNNs are used to directly predict attribute values from the original input images. Thus, the designed DeepAP model can serve as the mapping from low-level image features to high-level semantic attributes in the traditional direct attribute prediction (DAP) model. Second, another prior information about attribute, i.e., class-attribute matrix is used to mine the attribute-class correlation with sparse representation coefficients. Since the attribute-class correlation can reflect different contributions of attributes to classification, we use it to define attribute weights and incorporate the idea of weighted attributes into DeepAP to form the deep weighted attribute prediction (DWAP) model. Experiments on three real datasets show that DWAP outperforms the deep attribute network and DAP on attribute prediction and zero-shot image classification.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing has proved to be a splendid tool to aggregate the knowledge from a pool of individuals in order to perform abundant microtasks efficiently. Recently, with the explosive growth of online social network, Word of Mouth (WoM)-based crowdsourcing systems have emerged, in which besides conducting the tasks by themselves, participants simultaneously recruit other individuals through exploiting their social networks to help solve crowdsourced tasks. This crowdsourcing paradigm can greatly facilitate to grow the pool of crowdworkers. However, there exist two conflicting challenges in designing an effective WoM-based incentive mechanism: 1) sybil attack and 2) heterogeneous effect of participants. That is, intuitively, incentivizing (usually compensating for) common-ability individuals will inevitably stimulate the behavior of sybil attack (i.e., some individuals create multiple sybils, and split the total efforts into those sybils to expect more compensation). This paper proposes a novel biased contest-based crowdsourcing incentive mechanism through exploiting social networks (BciNet), aiming to balance those two conflicting objectives. BciNet is composed of two phases. First, based on spreading activation model, an enhanced geometric virtual point dissemination mechanism is able to provide sybil-proof property and accommodate the realistic social network structure. Second, based on participants&#39; virtual points, a biased contest gives more reward to less able participants. Through carefully calibrating the bias factor, simulation results based on the real dataset show that BciNet can greatly improve the amount of participants&#39; effort levels, and actually be robust against the sybil attack. In brief, for a practical incentive mechanism, the methodology to address conflicting goals is to put rational individuals into dilemma: to be sybil or not to be, it is the problem, i.e., the potential gain from the sybils in the second phase may be offset by the loss in the first phase.},

  abstract     = {For the upcoming Internet of Things (IoT) enabled era, context-aware service provisioning (CaSP) can be realized by first analyzing new input data, followed by inferring contexts from the input data, and providing new services based on the inferred contexts. Over time, further new contextual models will also be incorporated into CaSP due to growing data collected by existing or new IoT devices. Furthermore, these contextual models require ongoing adaptation because a real-life environment is dynamic in nature. It becomes more challenging to maintain and adapt these ever-increasing contextual models as the system evolves. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a CaSP infrastructure along with an agentized and reconfigurable design to improve system adaptability and extensibility. The proposed middleware-enhanced CaSP infrastructure can keep as much previously learned knowledge as possible to share among all integrated components. This design reduces the overhead from integrating and adapting multiple contextual models in response to inevitable uncertainties in a dynamically changing IoT-enabled smart home environment. Our agentized design generalizes the scheme of all smart components integrated with the CaSP infrastructure, thus facilitating reciprocal cooperation among all initially independent components. The CaSP infrastructure can facilitate multilevel rather than single-level information reuse via message queues residing in the middleware. This reconfigurable design enables all of the smart components to become loosely coupled and flexibly interconnect to form reconfigurable agents. Such a design allows temporal reconfiguration by reusing as many existing or even new features and contexts on the CaSP infrastructure, thus improving extensibility. Our experimental results show that the proposed CaSP infrastructure can improve the overall adaptability (by about 20\%) and extensibility (by 44\% to 95\%) of CaSP in a dynamic environment.},

First, we present a cost model for a disintegration strategy with both cost-sensitive and cost-constraint parameters in complex networks. Then, we propose an optimization model for the disintegration strategy with heterogeneous cost and introduce the genetic algorithm to identify the optimal disintegration strategy. Extensive experiments in synthetic and real-world networks suggest that the heterogeneity of the disintegration cost and the tightness of the cost constraint significantly affect the optimal disintegration strategy. We demonstrate that, in contrast to the classical hub node strategy, low-cost nodes play a key role in the optimal disintegration strategies if the cost constraint is tight and the disintegration cost is strongly heterogeneous.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a curved path following scheme with the aid of the vector field (VF) and the notion of input-to-state stable (ISS) for a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed. The VF strategy is a robust and valid guidance method and its stability is proved using ISS properties. Many existing path following algorithms for fixed-wing UAVs are only proposed for straight-lines and orbits. However, the path required to be followed is always in approximate curves rather than straight-lines and orbits in many high-level missions, such as obstacle avoidance, search, and surveillance. The nonlinear-theoretic notion of ISS is playing a central role in the control law design and stability analysis. The error kinematics are converted into two interconnected subsystems with proven ISS properties, which yield the overall system that is globally asymptotically stable, i.e., and the along-track error and the cross-track error asymptotically approach zeros from any initial position in the space. The followed path is defined in terms of the arc-length parameter, and it can be expanded according to the waypoint fitting without the need to obtain a global function representation. The singularity of multiple closest points on the path is eliminated by constructing a speed profile of a virtual point on the path. The scheme is validated with a semi-physical experiment combined by an actual autopilot, ground station and the X-Plane flight simulator. Flight tests using a small fixed-wing UAV show excellent tracking performance of the curved path following.},

  abstract     = {Graphs are commonly used to represent objects, such as images and text, for pattern classification. In a dynamic world, an object may continuously evolve over time, and so does the graph extracted from the underlying object. These changes in graph structure with respect to the temporal order present a new representation of the graph, in which an object corresponds to a set of time-variant graphs. In this paper, we formulate a novel time-variant graph classification task and propose a new graph feature, called a graph-shapelet pattern, for learning and classifying time-variant graphs. Graph-shapelet patterns are compact and discriminative graph transformation subsequences. A graph-shapelet pattern can be regarded as a graphical extension of a shapelet-a class of discriminative features designed for vector-based temporal data classification. To discover graph-shapelet patterns, we propose to convert a time-variant graph sequence into time-series data and use the discovered shapelets to find graph transformation subsequences as graph-shapelet patterns. By converting each graph-shapelet pattern into a unique tokenized graph transformation sequence, we can measure the similarity between two graph-shapelet patterns and therefore classify time-variant graphs. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel decentralized control strategy for a class of uncertain nonlinear large-scale systems with mismatched interconnections. First, it is shown that the decentralized controller for the overall system can be represented by an array of optimal control policies of auxiliary subsystems. Then, within the framework of adaptive dynamic programming, a simultaneous policy iteration (SPI) algorithm is developed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated with auxiliary subsystem optimal control policies. The convergence of the SPI algorithm is guaranteed by an equivalence relationship. To implement the present SPI algorithm, actor and critic neural networks are applied to approximate the optimal control policies and the optimal value functions, respectively. Meanwhile, both the least squares method and the Monte Carlo integration technique are employed to derive the unknown weight parameters. Furthermore, by using Lyapunov&#39;s direct method, the overall system with the obtained decentralized controller is proved to be asymptotically stable. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized control scheme is illustrated via simulations for nonlinear plants and unstable power systems.},

Compared with slow state variables feedback controller, a new controller is proposed for slow sampling discrete-time SPSs, which has less conservatism. A more realistic situation, i.e., the system modes cannot be directly acquired for controller design, is considered with the help of hidden Markov model (HMM). The goal is to design a resilient asynchronous controller based on HMM such that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable while meeting an expected H ∞ performance in the presence of random controller gain fluctuation and the system modes hiding for controller. By utilizing matrix inequality techniques and Lyapunov function method, some criteria are established for the existence of the resilient asynchronous controller. The superiority and practicability of the obtained theoretical results are demonstrated by a numerical example and an inverted pendulum system.},

An emergency disposal plan is usually organized as a series of emergency response processes manipulated by one emergency command center and several subordinate emergency organizations. Moreover, these subordinate organizations are usually geographically dispersed and need to collaborate with each other. In this case, designing and verifying such cross-organizational collaborative emergency response processes are complicated and time-consuming. To address this problem, we propose a hierarchical modeling and correctness verification approach. A general framework for hierarchical modeling and correctness verification of such processes is first introduced. Then, a top-level model and two kinds of bottom-level models (complex and simple bottom-level ones) are proposed to model such processes and collaboration patterns from different abstraction levels. Next, Petri net refinement operation is adopted to refine the top-level model by using its corresponding bottom-level models to obtain the refined model. Finally, the correctness of the refined model is verified based on reachability graph. A typical running case of cross-organization collaborative fire emergency response processes is given to validate our proposed method.},

International consortia provide benchmarks in a wide range of domains, being normally used by industry, vendors, and researchers for evaluating their software products. In this regard, a benchmark of untimed Petri net models was developed to be used in a yearly software competition driven by the Petri net community. However, to the best of our knowledge there is not a similar benchmark to evaluate solution techniques for Petri nets with timing extensions. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for the comparative analysis of generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPNs) simulation techniques. Although we focus on simulation techniques, our framework provides a baseline for a comparative analysis of different GSPN solvers (e.g., simulators, numerical solvers, or other techniques). The evaluation framework encompasses a set of 50 GSPN models including test cases and case studies from the literature, and a set of evaluation guidelines for the comparative analysis. In order to show the applicability of the proposed framework, we carry out a comparative analysis of steady-state simulators implemented in three academic software tools, namely, GreatSPN, PeabraiN, and TimeNET. The results allow us to validate the trustfulness of these academic software tools, as well as to point out potential problems and algorithmic optimization opportunities.},

The implementation of the controller requires some prior information about its Markov parameters, namely, upper and lower bounds on the systems impulse response. It is directly applicable to plants with interlacing real poles and zeros, i.e., with Cauchy index equal to the plant order, provided the adaptation gain is restricted to be smaller than some value determined by the measure of relative primeness of the pole and zero polynomial.

This paper introduces a novel approach to adapt composite rewards of all the agents in one Q-table in joint state-action space during learning, and uses these rewards to compute CE in an efficient way during the planning phases. Two schemes of MAQL have been proposed. If mutual cooperation among the agents leads to success of at least one agent and is enough to make the team successful, then scheme-I is employed. However, if an agent&#39;s success is contingent upon other agents&#39; mutual cooperation as well as simultaneous success of the agents is mandatory then scheme-II is employed. New algorithms for multi-agent learning/planning have been proposed, centering on the said schemes. It is shown that the equilibrium obtained by the proposed algorithms and the traditional correlated Q-learning are identical. In order to restrict the exploration within the feasible joint states, constraint versions of the said algorithms are also proposed. An analysis is included to demonstrate the significant saving of computational time and space by the proposed algorithms. In addition, convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms is done.

We derive a sufficient condition for the asymptotic synchronization. Interestingly, the stability implies that with no constraint on the phase differences or the coupling strength, the asymptotic frequency synchronization can be achieved under certain topology-switching signals. Then, based on the stability of asymptotic frequency synchronization, two triggered topology-switching algorithms are proposed. The step force together with the topology-switching algorithm work as a new frequency synchronization algorithm.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a problem of stability analysis for a class of nonlinear systems with a time-varying delay taking both large and small values in an alternating manner. This problem is a delay-dependent stability analysis one but it shares some features with delay-independent ones. Hence, traditional stability analysis techniques for systems with delay are not applicable. By building upon our previous works, we first introduce the concept of delay-hybrid-dependent stability, which characterizes the delays described above. The considered system is first represented as a system with a switched delay. Then by using switching techniques and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs), a new stability criterion is developed. Next, in the linear context, it is shown how the needed LKFs can be constructed by developing an original design of LKFs.},

  abstract     = {Rail surface inspection using visual inspection system is an important part of railway maintenance. However, accurate and efficient identification of possible defects remains challenging. This paper proposes a background-oriented defect inspector (BODI) to improve defect detection by considering specified characteristics of the track during inspection. Reformulating the inspection task in this manner offers a new way to model rail surface images. More specifically, BODI features a random sampling stage to obtain a compact background representation without any prior information. A sufficient number of random selections generates adequate and diverse background statistics, and defect-determination and a fusion of procedures then determine whether current pixel belongs to the background. Finally, a background update mechanism and parallelism ensure real-time applicability. The proposed BODI is evaluated on a working railway line. The experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

However, that too many people are “good at many things” is definitely a waste. Role-based collaboration and its environments-classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects (E-CARGO) model are a good means to provide modeling and solutions to such a challenging problem. This paper formalizes the problem of GMEO into GMEO-1 (the fundamental form of GMEO) with the support of E-CARGO, clarifies two different forms of GMEO-1 and provides two highly practical solutions. The proposed solutions are verified by comparing with initial solutions using a linear programming solver, i.e., the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Platform. The contributions of this paper are a thorough investigation of GMEO-1 that has no exact solutions even for a small group (e.g., ten people) and is normally managed by highly qualified administrators. The proposed solutions provide digital results with algorithms that form a solid foundation for decision making in dealing with similar issues.},

  abstract     = {The value proposition for ground vehicle modularity in the U.S. Army and other services has been a topic of continuing debate. Studies to date have largely focused on individual system elements such as manufacturing or maintenance, lacking a holistic perspective of the implications of modularity for the entire fleet operation and life-cycle. The U.S. Army Science and Technology community has demonstrated the technical feasibility of large-scale, transformative ground vehicle modularity, but the business case for modularity remains incomplete. There are multiple criteria tradeoffs between modular and mission-specific (conventional) vehicle platforms, such as total life-cycle cost, mission utility, personnel requirements, and fleet adaptability. This paper presents a system-of-systems framework to address these tradeoffs to support high-level decisions on the strategic feasibility of ground vehicle modularity. We demonstrate this framework with a notional example and an application to the Joint Tactical Transport System (JTTS), a U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center demonstrator program. Under certain modeling assumptions with regards to the operation of a modular fleet, results for the JTTS study indicate that modularity can lead to significant cost savings at the expense of increased personnel requirements.},

  abstract     = {People use various online social networks for different purposes. The user information on each social network is usually partial. Thus, matching the users across these multiple online social networks is of great significance for providing new services as well as new insights on user behaviors. Recent research shows that group structure widely exists on social networks, in which members work together with certain purpose and are more influential than individuals on online social networks. Previous works provide outstanding solutions for mapping individuals, but few ones pay attention to the study of groups across multiple social networks. To address the research gap, we first aim to propose an effective method to detect similar group across multiple social networks. The method mainly has three steps, including detecting group structure based on random walks, extracting similarity features, and inferring group similarity using probabilistic graphical model. We evaluate our algorithm on five different types of online social networks. Experimental results show that our method achieves 0.693, 0.779, 0.729 in precision, recall, and F1-measure, which significantly surpass the state-of-the-art by 31.4\%-44.3\%, 17.3\%-26.3\%, and 25.9\%-31.6\%, respectively. The outstanding performance of our method demonstrates that our proposal can reach the requirement of detecting similar groups across social networks. In particular, the result of this paper paves the way for the recommendation system, link prediction and information diffusion across sites.},

In fact, it is very difficult to detect very small breathing motion on images. In this paper, well-known techniques are employed to obtain useful features from the chest area for the Lucas-Kanade algorithm. Various levels of the Pyramidal Lucas-Kanade are then adapted to track possible small motions of those features. The proposed approach can successfully detect the inspiratory-expiratory motions and the peak time of inspiratory phase can be predicted within an acceptable interval of error time. From the experiments conducted, the breath motion can be successfully observed in two different environment situations (dim-lighting and lighting conditions). It can be found that the tracked features are quite robust and stable without losing the quantity over a long period of testing time. Thus, the proposed approach can effectively be used to define a proper triggering timing for X-ray shooting. Besides, in our experiments, even though the target is 6 m away, the breath detection is still successful. In other words, the proposed approach can also be used for surveillance or healthcare environments.},

Smartphones can send Wi-Fi request packets periodically, even when they are not connected to access points. This gives another promising solution to the crowd density estimation even for the public environment. In this paper, we first develop a Wi-Fi monitor detection that can capture smartphone passive Wi-Fi signal information including MAC address and received signal strength indicator. Then, we propose a positioning algorithm based on smartphone passive Wi-Fi probe and a dynamic fingerprint management strategy. In real-world public social activities, a person may have zero, one, two, or multiple smartphones with variant Wi-Fi signals. Therefore, we design a method of computing the probability of a user generating one Wi-Fi signal to identify people population. Finally, we propose a crowd density estimation solution based on Wi-Fi probe packets positioning algorithm.

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be seriously impacted by several changes in behavior. As a measure of optimality, a network should react in real-time. However, even if some reactions can make the system flexible, they can cause significant damages when they are not well-structured. Moreover, the scenarios of reconfigurations can affect several parameters within a wireless sensor network. Among these parameters it is possible to name the energy efficiency, the memory limitation within a node, the real-time constraints at the level of the nodes and the network in general. Either through the application or the transmission of the reconfiguration scenarios, some parameters are severely altered. A metamorphosis of the internal architecture of the nodes is proposed in this research work as well as a policy of communication between several nodes aiming to adapt the network to any change. The resulting proposition offers general efficiency in energy and real-time constraints. The efficiency is realized by the application of a pipelined approach, dealing with the incoming reconfiguration scenarios, and a communication protocol, based on a priority energy and deadline aware scheduling algorithm (a multicriteria scheduling algorithm). This protocol is capable of optimizing the transmission of both reconfiguration scenarios and sensed data simultaneously. The solution is tested on a network connecting several cars during an automobile journey and the results validate the efficiency of this proposition.},

Our focus is to devise a distributed primal-dual gradient algorithm for working out the problem over a sequence of time-varying general directed graphs. The communications among agents are assumed to be uniformly strongly connected. A column-stochastic mixing matrix and a fixed step-size are applied in the algorithm which exactly steers all the agents to asymptotically converge to a global optimal solution. Based on the standard strong convexity and the smoothness assumptions of the objective functions, we show that the distributed algorithm is capable of driving the whole network to geometrically converge to an optimal solution of the convex optimization problem only if the step-size does not exceed some upper bound. We also give an explicit analysis for the convergence rate of the proposed optimization algorithm. Simulations on economic dispatch problems and demand response problems in power systems are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm.},

However, biases contained in the provided ionospheric heights definitely cause degradation of the tracking performance. This paper is concerned with the joint estimation problem of the target state and the ionospheric height bias for OTHR target tracking subject to multipath and cluttered measurements. A Markovian jump ionospheric height bias model is presented by simultaneously considering the intermittent and abrupt ionosphere changes. Meanwhile, a set of stochastic variables are adopted to depict association uncertainties among measurements, clutters, and propagation modes so that association is embedded in the resultant measurement model with random coefficients. Through such modeling transformation from association uncertainties to parameter randomness, the coupling processing of data association and state estimate is equivalent to pure state estimate subject to stochastic parameters. Furthermore, an optimal linear joint estimator containing causality constraints is developed in the minimum mean-squared error sense, and further extended to the case of nonlinear measurement model via iterative optimization. A target tracking example with four resolvable propagation modes illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed estimation scheme.},

  abstract     = {Complex networks with time-varying nodal parameters are of considerable interest and significance in many areas of science and engineering. Reconstructing networks with unknown but continuously bounded time-varying nodal parameters from limited measured information is desirable and of significant interest for using and controlling these networks. Based on the Lasso method and the Taylor expansion approximation, we develop an efficient and feasible, completely data-driven approach to predicting the structures of networks with unknown but continuously bounded time-varying nodal parameters in the presence or absence of noise. In particular, the reconstruction framework is implemented on several different kinds of artificial, two-layer and real complex networks composed of various parameter-varying nodal dynamics. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that, networks structures can be fully reconstructed with limited available information and presence or absence of noise, though systemic parameters are continuously time-varying. In addition, our method is also applicable to structure identification of multilayer networks as well as networks with constant nodal parameters. We expect our method to be useful in addressing issues of significantly current concern in the information era, natural networks, and large-scale multilayer networks.},

On this basis, by dividing the sampling input available interval and unavailable interval into several segments, the matrix functions of the SDTVLF are chosen to be continuous piecewise linear. Then, by using the proposed SDTVLF approach, computable convex conditions are obtained for the sampling input unavailable interval and the sampling input available interval in framework of dwell time. By confining the sampling input unavailable interval with an upper bound and confining the sampling input available interval with a lower bound, the SDTVLF is always decreasing in all sampling input available and unavailable interval, which can make the sampled control system tolerate a larger packet dropout rate.

  abstract     = {Defense modeling and simulation (DM&amp;S) has brought insights into how to efficiently operate combat entities, such as soldiers and weapon systems. Most DM&amp;S works have been developed to reflect accurate descriptions of military doctrines, yet these doctrines provide only guidelines of military operations, not details about how the combat entities should behave. Because such vague parts are often fulfilled with the appropriate behavior of combat entities in a battlefield, one part argues that DM&amp;S should consider individual combat behaviors as well. However, it is known as an infeasible problem discovering best individual actions from infinite searching space, such as the battlefield. This paper proposes a layered behavior modeling to practically resolve this issue. The proposed method applies descriptive modeling to reduce the searching space by employing domain-specific knowledge; and prescriptive modeling to discover best individual actions in the reduced space. For the generalization, the proposed method adapts both modeling methods being modularized, and then the proposed method suggested an interface between them that is based on their semantic analogies. Both modeling methods are modularized, so they are interacted through an interface defined in the proposed method. This paper presents a realization of the proposed method through a case study of infantry company-level operations. In the case study, the proposed method is implemented with discrete event system specification formalism as the descriptive part and Markov decision process as the prescriptive part. The experimental results illustrated that the combat effectiveness resulted from the proposed method is statistically better than that from the descriptive-only modeling, and the difference would be guided by the objective of the combat behavior. Through the presented experimental results and the discussion, this paper argues that future DM&amp;S should consider a broad spectrum from the battlefield incorporating the rational behavior of military individuals.},

For the case of undirected and connected communication graphs, we propose a distributed discontinuous nonlinear controller which can achieve the bipartite consensus. To cancel the chattering phenomenon of the discontinuous controller, a continuous one is designed by using the boundary layer technique, under which the bipartite consensus error is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded and can exponentially converge to a small adjustable bounded set. Further, considering the case of a leader having a bounded control action, we present a continuous controller to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the bipartite tracking error.},

Therefore, we design a set of continuous state feedback controllers based on the control targets of the two active links, and then we optimize the target angles of all links and the design parameters of the above controllers by employing intelligent optimization algorithm. In this way, the system can be stabilized at the target point by using these controllers with optimized parameters.

Motivated by that the clustering accuracy is affected by both the prior-known label information of some of the images and the sparsity feature of the representations, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method with dual constraints in this paper. In our model, one constraint is used to keep the label feature and the other constraint is utilized to enhance the sparsity of the representations. Notably that these two constraints are embedded naturally into the traditional NMF model, refraining from the usage of the balance parameters which are hard to choose. Meantime, for solving the proposed model, the alternative iteration scheme is employed, and an efficient algorithm based on convex optimization is designed to conduct each iteration operation. It is proved that this algorithm achieves a nonlinear convergence rate, much faster than existing methods with linear rate. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

This paper investigates the feasibility and applicability on the usage of wristband-interaction behavior for recognizing hand-dominated activities, with the advantage of great compliance and long wearing time. For each action, sensor data from wristband are analyzed to obtain kinematic sequences. The sequences are then depicted by statistics-, frequency-, and wavelet-domain features for providing accurate and fine-grained characterization of hand-dominated actions, and the correlation between the wristband-sensor features and the actions is analyzed. Classification techniques (Naive Bayes, nearest neighbor, neural network, support vector machine, and Random Forest) are applied to the feature space for performing hand-dominated activity recognition. Analyses are conducted using the data from 51 participants with a diversity in gender, age, weight, and height. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, achieving a recognition rate of 97.29\% and an F-score above 0.94. Additional experiments on the effect of feature selection and wristband sampling rate are provided to further examine the effectiveness of our approach. Our data are publicly available.},

The train traffic model is proposed with the dynamic equations for the evolution of train headway, train passenger loads, and the energy consumption along the subway line. For the dynamic changing of the onboard passengers with time, the total train energy usage is modeled as the sum of energy consumptions from the traction system and auxiliary facilities. A nonlinear DP problem is formulated to generate a near optimal timetable to realize the tradeoff among the utilization of trains, passenger waiting time, service levels, and energy consumption. To overcome the curse of dimensionality in this optimization problem, we construct an approximate DP framework, where the conceptions of states, policies, state transitions, and reward function are introduced. And this algorithm is able to converge to a good solution with a short time compared to the genetic algorithm and differential evolution algorithm.

Each agent&#39;s state is constructed via a state observer, and the relative state estimate is assumed to be confined into a hypercube. In virtue of the edge Laplacian, the consensus problem of nonlinear multiagent systems under this constraint is converted into the stabilization problem of edge dynamics operating on the constrained set. Observer-based intermittent protocol and adaptive protocol are, respectively, designed for achieving consensus. A convergence analysis is provided with the help of state saturation theory, switched system theory and adaptive theory. Finally, the results on consensus with relate state estimate constraints are applied into the consensus problem while preserving the connectedness, and are validated by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Femtocell is a promising technology for wireless service networks to facilitate sustainable and efficient services for users. This paper deals with a downlink joint channel assignment and power allocation problem with multiple channels, users, constraints, and uncertainties in the orthogonal frequency division of a multiple-access hierarchical femtocell network system. Specifically, a hierarchical robust Stackelberg game, which aims to achieve robust equilibrium, is first proposed for resource allocation with uncertainties. Then, a low-complexity, low-interference, high-efficiency, and high-performance algorithm is presented to handle the complex robust joint allocation problem. Considering the demand capacity of macro-base stations, an efficient fitness function in conjunction with particle swarm optimization-constriction factor, is utilized to yield the best response in the upper game to satisfy multiple constraints. Meanwhile, an iterative waterfilling algorithm is exploited to achieve the best response of femto-base stations in the lower game. Lastly, a stop protocol is established for two-tier users to accomplish an efficient robust Stackelberg equilibrium. Comparative results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is superior to the existing game-based algorithms.},

Differing from some existing works, each follower under consideration is modeled by a nonlinear nonstrict feedback system, especially, the virtual and real control gains are unknown functions rather than constants. To overcome the difficulty caused by the unknown nonlinearities, radial basis function neural networks are employed to model those unknown nonlinearities. Then, adaptive neural approach and backstepping technique are combined to construct the consensus tracking control protocol. It is shown that under the action of the suggested control protocol, whole closed-loop system is stable and all the outputs of followers ultimately track the reference signal, i.e., the output of the leader, synchronously.

As decision-making reliability, indicating the validity and accuracy, greatly depends on the reliabilities of both group similarity and the degree of familiarity, it is helpful to study a decision-making problem from the perspective of information reliability. To this end, a PLMAGDM method which considers reliability is put forward in this paper. First, two sets of information (i.e., probabilistic linguistic terms on alternative grades, and linguistic terms on familiarity) are given by experts as measures of expert reliability and attribute reliability. A granulation optimization model is then constructed to generate the utility of grades while maximizing group similarity, and a model that redistributes the probabilities of grades is established for the situation of incomplete information. We further provide another granulation optimization model to generate the degree of familiarity. Additionally, using the evidential reasoning rule, the aggregated weights of experts are obtained employing an optimization method that is used to retrieve attribute information. Lastly, through the method comparison in two cases as well as the sensitivity analysis, the validity and applicability of the method are verified.},

  abstract     = {Satisfying the process technical requirements while optimizing the control of oxygen and zinc oxide is the main task for optimal operation of the iron removal process. However, due to the complicated mechanism and varied production conditions, the process is difficult to achieve optimal operation with the simple controller. The manual control, as a result, is extensively used in practice. In this paper, we develop an optimal setting and control (OSC) system for the iron removal process to achieve its technical requirements with minimal process consumptions. The OSC system is composed of a neural network soft-sensor, an optimal setting module, an optimal controller, and a fuzzy-logic-based compensator. First, we define the oxygen reaction efficiency (ORE) to measure the difference between the theoretical oxygen amount and its actual amount. Due to the ORE cannot be measured online and it varies with the production conditions, an adaptive weight radial basis function neural network soft-sensor is designed to estimate it. The adaptive weight adjusting method contributes to improve the adaptability of the soft-sensor, and its convergence is discussed. The optimal setting module provides the set-point of outlet ferrous ion concentration for the optimal operation of every reactor. The steady-state optimal control of oxygen and zinc oxide is then established, and the compensator compensates the control inputs utilizing the feedforward and feedback information. Finally, simulations validate that the ORE is important for the optimal control of the process. Furthermore, industrial experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and potential of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is an emerging paradigm that aims to provide on-demand manufacturing services over the Internet. Service composition as an important means for generating value-added services plays an important role in achieving the aim of CMfg. Most of previous works focused on exploring techniques of service composition for a single composite task using meta-heuristic algorithms. However, the issue of service composition for multiple composite tasks has rarely been considered. Meta-heuristic algorithms suffer from cumbersome parameter tuning as well as the tendency of getting into local optima. In addition, the effectiveness of different algorithms has not yet been fully explored when different degrees of constraints are imposed. Different from approaches in most of the previous works, this paper proposes an extended Gale–Shapley (GS) algorithm-based approach for service composition that allows generation of multiple service composition solutions effectively. Requirements with different constraints are considered. Experimental results indicate that: 1) meta-heuristic algorithms can be used in various scenarios with different degrees of constraints. However, they are incapable of finding the optimal solutions in situations with relatively loose constraints, and moreover, the failure rate of finding solutions for a batch of multiple tasks is high; 2) the dynamic programming (DP) is a method that is the most sensitive to constraints. It performs better only under loose constraints and in the case of a single requirement; and 3) the application range of the GS method proposed is wider than that of the DP method. It can achieve better performance when constraints are relaxed irrespective of task status (i.e., a single task or multiple tasks), and moreover, it can make more tasks find solutions in the multitask scenario without service reuse.},

Mainly due to the presence of the unknown powers which have not known upper bound, no existing methods are applicable to the control problem to be solved. In this paper, to compensate the serious system uncertainties and particularly to overcome the major obstruction from unknown powers, we appeal to the mechanism of switching adaptive feedback. By flexibly combining the domination and the method of adding a power integrator, we propose a new adaptive controller design, whose design parameters are tuned online based on a switching logic. The designed controller will become operative as long as finite switchings happen and will not lead to Zeno phenomenon, and can guarantee the global boundedness as well as ultimate convergence of the resulting closed-loop system. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed design scheme.},

Our goal is to design the GrHDP method to achieve consensus control which makes all the agents track the desired dynamics and simultaneously makes the performance indices reach Nash equilibrium. The new local internal reinforcement signals and local performance indices are provided for each agent and the corresponding distributed control laws are designed. Then, GrHDP algorithm is developed to solve the multiagent consensus control problem with the proof of convergence. It is shown that the designed local internal reinforcement signals are bounded signals and the local performance indices can monotonically converge to their optimal values. Moreover, the desired distributed control laws can also achieve optimal.

  abstract     = {Two of the most dominant challenges in post disaster emergency resource allocation are: 1) understanding the exact utility, i.e., exigency, of emergency resources and 2) collecting and transmitting the need for these resources to the control station from where resources are allocated. Measuring the utility of resources with precision becomes tricky in a dynamic post disaster scenario, where demands are constantly evolving and supplies trickle in at an uncertain rate. Moreover, collection and transmission of resource needs of far-flung areas are easier said than done owing to the post disaster disruption of communication infrastructure. These result in the ad-hoc allocation of emergency resources to the shelters. In this paper, we first derive a utility function for dynamically enumerating the shelter specific utility of each emergency resource. Subsequently, we propose an opportunistic knowledge sharing scheme for gathering and disseminating resource needs to the control station using a smartphone-based delay tolerant network. Finally, based on these opportunistically transmitted needs, we formulate a utility driven optimal resource allocation model which minimizes overall resource deficit and total resource deployment time. The proposed system optimally assigns constrained emergency resources to different shelters, so that high-utility resources are deployed fast. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated using ONE simulator and LINGO optimization modeling tool. Exhaustive simulation is done to evaluate the comparative performance of our system with a number of competing schemes. Results show that our system outperforms all these schemes in a fully connected scenario. It is also observed that even in an intermittently connected environment, the performance of our system is almost at par with the competing schemes.},

This paper reports a miniature untethered robotic fish, whose body length is 69 mm. In particular, a newly designed magnetic actuator system (MAS) is equipped, which guarantees both small-sized dimension and flexibility of the robot. More specifically, the magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet is first investigated based on Biot-Savart law. Then, a novel tail-beating rhythm called magnetically actuated pulse width modulation (MAPWM) is modeled for the new actuator system. Further, an MAPWM-based control method is presented, in which the duty ratio of MAPWAM is innovatively utilized to realize the turning maneuvers for the first time. In addition, Lagrangian method is employed to establish the dynamic model to assess the MAPWM-based control method and the turning performance of the robotic fish. To further improve the maneuverability, the effect of a shape-variable caudal fin is analyzed based on computational fluid dynamics and the built dynamic model. Finally, combined with the MAS, the MAPWM-based control method, and the optimally selected caudal fin, extensive aquatic experiments are conducted on the robotic prototype. The results indicate that the developed miniature robotic fish achieves a considerably higher level of maneuverability in terms of turning radius when compared to swimming robots with equivalent dimensions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the global pinning synchronization problem is studied for a complex dynamical network to follow a dynamic target system. A distinguished feature of the present network model is that the target system may have some predesigned control inputs. This implies that, when pinning synchronization is guaranteed, the states of the nodes within such a pinning-controlled dynamical network may approach a specified trajectory which does not satisfy the system equation of the uncoupling individual node system within the network. The practical constraint that the external control inputs acting on the target system are unknown to any node in the considered network poses a big challenge in solving such a pinning synchronization problem. The designed scheme for achieving pinning synchronization is executed in two steps. Specifically, the first step is to select some nodes to pin such that the augmented interaction topology has at least one directed spanning tree rooted at the node describing the target system, while the second step is to construct a coupling law to synchronize all the states of nodes within the network. Moreover, two kinds of discontinuous coupling laws with static and adaptive coupling gains are, respectively, proposed to achieve pinning synchronization. Meanwhile, by utilizing nonsingular ${M}$ -matrix theory and Lyapunov stability analysis for nonsmooth system, some efficient criteria are established for guaranteeing synchronization in the pinning-controlled networks. Numerical simulations on pinning synchronization of networking Chua&#39;s circuit systems are finally given to verify the analytic results.},

  abstract     = {This paper is about the design of control sequences for discrete event systems (DESs) modeled with bounded partially controlled timed Petri nets (PC-TPNs) including a set of temporal specifications that correspond to minimal firing durations. Petri nets are well-known mathematical and graphical models that are widely used to describe distributed DESs, including choices, synchronizations, and parallelisms. The domains of application include but are not restricted to manufacturing systems, computer science, and transportation networks. Including the time in the model is important to consider many control problems. This paper is more particularly concerned with control issues in timed context and uncertain environments when unexpected events occur and when control errors disturb the system behavior from the planned policy decided by the controller. To deal with such uncertainties, we propose first to build a timed extended reachability graph (TERG) that includes the time specifications when the PC-TPN behaves with an earliest firing policy. Then, the optimal paths in TERG are found by using an approach based on discrete time Markov decision processes under discounted criterion. Several simulations illustrate the benefit of our method from the computational point of view, in particular for uncertain environments.},

In spite of improved vehicle safety due to better steering capability, the SbW system actuator failure may lead to unwanted steering performance or even instability. A fault tolerant model predictive control (MPC) with fault compensation for SbW systems based on delta operator for actuator faults is proposed. It deploys an observer to estimate both the fault information and the faulty SbW system states. At each sampling time, the MPC immediately compensates for the fault. The gains of the observer and the fault tolerant MPC controller are obtained by solving a linear matrix inequality derived from the Lyapunov theory. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed fault tolerant control strategy can counter the various types of actuator faults and maintain superior steering performance to shift operator-based MPC controller.},

  abstract     = {Information source detection is to identify nodes initiating the diffusion process in a network, which has a wide range of applications including epidemic outbreak prevention, Internet virus source identification, and rumor source tracing in social networks. Although it has attracted ever-increasing attention from research community in recent years, existing solutions still suffer from high time complexity and inadequate effectiveness, due to high dynamics of information diffusion and observing just a snapshot of the whole process. To this end, we present a comprehensive study for single information source detection in weighted graphs. Specifically, we first propose a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to detect the information source with other methods as the prior, which ensures our method can be integrated with others naturally. Different from many related works, we exploit both infected nodes and their uninfected neighbors to calculate the effective propagation probability, and then derive the exact formation of likelihood for general weighted graphs. To further improve the efficiency, we design two approximate MAP estimators, namely brute force search approximation (BFSA) and greedy search bound approximation (GSBA), from the perspective of likelihood approximation. BFSA tries to traverse the permitted permutations to directly compute the likelihood, but GSBA exploits a strategy of greedy search to find a surrogate upper bound of the likelihood, and thus avoids the enumeration of permitted permutations. Therefore, detecting with partial nodes and likelihood approximation reduces the computational complexity drastically for large graphs. Extensive experiments on several data sets also clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on detecting the single information source with different settings in weighted graphs.},

First, for the output-feedback-based closed-loop MAS in normal case and faulty cases, a bank of fault detection and isolation (FDI) interval observers are constructed by taking into account the outputs of local and received from neighbors, the bounds of one node fault signal and the whole disturbances. Then, the observer gains can be determined by solving the disturbance attenuation, fault sensitivity, and nonnegativity conditions, simultaneously. Furthermore, an alarm signal is released when the zero value is excluded from any one of the intervals, a node fault is indicated when the zero value is included in one residual interval and excluded from the surplus intervals. Different from the classical FDI methods, the proposed interval observers are able to both generate the residual signals and imply the thresholds. Under such framework, each agent has the capacity to determine which neighbor agent is faulty. Finally, the developed techniques are demonstrated in a simulation example.},

Common electronics are used in the design of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), targeting military, and civilian populations, while concealed recording devices steal proprietary/confidential data, compromising both government and industrial resources. This paper discusses a novel, nonintrusive, repeatable, reliable, expandable, and simple-to-implement detection and identification (D&amp;I) system for identifying threats by using unintended radiated emissions (URE). This paper differs from current URE proposals, by avoiding energy radiation. The proposed process also addresses big data problems involved in capturing and building databases of URE characteristics. Issue interpretation is utilized with URE data to distinguish between threat/nonthreat devices using multiple criteria decision analysis and other decision-making techniques to determine model and mode of hidden devices. System optimization, verified by testing, is used to improve the speed and accuracy of the identification algorithm. The system is developed with data from 130 devices and validated with 33 separate devices, which are representative of IED and espionage threats. Due to slow progress in the URE D&amp;I field, the properties and potential of a more effective D&amp;I system, compared to current methods, will be of interest to the explosive ordnance disposal, security services, electronic systems manufacturing, automated inventory, mobile application development communities, and potentially others as well. For a field that is not well documented, this paper provides a clear, concise, and detailed model for future research and applications of URE D&amp;I.},

As a conventional and direct congestion alleviation strategy, constructing new roads and lanes are increasingly restricted by limited land resources and high costs. Thus, making full use of existing transport network via appropriate management is critical to realize the sustainable development of transportation systems. As a flexible management strategy, lane reservation strategy has been widely adopted in real life. The reserved lanes can improve the efficiency of special transports, while they bring negative impact such as travel delay for general-purpose transports. In addition, the setting and operating of reserved lanes require a certain amount of cost. This paper proposes a new dual-objective integer linear programming model for optimally determining reserved lanes on a network for time-guaranteed special transports in order to simultaneously maximize the benefits and minimize the negative impact brought by reserved lanes, which incorporates road residual capacity and limited budget to the actual decision. Moreover, an iterative weighted sum-based method is proposed to solve it, in which a new relax-and-optimize algorithm is developed to exactly solve the single-objective optimization problems.

By utilizing the received measurements subject to fading phenomena, a novel output-feedback PID controller is proposed where the integral-loop (accumulation sum-loop for the discrete-time case) is equipped with the limited time-window in order to reduce the computational burden. The main objective of the addressed problem is to design a desired PID controller such that both the exponentially mean-square stability and the prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty}$ performance are guaranteed for the closed-loop system in the presence of fading measurements. With the help of Lyapunov stability theory, a sufficient condition is obtained to guarantee the desired performance and, on the basis of such a condition, the synthesis issue of the PID controller is subsequently discussed, where the orthogonal decomposition combined with a free matrix is introduced to facilitate the controller design.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present an approach to local coverage path (CP) planning for a circular mobile sensor. Our family of algorithms provides completed and overlapped coverage control, curvature and path length control, localization, choice of observer&#39;s placement based on sensing range, and first-order differentiable CP. Our family of algorithms begins by partitioning the target region (TR) into several regular triangulations (RTs). Based on the size of the RT and the sensing range, the number and location of observers are determined for all RT. All observers found are then used as waypoints (WPs) to generate baseline CP with the Traveling Salesman Problem&#39;s nearest neighbor algorithm. The proposed algorithm solved the problems of how to design a differentiable and collision-free CP for all sensing range, limited and sufficient, while providing completed coverage control, overlapped coverage control, curvature and path length control, localization, collision avoidance, and the choice of observer&#39;s placement based on sensing range and the environment. The main technical contributions of the proposed approach is to provide a holistic solution that segments any TR, uses triangulation to determine the observation WPs and then compute the smooth and collision-free CP.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the technology of small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has steadily improved in terms of flight time, automatic control, and image acquisition. This has lead to the development of several applications for low-altitude tasks, such as vehicle tracking, person identification, and object recognition. These applications often require to stitch together several video frames to get a comprehensive view of large areas (mosaicking), or to detect differences between images or mosaics acquired at different times (change detection). However, the datasets used to test mosaicking and change detection algorithms are typically acquired at high-altitudes, thus ignoring the specific challenges of low-altitude scenarios. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by providing the UAV mosaicking and change detection dataset. It consists of 50 challenging aerial video sequences acquired at low-altitude in different environments with and without the presence of vehicles, persons, and objects, plus metadata and telemetry. In addition, this paper provides some performance metrics to evaluate both the quality of the obtained mosaics and the correctness of the detected changes. Finally, the results achieved by two baseline algorithms, one for mosaicking and one for detection, are presented. The aim is to provide a shared performance reference that can be used for comparison with future algorithms that will be tested on the dataset.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of resilient nonlinear control for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) over attacked networks is studied. The motivation for this paper comes from growing applications that demand the secure control of CPSs in industry 4.0. The nonlinear physical system considered can be attacked by changing the temporal characteristics of the network, causing fixed time or time-varying delays and changing the orders of received packets. The systems under attack can be destabilized if the controller is not designed to be robust with an adversarial attack. In order to cope with nonlinearity of the physical system, a nonlinear generalized minimum variance controller and a modified Kalman estimator are derived. A worst-case controller is presented for fixed-time delay. In the situations of time-varying delays and out-of-order transmissions, an opportunistic estimator and a resilient controller are designed through an on-line algorithm in the sense that it is calculated by using the information in the received packets immediately. The ability to use the received information immediately leads to the improvement of the controller&#39;s performance. Simulation results are provided to show the applicability and performance of control law developed.},

Nonidentical nodes are adopted to describe the different industrial processes. The target trajectory is the output of an autonomous linear time-invariant system. The designed controller for each nonidentical node is distributed and calculated on the local information. Each distributed controller composes by the reference generator (RG) and the regulator (RE), where RG can copy the dynamics of the target trajectory and RE can ensure the synchronization. Limited to communication constraints, the time-varying sampled-data control strategy is utilized to reduce the updated frequency of the controller and communication burden of the network. The upper bound of the sampling instants is calculated by the theory of small gain theorem and the theory of integral quadratic constraints. Finally, a practical numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the distributed controller design strategy.},

In the method, those pairs most analogous to a test pair are identified by using the learned metric and then used to build a local ranking function.

  abstract     = {With increasing concerns on climate change and energy shortage, manufacturing industries must adopt more sustainable production and facility control strategies. Such strategies require operational practices that emphasize sustainability by considering economic, energy, and environmental aspects simultaneously. In this paper, a new combined production scheduling model that jointly considers energy control and maintenance implementation to address the concerns of energy consumption, intelligent maintenance, and throughput improvement simultaneously is proposed. Multiple measures are combined and evaluated using a single objective, i.e., cost minimization. Particle swarm optimization, with a local optimal avoidable mechanism and a time varying inertial weight, is used to solve the cost minimization problem to find a near optimal solution of production and maintenance schedules. A numerical case study is implemented and the results show that the cost per unit production can be reduced up to 27\% compared to the existing benchmark strategies. The implications to practitioners with respect to the tradeoff between cost and throughput/energy consumption, and the model applicability considering energy tariff structure, are also discussed to provide more insights for using the proposed joint model in the real world. The proposed model advances the state-of-the-art on maintenance and energy scheduling, which is typically performed exclusively. It is expected to guide operational activities on shop floors toward sustainability.},

Instead, we propagate the transition probabilities directly which allows us to build the probability distribution from data. This provides a more realistic algorithm for probabilistic forecasting. To address large scale problems, our method is made computationally efficient by using an incremental model to construct probabilities relative to the nominal (or mean) of the state which is allowed to change over time.

  abstract     = {Shockwaves lead to speed variation and capacity drop, which hamper the stationarity and throughput of traffic network greatly in reality. In order to dominate or suppress shockwaves, there exist two philosophies: the analytical and numerical methods to investigate various traffic management schemes. However, both are studied completely separately in the existing literature. In this paper, we primarily focus on the uniformity and combination of the two philosophies, especially in terms of traffic evolution and shockwave trajectory extraction. Aiming at exploring the uniformity, numerical methods are equipped with gradient boundary detection and polar-parameter coordinate projection to iteratively calculate traffic states and extract shockwave trajectories as line segments. By contrast, analytical methods derive traffic evolution from fundamental diagrams and present shockwave trajectories as vector graphics in the traffic time-space diagram. Furthermore, to rationally measure the accuracy of extracted trajectories, a calibration model is established to decrease angle and distance errors yielded by the two methods. In the uncontrolled and variable speed limit (VSL)-controlled bottleneck scenarios, the simulation results have shown that: 1) both analytical and numerical methods have the capability to precisely describe traffic evolution and the effects of VSL strategies on recovering traffic throughput; 2) shockwave trajectories extracted by the two methods are coincident, with the significant reduction of relative distance errors from 15\%-80\% to 0.1\%-3\%; and 3) it is quite promising to take full advantage of both the visual/intuitive nature of analytical methods and the iterative optimization of numerical methods to investigate efficient traffic management strategies.},

With buffer sizes fixed, the result is a small invariant supervisor which is independent of the total number of original machines.

Meanwhile, the convex combination technique is employed to deal with not only the parameter uncertainties but also the derivative of delay τ(t). To ensure the GUNNs to be globally asymptotically stable with the guaranteed H ∞ performance in the case of disturbance and parameters uncertainties, a controller is designed using the liner matrix inequalities technique. Numerical examples show that, in the sense of the prescribed H∞ performance, this proposed work achieves expected results on the error synchronization system.},

By exploiting it, this paper presents a method for comprehensively analyzing the properties of general UPNs. Particularly, we reveal the repeatability of deadlock with the unfolding of some unbounded leaves in LRT and present a sufficient and necessary condition of deadlock existence. Then, LRT and some partial trees generated from it, instead of entire reachability graphs, are utilized to analyze the liveness and reversibility of general UPNs rather than some special ones. The related theoretical results are proven. A unified algorithm based on LRT for analysis of boundedness, liveness, deadlock, and reversibility of general UPNs is developed for the first time. The results of a case study show that the presented method is effective for general UPNs.},

The trained network learns a bidirectional mapping and can apply to some inverse problems. A bidirectional multilayer neural network can exactly represent some invertible functions. We prove that a fixed three-layer network can always exactly represent any finite permutation function and its inverse. The forward pass computes the permutation function value. The backward pass computes the inverse permutation with the same weights and hidden neurons. A joint forward-backward error function allows BP learning in both directions without overwriting learning in either direction. The learning applies to classification and regression. The algorithms do not require that the underlying sampled function has an inverse. A trained regression network tends to map an output back to the centroid of its preimage set.},

Necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring a strong mean square leader-following bipartite consensus are given. In particular, in the absence of measurement noise, the convergence speed of error dynamics is dependent on the eigenvalues of Laplacian and the rate of ∫ 0 t q(s)ds approaching infinity. By appropriately choosing q(t), the speed of leader-following bipartite consensus convergence can be improved in a fixed communication topology.

The system parameters are subject to abrupt changes regulated by the Markovian process for which the entries of the mode transition probability matrix are partially accessible. A novel 2-D nonfragile state estimator is constructed to achieve the sensor fault estimation where the estimator gains are allowed to be randomly perturbed. Then, together with the Lyapunov stability theory, the stochastic analysis techniques are employed to derive the sufficient conditions that guarantee the following three performance requirements: 1) the exponential stability of the estimation error dynamics; 2) the prespecified constraint on the energy-to-peak gain; and 3) the prespecified restriction on the prescribed power bound. Moreover, the estimator gains are parameterized by using the convex optimization method. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the addressed estimation algorithm.},

It is shown that the proposed control approach does not require the existence of a Lyapunov function before design of the fuzzy controller in comparison with many existing control approaches to finite-time control of nonlinear systems via the technique of control Lyapunov functions, and thus, the finite-time controller and the corresponding Lyapunov function can be designed simultaneously. The procedures on how to obtain the fuzzy controller are provided in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, an upper bound on the time taken for state trajectories to arrive at their desired targets is estimated. The effectiveness of the proposed finite-time H ∞ control approach is finally illustrated via numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides new insight into the theoretical principle and the practical applicability of the ranked nodes method (RNM) that is used to construct conditional probability tables (CPTs) for Bayesian networks (BNs) by expert elicitation. RNM is designed for specific types of discrete random variables called ranked nodes that are common in real-world applications of BNs. Despite its active use in recent years, there remains ambiguity about the exact theoretical basis of RNM which can hamper its effective employment. In addition, there are a lack of studies about the general ability of CPTs generated with RNM to represent probabilistic relationships in real-world applications. In this paper, it is shown how the generation of probabilities with RNM is underpinned by a regression model of continuous random variables. Then, it is experimentally determined that in typical applications of RNM, one can generate in a matter of seconds CPTs whose elements reflect well probabilities given by the underlying regression model. Another experiment discovers that CPTs generated with RNM provide a good average fit to a large portion of various real-world CPTs investigated. This confirms the usefulness of RNM in practical applications. The results of the experiment also indicate that choices made by the user of RNM can considerably impact the ability of a generated CPT to represent a given probabilistic relationship. This paper then provides practical advice on the efficient use of RNM with regard to the user-controlled features explored in the experiment.},

Then the remote estimator completes the estimation with only partially available observations, which are quantified. Suppose that the Markov chain is unknown to the remote estimator. By using orthogonal projection principle and innovation analysis method, a Kalman type filter is designed in a recurrence form.

Particularly, we examined the capabilities of mental simulation of one&#39;s own actions as well as the inference of others&#39; intention because they play a crucial role, especially in social cognition. We propose a dynamic neural network model based on predictive coding which can generate and recognize dynamic visuo-proprioceptive patterns. The proposed model was examined by conducting a set of robotic simulation experiments in which a robot was trained to imitate visually perceived gesture patterns of human subjects in a simulation environment. The experimental results showed that the proposed model was able to develop a predictive model of imitative interaction through iterative learning of large-scale spatio-temporal patterns in visuo-proprioceptive input streams. Also, the experiment verified that the model was able to generate mental imagery of dynamic visuo-proprioceptive patterns without feeding the external inputs. Furthermore, the model was able to recognize the intention of others by minimizing prediction error in the observations of the others&#39; action patterns in an online manner. These findings suggest that the error minimization principle in predictive coding could provide a primal account for the mirror neuron functions for generating actions as well as recognizing those generated by others in a social cognitive context.},

The aim of the problem addressed is to design a quantized controller such that, under the Round-Robin protocol, the switched system with the known joint distribution is mean-square stable. Considering the sojourn time and the periodicity of Round-Robin protocol, we present an interval-dependent periodic condition to guarantee the stability of addressed systems and then derive the explicit expressions of the controller for each subsystem by solving a set of matrix inequalities.

Since domain adaptation learning can effectively perform knowledge transfer under the circumstance of different data distributions, we proposed a novel ZSL method, referred to as multisource domain attribute adaptation based on adaptive multikernel alignment learning (A-MKAL), from the point of view of classifier adaptation. Considering there may be a large difference between object classes, we adopt the clustering method to group the training images according to the class–class correlation measured by the whitened cosine similarity, thus multiple source domains are created. The created multiple source domains are then combined into one weighted source domain to participate in the distribution discrepancy match across domains. In order to adapt the attribute classifier learned on the well-defined source domains to the target domain (the training image set), we designed the A-MKAL by applying the centered kernel alignment to align the attribute kernel matrix and the kernel function of adaptive multiple kernel learning. Experiments on Shoes, OSR, and AWA datasets show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method yields more accurate classification.},

Unlike conventional constrained model predictive control (MPC) strategies that have a limitation in the consideration of both set-point tracking and the dynamic process responses, the system state variables and output tracking errors are combined and thus can be regulated simultaneously in the new MPC scheme. Based on such advantages, there are more degrees of freedom for the subsequent controller design and improved system performance can then be obtained. Case studies on the regulation of chamber pressure of a coke furnace under process uncertainties and packet losses are investigated to verify the proposed approach in comparison with typical traditional constrained MPC schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper suggests evolving linear models as a powerful alternative for online forecasting of synchronous time series. First, using a priori knowledge of an expert, all known possible features are clustered in some categories so that each category includes homogeneous features. Then, a novel evolving correlation-based forward subset selection technique is used to determine relevant features from each category. Next, based on the selected features, an estimation of the output of the system is modeled through an evolving adaptive linear regression model. In evolving systems, selected features and their associated weights could vary over time based on new incoming data samples which contain new information. Finally, a soft combination of output estimations of all categories, in a new sense of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system, gives the prediction of the output of the system at each sampling time. The approach offers a certain new view at the enhancement of evolving forecasting models. The proposed approach embodies recursive learning and one-step-ahead incremental algorithms that progressively modify the model to ensure continuous learning, and self-organization of the model structure and its parameters. Two real-world problems, forecasting electricity load of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas region and stock price forecasting of technology sector of Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index, are provided to validate the developed method. Pros and cons of the proposed approach are comprehensively discussed and shown through simulation results and comparisons with other state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract     = {Seam carving is a content-aware image processing approach that has been successfully applied to resizing or removing objects from digital images. Seam-carved images are hard to identify from the original image, making this detection method an important and attractive research topic. Existing methods are based on steganography attacks or statistical features, and their trained and tested models are all constructed using support vector machines (SVMs). The trained models of these methods take a long time to build from a limited number of images. This paper presents a new patch-based sobel operator (PSO) method using SVM and extreme learning machines (ELMs) based on the patch analysis method with square-based features. The ELM adopts five types of neurons to obtain five prediction results, which are then combined using the jury voting scheme in order to improve the accuracy. In addition, combinatorial fusion is first used to choose two of five prediction results according to the diversity rank/score graph, and these two results are then combined to make the final decision. The PSO method in the ELM with jury voting and combinatorial fusion achieves accuracies of 70.60-98.80\% and 95.58-99.36\% for 10-50\% seam-carved and seam-insertion images, respectively. Additionally, for the PSO method, the ELM required only 1.2\% of the training time required by the SVM. In conclusion, the PSO method in the ELM is useful for constructing trained models from a large number of images.},

Compared with the existing results, the proposed control scheme avoids the use of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, which relaxes the restriction on the derivative of unknown time-varying delay (τ̊(t) &lt;; 1). By utilizing the finite covering lemma and fuzzy logic systems (FLSs), the considered time-varying delay system is transformed into novel switched nonlinear system with known constant delays. In addition, the nonaffine nonlinear faults make the control design more complicated. To overcome the difficulty, the fault function is decoupled by utilizing the mean-value theorem. In the design procedure, the problem of unknown control gain and control direction is produced. To solve this problem, the Nussbaum-type function is introduced. Combined backstepping technique with FLSs, an adaptive approximation FT tracking control scheme is proposed. Finally, the developed control method ensures that all the closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. A simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed control scheme.},

Based on LaSalle invariance principle, the associated tracking problem is then solved under a necessary condition for stabilization and particularly true for the power form systems and the rolling sphere. With the help of virtual trajectory, the achieved tracking result is applied to the regulation problem and used to guarantee practical stability. The proposed controllers have a simple and explicit form, and hence are easily implemented. Simultaneously, fast convergence is guaranteed, thanks to the K-exponential convergence. More interestingly, the used approach is adding sufficiently exciting signals to the systems by considering virtual tracking signals so that the attractivity of the origin can be guaranteed based on LaSalle invariance principle. Thus, it is possible to extend the proposed results to more general systems. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, interesting simulation results are presented.},

Underwater image processing has been used in a wide variety of fields, such as underwater microscopic detection, terrain scanning, mine detection, telecommunication cables, and autonomous underwater vehicles. However, underwater imagery suffers from strong absorption, scattering, color distortion, and noise from the artificial light sources, causing image blur, haziness, and a bluish or greenish tone. Therefore, the enhancement of underwater imagery can be divided into two methods: 1) underwater image dehazing and 2) underwater image color restoration. This paper presents the reason for underwater image degradation, surveys the state-of-the-art intelligence algorithms like deep learning methods in underwater image dehazing and restoration, demonstrates the performance of underwater image dehazing and color restoration with different methods, introduces an underwater image color evaluation metric, and provides an overview of the major underwater image applications.

Meanwhile, with the development of globalization, distributed manufacturing is becoming widespread. This paper addresses an energy-efficient scheduling of the distributed permutation flow-shop (EEDPFSP) with the criteria of minimizing both makespan and total energy consumption. Considering the distributed and multiobjective optimization complexity, a knowledge-based cooperative algorithm (KCA) is proposed to solve the EEDPFSP. First, a cooperative initialization scheme is presented with both extended energy-efficient Nawaz–Enscore–Ham heuristic and slowest allowable speed rule that are specially designed to produce good initial solutions with certain diversity. Second, several properties of the nondominated solutions are investigated based on the characteristics of the bi-objective problem, which are used to develop the knowledge-based search operators. Third, a cooperative search strategy of multiple operators is designed for the solutions with different characteristics to tradeoff two objectives. Fourth, a knowledge-based local intensification is used for exploiting better nondominated solutions sufficiently. Moreover, an energy saving method based on the critical path is used to further improve the performance. The effect of parameter setting on the KCA is investigated with the Taguchi method of design-of-experiment. Extensive computational tests and comparisons are carried out, which verify the effectiveness of the special designs of the KCA in solving the EEDPFSP.},

  abstract     = {The learning algorithm of an extreme learning machine (ELM) has two fundamental steps: 1) random nonlinear feature transformation and 2) least squares learning. Since the probabilistic interpretation for a sample by the least squares method follows a Gaussian distribution, there are two limitations in ELM caused by the second step: 1) it may be inaccurate to handle binary classification problems, since the output of a binary dataset has a distribution far from Gaussian and 2) it may have difficulties in dealing with nontraditional data types (such as count data, ordinal data, etc.), which also do not follow Gaussian distribution. In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, this paper proposes a generalized ELM (GELM) framework by applying the exponential family distribution (EFD) to the output layer node of ELM. It simplifies the design of ELM models for task-specific output domains with different data types. We propose a unified learning paradigm for all the models under this GELM framework with different distributions in EFD, and prove that traditional ELM is a special instance of GELM by setting the output distribution as a Gaussian distribution (GELM-Gaussian). We also prove that the training of GELM-Gaussian can be finished in one iteration, in this case, GELM-Gaussian does not slow down the training speed of traditional ELM. Besides, we propose the kernel version of GELM, which can also be concretized to different models by applying different EFDs. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that GELM can give more accurate probabilistic interpretation to binary classification and GELM has a great potential in dealing with a broader range of machine learning tasks.},

To better explore the effect of information sharing on a coopetitive supply chain, we consider a sequential game with the OEM as the Stackelberg leader under two different wholesale pricing methods, which is close to the practical situation. Our analysis shows that when the wholesale price is exogenously given, information sharing is beneficial for the OEM but hurts the CM, and a side-payment contract is designed to induce Pareto-optimal information sharing. When the wholesale price is a decision variable, the CM benefits from information sharing while the OEM does not and a discount-based wholesale price contract is designed to induce truthful information sharing. The numerical examples analysis further finds that the OEM benefits from the exogenous wholesale price scenario while the CM benefits from the endogenous wholesale price scenario. The study sheds lights on the decision-making processes for operating and managing the coopetitive supply chain and extends the research scope of information sharing. Our findings also provide some scientific references about information sharing in daily production.},

  abstract     = {With many degrees of freedom (DOFs), a hyper-redundant manipulator has superior dexterity and flexible manipulation ability. However, its inverse kinematics and configuration planning are very challenging. With the increase in the number of DOFs, the corresponding computation load or training set will be much larger for traditional methods (such as the generalized inverse method and the artificial neural network method). In this paper, a segmented geometry method is proposed for a spatial hyper-redundant manipulator to solve the above problems. Similar to the human arm, the hyper-redundant manipulator is segmented into three sections from geometry, i.e., shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Then, its kinematics can be solved separately according to the segmentation, which reduces the complexity of the solution and simplifies the computation of the inverse kinematics. Furthermore, the configuration is parameterized by several parameters, i.e., the arm-angle, space arc parameters, and desired direction vector. The shoulder has proximal four DOFs, which is redundant for positioning the elbow and avoiding the joint limit. The arm-angle parameter is defined to solve the redundancy. The wrist consists of the distal two DOFs, and its joints are determined to match the desired direction vector of the end-effector. All the other joints (except for the joints belonging to shoulder and wrist) compose the elbow. These joint angles are solved by using space arc-based method. The configuration planning for avoiding joint limit, obstacles, and inspecting narrow pipeline are detailed for practical applications. Finally, circular trajectory tracking and pipeline inspection are, respectively, simulated and experimented on a 20-DOFs hyper-redundant manipulator. The results show that the proposed method can give solutions of the three-dimensional-pose-determining problem and the configuration-planning problem. The computation of the inverse kinematics is simplified for real-time control. It can also be applied to other spatial hyper-redundant manipulators with similar serial configurations.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the φ-type stability and robust stability for a general class of stochastic reaction-diffusion neural networks (SRDNNs) with Dirichlet boundary conditions, infinite discrete time-varying delays, and infinite continuously distributed delays. By virtue of inequality techniques, properties of M-matrix, and theories of stochastic analysis, several sufficient criteria are obtained to guarantee the almost sure φ-type stability, pth moment φ-type stability, and φ-type robust stability of the underlying SRDNNs with hybrid unbounded time delays. With appropriate choices of the function φ, the φ-type stability reduces to the exponential stability, polynomial stability, and logarithmic stability. Additionally, the developed results herein include some existing ones as special cases. A numerical simulation is performed to substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {A Water Distribution System (WDS) is a critical infrastructure for society and economy, subject to frequent maintenance either for contingencies or planned operations. Maintenance procedures affect the hybrid dynamics of a WDS at stochastic time points, representing the completion of repair activities that change the WDS topology and operation mode. Hence, the problem of performability evaluation of the WDS behavior during a maintenance intervention falls in the class of stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs), for which existing numerical or simulative approaches cannot afford the complexity of realistic WDSs. We propose a viable approach that computes the expected demand not served during a maintenance procedure by integrating fluid-dynamic analysis of the WDS with quantitative evaluation of the procedure timing, notably assuming non-Markovian repair times over a bounded support. Different solution techniques are presented to evaluate the joint distribution of the times when the procedure affects the WDS, performing either simulation of the procedure model or state-space analysis based on an extension of the method of stochastic state classes. Feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods are assessed on a real WDS in terms of result accuracy and computational complexity, showing that the overall approach could be efficiently applied in higher level tasks including activity scheduling, resource planning, and budget allocation.},

  abstract     = {In the system and control community, the sliding mode control technology has been known as a tool which is able to handle system uncertainties and external disturbances. Simplicity in implementation and good stability performance are the other interesting features of the sliding modes. However, traditional sliding mode controllers exhibit two weaknesses, as follows: 1) generally, they have asymptotic stability in sliding mode dynamics which results in a slow speed system and 2) the so-called chattering phenomenon exists, which produces undesirable high frequency oscillations in the control signal. In this paper, the former problem is solved using a twofold terminal sliding manifold displaying desired transient and steady state behavior. The latter issue is responded to by a twofold sliding mode technology which leads to a continuous sliding control rule instead of a discontinuous switching control. The effects of uncertain terms as well as external perturbations with unknown bounds are fully compensated using updated parameters. The values of the updated parameters approach fixed values as the system trajectories converge to the equilibrium states. The analytical results of this paper are theoretically proved using the Lyapunov technique and the finite-time control strategy. Comparative computer simulations on a robotic manipulator confirm the fast convergence attribute and robust performance of the introduced adaptive robust nonsingular terminal sliding control algorithm.},

When unexpected events occur, such as machine breakdown and due date changes, manufacturers need to react quickly and revise the schedule accordingly. This paper presents a novel partial repair rescheduling solution that consists of a criterion and a scheduler. The former decides the segment of the original schedule to be repaired by detecting a match-up point. The impact of disturbances caused by unexpected events can be limited between the disturbing time and this match-up point. The scheduler generates a new schedule segment to replace the original and impacted one with single machine-oriented or machine-group-oriented match-up rescheduling algorithms. On practical demand, the proposed solution can be further updated due to the changing consideration of unexpected events and/or expanded performance criteria. The simulation results show that the proposed rescheduling methods have higher stability and efficiency than some well-known existing rescheduling methods.},

In this paper, we propose a new dual implicit mining-based latent friend recommendation model that simultaneously considers the implicit interest topics of users and the implicit link relationships between the users in the local topic cliques. Specifically, we first propose an algorithm called all reviews from a user and all tags from their corresponding items to learn the implicit interest topics of the users and their corresponding topic weights, then compute the user interest topic similarity using a symmetric Jensen-Shannon divergence. After that, we adopt the proposed weighted local random walk with restart algorithm to analyze the implicit link relationships between the users in the local topic cliques and calculate the weighted link relationship similarity between the users. Combining the user interest topic similarity with the weighted link relationship similarity in a unified way, we get the final latent friend recommendation list. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art latent friend recommendation methods under four different types of evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {An improved method for the real time sensitivity analysis in large scale complex systems is proposed in this paper. The method borrows principles from the event tracking of interrelated causal events and deploys clustering methods to automatically measure the relevance and contribution made by each input event data (ED) on system outputs. The ethos of the proposed event modeling (EM) technique is that the behavior or the state of a system is a function of the knowledge acquired about events occurring in the system and its wider operational environment. As such it builds on the theoretical and the practical foundation for the engineering of knowledge and data in modern and complex systems. The proposed EM platform EventiC filters noncontributory ED sources and has the potential to include information that was initially thought irrelevant or simply not considered at the design stage. The real-time ability to group and rank relevant input-output ED in order of its importance and relevance will not only improve the data quality, but leads to an improved higher level of mathematical formulization in the modern complex systems. The contribution of the approach to systems&#39; modeling is in the automation of data analysis, control, and plant process modeling. EventiC has been validated as the monitoring and the control system for a cement factory. In addition to the previously known parameters, the proposed EventiC identified new influential parameters that were previously unknown. It also filtered 18\% of the input data without compromising the data quality or the integrity. The solution has improved the quality of input variable selection and simplify plant control strategies.},

These collections bring the difficulties of managing and organizing the comprehensive information hidden in different texts of the system. To more effectively organize the multisourced texts and help online users acquire wider knowledge, we propose a business intelligence system which integrates the multisourced texts from multisources. Regarding in many occasions, multisourced texts share some common contents with respect to the same topics. For example, a tweet and a news report may talk about the same event. Therefore, our goal is to correlate such texts of different sources with respect to the similar topics and get integrated more comprehensive information to facilitate other data mining tasks as well as online applications. To handle the problem, we propose a heterogeneous information network-based text aligning (HINTA) framework in this paper. HINTA applies meta-paths to calculate the text similarities, and constructs correlated pairs between the two types of texts. Next, HINTA first applies anchored pairs as bridges to combine the different types of texts. Finally, three different inference methods are employed to align the multisourced texts. Experimental results on real-world dataset show the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework in addressing the texts alignment problem.},

To reduce the carbon emission, in real world practice, governments have executed different forms of policies to motivate the firms to operate in a sustainable manner. This paper aims to examine the value of bargaining contract when the supply chain member invests in the sustainability projects, and explore the effectiveness of the direct (e.g., cash grant) and indirect (e.g., an increased environmental tax rate) subsidies in reducing the total carbon emission. We first derive the optimal pricing and sustainability effort under the wholesale pricing contract when either the manufacturer or the retailer makes the sustainability investment. We then consider the supply chain coordination under the two-part tariff, revenue sharing, and bargaining contracts. We uncover that only the bargaining contract can coordinate the supply chain and a Pareto improvement is achieved when the bargaining power of the manufacturer is in a specific range. Finally, we reveal that both the direct and indirect subsidies can increase the sustainability effort but they are not always an effective tool to reduce the total carbon emissions.},

Then, the specified finite-time distributed observers are proposed by using the time-rescaling approach, where the finite terminal time can be specified in advance according to the task requirements. The advantage of time-rescaling method is that the asymptotic, exponential, or finite-time distributed observers can be converted to the specified finite-time distributed observers via choosing an appropriate continuously differentiable scaling function that satisfies some required properties to rescale time. Based on the distributed observers, the velocity-free attitude synchronization control torques are designed by virtue of observer-like systems. The performances of the specified finitetime distributed observers and the velocity-free attitude synchronization with distributed observers are illustrated through numerical/SimMechanics simulations.},

In general, the repulsive radius needs to be given by the user before the run. However, its optimal parameter setting is difficult and problem-dependent. To alleviate this drawback, in this paper, we first propose a dynamic repulsion technique, and then a general framework based on the dynamic repulsion technique and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is presented to effectively solve NES. The major advantages of our framework are: 1) the repulsive radius is controlled dynamically during the evolutionary process; 2) multiple roots of NES can be simultaneously located in a single run; 3) the diversity of the population is preserved due to the population reinitialization; and 4) different repulsion techniques and different EAs can be readily integrated into this framework. To extensively evaluate the performance of our framework, we choose 42 problems with diverse features as the test suite. In addition, some representative differential evolution and particle swarm optimization variants are incorporated into the framework. Our method is also compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results indicate that the dynamic repulsion technique can improve the performance of the original repulsion technique with static repulsive radius. Moreover, the proposed method is able to yield better results compared with other methods.},

First, the topological structure of BCNs under given SDSFC is investigated. The fixed point and sampled cycle are defined, respectively. It is found that sampled cycles allow elements to be repeated and not every element can be regarded as an initial state, and this is quite different from conventional cycles of BCNs. A theorem is presented to calculate the number of fixed points and an algorithm is given to find all fixed points and sampled cycles. Second, the set stabilization problem of BCNs by SDSFC is investigated based on the sampled point set and the sampled point control invariant set (SPCIS). A necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the global set stabilization of BCNs by SDSFC, and further sampled-data state feedback controllers are also designed. The interesting thing is that if a state enters the SPCIS as an unsampled point, then it may run out of the given set again, which is in sharp contrast to conventional BCNs. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the efficiency of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {As the requirements on powertrain efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs) are increasing, integrated motor-transmission (IMT) powertrain systems for EVs are becoming a promising solution. For the integration of IMT powertrain systems, the system state information and the actuator status are usually required for the closed-loop controller design or the on-board fault diagnosis. Embracing the demands, an observer for simultaneous estimation of input and system state of an IMT powertrain system is studied in this paper. It is well-known that controller area network (CAN) has been dominant in the vehicle network, which is used to communicate among controllers, sensors, and actuators. However, the CAN bus always induces time-varying delays when there are a number of communication nodes on the bus. The CAN-bus induced delay would result in vibrations in the vehicle powertrain or even deterioration of the entire closed-loop system. To deal with the CAN-bus induced delay in the estimation work for IMT powertrain systems, the potential random delays are considered in a three-state nonlinear model which represents the behavior of an IMT system. To estimate the input and state simultaneously, an adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) is adopted. As we know, the adopted AUKF has the benefits of dealing with system nonlinearities and calculating the noise covariance matrix automatically. Simulations and comparisons are carried out. We can see from the results that the proposed observer estimates the input and system state well. Moreover, the resulting estimation error is smaller comparing with the estimation error of the observer based on extended Kalman filter algorithm.},

Lack of information of the fire front causes many accidents. Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to cover wildfire is promising because it can replace humans in hazardous fire tracking and significantly reduce operation costs. In this paper, we propose a distributed control framework designed for a team of UAVs that can closely monitor a wildfire in open space, and precisely track its development. The UAV team, designed for flexible deployment, can effectively avoid in-flight collisions and cooperate well with neighbors. They can maintain a certain height level to the ground for safe flight above fire. Experimental results are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the UAV team in covering a spreading wildfire.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, fingerprint authentication systems have been extensively deployed in various applications, including attendance systems, authentications on smartphones, mobile payment authorizations, as well as various safety certifications. However, similar to the other biometric identification technologies, fingerprint recognition is vulnerable to artificial replicas made from cheap materials, such as silicon, gelatin, etc. Thus, it is especially necessary to distinguish whether a given fingerprint is a live or a spoof one prior to such authentication. In order to solve the problems above, a novel local descriptor named Weber local binary descriptor for fingerprint liveness detection (FLD) has been proposed in this paper. The method consists of two components: the local binary differential excitation component that extracts intensity-variance features and the local binary gradient orientation component that extracts orientation features. The co-occurrence probability of the two components is calculated to construct a discriminative feature vector, which is fed into support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The effectiveness of the proposed method is intuitively analyzed on the image samples and numerically demonstrated by Mahalanobis distance. Experiments are performed on two public databases from FLD competitions from 2011 and 2013. The results have proved that the proposed method obtains the best detection accuracy among the existing image local descriptors in FLD.},

By constructing a novel common sliding surface, this paper designs an event-triggered asynchronous SMC law, which just depends on the hidden mode information. A combination of the stochastic Lur&#39;e-type Lyapunov functional and the HMM approach is exploited to establish the sufficient conditions of the mean square stability with a prescribed H∞ performance and the reachability of a sliding region around the specified sliding surface.

  abstract     = {Finding multiple roots of nonlinear equation systems (NESs) in a single run is one of the most important challenges in numerical computation. We tackle this challenging task by combining the strengths of the repulsion technique, diversity preservation mechanism, and adaptive parameter control. First, the repulsion technique motivates the population to find new roots by repulsing the regions surrounding the previously found roots. However, to find as many roots as possible, algorithm designers need to address a key issue: how to maintain the diversity of the population. To this end, the diversity preservation mechanism is integrated into our approach, which consists of the neighborhood mutation and the crowding selection. In addition, we further improve the performance by incorporating the adaptive parameter control. The purpose is to enhance the search ability and remedy the trial-and-error tuning of the parameters of differential evolution (DE) for different problems. By assembling the above three aspects together, we propose a repulsion-based adaptive DE, called RADE, for finding multiple roots of NESs in a single run. To evaluate the performance of RADE, 30 NESs with diverse features are chosen from the literature as the test suite. Experimental results reveal that RADE is able to find multiple roots simultaneously in a single run on all the test problems. Moreover, RADE is capable of providing better results than the compared methods in terms of both root rate and success rate.},

  abstract     = {As the failure of power line insulators leads to the failure of power transmission systems, an insulator inspection system based on an aerial platform is widely used. Insulator defect detection is performed against complex backgrounds in aerial images, presenting an interesting but challenging problem. Traditional methods, based on handcrafted features or shallow learning techniques, can only localize insulators and detect faults under specific detection conditions, such as when sufficient prior knowledge is available, with low background interference, at certain object scales, or under specific illumination conditions. This paper discusses the automatic detection of insulator defects using aerial images, accurately localizing insulator defects appearing in input images captured from real inspection environments. We propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) cascading architecture for performing localization and detecting defects in insulators. The cascading network uses a CNN based on a region proposal network to transform defect inspection into a two-level object detection problem. To address the scarcity of defect images in a real inspection environment, a data augmentation method is also proposed that includes four operations: 1) affine transformation; 2) insulator segmentation and background fusion; 3) Gaussian blur; and 4) brightness transformation. Defect detection precision and recall of the proposed method are 0.91 and 0.96 using a standard insulator dataset, and insulator defects under various conditions can be successfully detected. Experimental results demonstrate that this method meets the robustness and accuracy requirements for insulator defect detection.},

A novel event-triggered control scheme on the basis of the relative interagent state is developed under the DoS attacks, by designing a link-based estimator to estimate the relative interagent state between intermitted communication instead of the absolute state. Compared with most of the existing work on the design of the triggering condition related to the state measurement error, the proposed triggering condition is designed based on the control input signal from the view of privacy protection, which can avoid continuous sampling for every agent. Besides, the attack frequency and attack duration of DoS attacks are analyzed and the secure consensus is reachable provided that the attack frequency and attack duration satisfy some certain conditions under the proposed control algorithm. “Zeno phenomenon” does not exhibit by proving that there exist different positive lower bounds corresponding to different link-based triggering conditions.

In addition, the improvement of the smoothness of human-smartphone interaction may be limited because the display subsystem is not optimized. Therefore, in this paper, we design a motion prediction queuing system, named MPQS, to improve the smoothness of human-smartphone interaction. For this, we use the information of vector, speed, movement, provided by the queuing mechanism of Android, to predict the movement of user-smartphone interaction. Based on the prediction, we then utilize available execution time between frames to perform image processing. We conducted a set of experiments on beagleboard-xM to evaluate the performance of MPQS.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the increased amount of users&#39; devices produce huge volumes of data that should be efficiently managed by modern applications. Streams are adopted to deliver data that, usually, are stored into a number of partitions. Splitting the data offers a lot of advantages as applications can process them in parallel, thus, they increase the speed of processing. Progressive analytics are also adopted to deliver partial responses, during processing, thus, saving time in the execution of applications. Data exploration and analytics queries are very significant for future applications. Usually, such queries demand for an ordered set of objects as a response and require intelligent predictive schemes to deliver the responses on top of the partial results retrieved by the distributed data partitions. A finite set of query processors are adopted to produce these partial results. Processors are placed in front of each partition and report progressive analytics to a central entity. In this paper, we envision the query controller (QC) as the central entity that collects progressive analytics and return the final response to users/applications. The QC receives partial ordered sets of objects and aggregates them to derive the final outcome. We focus on a QC that applies time-optimized techniques and aggregation operators to deliver every response, i.e., ordered sets, over streams of partial ordered subsets. We perform a comprehensive performance assessment with synthetic data and report on the performance of the QC. Our experimental evaluation reveals the pros and cons of the proposed model and a comparison assessment places this paper in the respective literature.},

  abstract     = {Graph matching is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, and lays the foundation for many computer vision and machine learning tasks. Approximate algorithms are necessary for graph matching due to its NP-complete nature. Inspired by the usage in network-related tasks, random walk is generalized to graph matching as a type of approximate algorithm. However, it may be inappropriate for the previous random walk-based graph matching algorithms to utilize continuous techniques without considering the discrete property. In this paper, we propose a novel random walk-based graph matching algorithm by incorporating both continuous and discrete constraints in the optimization process. Specifically, after interpreting graph matching by random walk, the continuous constraints are directly embedded in the random walk constraint in each iteration. Further, both the assignment matrix (vector) and the pairwise similarity measure between graphs are iteratively updated according the discrete constraints, which automatically leads the continuous solution to the discrete domain. Comparisons on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A fast retransmit, which reduces the sender&#39;s waiting time before retransmitting a lost segment, is applied to guarantee data integrity with no data loss in transmission. Based on fast retransmit, many application protocols have been enhanced and evolved to ensure quality of service and reduce data transmission time. One of application protocols is the multipath transmission control protocol which is catholically applied in modern computer networks. Communication lines used in this kind of network have different states, namely, failure, partial failure, and maintenance. Therefore, a computer network with a fast retransmit can be classified as stochastic and is called a stochastic-flow computer network with a fast retransmit (SCNFR). This paper assesses the system reliability of SCNFR for the successful transmission of demand d through k (k &gt; 1) separate minimal paths (kSMiP) under the latency. An algorithm is proposed to find all minimal capacity vectors (MCVs) that satisfy the demand and latency. Then, the system reliability is computed based on all MCVs. We adopt two practical cases of the pan-European research and education network and the Taiwan academic network to explore the effectiveness of the algorithm. The results show that the system reliability can be classified as decision reference while the manager decides the better kSMiP with higher system reliability.},

This paper shows how spatial discrepancies due to pose differences can occur in a haptic augmented virtuality system with an encountered-type haptic display. To mitigate this problem, we propose visual guidance, an algorithm that dynamically manipulates the visual scene to compensate for discrepancies. The effectiveness of this algorithm was verified in a pair of studies involving a button pressing task and spatial discrepancies between ±150 mm and ±40°. Experimental results show that discrepant trials using the technique yield error rates and a number of speed peaks (representing the number of targeting movements) that are comparable to those attained in trials with zero spatial discrepancy. This result was also achieved without requiring a dedicated adaptation or training process, ensuring the algorithm can be used immediately by users. A pair of follow-up studies also indicates the algorithm has little impact on subjective ratings of simulator sickness, suggesting that sporadic use of the algorithm will not negatively affect user&#39;s experience of a virtual environment. We believe that the visual guidance algorithm presented in this paper can be used to create more useful and compelling experiences in various haptic training applications incorporating encountered-type haptic displays.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a new orthogonal packing and time scheduling problem-3D space-time optimization problem (3D-STO). Given a rectangular sheet and a set of rectangular items, each item needs to be continuously processed with a time length on the sheet, the 3D-STO consists in arranging each item&#39;s loading time, location, and orientation for a certain period such that the total utilization time of the sheet, i.e., the makespan of the schedule, is minimized. The 3D-STO involves a series of 2D rectangular packing problem (2D-RPP) for the whole scheduling period. If the processing time of each item is simply regarded as a space dimension for the packing, then the 3D-STO can be reduced to an NP-hard packing problem-3D strip packing problem (3D-SPP). The 3D-STO differs from the 3D-SPP in that the position and orientation of items can be changed over the processing time (the third dimension) such that the 3D-STO has a much larger search space compared with the 3D-SPP. Hereby, the optimal solution of the 3D-STO is better than or equal to the optimal solution of the 3D-SPP, and a possibly better solution could be found for the 3D-STO model. As a new model, there is no algorithm or benchmark in the literature. Moreover, the 2D-RPP and 3D-SPP algorithms are not suitable for solving the 3D-STO which considers the packing and scheduling simultaneously. Hereby, we propose a caving-degree-based scheduling algorithm (CDS) for the 3D-STO. This is the first proposed 3DSTO algorithm. We also formalize the problem as a mixed integer programming model and solve it by ILOG CPLEX. For evaluation, we provide a synthesized method to generate a total of 195 various benchmark instances with guillotine and nonguillotine cut constraints. The comparative results show that CDS is more effective than the CPLEX solver for the 3D-STO. Also, when comparing CDS for the 3D-STO and the adapted CDS for the 3D-SPP, we see that the new 3D-STO model can enhance the flexibility of the item arrangement and make maximum utilization of the sheet and time.},

Using the concept of I-frames from imaging and animation, we approximate a solution to the nonlinear least squares problem via a two-step process, an I-frame optimization, and an incremental optimization. The I-frame optimization solves for the parameters using a subset of data points and the incremental optimization adjusts the parameters in between the I-frames. We show that the criterion of generating I-frames can affect the average squared error of the final solution. Our methodology benefits from being scalable as the number of parameters and amount of data increases with an appropriate I-frame generation criterion.},

On the other hand, in dealing with the sparsity problem, community context information that is extracted from the social network containing all users is used for predicting unprovided ratings. As predicted ratings are not a hundred percent accurate, while the provided ratings are actually evaluated by users, we also develop a new method for calculating user-user similarities, in which provided ratings are considered to be more significant than predicted ones.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new intelligent data-driven adaptive method (IDAM) of performing automatic online searches in real time. An online implementation of the proposed IDAM achieved rapid real-time optimization of system integration scaling factors for an automatic touch panel lamination machine. The proposed IDAM combines three-level orthogonal arrays (OAs), signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the best combined strategy, and a stepwise ratio. Three-level OA experiments with factor values are used to perform positional experiments, and SNRs are calculated for each experimental value. After the best combination of factor values (in terms of factor effect) is determined, new three-level factor values are derived by applying a stepwise ratio and used in further three-level OA experiments. These steps are repeated until the stopping criterion is met. Compared to conventional methods, the use of the IDAM in practical industrial applications, i.e., online real-time precision positioning for automatic touch panel lamination machines, reduces the number of experiments needed to obtain the system integration scaling factors that minimize the iteration count. For example, the IDAM required less than 40 online real-time experiments with a specific stepwise ratio for system integration scaling factors that met the minimum requirement of two iterations. In 50 independent experimental runs using the robust scaling factors obtained by the method, an average of 2.15 iterations was needed to achieve a positional accuracy within 5 μm. The main advantage of the proposed IDAM over conventional methods is its effectiveness for automatically finding robust parameters for online alignment systems in real time and with fewer experiments.},

The main task is to compare between images which are acquired from different sensing spectrums for identity recognition. Using an extreme learning machine, the proposed recursive formulation seeks a direct optimization to the classification error goal where the solution converges exactly to the batch mode solution. Due to the nonlinear nature of the classification error objective function, formulation of a recursive solution that converges is an important and nontrivial task. Based on this recursive formulation, an online HFR system is designed. The system is evaluated using two challenging heterogeneous face databases with images captured under visible, near infrared and infrared spectrums. The proposed system shows promising performance which is comparable with that of competing state-of-the-arts.},

In order to avoid the noncausal problem, the original system is transformed into an input-output expression in accordance with the diffeomorphism theory. Then, in order to establish a quick response to the fault, the fault tolerant controller with minimum learning parameters has been designed such that the semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of all the variables in the resulting closed-loop systems can be guaranteed. Finally, the output feedback FTC approach is applied to the interconnected CSTRs, and the comparisons with existing methods are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing has been increasingly concerned in scientific computing area. More and more enterprises and research institutes have migrated their applications to the clouds. Due to the complexity of cloud computing system in structural and behavioral aspects, how to design the fault tolerant cloud computing system becomes a challenging problem. This paper investigates the modeling and analysis of fault tolerant strategy for deadline constrained task scheduling in cloud computing. First, a formal description language is defined to accurately model the different components of cloud application, and use it to characterize the operational mechanisms and fault behaviors. Second, we propose a fault tolerant strategy, which includes the scheduling mechanism, synchronization mechanism, and exception mechanism, to dynamically compute the execution mode and required virtual machine for tasks, thus ensuring the reliability and real-time requirement of cloud application. An enforcement algorithm is also designed to realize the proposed strategy. Third, the techniques of Petri nets are provided to analyze and validate the correctness of proposed method. Finally, several experiments are done to illustrate that the reliability of cloud application is improved and its deadline is met.},

  abstract     = {Tidal power is an emerging technology with great potential to provide a sustainable means of renewable energy in many areas worldwide. However, the nature of the underwater environment provides challenges. Submerged machinery cannot be easily accessed for inspections, and turbines must be brought to the surface for maintenance. This is an expensive process and results in prolonged periods of downtime where no power can be supplied to the grid. Condition monitoring systems, capable of accurately and remotely assessing the health state of machinery while in operation, can therefore be of great value to this industry. This paper presents an approach for condition monitoring of a tidal turbine&#39;s gearbox from monitoring data with low sample rates. Models of normal behavior were trained using weighted least squares regression, where prediction errors are used to identify changes in response. This paper then examines how prediction errors from a number of different cases (including changes in control scheme and simulated gearbox faults) can be interpreted by operators to classify anomalous behavior.},

With adaptive hidden layer and tunable radii of hyper-spheres, AdaHS has strong capability of local learning like instance-based algorithms, but free from slow searching speed and excessive memory consumption. The experiments showed that AdaHS is robust, adaptive, and highly accurate. It is especially suitable for dynamic data in which patterns are changing, decision borders are complicated, and instances with the same label can be spherically clustered.},

In this correspondence, an optimal operation of HC refining system is presented using nonlinear multiobjective model predictive control strategies that aim at set-point tracking objective of pulp quality, economic objective, and specific energy (SE) consumption objective, respectively. First, a set of input and output data at different times are employed to construct the subprocess model of the state process model for the HC refining system, and then the Wiener-type model can be obtained through combining the mechanism model of Canadian Standard Freeness and the state process model that determines their structures based on Akaike information criterion. Second, the multiobjective optimization strategy that optimizes both the set-point tracking objective of pulp quality and SE consumption is proposed simultaneously, which uses NSGA-II approach to obtain the Pareto optimal set. Furthermore, targeting at the set-point tracking objective of pulp quality, economic objective, and SE consumption objective, the sequential quadratic programming method is utilized to produce the optimal predictive controllers. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can make the HC refining system provide a better performance of setpoint tracking of pulp quality when these predictive controllers are employed. In addition, while the optimal predictive controllers orienting with comprehensive economic objective and SE consumption objective, it has been shown that they have significantly reduced the energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {An adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with a sliding-level particle swarm optimization (SL-PSO) is proposed for optimizing parameters of a chemicalmechanical process for polishing a color filter (CMP-CF). The SL-PSO is used not only to find the best membership function types, but also to optimize the premise and consequent parameters for ANFIS. The important process parameters for CMP-CF included the initial time, polishing time, polishing pad weight (down force), slurry chemicals, and rotation speed. The output targets were red pixels, green pixels, blue pixels, and the surface roughness. First, the performance of the SL-PSO was tested with 18 continuous global numerical optimization problems, including six unimodal functions, seven multimodal functions, and five complex rotated and shifted functions. Nonparametric Wilcoxon tests were also used in multiple-problem analysis for simultaneous comparison of various algorithms over a problem set. The computational experiments showed that the proposed SL-PSO approach outperforms PSO-based methods reported in the literature. Finally, the proposed SL-PSO method was used to optimize CMP-CF parameters. The experimental results showed that the ANFIS with SL-PSO outperforms the conventional ANFIS method and conventional back propagation neural network in terms of prediction accuracy. A practical industrial application in a CF manufacturer showed that the ANFIS with SL-PSO obtained superior results compared to the previous method and immediately enhanced production efficiency. Together, these experimental results indicate that the proposed ANFIS with SL-PSO is a reliable method for optimizing CMP-CF processes.},

This theory is a generalization of probability distribution and offers a mathematical representation for two types of uncertainty-based information: 1) discord and 2) nonspecificity. Several measures have already been developed to quantify these two types of uncertainty. They have been called total uncertainty (TU) measures since they quantify both types of uncertainty. The generalized Hartley measure and the maximum entropy have been the only measures so far that satisfy a list of properties very desirable for practical applications. Recently, two new measures of nonspecificity and TU based on belief intervals have been proposed. These two measures do not satisfy the properties of additivity, superadditivity, and subadditivity in the TE. The present critique is about these shortcomings and provides a more complete analysis of those uncertainty measures with respect to a list of desired properties. A potential consequence of an ill-characterized measure may yield selecting an inappropriate rule for decision-making in the processing chain from data to information to decisions.},

  abstract     = {During the development or deployment of discrete event simulation systems, many sudden changes in requirements emerge. To embrace the changes rapidly and reduce development costs, attaching reusable, and black-boxed components to existing systems has been regarded as one of the most effective approaches because modifications at the code level are generally costly and risky. However, since this approach requires components that are an exact fit, it may not be easy to avoid the modifications at the source code level actually. Moreover, the required components may not exist. Hence, this paper applies black-box extensibility to simulation systems in order to avoid the modifications. This paper proposes adaptive discrete event simulation systems using event control models for extending and modifying semantics through event-based simulation interface. With the proposed work, the simulation events are modulated, deleted, and generated by the event-oriented control functions in the event control model to embrace the changes of requirements. It can substitute for the modifications at the code level and extend the existing behavioral semantics. As a result, the proposed work provides a new alternative step in the development process with reusable components to avoid modifications at the source code level. The new step will lead to rapid adaptations of existing simulation systems. To support the effectiveness of this approach, this paper will describe applicable examples based on our empirical studies.},

Moreover, translating MRE wave images into soft tissue elasticity is a nontrivial issue for clinical professionals and healthcare practitioners. An interactive system-OpenMRE-is thus developed with the aid of ImageJ for numerical MRE study. It is comprised of two comparatively independent toolkits, namely MREA for simulation and MREP for interpretation. MREA mainly deals with the forward problem of MRE, and provides a numerical platform to determine the propagation and distribution of specially designed elastic wave. It is possible to numerically study some state-of-the-art paradigms including multisource and multifrequency MRE. The resultant wave images are interpretable in MREP that is designed for the inverse problem of MRE. It consists of the algorithms for phase unwrapping, directional filtering, and elasticity reconstruction. In a word, OpenMRE offers the MRE community a convenient and well-functioning system for interactive MRE study.},

Although many studies have been carried to assess how the power structure impacts supply chains, most of them only focus on the power dynamics in the vertical competition or horizontal competition. This paper systematically examines the impacts of bidimensional power structure on a supply chain. Considering a triadic setting that is made of two rival retailers and a common manufacturer, we compare the equilibriums for the supply chain and individual firms with five different possible power structures. The analysis results show that the bidimensional power dynamics have a significant impact. Furthermore, the impacts of the bidimensional power structure are also dependent on the nature of customer demand. This paper provides important management implications that are supportive for companies to make strategic and operational decisions.},

The objective of this paper was to develop a utility-based model with preference parameters for clarifying the reasons for the behavior underlying network evolution. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm combined with snowball sampling (SS) was proposed for parameter estimation. EM is suitable to cope with the data set with latent variables or missing data and SS would be helpful in decreasing the network size without loss of critical information. Simulation studies were further performed to assess the effects of network size, seed set size, meeting probabilities, sampling waves, and sampling methods on the summary statistics of estimates and to highlight the importance of the unobserved variables. Finally, an application was developed on the Facebook platform to demonstrate the model. In all, the proposed model is expected to be a novel tool for exploring and understanding the evolution of social networks.},

The proposed theorem recognizes the existence of the diffeomorphism and feedback law for linearizing the nonlinear stochastic system without finding them. Checking the conditions of the proposed theorem in order to recognize the solvability of the feedback complete linearization problem, needs only simple matrices multiplication instead of complete solving the problem. The previous works need to solve a set of partial differential equations to recognize the solvability of the problem. The nonlinear stochastic systems that satisfy the conditions of the proposed theorem are completely linearizable, then linear stochastic control methods can be applied to control them and more accurate results in less computation will be achieved.

We validate the proposed architectural and algorithmic concepts via several realistic mission scenarios. We conduct sensitivity analyses to quantify the robustness and proactivity of our approach, as well as to measure the value of information used in the allocation process.

First, two active links of the planar PAn-1 manipulator are chosen to be the active links of a planar virtual passive-active-active (PAA) manipulator, which guarantees that the geometric reachable range of the planar virtual PAA manipulator is the same as that of the planar PAn-1 manipulator. The planar PAn-1 manipulator is reduced to the planar virtual PAA manipulator by keeping the states of two active links in their initial values and controlling the states of the remaining n - 3 active links to zero. Then, the planar virtual PAA manipulator is equivalent to two planar virtual Acrobots by adopting two-stage control method. Based on two sets of angle constraint relationships corresponding to two planar virtual Acrobots, an online differential evolution algorithm is employed to obtain all link target angles of the planar virtual PAA manipulator. Next, two Lyapunov functions, each of which is constructed based on the active link angle of one planar virtual Acrobot, are used to design controllers to realize the system control objective. Finally, Simulation results of a planar PAA-active manipulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Allocating an exponential weighting function to each local model, the nonlinear dynamics of the global system is approximated by combining all local models. The variational Bayesian (VB) approach is adopted to find the solution to the problem of parameter estimation. For the parameter uncertainties, instead of the point estimation, the posterior distribution of each model parameters is obtained under the framework of the VB approach.

The rate-dependent property of PEA is identified as a linear dynamic submodel. Moreover, a pointing control system with two dualPEA-axis steering mirrors is developed, which can regulate the 4-degree-of-freedom pose of a laser beam. The coordinated control of four PEAs is realized based on the Jacobian matrix. The learned inverse PEA models are used for the feedforward compensation of each PEA&#39;s nonlinearity.

The highlight of the error-driven nonlinear feedback technique is that the feedback gain self-regulates versus different levels of output and virtual tracking errors, this reflects the classical control design criterions commendably: relatively high feedback gains can be implemented to guarantee disturbances and uncertainties attenuation and so on to improve the control performance when small tracking errors are measured, and relatively small feedback gains can be implemented to circumvent the problems of actuator and states saturations when large tracking errors are measured. The complexity problem of the traditional backstepping design is circumvented owe to the peculiarity of DSC method. Caused by the compound error functions of nonlinear feedback dynamics, a nonquadratic Lyapunov function is used to deduce the conditions of closed-loop stability. Fuzzy logic systems and error transformation-based method are used in the online learning of completely unknown dynamics and the prescribed performance tracking, respectively.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have the potential to deliver continuous SHM at a low cost. We present a novel WSN system that monitors ambient structural vibrations and looks for deviations from a baseline response to assess the condition of the structure under observation. Efficiency is achieved by implementing our damage assessment process with an innovative wireless-sensor-based technique involving look-up tables. By using look-up tables we are able to minimize computations. Only 4-6 integer and two floatingpoint operations are required per damage assessment. This is in contrast to the majority of other methods that rely on precise engineering models of the monitored structures. Our look-up table technique is benchmarked against the brute force approach, which involves solving equations, by measuring the execution time of each implementation on a low-power Microchip microcontroller. Here, we were able to achieve a speedup of roughly five. In addition, we investigate a tradeoff between average transmission power and the number of measurements required to make a decision as to the structure&#39;s condition. Finally, we benchmark our damage assessment process using a case study to verify its efficacy for bridges.},

We design a novel way of calculating local outlier factors in a relevant subspace with the probability density of local datasets; this new approach can effectively reflect the outlier degree of a data object that does not satisfy the distribution of the local dataset in the relevant subspace. Attribute dimensions of a relevant subspace, and local outlier factors are expressed as vital contextual information, which improves the interpretability of outliers. Importantly, the selection of N data objects with the largest local outlier factor value is categorized as contextual outliers in our solution. To this end, our scalable mining algorithm, which incorporates the locality sensitive hashing distributed strategy, is implemented on a Hadoop cluster. The experimental results validate the effectiveness, interpretability, scalability, and extensibility of the algorithm using both synthetic data and stellar spectral data as experimental datasets.},

The proposed convergence rate is described in terms of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the network graph. The generalized power iteration algorithm is then introduced based on the Krylov subspace method to compute the proposed expected convergence rate in a centralized fashion. To this end, the Laplacian matrix of the network is transformed to a new matrix such that existing techniques can be used to find the eigenvalue representing the expected convergence rate of the network. The convergence analysis of the centralized algorithm is performed with a prescribed upper bound on the approximation error of the algorithm. A distributed version of the centralized algorithm is then developed using the notion of consensus observer. The efficiency of the algorithms is subsequently demonstrated by simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to design a dissipative fuzzy filter for a class of discrete-time nonlinear networked systems. In order to adopt the limited communication links, we employ an eventtriggered scheme to reduce the number of transmitted data in the network by preventing the unnecessary ones from releasing. Due to the digital channel, the data to be transmitted should be quantized and a logarithmic quantizer is employed. Then, when the part of released data is transmitted in the network, data losses is captured by a Bernoulli process. Consequently, the uncomplete data sequence is compensated by the buffer and then send to the filter. During this process, a new random series is developed to help constructing the filtering systems. Thus, a novel method is presented to guarantee the filter error system to be dissipative based on the T-S fuzzy model approach. Finally, an example concerned with Henon mapping system is provided to verify the validity of the proposed design method.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for Web services encourages commercial cloud service providers to publish their own services with various functional and nonfunctional capabilities in different cloud platforms. The aggregation of atomic services from multiple service repositories is the main idea of the service composition concept in multiclouds. The cloud Web service composition is a suitable way for satisfying users&#39; complex requests by integrating services from different clouds in order to create a new value-added composite service. The time required to serve a composite service by a multicloud environment is an important parameter, which depends on different factors, ranging from the service composition and selection algorithm to the number of atomic services published in the clouds. In this paper, a model based on timed colored Petri nets (TCPNs) is proposed to evaluate the service composition in multicloud environments while minimizing the number of clouds involved in serving a composite service request. The proposed TCPN graphically models the process of request submission, composite service analysis, service selection, and service provisioning in a multicloud environment. It also assesses both mean response time of the environment and probability of dropping composite requests. The verification of the accuracy of the proposed model is done by comparing the results obtained from the TCPN model, in two different scenarios, with the results from the CloudSim framework. These results confirm that our proposed TCPN model can appropriately model the system and evaluate its performance more efficiently than the CloudSim.},

Such relations include not only co-occurrence-based explicit relations but also nonco-occurrence-based implicit ones. Explicit relations have been substantially studied by rule mining-based approaches, including association rule mining and causal rule discovery. In contrast, implicit relations have received much less attention but could be more actionable. In this paper, we focus on the implicit relations between items which rarely or never co-occur while each of them co-occurs with other identical items (link items) with a high probability. A framework integrates both explicit and hidden item dependencies and a corresponding efficient algorithm IRRMiner captures such implicit relations with implicit rule inference. Experimental results show that IRRMiner not only infers implicit rules of various sizes consisting of both frequent and infrequent items effectively, it also runs at least four times faster than IARMiner, a typical indirect association rule mining algorithm which can only mine size-2 indirect association rules between frequent items. IRRMiner is applied to make recommendations and shows that the identified implicit rules can increase recommendation reliability.},

The control policy that governs mission steps can be computed off-board or onboard depending upon the availability of communication bandwidth and on-board computational resources. This paper considers a sample science mission, where the spacecraft collects data from celestial objects viewable only within a certain orbit true anomaly window. Science data collection requires the spacecraft to slew its instrument(s) toward each target, and continue pointing in the direction of the target while the spacecraft traverses its orbit. Robustness and stochastic optimization of scientific reward, is achieved at the cost of computational complexity. Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) is exploited to reduce the computational time and effort to manageable levels and to treat larger problem sizes. The proposed ADP algorithm partitions the state-space based on true anomaly regions, enabling grouping of adjacent science targets. Results of a simulation case study demonstrate that our proposed ADP approach performs quite well for reasonable ranges of key problem parameters.},

Its testing strategy can be adjusted online by using the testing data collected during the software testing process. However, it requires complex parameter estimation which results in excessive computational overhead that may hinder the applicability of AT. In this paper, we propose an approach called AT based on moment estimation (AT-ME) to address this problem. The proposed approach uses moment estimation to serve as the algorithm of parameter estimation, which reduces the complexity of AT-ME. In addition, a dynamic length for testing action is set to limit the number of decisions without influencing the test effectiveness. The proposed approach has been validated on the Siemens test suite, which includes seven real programs. The experiments show that AT-ME can reduce the computational overhead of AT without compromising overall testing efficiency. Results demonstrate that AT-ME is a feasible and effective AT strategy.},

To approach the model mismatching problem induced by random quantization, some quantized Kalman filters have been presented in the previous work, such as the quantized Kalman filter with strong tracking filtering (QKF-STF), the variational Bayesian adaptive quantized Kalman filter (VB-AQKF), and a centralized fusion frame-based complex quantized filter called variational Bayesian adaptive QKF-STF (VB-AQKF-STF). Based on the previous work for the single sensor system, a distributed complex quantized filter is designed in this paper. A novel quantized Kalman filter based on multiple-method fusion scheme (QKF-MMF) is proposed. Similar to the VB-AQKF-STF, the QKF-MMF can also realize joint estimation on the state and the quantization error covariance under the distributed fusion frame. Furthermore, it extends the single sensor results to multisensor tracking systems by using centralized and distributed fusion frames. Two multisensor quantized fusion estimators are proposed for a parallel structure with main-secondary processors in the fusion center. The weighted fusion and embedded integration ways are deeply applied to design the multisensor quantized fusion methods. The proposed work can perfect the quantized estimation algorithms and provide different choices for practical engineering applications.},

In this paper, we propose a beliefdesire-intention modeling approach to predict suppliers&#39; behavior and provide inspection suggestions to buyers to overcome the problem. Assuming access to the production process, our approach can represent suppliers&#39; knowledge of production and deception to mimic their reasoning processes and predict their deception intentions. This flexible approach can also adapt to environmental changes and deliver effective results. In this paper, we build a prototype system for supply chain quality inspections based on the proposed method.

With a backward strategy, the scheduling problem of such singlerobot-arm cluster tools is well-studied in the literature. It is much more challenging to schedule a more general case whose optimal scheduling strategy is not limited to the backward one. This work uses a timed Petri net (PN) to model the dynamic behavior of the system and presents a method to determine the optimal scheduling strategy for the system. Based on its PN model and the obtained strategy, it reveals that the key issue to schedule such a tool is to determine when and how long the robot should wait for. Based on this finding, this work establishes for the first time the necessary and sufficient conditions regarding the existence of an optimal and feasible one-wafer cyclic schedule for singlerobot-arm cluster tools. It then formulates a computationally efficient linear program to find it if existing, and finally gives industrial examples to show the application and power of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Overlapping coalition formation (OCF), which provides a natural framework for modeling scenarios where each agent can join and allocate their resources to several completely different coalitions at the same time, has become a very active topic in multiagent systems. For OCF in resource-constrained and subadditive task oriented domains, an agent may not possess sufficient resources to meet the needs of multiple coalitions simultaneously. As a result, there may exist many potential resource conflicts among the rival overlapping coalitions. To tackle such situations, we first present a natural variation of the traditional OCF model and analyze the size of the solution space and the computational complexity of the overlapping coalition structure generation (OCSG) problem. Next, we develop a generic task-oriented heuristic (TOH) for individual repairs that can be used in binary meta-heuristic algorithms to generate overlapping coalitions in a parallel manner. Moreover, we show how the proposed TOH repairs a 2-D individual to resolve resource conflicts and discuss several basic properties. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of TOH, we compare it with the existing agent-oriented heuristic for the OCSG problem. The empirical results demonstrate that TOH is of high efficiency and effectiveness in harsh environments with fierce competition over scarce resources.},

A planning horizon contains multiple periods. Different periods have different demands of products and hence should have different supply chain decisions, which mainly include facilities&#39; locations, the environment protection level in facilities, as well as the transportation flows of products in the supply chain. For each facility in two consecutive periods, the changes of the location and environment protection level related decisions may incur adjustment cost. A bi-objective mixed-integer programming model is proposed to minimize both the total cost and the CO2 emissions of the supply chain during the planning horizon with multiple periods. A solution approach is proposed to solve the model. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In order to understand how geometric errors propagate and how deviations accumulate in a six-axis motion platform (SMP), a new geometric error model based on the stream of variation (SOV) theory is presented in this paper. SOV theory is widely used in industrial engineering with several steps or phases. The conventional geometric error model only calculates the initial and final orientation, yet the deviations after each step in the whole process are still unknown, which are critical parameters in measuring the product quality. In this new error modeling method, each step in the alignment and welding process in SMP can be considered as a station. Thus, the deviations can also be derived after each station, which is beneficial for error identification. Based on the new error modeling approach involving SOV theory, the validation of an optimized configuration is developed by a series of calculations results. By observing the deviations after each station, the optimized configuration can improve accuracy and reduce power loss compared to a traditional configuration. The new error modeling approach based on SOV theory is systematic and comprehensive, and can be applied in other similar environments.},

  abstract     = {A finger biometric system at an unconstrained environment is presented in this paper. A technique for hand image normalization is implemented at the preprocessing stage that decomposes the main hand contour into finger-level shape representation. This normalization technique follows subtraction of transformed binary image from binary hand contour image to generate the left-side of finger profiles (LSFPs). Then, XOR is applied to LSFP image and hand contour image to produce the right side of finger profiles. During feature extraction, initially, 30 geometric features are computed from every normalized finger. The rank-based forward–backward greedy algorithm is followed to select relevant features and to enhance classification accuracy. Two different subsets of features containing 9 and 12 discriminative features per finger are selected for two separate experimentations those use the ${k}$ -nearest neighbor and the random forest (RF) for classification on the Bosphorus hand database. The experiments with the selected features of four fingers except the thumb have obtained improved performances compared to features extracted from five fingers and also other existing methods evaluated on the Bosphorus database. The best identification accuracies of 96.56\% and 95.92\% using the RF classifier have been achieved for the right- and left-hand images of 638 subjects, respectively. An equal error rate of 0.078 is obtained for both types of the hand images.},

  abstract     = {For leader-following multiagent systems with input saturation, the existing protocols use a low gain feedback approach to achieve semi-global consensus. The main drawback of this approach is the ineffective utilization of the actuator potential, resulting in bad performance. To improve the transient performance of the consensus tracking, this paper proposes a gain scheduled approach for multiagent systems subject to the saturator saturations. A novel kind of scheduler-based protocols are proposed, which consists of state feedback controllers with time-varying gain and parameter schedulers. The role of the controllers is to achieve the consensus tracking, while the schedulers can accelerate this consensus progress by enlarging the gain parameter. To remove the dependence of the schedulers on global information, a minimum-value-based consensus algorithm is put forward, with idea of driving all values of agents throughout the network to their minimum value. Its implementation is guaranteed by the network-topology connectivity. Finally, our approach is further extended to the case where the leader’s control input is nonzero, time-varying, and bounded. The discontinuous protocol and its continuous approximation counterpart are designed, yielding the exact- and quasi-consensus tracking, respectively. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis.},

A sufficient condition that is dependent on the known sojourn probabilities of switching signals is proposed to ascertain the reachable set of the closed-loop system, which is a hidden Bernoulli model, mean square contained in an ellipsoid-like set. Several nonfragile and nonsynchronous controllers are parameterized to guarantee the corresponding requirements to be satisfied for the closed-loop systems.

Modeling of room temperature dynamics is the first-step in designing an efficient air-conditioning system. In this regard, this paper proposes a semi-nonlinear thermal model: ordinary differential equation, with parameters as nonlinear functions of ambient temperature and cooling air flow-rate. To validate the performance of the model, a three-roomed building, equipped with an air-conditioning system is modeled, and Navier-Stokes equations are solved to simulate the temporal evolution of temperatures for different ambient temperatures and cooling air flow-rates. The steady-state temperature and transient solution parameters of the thermal model are assumed to be polynomial functions of ambient temperature and flowrate, and are determined by minimizing the errors between the thermal model- and the computational fluid dynamics-based solutions of final and transient temperatures, respectively. The proposed thermal model of third-order and nonlinear type transient coefficients is shown to predict the temporal evolution of temperature accurately. Further increase in prediction accuracy is achieved by recursively updating the parameters online using extended Kalman filter. The high prediction accuracy of the proposed thermal model makes it a potential candidate for the design of an optimal temperature regulator.},

Thus, the quick response (QR) strategy is crucial for MC supply chains. Prior studies in related areas only examine MC supply chains with limited features and topics, such as measures for win-win coordination or profit risk analysis, but without a comprehensive consideration of these aspects together. Besides, the systems enhancement schemes are not yet explored. This paper aims to fill these gaps and generate novel insights. Among the findings, we show that a higher salvage value of the consumer returned items and a higher salvage value of the unused inventories both can reduce the value of QR for the supplier. We illustrate how a simple two-part tariff contract and a sophisticated hybrid contract can achieve win-win coordination with different levels of flexibility. We also conduct a profit risk analysis on the MC supply chain. Finally, we demonstrate how three practical measures, namely technology investment, product design improvement, standardization of component, can further improve the MC supply chain system&#39;s performance.},

The expert system is the first of its kind that consists of multiple concurrently activated BRB subsystems, in which each subsystem has its distinctive outputs and uses the evidential reasoning approach for inference. This novel modeling approach can be applied to identify fault modes that may co-exist. In essence, the group of BRB subsystems is used to model the nonlinear relationships between the fault features and the fault modes in marine diesel engines. The initial BRB expert system can be established by using expert experience and then optimized by using the data samples accumulated during the operation of marine diesel engines. Due to limitations in knowledge and data collected, ignorance is also considered in some BRB subsystems. The proposed BRB expert system is applied to abnormal wear detection for a kind of marine diesel engine. The performance of the BRB expert system is investigated in comparison with that of artificial neural network (ANN) models, support vector machine (SVM) models, and binary logistic regression model with fivefold cross-validation. The results show that the BRB expert system can be used for fault diagnosis of marine diesel engines in a probabilistic manner, which outperforms the ANN models, SVM models, and the binary logistic regression model in terms of accuracy and stability, and can effectively identify concurrent faults.},

The main objective of this paper is to design a fuzzy rule-based modified repetitive controller such that the system output can track any given periodic reference signal even in the presence of periodic disturbances. For this purpose, by employing fuzzy-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional together with the free-weighting matrix technique, a new set of sufficient conditions is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee the robust stability of the resulting closed-loop system. Based on these conditions and using internal model principle, it is shown that the system output tracks the given reference input within the desired error. Finally, two application-oriented examples are presented to validate the obtained theoretical results in which the proposed control design scheme gives better performance over the existing control scheme.},

This paper presents a challenging role assignment problem in collaboration, called GRA with budget constraints (GRABC). This paper contributes a thorough investigation of the GRABC problem including: 1) the first formalization of the proposed problem; 2) a set of practical solutions to different forms of this problem by using the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization package (CPLEX); 3) a set of necessary conditions for these problems to possess feasible solutions to improve the CPLEX solutions; and 4) a synthesized process to deal with GRABC problems.

  abstract     = {There are two problems in the traditional crowdsourcing systems for handling complex tasks. First, decomposing complex tasks into a set of micro-subtasks requires the decomposition capability of the requesters; thus, some requesters may abandon using crowdsourcing to accomplish a large number of complex tasks since they cannot bear such heavy burden by themselves. Second, tasks are often assigned redundantly to multiple workers to achieve reliable results, but reliability may not be ensured when there are many malicious workers in the crowd. Currently, it is observed that the workers are often connected through social networks, a feature that can significantly facilitate task allocation and task execution in crowdsourcing. Therefore, this paper investigates crowdsourcing in social networks and presents a novel context-aware reliable crowdsourcing approach. In our presented approach, the two problems in traditional crowdsourcing are addressed as follows: 1) the complex tasks can be performed through autonomous coordination between the assigned worker and his contextual workers in the social network; thus, the requesters can be exempt from a heavy computing load for decomposing complex tasks into subtasks and combing the partial results of subtasks, thereby enabling more requesters to accomplish a large number of complex tasks through crowdsourcing, and 2) the reliability of a worker is determined not only by the reputation of the worker himself but also by the reputations of the contextual workers in the social network; thus, the unreliability of transient or malicious workers can be effectively addressed. The presented approach addresses two types of social networks including simplex and multiplex networks. Based on theoretical analyses and experiments on a real-world dataset, we find that the presented approach can achieve significantly higher task allocation and execution efficiency than the previous benchmark task allocation approaches; moreover, the presented contextual reputation mechanism can achieve relatively higher reliability when there are many malicious workers in the crowd.},

To handle this problem which cannot be dealt with directly using the existing methods, a distributed adaptive observer is introduced so that the controllers are decoupled and the difficulty caused by the unknown control directions can be overcome by adopting the existing Nussbaum functions and the unknown control directions of agents are allowed to be nonidentical.

As the main contribution of this paper, a global nonrecursive tracking design procedure is first proposed to render a simple construction of a realizable output feedback control law, whose gain selections follow the conventional pole placement approach while the stability margin can be guaranteed via a sufficiently large scaling gain. By introducing a Lyapunov function which neglects the virtual controllers in essence, rigorous analysis is presented to ensure the global stability. In addition, finite-time and asymptotical tracking results can now be achieved within the same design framework whereas the tunable homogeneous degree plays as a key role. As another contribution, by proposing a saturated dynamic compensator, a less ambitious but practical control objective, namely semiglobal stability is achieved of the closed-loop system to relax the requirement of the restrictive growth conditions for global control design. Taking consideration of the case when system is subject to mismatched disturbances, a unified design and stability analysis framework shows that the practical tracking result can also be realized. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the nonrecursive design and the simplicity of the proposed tracking control algorithm.},

However, the majority of the existing works are based on the strict condition that the weights of MNNs are known and determined. When the parameters are unknown, the obtained results may be inapplicable. Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate the synchronization problem of the delayed MNNs with unknown parameters. Due to the parameter uncertainties of MNNs, a novel response system and an adaptive control method are proposed under different assumptions. The update laws for weights in the response system and the gains of adaptive controllers are developed to synchronize the proposed response system with the delayed MNNs.

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the liveness analysis and deadlock control for automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) with multiple resource requirements. Such an AMS is modeled by a class of generalized Petri nets called systems of simple sequential processes with multiple resources (S 3 PMR). It is shown that a deadlock of the considered AMSs can be characterized by the saturation of a structural object in S 3 PMR, called perfect resource transition-circuit (PRT-circuit). As a consequence, an S 3 PMR is live if and only if no PRT-circuit is saturated at any reachable marking. To ensure the system liveness, one has to prevent all PRT-circuits from being saturated at all reachable markings. To develop a structurally simple Petri net deadlock controller, we present the concept of an effective transition cover, which is a special subset of PRT-circuits that may be saturated. Then by designing a control place with a proper control variable for each PRT-circuit in an effective transition cover, we obtain a deadlock controller for the system. The needed control variables are determined by an integer linear program. Since the number of PRT-circuits in an effective transition cover is much less than that of all PRT-circuits that need to control, our controller is of small structural size. For an AMS with saturable PRTcircuits, there exists at least a transition cover. An algorithm is presented for checking the effectiveness of transition covers, and transforming noneffective transition covers into effective ones. Finally, some examples are used to illustrate the proposed method.},

First, a novel concept relating to external parameters is proposed to describe the overall dissipativity property of switched parameter-varying systems in the absence of the conventional dissipativity property of the subsystems. Second, a state and parameter-triggered and time-driven switching laws is proposed, which avoids Zeno behavior by guaranteeing a dwell time among the adjacent switching. Third, several classic forms of dissipativity are addressed. For passivity and L 2 -gain, under certain negative output feedback asymptotic stability is guaranteed with the aid of asymptotic zero state detectability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed result is illustrated by its application to a speed adjustment problem of an aero-engine.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the practically finite-time (PFT) control problem for a class of more general nonlinear systems subject to mismatching time-varying disturbances. Without any extra assumptions on system nonlinearities, a composite controller is developed by introducing a disturbance observer and finite-time control technique. Based on the designed controller and Lyapunov stability theory, the PFT stability of the closed-loop system is strictly verified and proven to be a better convergence performance. Furthermore, as a byproduct of the proposed design method, the disturbance observer-based PFT control for high-order nonlinear systems is also shown to be possible. To the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, it is the first PFT control result for high-order nonlinear systems with external disturbances. Finally, an application example of a singlelink robot system with disturbances and a numerical example are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, respectively.},

In this paper, a hybrid indoor localization system has been developed within the European project REFIRE for emergency situations. The REFIRE solution estimates the user&#39;s pose according to a prediction-correction scheme. The user is equipped with a waist-mounted inertial measurement unit and a radio frequency identification (RFID) reader. In the correction phase, the estimation is updated by means of geo-referenced information fetched from passive RFID tags predeployed into the environment. Accurate position correction is obtained through a deep analysis of the RFID system radiation patterns. To this end, extensive experimental trials have been performed to assess the RFID system performance, both in static and dynamic operating conditions. Experimental validation in realistic environments shows the effectiveness of the proposed indoor localization system, even during long-last missions and/or using a limited number of tags.},

  abstract     = {A conventional power grid is criticized by its poor capability of power usage management, especially in handling dynamically varying power demands over time. The concept of smart grid has been introduced to mitigate this problem by satisfying not only real-time power demands, but also by restricting power usage within the capacity. Its consistent outperformance and new perspective in computer intelligence to control the grid for autonomous power consumption has been gradually replacing the conventional power grid. However, even in smart grid, providing high satisfaction to users often leads smart grid operator (SGO) to loss and vice versa. In this paper, we develop an optimal dynamic pricing mechanism for trading-off (ODPT), for SGOs that tradeoff between user utility and operator profit in smart grid systems. It allows the operator to purchase power from multiple energy producers and to set selling price to users dynamically following the demand-supply theory of economics. It also exploits an artificial neural network model to more accurately predict the power usage. The simulation results, carried out on a commercially available optimization modeling tool using practical power usage data, prove the effectiveness of the proposed ODPT in increasing the operator profit while satisfying user demands.},

Under the assumption of a linear, P-type iterative learning control (ILC) update law, a double-dynamics analysis (DDA) approach is proposed to show the convergence of the ILC process in the presence of the locally Lipschitz nonlinearities and iteration-varying uncertainties. The DDA approach results in a contraction mapping-based convergence condition that guarantees both: 1) the boundedness of all system trajectories and 2) the robust convergence of the output tracking error. Further, a basic system relative degree condition is given that provides a necessary and sufficient (NAS) guarantee of the convergence of the ILC process. As a corollary, it is noted that in the absence of iteration-varying uncertainties, the results likewise provide an NAS convergence guarantee for MIMO LLNL systems. The simulations are presented to illustrate the ideas.},

The algorithm is fully distributed in the sense that the control input for each agent is independent of any global information of the communication graph and is solely based on local relative output information from its neighborhood set. The approximating structures, e.g., neural networks or fuzzy systems, and the command filters that are typically incorporated to avoid the need for analytical derivatives in the backstepping design are not employed here, resulting in a low-complexity design.

To reduce calculation complexity, the adaptation law for robot parameters estimation is designed in the joint space. Actuator saturation is also overcome by an auxiliary system, and imprecise force sensor measurement is compensated with utilization of adaptive bounding technique. Moreover, the joint acceleration vector problem, which is nonmeasurable, is covered by the filtered regressor matrix. Using Lyapunov&#39;s direct method, as long as two conditions are satisfied the proposed controller ensures the exponential stability of all the signals of the closed loop system; otherwise, the closed loop system is globally stable.

  abstract     = {Stereo matching methods consist of matching cost computation and several post processing steps. Deep learning methods have greatly raised the accuracy of matching cost and achieved the lowest error rate on several public datasets. However, their generality capabilities are not the best due to potential overfitting, which is the common problem of supervised learning approaches. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) based cost estimation method for computing the similarity of image patches. In consideration of accuracy and generalization capability, small size convolution kernels are chosen in the convolution layer and dropout in the decision layer is used for preventing overfitting. After obtaining stereo matching cost from the output of the CNN, several post-processing operations are adopted for disparity optimization, which includes semi-global matching in 1-D from different directions, a left-right consistency check, and the slanted plane smoothing method. The method is evaluated on KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, and Middlebury stereo datasets and the experimental results on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate the competitive accuracy performance of the approach. Additionally, to test the generalization of the method, a series of extended crossover experiments are conducted in which the training samples and testing samples come from different datasets. The results indicate superior generalization capability of our method than other supervised learning methods.},

The complicated interaction matrix is simplified by projecting original image to virtual image plane. On this basis, the dynamics of the system is determined by considering the dynamics of image features and the quadrotor simultaneously. Backstepping controllers are then designed to stabilize the visual servoing system of the quadrotor. In reality, it is unrealistic to have exact prior knowledge about the trajectory parameters of an unpredictable moving target. To solve this problem, a trajectory observer based on nonlinear tracking-differentiator to estimate trajectory parameters of the target is firstly integrated into the quadrotor with image dynamics, which guarantees a satisfactory performance.

Different from native real-valued negative selection algorithm (RNSA) that operates in original data space, this algorithm utilizes feature space transformation and diversity factor-based GA for optimized detector distribution in nonself feature space. The proposed framework comprises three stages namely; feature extraction, unsupervised feature selection, and GA optimized AIS. In the first stage, signal processing methods are applied to extract multidomain features (time-domain statistical, frequency domain statistical, and special features) of the system. In the second stage, two unsupervised methods namely, k-NN clustering and pretraining using deep learning neural network are proposed for dominant fault-characterizing feature selection. Finally, in the third stage, the fault-characterizing feature vectors are used for system status categorization (i.e., normal, fault) using selected (fault-characterizing) features-based AIS method. The efficacy of the proposed framework is verified through experiments on motor bearing fault detection using vibration signal. The major accomplishment of the proposed combination of space transformation, feature selection and AIS (anomaly classification) techniques is the alleviation of computational burden on RNSA implementation. Moreover, GA optimized AIS fault diagnosis based on well-established features gives improved detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions are the linchpin of maritime operations involving effective allocation and path planning of scarce assets to search for, detect, classify, track, and prosecute hostile submarines within a dynamic and uncertain mission environment. Motivated by the need to assist ASW commanders to make better decisions within an evolving mission context, we investigate a moving target search problem with multiple searchers and develop a context-driven decision support tool for the ASW mission planning problem. Given the spatial probability distribution of a target submarine, sensor detection probability surfaces from meteorological and oceanographic products, and the risk to the fleet as a function of distance of the target from the fleet, we model and formulate the ASW asset allocation and search path planning problem using a hidden Markov modeling framework. We propose a two phase approach to solve this NP-hard problem. In phase I, we partition the geographic area, satisfying contiguity constraints, into search regions using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) coupled with a Voronoi tessellation approach, and allocate the assets to partitioned search areas using the auction algorithm. In phase II, we construct a dynamic search plan for each asset over the search interval using EA. We evaluate our approach via a hypothetical ASW scenario to monitor an enemy submarine in a geographic region via multiple assets. We compare our results to various search path planning strategies that, using the context-driven decision support tool developed here, revise the search regions at periodic intervals given a fixed total search time.},

  abstract     = {Indoor localization has been an active research area in the last decade. Various localization systems have been proposed based on different types of signals, including but not limited to WiFi, ultrawideband, inertial measurements, and visual signals. Fingerprinting-based methods are among the most popular methods due to their accuracy and ease of deployment. However, a disadvantage to fingerprinting-based methods is the training phase in which fingerprints have to be collected at known locations and stored for future localization inquiries. Recently a few methods have been proposed to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we focus on the possibility of reducing the burden of the training phase for visual (image-based) indoor localization systems by proposing a system that automatically generates the image-location database. The proposed system will be referred to as automatic visual fingerprinting that can be paired with any indoor image-based localization method. We will also validate the proposed system through extensive experiments.},

  abstract     = {Renewable energy production is constantly growing worldwide, and some countries produce a relevant percentage of their daily electricity consumption through wind energy. Therefore, decision support systems that can make accurate predictions of wind-based power production are of paramount importance for the traders operating in the energy market and for the managers in charge of planning the nonrenewable energy production. In this paper, we present a decision support system that can predict electric power production, estimate a variability index for the prediction, and analyze the wind farm (WF) production characteristics. The main contribution of this paper is a novel system for long-term electric power prediction based solely on the weather forecasts; thus, it is suitable for the WFs that cannot collect or manage the real-time data acquired by the sensors. Our system is based on neural networks and on novel techniques for calibrating and thresholding the weather forecasts based on the distinctive characteristics of the WF orography. We tuned and evaluated the proposed system using the data collected from two WFs over a two-year period and achieved satisfactory results. We studied different feature sets, training strategies, and system configurations before implementing this system for a player in the energy market. This company evaluated the power production prediction performance and the impact of our system at ten different WFs under real-world conditions and achieved a significant improvement with respect to their previous approach.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a control algorithm to collectively transport an object using a group of relatively low-cost robots. We address this problem using the robust caging, which features reliable object closure with minimum number of robots, and requires no high-precision control capability on the individual robot. Given a 2-D convex object, the proposed method uses the quality of complete robustness to first optimize the number of robots in the initial formation, and then reorient and move the formation. The method is free of force analysis, and therefore less prone to sensor errors and failures. Compared with state-of-the-art multirobot object transport approaches, which require more robots and rely heavily on high-precision control, such as force and torque feedback control, our method uses fewer robots and has high tolerance to control noises. We performed both simulation and real-time experiments to demonstrate the performance of our method. We conclude that the proposed robust caging is promising under reduced number of robots and a certain level of control noises in multirobot object transport tasks.},

  abstract     = {In deterministic deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), nodes are carefully placed at desired locations, with careful planning for separation distances, heights, and node orientations. This deployment strategy ensures good radio communication and sensing coverage. However, deterministic deployments are impractical for harsh large tree vegetation environments that span hundreds of kilometers. In these cases, stochastic deployments may enable effective deployment strategies. When relying on stochastic deployments, nodes are likely to be positioned at un-desired locations with unknown node orientations, which can lead to suboptimal radio connectivity and network performance. This paper examines the effects of factors affecting path loss under conditions resembling stochastic aerial deployments of WSN. Unlike previous work in the existing literature, this paper takes into account important deployment factors that affect network performance, such as node orientation and positioning, energy-to-bit-rate ratio, packet loss rate, and the composition of environment. Based on experimentation, a set of path loss models are proposed to model radio signal propagation in jungle-like environments under side-effects encountered in aerial deployments. The proposed models are compared with theoretical models and with other proposed models in the literature. Results show a significant difference with improved network performance that exhibits enhanced energy-to-bit-rate ratio, reduced packet loss rate, and increased node lifetime.},

This model can exactly represent the original nonlinear system with hard nonlinearity while the discontinuous signum functions are not approximated. Based on the bounded-input-bounded-output stability scheme and L 1 performance criterion, new robust controller design conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived. Three practical case studies, electric power steering system, a helicopter model and servo-mechanical system, are presented to demonstrate the importance of such class of nonlinear systems comprising signum function.

The incomplete measurements cover randomly occurring sensor delays and missing measurements that are presented in a unified form by resorting to a stochastic Kronecker delta function. The occurrences of the sensor delays and missing measurements are governed by stochastic variables with known probability distributions. The main aim of the addressed problem is to design a recursive filter with appropriate gain parameters that ensure the local minimum of certain upper bound on the estimation error variance at each time instant. With the aid of the inductive approach and the 2-D Riccati-like difference equations, one of the first few attempts is made to tackle the robust filter design problem for 2-D uncertain systems with random sensor delays over a finite horizon. Sufficient conditions are provided for the existence of an upper bound on the estimation error variance, an algorithm is then developed to derive such an upper bound, and finally the desired filter is designed to minimize the obtained upper bound. The filter design procedure is of a recursive form that facilitates the online calculation. A numerical simulation is carried out to show the effectiveness of the developed filtering scheme.},

But the network stability seems lack of attention, which in fact affects the blockchain performance. This paper studies the performance of a well adopted consensus algorithm, Raft, in networks with non-negligible packet loss rate. In particular, we propose a simple but accurate analytical model to analyze the distributed network split probability.

To validate our analysis, we implement a Raft simulator and the simulation results coincide with the analytical results.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenging problem of multishot person reidentification (Re-ID) in real world uncontrolled surveillance systems. A key issue is how to effectively represent and process the multiple data with various appearance information due to the variations of pose, occlusions, and viewpoints. To this end, this paper develops a novel subspace learning approach, which pursues regularized low-rank and sparse representation for multishot person Re-ID. For the images of a person crossing a certain camera, we assume that the appearances of those subset images with similar viewpoints against a camera draw from the same low-rank subspace, and all the images of a person under a camera lie on a union of low-rank subspaces. Based on this assumption, we propose to learn a nonnegative low-rank and sparse graph to represent the person images. Moreover, the recurring pattern prior is integrated into our model to refine the affinities among images. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets yield impressive performance by improving 22.9\% on imagery library for intelligent detection systems video re identification (iLIDS-VID), 42.4\% on person RE-ID (PRID) dataset 2011, 39.7\% and 30.6\% on speech, audio, image, and video technology-SoftBio camera 3/8 and camera 5/8, respectively, and 1.6\% on motion analysis and re identification set compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

The key idea is enlightened by the need to handle the redundant test signals and the multiple fault ambiguity groups when applying multisignal modeling for multiple fault diagnosis. Considering that BSS is inherently suitable to extract the independent source information, it is integrated into the multisignal model to reconstruct the causality structure that will have superior diagnosticability. Preliminary study on test point design is also presented in the proposed strategy. The proposed multiple fault diagnosis strategy has been verified on a hydraulic automatic gauge control simulation system in a cold rolling mill.

  abstract     = {In this era of big data, stream data classification which is one of typical data stream applications has become more and more significant and challengeable. In these applications, it is obvious that data classification is much more frequent than model training. The ratio of stream data to be classified is rapid and time-varying, so it is an important problem to classify the stream data efficiently with high throughput. In this paper, we first analyze and categorize the current data stream machine learning algorithms according to their data structures. Then, we propose stream data classification topology (SDC-Topology) on Storm. For the classification algorithms based on the matrix, we propose self-adaptive stream data classification framework (SASDC-Framework) for efficient stream data classification on Storm. In SASDC-Framework, all the data sets arriving at the same unit time are partitioned into subsets with the nearly best partition size and processed in parallel. To select the nearly best partition size for the stream data sets efficiently, we adopt bisection method strategy and inverse distance weighted strategy. Extreme learning machine, which is a fast and accurate machine learning method based on matrix calculating, is used to test the efficiency of our proposals. According to evaluation results, the throughputs based on SASDC-Framework are 8-35 times higher than those based on SDC-Topology and the best throughput is more than 40000 prediction requests per second in our environment.},

A Stackelberg game is applied to depict the interaction of transmitter and jammer. On account of game equilibria of two players, controller is devised for CCS with time-varying delay. A novel cross-layer dynamic pricing mechanism is devised to drive the disturbance attention performance of CCS to a desired region under constrained information and time-varying networks.

The proposed robust control strategy can synchronize the voltages of a dc microgrid to the desired value while achieving the optimal load sharing for minimizing distributed energy resources&#39; (DERs) generation cost to achieve their economic operation at the same layer via a sparse communication network considering communication delays and slow switching topologies synchronously. The continuous interaction of physical-electrical and cyber networks generally exacerbates the occurrence of communication delays. Moreover, the arbitrary switching topologies could destroy the system&#39;s transient characteristics at the switching time instants. To further quantify these impacts on the system stability, the communication delay and average switching dwell-time-dependent control conditions for the proposed control strategy are proved based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory. Some sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the cyber-physical delayed-switching system are developed, which guarantees the robustness of the proposed strategy against the communication delays and dynamically changing interaction topologies. The proposed control protocols are shown to be fully distributed and implemented through a sparse communication network. Finally, several cases on a modified IEEE 34-bus test network are investigated which demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the results.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the reliable leader-to-follower formation control problems for multiagent systems (MASs) under quantized communication and false data injection attacks on the communication channels. To solve the problems, a novel distributed filter with an adaptive attack compensator is proposed such that the distributed controller, equipped with the developed filter, guarantees the reliability of the systems for the attacked case. Meanwhile, the tracking performance for a no-attack situation approaches that as under traditional controllers. Different from the existing secure distributed controllers, the proposed one only uses available local information (e.g., the follower&#39;s own filtering data), rather than relying on the information of the attacks&#39; random characteristic and upper bound. Next, to address the challenge that a discontinuous right-hand side is, however, presented to the resulting closed-loop system, the nonsmooth analysis technique and Lyapunov approach are employed. It is shown that all signals in the closed-loop systems are uniformly ultimately bounded, which also implies that the A-asymptotic leader-to-follower formation stability is achieved by MASs, i.e., the asymptotic tracking error converges to zero as the parameter A of the uniform quantizer approaches zero. Furthermore, for the no-quantization-but-possibly attack-occurred situation, the developed filter can achieve cooperative output regulation of MASs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a numerical example.},

Different from most existing works that trade electricity over long distances and through complex meshes, this proposed work performs decentralized and automated demand response through energy sharing of P2P executors. We explore for the first time the benefits of a promising blockchain to conduct the overall ADR framework and increase the P2P trading security. To achieve decentralized scheduling without relying on a central entity, a price-incentive noncooperative game theoretic model is introduced to produce equilibrium solutions for energy storage systems. Moreover, we develop a schedulable ability evaluation system to match trading pairs involving buying and selling nodes. On this basis, a state-machine-driven smart contract mechanism is built to realize P2P trading without reliance on a trusted third party. To illustrate the implementation details of the ADR method, a distributed algorithm is designed. Case studies are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient V2G energy trading framework by exploring blockchain, contract theory, and edge computing. First, we develop a consortium blockchain-based secure energy trading mechanism for V2G. Then, we consider the information asymmetry scenario, and propose an efficient incentive mechanism based on contract theory. The social welfare optimization problem falls into the category of difference of convex programming and is solved by using the iterative convex-concave procedure algorithm. Next, edge computing has been incorporated to improve the successful probability of block creation. The computational resource allocation problem is modeled as a two-stage: 1) Stackelberg leader-follower game and 2) the optimal strategies are obtained by using the backward induction approach. Finally, the performance of the proposed framework is validated via numerical results and theoretical analysis.},

Toward this end, in this paper, an anonymous off-blockchain micropayments scheme (AOM) is proposed for cryptocurrencies in the real world. In AOM, a payee receives micropayments from an “honest-but-curious” intermediary T by solving puzzles which are generated based on the standard RSA assumption. Meanwhile, T also receives micropayments from the payers by payee&#39;s solutions and T will randomly select the inputs of the merging transaction Tmer. In order to improve service efficiency of T and resist denial of service attack, one of the outputs of T mer is paid for T as a service fee. Besides, AOM simultaneously ensures the correctness and fairness of transactions. Finally, from the analyses of property and security, AOM has strong unlinkability, ability for anti-attacks and unforgeability.},

  abstract     = {Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a decentralized semi-anonymous peer-to-peer payment system in which the transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public massively replicated ledger called the blockchain. Bitcoin is currently considered as one of the most disruptive technologies. Bitcoin represents a paradox of opposing forces. On one hand, it is fundamentally social, allowing people to transact in a peer-to-peer manner to create and exchange value. On the other hand, Bitcoin&#39;s core design philosophy and user base contain strong anti-social elements and constraints, emphasizing anonymity, privacy, and subversion of traditional centralized financial systems. We believe that the success of Bitcoin, and the financial ecosystem built around it, will likely rely on achieving an optimal balance between these social and anti-social forces. To elucidate the role of these forces, we analyze the evolution of the entire Bitcoin transaction graph from its inception, and quantify the evolution of its key structural properties. We observe that despite its different nature, the Bitcoin transaction graph exhibits many universal dynamics typical of social networks. However, we also find that Bitcoin deviates in important ways due to anonymity-seeking behavioral patterns of its users. As a result, the network exhibits a two-orders-of-magnitude larger diameter, sparse treelike communities, and an overwhelming majority of transitional or intermediate accounts with incoming and outgoing edges but zero cumulative balances. These results illuminate the evolutionary dynamics of the most popular cryptocurrency, and provide us with initial understanding of social networks rooted in and driven by anti-social constraints.},

  abstract     = {Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a financial transaction network implemented using blockchain technology. Users in the Bitcoin network use pseudonymous Bitcoin addresses and conduct transactions with others without revealing their real identities. In order to further enhance their privacy and convenience, users often use a large number of different addresses. In this paper, we analyze different patterns of transactions occurring in the Bitcoin network in order to cluster addresses that share the same ownership. In order to evaluate the proposed clustering approach, Bitcoin addresses belonging to known entities are tagged and these are used in conjunction with the Gini impurity index to test the accuracy of the recovered identity-based clusters. The results show that our heuristic was able to detect relationships between Bitcoin addresses that were missed by the existing heuristics.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain, as an emerging decentralized architecture and distributed computing paradigm underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has attracted intensive attention in both research and applications recently. Blockchain, especially powered by chain-coded smart contracts, has the full potential of revolutionizing increasingly centralized cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs) for constructions and applications, and reshaping traditional knowledge automation workflows. The key advantage of blockchain technology lies in the fact that it can enable the establishment of secured, trusted, and decentralized autonomous ecosystems for various scenarios, especially for better usage of the legacy devices, infrastructure, and resources.},
