With ensemble learning, several models can be combined into a single demand predictive model, achieving low prediction error. Nevertheless, the existing ensemble methods are not intended for spatio-temporal data and thus cannot deal with it. In this article, a spatio-temporal data ensemble model is proposed to predict car-hailing demands. Treating the prediction results as various channels of an image, the proposed ensemble module first compresses and then restores the results using the fully convolutional network. Additionally, a skip connection is used to preserve both the fine-grained information in the shallow layers and the deep coarse information. Based on the principle of model as a service, any model can be plugged into our framework as base models to improve the prediction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented model.},

  abstract     = {An important issue of research in the transportation system is timely classification of the inside-outside environment of the vehicle using sensors. The sensors generate the multivariate time series data, which requires a classification technique to classify it in real-time. Road surface classification is an example, where multivariate time series data can be used for early identification of the type of road surface. The challenge is to maintain the accuracy of the classification using a minimum number of data points of the multivariate time series. This work proposes an early classification approach for multivariate time series with a desired level of accuracy. It is assumed that the number of samples in the time series are not equal for a given period of time due to different type of sensors. Gaussian Process learning method is used to first estimate the minimum required length of the time series which helps to build an ensemble classifier with a desired level of accuracy. The ensemble classifier is used to predict the class label of an incoming multivariate time series. This work demonstrates a road surface classification system using the built ensemble classifier. Finally, the ensemble classifier is also evaluated on the various existing datasets from other domains. The results demonstrate the significance of early classification approach using accuracy, earliness, and confusion matrix, with the minimum required data points.},

  abstract     = {For critical vehicular communication services, such as traffic safety and traffic efficiency, it is advisable to design systems with robustness as the main criteria, possibly at the price of reduced peak performance and efficiency. We describe a simple, low-cost method for combining the output of L directional (i.e., not omnidirectional) antennas to the input of a single-port receiver with the aim to guarantee robustness, i.e., to minimize the probability that K consecutive packets arriving from the worst-case angle-of-arrival are decoded incorrectly. To minimize complexity, the combining network does not estimate or use channel state information. The combining network consists of L - 1 analog phase shifters whose phases are affine functions of time. For a general L ≤ K and when the packet error probability decays exponentially with the received SNR, the optimum slopes of the affine functions can be computed by solving an optimization problem that depends on the antenna far-field functions. We provide analytical solutions for the special case of L = 2 and 3 antennas, which turns out to be independent of the antenna far-field functions and placement on a vehicle. In an experimental setup consisting of two monopole antennas mounted on the roof of a Volvo XC90, the proposed combining method is shown to give significant performance gains, compared to using any one of the antennas.},

Thus, a large body of related work in computer vision appears inapplicable to the maritime setting at the first sight. We discuss the problem of defining assessment metrics suitable for maritime computer vision. We consider new bottom edge proximity metrics as assessment metrics for maritime computer vision.

  abstract     = {Under the connected vehicle environment, autonomous vehicles (AVs) could bring numerous advantages including: improving the traffic flow, enhancing safety and alleviating air pollution. However, optimally operating AVs at signalized multi-lane intersections is a challenging problem due to the complex interaction of vehicles between lanes. It is thus a desire to manage and control the dynamics of AVs at signalized multi-lane intersections. To this end, this paper puts forward a bi-level control framework to optimize the intersection throughput. In our proposed method, the upper level (i.e. the intersection controller) is used to optimize the lane usages of each approach and the AVs&#39; positions. In contrast, the lower level (i.e. the vehicle controllers) receives information from the upper level to control the AVs to get the maximum speed. More specifically, in the upper level, we apply a novel Space Distribution Method (SDM) for the AVs to maximize the throughput (i.e. a number of AVs) of the (multi-lane) intersection where signal timings are predefined. The SDM is divided into three steps: i) platoon formulation; ii) lane-mode optimization; and iii) AVs&#39; position distribution. To maximize the throughput, the intersection controller receives information about the states of the AVs (e.g. the trajectories), then optimizes the lane usages for each approach, the desired speed, and the gap of the AVs as well as the AV&#39;s position along the approach. After that, each AV which is allowed to cross the intersection will determine its own trajectory and travel with the scheduled time without crash. Numerical simulations are set up to show that the throughput increases significantly, even more than twice of the throughput obtained from other methods in some circumstances.},

Moreover, danger-level analysis is vital for automotive safety systems and driving assistance applications. However, danger-level analysis that simultaneously considers driver-, vehicle-, and road-related information from driving data has rarely been conducted. Such analysis is very challenging due to the issues associated with the high volume and high variety in multisourced driving data. In this paper, we propose a novel danger-level analysis framework for dealing with high variety and high volume problems of multisourced driving data. Built upon a feature extraction method in the proposed framework, we first profile multisourced driving features for overcoming the variety problem. Next, danger-level analysis is formulated as a multiobjective pursuit problem in a linear model. The problem is then solved using a semisupervised learning strategy to overcome the volume issue. Therefore, the danger level can be accurately estimated from multisourced driving data by using the proposed framework. The experimental results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms existing machine learning techniques for multisourced driving data.},

To evaluate the proposed method, we set up a stereo system with two cameras with different focal lengths and captured sequences of stereo images. In addition, we used KITTI, EISATS, and SceneFlow stereo datasets to simulate images with different focal lengths. Experimental results show that the proposed disparity estimation method successfully computed disparity maps for both near and far scenes, with significantly better performance than state-of-the-art monocular disparity estimation methods.

  abstract     = {Hybrid electric storage system (HESS) is a promising power supply for electric vehicles (EVs) to prolong battery cycling life. Battery longevity is affected by the magnitude and fluctuation of the charging/discharging power profiles. While vehicle driving, unexpected high power demand can cause battery degradation and should be supplied by the supercapacitor (SC) in the HESS. However, the limited capacity of SCs restricts the HESS benefit. Thus, one of the crucial while challenging issues for an HESS is how to effectively manage the power splitting between batteries and SCs to satisfy the vehicle&#39;s driving demand as well as reducing battery degradation rate. In this paper, a proactive power management scheme is proposed to extend the EVs battery life with the HESS. First, we exploit a time-series forecasting method to predict the short-term vehicle velocity and calculate the future power demand based on prediction results. Next, due to the nonlinear dynamics of the HESS, the T-S fuzzy modeling method is adopted to approximate system nonlinearity and develop an empirical model. Finally, a model predictive control (MPC) based power management problem is formulated. Prediction errors are considered in MPC formulation to improve system robustness. Based on driving profile tests, simulation results demonstrate that the magnitude and fluctuation of battery current are both reduced and the battery life is prolonged by 17.81% compared with the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Detecting traffic events and their locations is important for an effective transportation management system and better urban policy making. Traffic events are related to traffic accidents, congestion, parking issues, to name a few. Currently, traffic events are detected through static sensors e.g., CCTV camera, loop detectors. However they have limited spatial coverage and high maintenance cost, especially in developing regions. On the other hand, with Web 2.0 and ubiquitous mobile platforms, people can act as social sensors sharing different traffic events along with their locations. We investigated whether Twitter - a social media platform can be useful to understand urban traffic events from tweets in India. However, such tweets are informal and noisy and containing vernacular geographical information making the location retrieval task challenging. So far most authors have used geotagged tweets to identify traffic events which accounted for only 0.1%-3% or sometimes less than that. Recently Twitter has removed precise geotagging, further decreasing the utility of such approaches. To address these issues, this research explored how ungeotagged tweets could be used to understand traffic events in India. We developed a novel framework that does not only categorize traffic related tweets but also extracts the locations of the traffic events from the tweet content in Greater Mumbai. The results show that an SVM based model performs best detecting traffic related tweets. While extracting location information, a hybrid georeferencing model consists of a supervised learning algorithm and a number of spatial rules outperforms other models. The results suggest people in India, especially in Greater Mumbai often share traffic information along with location mentions, which can be used to complement existing physical transport infrastructure in a cost-effective manner to manage transport services in the urban environment.},

This paper presents an approach to derive lane width estimates using point clouds acquired from a geometrically-calibrated mobile mapping system. Starting from an accurate LiDAR point cloud, the road surface is extracted with the assistance of trajectory elevation data. Lane markings are identified based on the intensity data. Next, the lane marking centerline is derived and clustered to identify areas with ambiguous or missing lane markings and finally, use the normal (or, unambiguous) lane markings to estimate the lane width. The derived lane width estimates are used to develop a reporting mechanism for areas with narrow lanes, ambiguous lane markings, missing lane markings, and/or wide lanes.},

The geometrical rail track condition is monitored in real-time using fiber optic sensors, providing early warning if pre-defined thresholds are exceeded in terms of longitudinal, horizontal and cross-level defects. The sensor reading units can be remotely located from the monitored zones, without requiring active elements on the tracks and ensuring high immunity to electromagnetic interference. The proposed technology has been first validated in railway laboratories and then in field trials confirming its capability to detect defects over pre-established thresholds and the absence of false alarms with regular train circulation.},

  abstract     = {Driving safety has been a hot topic in recent vehicular research. However, research on active control strategy, by which an accident might be avoided before it really happens, is still lacking, especially those appealing to machine learning methods with real traffic data. In addition, previous works constructed models with only one or a few factors considered, while the impact of multiple factors on a collision probability is overlooked. In this paper, based on machine learning methods with an actual traffic dataset, we propose a multi-level active safety control strategy taking the Multi-source, Multi-parameter, and Multi-purpose (3M) properties of an accident into consideration. First, by analyzing the impact of different conditions on an accident with the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process)-Ridge regression and bisecting K-means clustering model, the safety inter-vehicle distance is derived by learning from an actual traffic dataset. Besides, ELM(Extreme Learning Machines) is adopted as a verification scheme for safety distance calculation. Subsequently, we design a three-level active safety control scheme using the LQG (Linear Quadratic Gaussian) optimal-control model based on the obtained safety inter-vehicle distance. Numerical results show that by comparing with some classical braking and car-following models, our strategy can always keep the distance of two followed vehicles at a safety state. To further explore the impact of the time complexity on the rear-end collisions, we also implemented a road-test and verified that our model can timely respond to the risks and keep two cars always in safety.},

  abstract     = {We consider a common truck operation scenario, where a long-haul heavy-duty truck drives across a national highway system to fulfill multiple geographically-dispersed tasks in a specific order. The objective is to minimize the total fuel consumption subject to the pickup and delivery time window constraints of individual tasks, by jointly optimizing task execution times, path planning, and speed planning. The need to coordinate execution times for multiple tasks differentiates our study from existing ones on single task. We first prove that our problem is NP-hard. Moreover, it is uniquely challenging to solve our problem, as we further show that optimizing task execution times is a non-convex puzzle. We then exploit the problem structure to develop (i) a Fully-Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme ( FPTAS ), and (ii) a fast and efficient heuristic algorithm, called SPEED (Sub-gradient-based Price-driven Energy-Efficient Delivery). We characterize sufficient conditions under which SPEED generates an optimal solution, and derive an optimality gap for SPEED when the conditions are not satisfied. We evaluate the practical performances of our solutions using real-world traces over the US national highway. We observe that our solutions can save up to 22% fuel as compared to the fastest-/shortest- path baselines, and up to 10% fuel than a conceivable alternative generalized from the state-of-the-art single-task algorithm. The fuel saving is robust to the number of tasks to be fulfilled. Simulations also show that our algorithms always obtain close-to-optimal solutions and meet time window constraints for all feasible problem instances. In comparison, the conceivable alternative fails to meet time window constraints for up to 45% of the instances.},

In this paper, a weigh-in-motion (WIM) system that functions at both low-speeds and high-speeds in flexible pavements is developed based on in-pavement, three-dimensional glass-fiber-reinforced, polymer-packaged fiber Bragg grating sensors (3D GFRP-FBG). Vehicles passing over the pavement produce strains that the system monitors by measuring the center wavelength changes of the embedded 3D GFRP-FBG sensors. The FBG sensor can estimate the weight of vehicles because of the direct relationship between the loading on the pavement and the strain inside the pavement. A sensitivity study shows that the developed sensor is very sensitive to sensor installation depth, pavement property, and load location. Testing in the field validated that the longitudinal component of the sensor if not corrected by location has a measurement accuracy of 86.3% and 89.5% at 5 mph and 45 mph vehicle speed, respectively. However, the system also has the capability to estimate the location of the loading position, which can enhance the system accuracy to more than 94.5%.},

To tackle these concerns, the functionality of in-vehicle navigational systems must adapt to the new propulsion technology with a limited battery capacity. Central aim is to consider charging infrastructure in route planning. Furthermore, detailed powertrain models are required to accurately forecast an EV&#39;s energy consumption. On the other hand, such detailed models are hardly applicable to large scale road networks that are usually handled by routing services for vehicle navigation. This study proposes a two-staged approach to compute time optimal routes for EVs. To this end, a reduced road network is obtained from a leading routing service. Subsequently, a detailed consumption model is applied and the resulting multiobjective shortest path problem is solved using an adapted Moore-Bellman-Ford algorithm. Within an experimental study, the consumption forecast is validated against measurement data and query times of the proposed methodology are assessed for generic routing problems. The former shows significant improvement of consumption forecast accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models while the latter indicates potential for application in car manufacturers vehicle backend services.},

Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed EZ-Net performs vehicle detection on the panoramic video at a speed of 140 fps while holding a competing accuracy with the state-of-the-art detectors.},

  abstract     = {The increasing popularity of battery-limited electric vehicles puts forward an important issue of how to charge the vehicles effectively. This problem, commonly referred to as Electric Vehicle Charging Scheduling (EVCS), has been proven to be NP-hard. Most of the existing works formulate the EVCS problem simply as a constrained shortest path finding problem and treat it by discrete optimization. However, other variables such as the charging amount of energy and the charging option at a station need to be considered in practical use. This paper hence formulates the EVCS problem as a hierarchical mixed-variable optimization problem, considering the dependency among the station selection, the charging option at each station and the charging amount settings. To adapt to the new problem model, we specifically design a Mixed-Variable Differentiate Evolution (MVDE) as the scheduling algorithm for our proposed EVCS system. The MVDE contains several specific operators, including a charging station route construction, a hierarchical mixed-variable mutation operator and a constraint-aware evaluation operator. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed MVDE-based system on both synthetic and real-world transportation networks.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian detection has attracted more attention in the fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence. A variety of real-world applications involving pedestrian detection have been promoted, such as Advanced Driving Assistant System (ADAS). Although both two-stage and single-stage deeply learned object detectors have shown outstanding performance for general object detection, they are still facing the problem of poor accuracy in single-class detection senario because they are designed to distinguish objects from different categories rather than pay attention to various appearances of pedestrians. Previous leading pedestrian detectors F-DNN and F-DNN v2 fuse several neural networks like SSD, VGG16 and GoogLeNet to generate ROIs and supress false alarms with cascaded structure, resulting in low miss rate but high complexity. In this paper we propose a novel framework called Attention-Enhanced Multi-Scale Region Proposal Network (AEMS-RPN) for ROI generation, which also acts as first-stage classification. Inspired by the success of traditional pedestrian detectors, we use soft-cascaded decision trees instead of cascaded deep neural networks to achieve high accuracy and fast detection speed simultaneously. The decision tree classifier is used and enables us to combine features from different layers with various resolutions for classification and incorporate effective bootstrapping for mining hard negatives. We test our method on several pedestrian detection datasets and the experimental results certify the effectiveness of the proposed AEMS-RPN. Compared with the state-of-the-art, we obtain the competitive accuracy with near real-time efficiency.},

To address these challenges, we investigate the possibility of estimating sensor perception reliability without a reference truth. In particular, we propose a framework to learn sensor perception reliability solely by exploiting sensor redundancies. We formulate a likelihood function for redundant binary sensor data without a reference truth and propose a Gaussian copula to model dependent sensor errors. Synthetic numerical experiments show that under an adequate dependence model, correct sensor perception reliabilities can be estimated without a reference truth. Because the selection of an adequate dependence model is challenging without a reference truth, we also investigate how inadequate dependence models influence the estimation. The proposed framework is a step toward the validation of sensor perception reliability because it could enable the learning of reliabilities from a fleet of driver-controlled vehicles equipped with series sensors.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the travel behavior of private cars will generate promising solutions on addressing urban problems such as alleviating traffic congestion and improving transport services. In this paper, we focus on investigating the individual travel patterns of private car users based on a large-scale private car trajectory dataset. To achieve this goal, we first analyze the stop-and-wait information from the private car trajectory data and utilize DBSCAN method to implement clustering with the aim at identifying the frequently-visit places (FVPs). After that, we leverage Markov chain to study the spatial-temporal transition characteristics when private cars travel among their FVPs. Finally yet importantly, we design the concept of spatial-temporal entropy rate and conduct a quantitative study for measuring the regularity of each individual private car&#39;s mobility. We validate the proposed methodology based on a real-world dataset including 25,564 private cars driving during one month in China. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of the accuracy on measuring the mobility behavior. Moreover, we observe that, on one side, the travel pattern is easier to mine from the private car users with fewer FVPs, on the other side, there are also a small number of users whose FVPs are large, while their mobility are relatively regular. Our work is the first effort to explore individual travel patterns of private car users via studying private car trajectory big data, thereby being able to provide new insight into the research of human travel activities, traffic management and urban planning.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian detection has achieved notable progress in the field of computer vision over the past decade. However, existing top-performing approaches suffer from high computational complexity which prohibits their realization on embedded platforms with low computational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a robust and fast pedestrian detection framework which is based on the Filtered Channel Feature (FCF) approach. The proposed framework exploits vector-form decorrelated filters to extract more discriminative channel features while benefiting from low computational complexity. A novel group cost-sensitive BoostLR (Boosting with Loss Regularization) algorithm is proposed to train the classifier. The proposed training strategy provides more emphasis to the harder samples by exploring the variations of negatives selected from different rounds in hard negative mining processing, and hence is able to boost the overall detection performance. In addition, the proposed method also benefits from the BoostLR framework to achieve better generalization. Experiments on the well-known Caltech, INRIA and CityPersons pedestrian detection datasets show that our proposed approach achieves the best detection performance among all of the state-of-the-art non-deep learning methods and can run one order of magnitude faster than classical FCF methods (e.g. Checkerboards).},

  abstract     = {During the last decades, concepts of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) were continuously adapted and improved based on new insights into human travel behavior. Drivers for improvements are the quantity and quality of available mobility data, which increased significantly in recent years. Based on travel behavior, literature proposes a large number of different solutions for next step or future location prediction. However a holistic spatio-temporal prediction, which could further improve the quality of ITS, creates a more complex task. The prediction of medium-term mobility for one to seven days is challenging in particular for atypical travel behavior, since the weekdays&#39; order delivers no reliable indication for the next day&#39;s travel behavior. With our contribution, we explore the benefits of various prediction approaches for medium-term mobility prediction and combine them dynamically to predict individual mobility behavior for a period of one week. The derived framework utilizes an exhaustive search approach to benefit from a machine learning based clustering method on location data. In conjunction with an Artificial Neural Network, the prediction framework is robust against prediction errors created by atypical behavior. With two data sets consisting of smartphone and vehicle data, we demonstrate the framework&#39;s real-world applicability. We show that clustering an individual&#39;s historical movement data can improve the prediction accuracy of different prediction methods that will be explained in detail and illustrate the interrelation of entropy and prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a game theoretical adversarial intervention detection mechanism for reliable smart road signs. A future trend in intelligent transportation systems is “smart road signs” that incorporate smart codes (e.g., visible at infrared) on their surface to provide more detailed information to smart vehicles. Such smart codes make road sign classification problem aligned with communication settings more than conventional classification. This enables us to integrate well-established results in communication theory, e.g., error-correction methods, into road sign classification problem. Recently, vision-based road sign classification algorithms have been shown to be vulnerable against (even) small scale adversarial interventions that are imperceptible for humans. On the other hand, smart codes constructed via error-correction methods can lead to robustness against small scale intelligent or random perturbations on them. In the recognition of smart road signs, however, humans are out of the loop since they cannot see or interpret them. Therefore, there is no equivalent concept of imperceptible perturbations in order to achieve a comparable performance with humans. Robustness against small scale perturbations would not be sufficient since the attacker can attack more aggressively without such a constraint. Under a game theoretical solution concept, we seek to ensure certain measure of guarantees against even the worst case (intelligent) attackers that can perturb the signal even at large scale. We provide a randomized detection strategy based on the distance between the decoder output and the received input, i.e., error rate. Finally, we examine the performance of the proposed scheme over various scenarios.},

Such assumptions are problematic for practice due to: (i) Measurement noise, (ii) difficulty of measuring OD-based accumulation states and inflow demands. To address these, we propose a nonlinear moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme for large-scale urban road networks with dynamics described via macroscopic fundamental diagram. Furthermore, we consider various measurement configurations likely to be encountered in practice, such as measurements on regional accumulations and transfer flows without OD information, and provide results of their observability tests. Simulation studies, considering joint operation of the MHE with a model predictive perimeter control scheme, indicate substantial potential towards practical implementation of MFD-based perimeter control.},

The current study attempts to provide a copula-based framework to capture the potential dependence between TTC and centerline separation between the interacting vehicles in staggered-following events according to lead vehicle type. Detailed trajectory data extracted from the video footage of urban roads were used for the purpose of this study. Considering negative association between the considered variables and checked by the performance measures, the bivariate Frank copula model is found acceptable to model the bivariate dependency structure between TTC and CS. In particular, the results of the study corroborate a pragmatic decreasing relationship of TTC with increasing CS and decrease in lead vehicle size- a finding which indicates that the risk level of riders in staggered-following scenario varies by the type of front vehicle ahead and the lateral positioning of the vehicles. Based on the results presented in this paper, our recommendation is to use different minimum TTC thresholds for different centerline separations and leader-follower pairs to suitably evaluate traffic safety in such non-lane based traffic environments.},

  abstract     = {This paper models the driver face recognition problem under the intelligent traffic monitoring systems as severe illumination variation face recognition with single sample problem. Firstly, in the point of view of numerical value sign, the current illumination invariant unit is derived from the subtraction of two pixels in the face local region, which may be positive or negative, we propose a generalized illumination robust (GIR) model based on positive and negative illumination invariant units to tackle severe illumination variations. Then, the GIR model can be used to generate several GIR images based on the local edge-region or the local block-region, which results in the edge-region based GIR (EGIR) image or the block-region based GIR (BGIR) image. For single GIR image based classification, the GIR image utilizes the saturation function and the nearest neighbor classifier, which can develop EGIR-face and BGIR-face. For multi GIR images based classification, the GIR images employ the extended sparse representation classification (ESRC) as the classifier that can form the EGIR image based classification (GIRC) and the BGIR image based classification (BGIRC). Further, the GIR model is integrated with the pre-trained deep learning (PDL) model to construct the GIR-PDL model. Finally, the performances of the proposed methods are verified on the Extended Yale B, CMU PIE, AR, self-built Driver and VGGFace2 face databases. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methods are efficient to tackle severe illumination variations.},

Based on an initial sample of 4870 retrieved papers, 59 studies were selected as the result of the selection criteria detailed in the paper. The shortlisted studies were then mapped into six categories to answer the proposed research questions. An AV system model was proposed and applied to orient the discussions about the SLR findings.

The traction force is determined from an actor network to maintain a desired inter-vehicle distance which improves the driving safety in a car-following process. The gear shift schedule is derived from a gear network to reduce the fuel consumption. The control strategy is model-free and allows continuous online learning for different driving situations without look-ahead velocity information. Particularly the nonlinear vehicle dynamics, the nonlinear transmission efficiency map for different gear ratios, and the nonlinear fuel consumption map are learned for fuel consumption reduction. The proposed controller is evaluated for different driving scenarios to demonstrate its robustness.

To address this challenge, we learn the traffic network as a graph and propose a novel deep learning framework, Traffic Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (TGC-LSTM), to learn the interactions between roadways in the traffic network and forecast the network-wide traffic state. We define the traffic graph convolution based on the physical network topology. The relationship between the proposed traffic graph convolution and the spectral graph convolution is also discussed. An L1-norm on graph convolution weights and an L2-norm on graph convolution features are added to the model&#39;s loss function to enhance the interpretability of the proposed model. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods on two real-world traffic state datasets. The visualization of the graph convolution weights indicates that the proposed framework can recognize the most influential road segments in real-world traffic networks.},

  abstract     = {In drive-thru internet, road side units (RSUs) are deployed along the road, which facilitate content dissemination to the vehicles on the go through vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications. Due to many factors including short and intermittent connections, the fading nature of wireless channel, and relatively fast speed of the vehicle, the vehicles might not be able to receive the complete content file successfully. Therefore, caching a file at multiple RSUs along the road in a collaborative manner is needed. To this end, the combination property (CP) is desired for caching the content: if k source packets are mapped into n ≥ k packets and with any k out of these n packets are able to recover all the information. Reed-Solomon (RS) codes possess CP and have been widely adopted in distributed storage (DS) systems. RS codes operating within a large size finite field have high encoding/decoding complexity, which dramatically increase the computation burden and prolong the processing delay. By introducing several overhead bits and by smart design, binary zigzag decoding (BZD) can significantly reduce the decoding complexity, and CP-BZD codes that possess both CP and BZD have been proposed recently. For CP-BZD structured drive-thru internet system, packets delivered over the air might encounter errors in certain bits. In this work, without adding extra checking bits, existing overhead bits in CP-BZD is used instead, and a novel decoding method that reaps error correction ability is proposed. In other words, our method has self-error correction ability. Complexity analysis of this proposed method is performed and a low complexity algorithm is designed. This error correction module is completely optional, adaptable, and flexible to be deployed to various environments. Numerical studies show that the proposed method can achieve CP with both low decoding complexity and self-error correction.},

Numerous driver models have been proposed for Single-Unit Vehicles (SUVs). Some SUV-based driver models have been applied to closed-loop simulations of Multi-Trailer Articulated Heavy Vehicles (MTAHVs). However, the dynamics of MTAHVs is significantly different from that of SUVs, and drivers of Multi-Unit Vehicles (MUVs) have different driving performance and skills. Very few driver models have been proposed for closed-loop simulations of MUVs. This paper designs the unified driver model, considering the dynamic features of both SUVs and MUVs. The driver model is derived using a sliding mode control (SMC) technique, and it distinguishes itself from conventional driver models with a number of features. Simulations demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed driver model.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles can place a significant load on the power grid due to their unscheduled charging events. One way of improving power grid stability is to schedule electric vehicle charging in advance. Before a charging visit, the electric vehicle provides necessary information to request for charging at a charging station, which prepares and reserves the energy before the visit. However, the reported information can cause privacy leakage of the electric vehicle user. Anonymous information reporting can protect user privacy, but also enables attacks on the charging station by unauthorized users. An anonymous authentication system can address these issues, but cannot detect misbehaviors by authenticated users. One remedy to this is revocable anonymity-based authentication, which can revoke the anonymity of malicious users after their misbehaviors. However, we show that such a system is still vulnerable to application-level Denial of Service attacks, where a malicious user requests for large amounts of energy simultaneously from many charging stations, preventing these stations from serving other users. To address this, we improve upon an existing revocable anonymity-based authentication framework. We propose a permit-based mechanism, where each electric vehicle is only issued with one blind signature-based permit at a time. A request is valid only if it contains a valid and unused permit, which protects the system from the application-level Denial of Service attacks. Security analysis and experiments demonstrate that our framework, while ensuring user anonymity and being robust to the aforementioned attack, is also scalable and lightweight.},

First, we propose different definitions of road coverage metrics. It is shown that the problem of deploying minimum number of sensors to achieve road coverage is NP-hard.

The goals of operating the electric vehicle fleet are to minimize customer waiting time, electricity cost, and operational costs of the vehicles. A novel framework characterized by decentralized learning and centralized decision making is proposed to solve the electric vehicle fleet dispatch problem. The decentralized learning process allows the individual vehicles to share their operating experiences and deep neural network model for state-value function estimation, which mitigates the curse of dimensionality of state and action domains. The centralized decision making framework converts the vehicle fleet coordination problem into a linear assignment problem, which has polynomial time complexity.

To address this problem, a reference-induced extended look-ahead tracking point is introduced such that the cutting-corner is compensated. Moreover, the stability of the internal dynamics is analyzed. To address the situation where the orientation tracking error is not measurable or corrupted by noise, an orientation-error observer, constructed from the position tracking error, is designed.

With the popularization of NEV, its unique dispatch research is imminent. This paper comprehensively considers electricity and charging piles during the NEV dispatch (NEVD) process. An NEVD framework containing a novel dispatch model is proposed, which elaborates the application service of NEV.

In this paper, we show how the latest advances on monocular vision-based human pose estimation, i.e. those relying on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), enable to recognize the intentions of such VRUs. In the case of cyclists, we assume that they follow traffic rules to indicate future maneuvers with arm signals. In the case of pedestrians, no indications can be assumed. Instead, we hypothesize that the walking pattern of a pedestrian allows to determine if he/she has the intention of crossing the road in the path of the ego-vehicle, so that the ego-vehicle must maneuver accordingly ( e.g. slowing down or stopping). In this paper, we show how the same methodology can be used for recognizing pedestrians and cyclists’ intentions. For pedestrians, we perform experiments on the JAAD dataset. For cyclists, we did not found an analogous dataset, thus, we created our own one by acquiring and annotating videos which we share with the research community. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides new state-of-the-art results on the intention recognition of VRUs.},

However, when dealing with noisy, unstructured, dense point clouds, we often face some challenges, most notably in handling of the outliers introduced during road marking detection and in recognition of curve types during 3D curve reconstruction. Our approach is formed by two main algorithms: a detector based on intensity variance and a robust model fitting estimator. The experimental results obtained using both a virtual scan dataset and a real MLS dataset demonstrated that our approach is very promising in handling of the outliers and reconstruction of 3D road curves. Specifically, a relative accuracy of 0.6% has been achieved in estimation of circle radii based on the virtual scan dataset. A comparative study also showed that our road marking detection approach is more effective and more stable than state-of-the-art approaches.},

Emergency rescue facilities play an important role in ensuring the safety of chemical parks, as their locations determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the emergency management process. This paper proposes a multi-objective emergency rescue facilities location (ERFsL) model for emergency management of CICAs. Due to the special characteristics of CICAs, the proposed model considers not only the spatial characteristics of the facilities but also the potential risks associated with CICAs. A quantitative area risk assessment (QARA) approach based on domino effect and grid partition is involved to delineate the potential negative impacts of CICAs on different demand points. Moreover, a matrix encoding scheme is coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) for model solving. A case study is presented to demonstrate the methodology. A set of reasonable and non-dominated solutions indicate that the matrix encoding scheme and the corresponding evolutionary operators can be successfully coupled with the MOEAs to produce feasible child solutions. We also find that the involvement of risk analysis has a significant effect on the location decision. The findings show that our work has the potential to ensure the safety and long-term development of the parks.},

This study focused on the development of a framework for the computation of the minimum time headway, for a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication-based collision avoidance system for HCRVs, that must be maintained through automated braking to avoid a collision. The framework, as well as the developed Collision Avoidance Algorithm (CAA), considers critical attributes of an HCRV such as significant load variations and brake actuator dynamics. Further, the time headway formulation varies with the initial longitudinal speed and considers communication latency. Experiments were conducted in a Hardware-in-Loop test setup to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed formulations. It was observed that the incorporation of communication latency and initial longitudinal speed explicitly in the time headway formulation maintained the desired final spacing between the vehicles, over a range of communication latencies and various host vehicle longitudinal speeds, which was not the case when the above factors were not considered.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the joint fleet sizing and charging system planning problem for a company operating a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) for passenger and goods transportation. Most of the relevant published papers focus on intracity scenarios and adopt heuristic approaches, e.g., agent based simulation, which do not guarantee optimality. In contrast, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model for intercity scenarios. This model incorporates comprehensive considerations of 1) limited AEV driving range; 2) optimal AEV routing and relocating operations; 3) time-varying origin-destination transport demands; and 4) differentiated operation cost structure of passenger and goods transportation. The proposed model can be computational expensive when the scale of the transportation network is large. We then exploit the structure of this program to expedite its solution. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. Our experimental results show that AEVs in passenger and goods transportation have remarkable planning and operation differences. We also demonstrate that intelligent routing and relocating operations, charging system and vehicle parameters, e.g., charging power, battery capacity, driving speed etc., can significantly affect the economic efficiency and the planning results of an AEV fleet.},

A density-based travel time partial differential equation (PDE) based on the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model, and its dynamics are reviewed. The travel time dynamics are an asymmetric, one-sided coupled system of hyperbolic PDEs. Although the model has been derived previously, and its applications have been proposed, important properties of the solution to the travel time PDE are studied for the first time. The travel time PDE has the form of a Hamilton Jacobi equation. For this type of equation, finding a unique solution that is consistent with reality is accomplished by finding its viscosity solution.

  abstract     = {Named Data Networking (NDN) might potentially help improve data acquisition efficiency in vehicular environments, so it is introduced into vehicular networks, namely vehicular NDN (VNDN). In the existing VNDN solutions, a large number of vehicles with high mobility are involved in forwarding messages, so it is hard to achieve request aggregation that is the main advantage of NDN and can help reduce the data acquisition delay. Moreover, the solutions employ flooding to achieve data retrieval without consumer mobility support, which increases the data acquisition cost and reduces the data acquisition success rate. In this paper, we propose a novel VNDN framework and aim to reduce the data acquisition delay and cost and improve the data acquisition success rate. In this framework, the cluster-chain vehicular backbone is constructed to enhance the stability of the backbone topology. Based on cluster chains, consumers can employ request aggregation and unicast to acquire data from the nearest provider. Moreover, consumer mobility is supported to guarantee successful retrieval of data in spite of high mobility of vehicles. This framework is quantitatively evaluated. According to the experimental results, compared with the VNDN approaches, our framework reduces the data acquisition cost and delay by nearly 54.6% and 12.3%, respectively, and improves the data retrieval success rate by nearly 7.9%.},

  abstract     = {Although there has been substantial research in system analytics for risk assessment in traditional methods, little work has been done for safety risk prediction in communication-based train control (CBTC) system, especially intelligently predicting risk caused by the uncertainty in the system operation. Risk prediction and assessment of hazards in train control systems are vital for the safety and efficiency of urban rail transit. In this paper, we propose an intelligent hazard-risk prediction model based on a deep recurrent neural network for a new communication-mode CBTC system. First, a train-to-train communication-based train control (T2T-CBTC) system is proposed to improve the drawback of CBTC in information-exchanging mode. Then we design a risk prediction feature selection and generation method and estimate a critical function feature in the T2T-CBTC system by statistical model checking. Finally, we construct our intelligent hazard-risk prediction model based on a deep recurrent neural network using a long-short-term memory (LSTM) network. The model had excellent risk prediction classification results and performance in our experiment, even for unbalanced data set. This model consistently outperforms the deep belief network trained in Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score for the hazard-risk prediction problem. Specifically, the mean accuracy is 97.2% and mean F1-score is 93.9% in overall performance of model. The improvements of our model against DBN model are 8.2% for Precision, 7% for Recall and 8% for F1-score.},

The goal is to minimize passengers travel time, including waiting at stations. In the common corridor, stations are shared by several bus lines which present riding alternatives for passengers with origins and destinations within the corridor. Since buses from different lines interact in the corridor, optimal multi-line headways that consider headways across all lines can alter single-line headways so as to maximize user benefit. We develop the system model in a mathematical programming fashion, embedded with the control strategy as bus holding decision variables. The method, named Multi-line Integrated Holding Control Strategy (M-IHCS), implements the required bus headway regulation for multiple lines in an integrated and simultaneous manner. Numerical tests of the optimization approach developed for the system model show the distinctive features of the solutions, indicating the superiority of multi-line headway control over its single-line counterpart.},

Instead of separating tasks in the decoder, we construct context tensors between sub-task decoders to share designate influence among tasks. Therefore, each task can benefit from others during multi-task learning.

To solve this problem, this research proposed a new model that incorporates a simplified shockwave model with traffic diffusion theory, which is able to reproduce the stochastic nature of traffic dynamics. The simulation results and comparison with field observed data verify that the proposed model is not only to model the traffic dynamics on arterials, but it is also able to derive signal timings of actuated intersections. Such results are encouraging since this model can be applied to a variety of real-time applications such as arterial traffic flow estimation, performance prediction and signal optimization.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous mobile vehicles are expected to perform persistent and accurate localization with low-cost equipment. To achieve this goal, we propose a stereo camera based visual localization method using a modified laser map, which takes the advantage of both the low cost of camera, and high geometric precision of laser data to achieve long-term performance. Considering that LiDAR and camera give measurements of the same environment in different modalities, the cross-modal invariance is investigated to modify the laser map for visual localization. Specifically, a map learning algorithm is introduced to sample the robust subsets in laser maps that are useful for visual localization using multi-session visual and laser data. Further, a generative map model is derived to describe this cross-modal invariance, based on which two types of measurements are defined to model the laser map points as appropriate visual observations. Tightly coupling these measurements within the local bundle adjustment during online sliding-window based visual odometry, the vehicle can achieve robust localization even one year after the map was built. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both the public KITTI datasets and self-collected datasets in our campus, which include seasonal, illumination and object variations. On all experimental localization sessions, our method provides satisfactory results, even when the direction is opposite to that in the mapping session, verifying the superior performance of the laser map based visual localization method.},

To address this challenge, efficient collection of data is critical to prevent overburdening the communication systems and overreaching computational and memory capacity. In this work, we propose an efficient data collection scheme that selects and transmits only a small subset of the data to alleviate data transmission burden. As a demonstration, we have used the proposed approach to select the data points to be transmitted from 10,000 connected vehicles trips available in the Safety Pilot Model Deployment dataset. The presented results show that collection ratio can be as small as 0.05 depending on the required precision. Moreover, a simulation study was performed to evaluate the travel time estimation accuracy using the proposed data collection approach. Results show that the proposed data collection approach can significantly improve travel time estimation accuracy.},

Although it has advanced considerably in the past few years, recent methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) discard temporal coherence in the video sequence and estimate depth independently for each frame, which often leads to undesired inconsistent results over time. To address this problem, we propose to memorize temporal consistency in the video sequence, and leverage it for the task of depth prediction. To this end, we introduce a two-stream CNN with a flow-guided memory module, where each stream encodes visual and temporal features, respectively. The memory module, implemented using convolutional gated recurrent units (ConvGRUs), inputs visual and temporal features sequentially together with optical flow tailored to our task. It memorizes trajectories of individual features selectively and propagates spatial information over time, enforcing a long-term temporal consistency to prediction results. We evaluate our method on the KITTI benchmark dataset in terms of depth prediction accuracy, temporal consistency and runtime, and achieve a new state of the art. We also provide an extensive experimental analysis, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach to memorizing temporal consistency for depth prediction.},

  abstract     = {Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding road users is critical to autonomous driving systems. In mixed traffic flows, road users with different kinds of behaviors and styles bring complexity to the environment, which requires considering interactions among road users when anticipating their future trajectories. This paper presents a long-term interactive trajectory prediction method for surrounding vehicles using a hierarchical multi-sequence learning network. In contrast to non-interactive method which assumes that road users are independent of each other, this method can automatically learn high-level dependencies among multiple interacting vehicles through the proposed structural-LSTM (long short-term memory) network. Specifically, structural-LSTM first assigns one LSTM for each interacting vehicle. Then these LSTMs share their cell states and hidden states with their spatial-neighboring LSTMs by a radial connection, and recurrently analyze the output state of itself as well as the other LSTMs in a deeper layer. Finally based on all output states, the network predicts trajectories for surrounding vehicles. The proposed method is evaluated on the NGSIM dataset, and its results show that satisfyingly accurate prediction performance of long-term trajectories of surrounding vehicles is accessible, e.g., longitudinal and lateral RMS error can be reduced to less than 1.93m and 0.31m over 5s time horizon, respectively.},

The Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane Changes Model (MOBIL) and Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) were modified to develop a simulation platform for a CAV environment. The optimal cooperative lane changing zones were firstly calculated by a heuristic algorithm, and then were applied in the simulation platform to implement the cooperative strategy. Various metrics were considered to evaluate the proposed strategy, including: total travel time, surrogate safety measures and traffic waves in the system. The experimental results showed that the length of the optimal cooperative zones obtained in our strategy were smaller than the fixed zone required in modified MOBIL strategy. Moreover, the results indicated that the cooperative strategy with the optimal zones, could improve traffic operation, traffic safety and traffic oscillation as compared to the modified MOBIL strategy with the fixed zone. The cooperative strategy can be potentially implemented nearby highway off-ramps by vehicle-based control, with the applications of the aforementioned cooperative zones.},

Existing methods are unable to adapt to these difficult cases while maintaining acceptable performance. In this paper we propose a novel feature learning model, referred to as CircleNet, to achieve feature adaptation by mimicking the process humans looking at low resolution and occluded objects: focusing on it again, at a finer scale, if the object can not be identified clearly for the first time. CircleNet is implemented as a set of feature pyramids and uses weight sharing path augmentation for better feature fusion. It targets at reciprocating feature adaptation and iterative object detection using multiple top-down and bottom-up pathways. To take full advantage of the feature adaptation capability in CircleNet, we design an instance decomposition training strategy to focus on detecting pedestrian instances of various resolutions and different occlusion levels in each cycle. Specifically, CircleNet implements feature ensemble with the idea of hard negative boosting in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two pedestrian detection datasets, Caltech and CityPersons, show that CircleNet improves the performance of occluded and low-resolution pedestrians with significant margins while maintaining good performance on normal instances.},

  abstract     = {Travel time and demand disturbances lead to unreliable bus operations and missed passenger transfers. This study formulates the multi-line synchronization problem as a robust min(i)max problem that considers the fluctuations of the travel and dwell times of bus trips. Given the infeasibility of the multi-line synchronization problem in extreme cases of travel/dwell time disturbances, we introduce a flexible problem formulation that incorporates the constraint violations into the objective function. To produce a robust schedule, the dispatching times of trips are our design variables and the travel and dwell time fluctuations are the environmental variables which have an adversarial role in our minimax problem. We validate our approach in the bus network of The Hague using 1 month of actual vehicle location and passenger counting data. There, we demonstrate the potential improvement in terms of service regularity and increased synchronizations in common case and extreme case conditions.},

  abstract     = {A deep learning-based safety monitoring framework for air traffic control (ATC) systems is proposed in this paper to reduce human errors and relieve the controllers’ workload by regulating the controlling procedure, eliminating communication misunderstanding, monitoring flight conformance, and detecting potential conflicts. The framework comprises automatic speech recognition (ASR), controlling intent inference (CII), and control safety monitoring (CSM) subsystems. The pipeline of the proposed framework can be described as follows: the ASR subsystem translates the pilot-controller voice communications (PCVCs) into texts, which are then converted to the predefined data structure by the CII subsystem. Three types of air traffic safety measures, including repetition check, flight conformance verification, and potential conflict detection, are finally validated by the CSM subsystem. An improved end-to-end ASR model with convolutional, bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and fully connected (FC) layers is trained using the connectionist temporal classification loss function. The BLSTM and FC combined CII model is designed to infer the controlling intent and slot filling. A language model is also trained in this subsystem to improve the overall performance of the framework. After converting the PCVCs to ATC data, the CSM subsystem checks the given safety monitoring tasks and sends warnings to the current system. The experimental results show that the proposed ASR model obtains a better performance than that of other approaches, and the tasks in the CII subsystem are fulfilled with a high classification precision. The CSM subsystem is also tested to confirm its safety monitoring function by playing back the data and several simulated instructions. To the best of our knowledge, this is pioneering work in the safety monitoring of flight control by recognizing the PCVCs with deep learning-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Routing data in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is still a challenging topic. The unpredictable mobility of nodes renders routing of data packets over optimal paths not always possible. Therefore, there is a need to enhance the routing service. Bus Rapid Transit systems, consisting of buses characterized by a regular mobility pattern, can be a good candidate for building a backbone to tackle the problem of uncontrolled mobility of nodes and to select appropriate routing paths for data delivery. For this purpose, we propose a new routing scheme called Bus-based Routing Technique (BRT) which exploits the periodic and predictable movement of buses to learn the required time (the temporal distance) for each data transmission to Road-Side-Units (RSUs) through a dedicated bus-based backbone. Indeed, BRT comprises two phases: (i) Learning process which should be carried out, basically, one time to allow buses to build routing tables entries and expect the delay for routing data packets over buses, (ii) Data delivery process which exploits the pre-learned temporal distances to route data packets through the bus backbone towards an RSU (backbone mode). BRT uses other types of vehicles to boost the routing of data packets and also provides a maintenance procedure to deal with unexpected situations like a missing nexthop bus, which allows BRT to continue routing data packets. Simulation results show that BRT provides good performance results in terms of delivery ratio and end-to-end delay.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in transportation have enabled lane-specific measurements and lane-specific control. This paper makes use of such data to promote energy efficiency of vehicles. In particular, a Multi-Lane Adaptive Cruise Controller (MLACC) is designed which determines the optimal velocity and lane-to-drive in real-time. This cruise controller solves lane-specific optimization problems to compute an instantaneous trip cost for each lane and selects the lane that poses the lowest cost. The optimization tasks incorporate future route data and encompass multiple objectives including safety, energy efficiency and desired velocity tracking. Therefore, they can be treated as distinct Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) problems that have to be solved altogether in each sampling time. To handle the computational load of solving multiple NMPCs in real-time, an integration of Newton and Generalized Minimal Residual numerical methods is employed. The proposed MLACC is implemented for a 2013 Toyota Prius and a wide range of simulation studies are performed to examine the controller. Specifically, hardware-in-the-loop experiments are utilized to evaluate the real-time implementability of the controller. In addition, extensive model-in-the-loop simulations are carried out and the results are compared with driver-in-the-loop experiments. Simulation results indicated that speed profiles and lane changes suggested by MLACC yield up to 27% improvement in energy consumption compared to human drivers.},

  abstract     = {Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are being extensively used for transportation and distribution of materials due to their high-efficiency. However, the vehicle-collision free problem is challenging since, when modeling these systems, there are indistinguishable and uncontrollable events due to the limited sensors and actuators. This paper proposes an approach to the design of a maximally permissive (optimal) controller to prevent vehicles from any collision based on Petri nets (PNs). For a typical class of AGV systems, a system modeling algorithm is presented using labeled PN, where indistinguishable events are represented by a set of transitions carrying the same label, and an uncontrollable event by an uncontrollable transition. By virtue of the PN model, the collision-free problem is formalized as a conjunction of linear constraints that are converted into admissible ones by an algorithm such that the computational overhead due to uncontrollable events is significantly reduced. In turn, a method is developed to compute the set of consistent markings for an observed sequence of labels that represent signals generated by sensors. Finally, given an observed sequence, a maximally permissive control action is computed to enforce a conjunction of admissible linear constraints based on the set of consistent markings. The approach well addresses the challenging issues caused by indistinguishable and uncontrollable events. A typical AGV system is utilized to illustrate and verify the theoretical results throughout the work.},

Despite their environmental benefits, the massive electricity demand imposed by the anticipated proliferation of EVs could jeopardize the secure and economic operation of the power grid. Hence, proper strategies for charging coordination will be indispensable to the future power grid. Coordinated EV charging schemes can be implemented as centralized, decentralized, and hierarchical systems, with the last two, referred to as distributed charging control systems. This paper reviews the recent literature of distributed charging control schemes, where the computations are distributed across multiple EVs and/or aggregators. First, we categorize optimization problems for EV charging in terms of operational aspects and cost aspects. Then under each category, we provide a comprehensive discussion on algorithms for distributed EV charge scheduling, considering the perspectives of the grid operator, the aggregator, and the EV user. We also discuss how certain algorithms proposed in the literature cope with various uncertainties inherent to distributed EV charging control problems. Finally, we outline several research directions that require further attention.},

Moreover, the research community continues to explore and investigate more robust approaches to deal with inattention. Meanwhile, vehicle automation, to various degrees, is becoming more prevalent, with the human&#39;s role in the driving task changing depending on the level of autonomy. This necessitates that inattention detection, moving forward, be studied and designed in view of automation and in the context of a specific level of vehicle autonomy. Driver inattention and vehicle automation interact in a complex way, and that needs to be taken into account in the design of future vehicles.

In FGL, the DCNNs face an inherent trade-off between moving objects, i.e., the foreground (FG) and the non-static background (BG) scenes, through learning from local- and global-level features. Driven by the latest success of the innovative structures for image classification and semantic segmentation, this work introduces a novel architecture, called Slow Encoder-Decoder (sEnDec) that aims to improve the learning capacity of a traditional image-to-image DCNN. The proposed model subsumes two subnets for contraction (encoding) and expansion (decoding), wherein both phases, it employs an intermediate feature map up-sampling and residual connections. In this way, the lost structural details due to spatial subsampling are recovered. It helps to get a more delineated FG region. The experimental study is carried out with two variants of the proposed model: one with strided convolution (conv) and the other with max pooling for spatial subsampling. A comparative analysis on sixteen benchmark video sequences, including baseline, dynamic background, camera jitter, shadow effects, intermittent object motion, night videos, and bad weather show that the proposed sEnDec model performs very competitively against the prior- and state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {It is significant to discovery the impact of panic on crowd movement and study the panic propagation mechanism which can help real crowd control. This paper focuses on panic propagation dynamics in a high-density crowd based on information entropy theory and Aw-Rascle model. A novel concept of panic entropy is defined to quantify the confusion degree of crowd movement based on information entropy theory. The behavior characteristics are measured by the modulus and direction of the gridded crowd velocity vector in a two-dimension space. In order to study panic propagation dynamics, Aw-Rascle model is used to describe the crowd flow dynamics. Then, the dynamic model of panic propagation is proposed based on crowd flow. To validate the panic propagation model, numerical simulations are conducted based on one of stampedes happened in the Mecca Hajj in 2015. Simulation results show the relationship between the crowd panic entropy, density and velocity with visual panic distribution and different color contour diagrams. As a discussion result of the relationship between velocity and panic entropy, it is verified that: 1) moderate panic can help the crowd to keep relatively high velocity; 2) excessive panic can lead to irregular crowd movement and decrease crowd movement velocity especially in the over-crowded situation. The contribution of this paper is to provide a novel approach to quantify crowd panic degree and study panic propagation dynamics in a high-density crowd.},

  abstract     = {The explosion of online shopping brings great challenges to traditional logistics industry, where the massive parcels and tight delivery deadline impose a large cost on the delivery process, in particular the last mile parcel delivery. On the other hand, modern cities never lack transportation resources such as the private car trips. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel and effective last mile parcel delivery mechanism through car trip sharing, to leverage the available private car trips to incidentally deliver parcels during their original trips. To achieve this, the major challenges lie in how to accurately estimate the parcel delivery trip cost and assign proper tasks to suitable car trips to maximize the overall performance. To this end, we develop Car4Pac, an intelligent last mile parcel delivery system to address these challenges. Leveraging the real-world massive car trip trajectories, we first build up a 3D (time-dependent, driver-dependent and vehicle-dependent) landmark graph that accurately predicts the travel time and fuel consumption of each road segment. Our prediction method considers not only traffic conditions of different times, but also driving skills of different people and fuel efficiencies of different vehicles. We then develop a two-stage solution towards the parcel delivery task assignment, which is optimal for one-to-one assignment and yields high-quality results for many-to-one assignment. Our extensive real-world trace driven evaluations further demonstrate the superiority of our Car4Pac solution.},

We conduct so far the most comprehensive evaluation on various models proposed for trajectory prediction, including 5 statistic-based models and 10 deep-learning based networks. In addition, we propose a hybrid model that integrates MLP to extract local features and LSTM to capture long term dependency. It is also enhanced with a moving-state prediction model based on random forest to further reduce prediction error. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation on three real datasets with different motion patterns and reveal interesting findings. Furthermore, the experimental results show that our proposed hybrid model achieves superior performance over its competitors in all the datasets.},

The system consists of three stages, traffic sign detection, refinement and classification. The detection and refinement is performed using Mask R-CNN while the classification is achieved with a proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. We introduced the extended version of the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB), labeled in a pixel manner (masks) with 164 classes grouped into 8 categories.

The result is a requirement on the vehicle delay, which is a quantity that is directly related to the dynamics of the controlled vehicles and describes how much time the vehicles need to follow a change of the velocity set-point. If the vehicle delay is too large, communication from vehicles ahead improve the performance of the vehicle within the platoon. It is proved that in order to guarantee collision avoidance in the platoon, the truncated platoons have to be externally positive. Hence, the vehicle controllers have to be designed with the two, partly contradictory objectives to make the vehicle delay as small as possible and to end up with externally positive vehicles. It is investigated how vehicles with velocity controller or combined distance and velocity controller can satisfy these objectives.},

Private cars are the most important component of urban road traffic. However, current research on urban mobility seldom employs travel data from private cars due to the lack of access to corresponding data acquisition. This problem can be solved with the massive application of Electronic Registration Identification (ERI), which is an emerging technology to identify a unique vehicle based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). This paper proposes a framework for discovering the urban mobility of private cars based on ERI data. The main research content includes two parts: trajectory segmentation and attractive area mining. In the trajectory segmentation, stay segments in trajectories are identified by Bayes classification based on the link travel time distribution model. The model parameters of each link are trained by Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm. In attractive area mining, a spatial clustering algorithm based on data field is introduced. Finally, we utilized real-world data into the proposed algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately segment the trajectory, and the visualization of attractive areas reveals the urban mobility characteristics of private cars.},

First, in order to address large distortion problem in the fisheye images, Restricted Deformable Convolution (RDC) is proposed for semantic segmentation, which can effectively model geometric transformations by learning the shapes of convolutional filters conditioned on the input feature map. Second, in order to obtain a large-scale training set of surround view images, a novel method called zoom augmentation is proposed to transform conventional images to fisheye images. Finally, an RDC based semantic segmentation model is built; the model is trained for real-world surround view images through a multi-task learning architecture by combining real-world images with transformed images. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the RDC to handle images with large distortions, and that the proposed approach shows a good performance using surround view cameras with the help of the transformed images.},

Our control goal is to drive the vehicles to reach a specified line formation, while moving forward according to the platoon leader speed. The control law in each vehicle is computed only by local relative information regarding its neighboring vehicles. The first result shows that communication delays cause steady-state formation error, whose value can be analytically calculated from the system data, and may lead to instability, if the delays values surpass a threshold. Hence, in the light of this finding, we present a decentralized control law to compensate for the delay effect, providing zero steady-state formation error. The paper is concluded by showing simulated experiments over six different communication topologies illustrating the applicability of our proposal.},

  abstract     = {Characterisation of the driver’s non-driving activities (NDAs) is of great importance to the design of the take-over control strategy in Level 3 automation. Gaze estimation is a typical approach to monitor the driver’s behaviour since the eye gaze is normally engaged with the human activities. However, current eye gaze tracking techniques are either costly or intrusive which limits their applicability in vehicles. This paper proposes a low-cost and non-intrusive dual-cameras based gaze mapping system that visualises the driver’s gaze using a heat map. The challenges introduced by complex head movement during NDAs and camera distortion are addressed by proposing a nonlinear polynomial model to establish the relationship between the face features and eye gaze on the simulated driver’s view. The Root Mean Square Error of this system in the in-vehicle experiment for the X and Y direction is 7.80±5.99 pixel and 4.64±3.47 pixel respectively with the image resolution of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$1440 \times 1080$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; pixels. This system is successfully demonstrated to evaluate three NDAs with visual attention. This technique, acting as a generic tool to monitor driver’s visual attention, will have wide applications on NDA characterisation for intelligent design of take over strategy and driving environment awareness for current and future automated vehicles.},

However, existing methods mainly focus on structure feature information which contains morphological shape features and machine learning features, suffering from lots of false positives which are generated at positions having similar structure features but different gray-value distribution with roads. To effectively fuse the two complementary gray-value distribution and structure feature information, we propose a coarse-to-fine road extraction algorithm from remote sensing images. First, at the coarse level, we introduce a local Dirichlet mixture models (LDMM) which utilizing gray-value distribution information to pre-segment images into potential roads and backgrounds. Thus, most backgrounds having different gray-value distribution with roads can be removed firstly. Compared with original Dirichlet mixture models, the LDMM is much faster and more accurate. Next, at the fine level, we introduce a multiscale-high-order deep learning strategy based on ResNet model which can learn robust structure context features for final road extraction step. Based on the results of LDMM, the multiscale-high-order strategy can further remove false positives which have different structure features with roads. Compared with a single scanning size ResNet, our multiscale-high-order strategy can learn higher-order context information, leading to better performances. We test our algorithm on Shaoshan dataset. Experiments illustrate our better performance compared with other six state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Basic Safety Messaging plays a crucial role to provide road safety in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). To avoid potential accidents, vehicles periodically broadcast safety information to neighboring vehicles. However, due to transmission collisions, fading channels and other factors, vehicular networks usually suffer a low packet delivery ratio (PDR) and a large delay, which are intolerant of many safety applications. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid medium access control (MAC) protocol for basic safety message (BSM) dissemination based on the framework of Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC). Its partially centralized and partially distributed characteristic not only can effectively suppress the collisions, but keep compatibility with IEEE 802.11p. In addition, the integration of Physical-Layer Network Coding (PNC) and Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) further strengthens the reliability and efficiency for BSM dissemination. Both the theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulations indicate that, compared with existing schemes, the proposed protocol can significantly improve the PDR by a range of 20% to 300%. Meanwhile, in terms of normalized throughput, it increases by varying percent between 20% and 160% in different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Energy-efficient train operation is regarded as an effective way to reduce the operational cost and carbon emissions in metro systems. Reduction of the traction energy and increasing of the regenerative energy are two important ways for saving energy, which is closely related to the train timetable and driving strategy. To minimize the systematic net energy consumption, i.e., the difference between the traction energy consumption and the reused regenerative energy, this paper proposes an integrated train operation approach by jointly optimizing the train timetable and driving strategy. A precise train driving strategy is presented and the timetable model considers the headway between successive trains, the distribution of the trip time, and passenger demand in this paper. In addition, a distributed regenerative braking energy model is proposed, based on which the integrated optimization model is formulated. Then, a two-level approach is proposed to solve the problem. At the driving strategy level, the train control problem is transferred into a multi-step decision problem and the Dynamic Programming method is introduced to calculate the energy-efficient driving strategy with the given trip time. As for the timetable level, the trip times and headway of trains are optimized by using the Simulated Annealing algorithm based on the results of dynamic programming method. The timetable optimization level balances the mechanical traction energy of multi-interstations and the amount of the reused regenerative energy such that the net mechanical energy consumption of the metro system is minimized. Furthermore, two numerical examples are conducted for train operations in the peak and off-peak hours separately based on the real-world data of a metro line. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed approach can produce a good performance on energy-saving.},

We study a novel data dissemination protocol which investigates a chain-based transmit rate control to reduce data dissemination latency. The optimal resource allocation algorithm is formulated to minimize the total dissemination latency of the platoon under guaranteed bit error rates, and can be judiciously reformulated and solved using standard optimization techniques. A novel dynamic programming algorithm is presented to solve the platooning resource allocation optimization, which uses backward induction to significantly reduce the resource allocation complexity. In addition, we interpret the vehicular platoon as one-dimensional Markov chain, and derive a closed form of dissemination latency. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed dynamic programming algorithm. The numerical results show that our algorithm achieves optimal solutions with cutting off the complexity by orders of magnitude, while improving dissemination rate in the vehicular platoon.},

This paper proposes a novel automatic planning method to suggest multiple itineraries that satisfy the specific demands of tourists. First, a multiple-itinerary planning model is developed, which provides three customized goals for a tourist to choose and supports generating multiple D -day trips. The model makes fewer assumptions than the literature works did, while it provides more flexibility to the tourists. Then, based on the multiple-itinerary planning model, we design a niching genetic evolution approach to accomplish the automatic itinerary planning task. The genetic evolution approach guarantees a high search efficiency, while the niching strategy facilitates maintaining the population diversity. Consequently, the resultant algorithm can finally provide a number of diverse and superior solutions. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithm not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in considering different user-specified goals, but it is also capable of generating a set of diverse itineraries for the tourist to select. Additional experiments further verify the scalability of the proposed algorithm in terms of the problem size and the optimization objective.},

  abstract     = {The low user acceptability of advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) is one of the fundamental problems limiting their wider adoption. One of the key factors affecting the frequency of warning signals is the standard warning thresholds set in ADASs, which may not be compatible with all drivers owing to various driver characteristics affecting their cognition of risk, such as comfort, skill, and experience. The present study focuses on the lane change warning (LCW) system to evaluate driving styles according to the perception of lane change risk, and determine appropriate warning thresholds corresponding to the different driving styles. A theoretical lane change warning model is established to calculate the deceleration required for the rear approaching vehicle in the target lane. The results of risk assessment experiments conducted on an actual expressway using 15 proficient drivers are employed to evaluate the risk cognitions of the participants, where the participants are divided into four different driving styles according to their adaptive warning thresholds, which are denoted as very low threshold, low threshold, medium threshold, and high threshold driving styles. Signal detection theory is then employed to determine lane change warning thresholds appropriate to the different driving styles. Our results clearly demonstrate the disparate perceptions of lane change risk for the different drivers. Therefore, the LCW system should adopt different warning thresholds for different drivers according to their driving style. The findings provide evidence supporting the exploitation of driving styles for adopting different warning thresholds in the LCW system to enhance its user acceptability.},

A new concise mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to address UAV routing and charging station planning for belt conveyor inspection. We conduct computational tests covering a real conveyor belt system in Brazil to validate the model in practical applications. The loading terminal possesses approximately 120 km of belt conveyors, leading to 230 inspection points. Instances of different sizes were generated by randomly sampling a subset of these points and using two different drone specifications. The results show that the new optimization modeling satisfies the problem requirements and is a significant contribution to the automation of inspection in the mining industry.},

However, current mainstream semantic segmenters are predominantly benchmarked against datasets featuring narrow Field of View (FoV), and a large part of vision-based intelligent vehicles use only a forward-facing camera. In this paper, we propose a Panoramic Annular Semantic Segmentation (PASS) framework to perceive the whole surrounding based on a compact panoramic annular lens system and an online panorama unfolding process. To facilitate the training of PASS models, we leverage conventional FoV imaging datasets, bypassing the efforts entailed to create fully dense panoramic annotations. To consistently exploit the rich contextual cues in the unfolded panorama, we adapt our real-time ERF-PSPNet to predict semantically meaningful feature maps in different segments, and fuse them to fulfill panoramic scene parsing. The innovation lies in the network adaptation to enable smooth and seamless segmentation, combined with an extended set of heterogeneous data augmentations to attain robustness in panoramic imagery. A comprehensive variety of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness for real-world surrounding perception in a single PASS, while the adaptation proposal is exceptionally positive for state-of-the-art efficient networks.},

The economic route and speed for a given origin-destination pair with the given expected trip time are optimized by a proposed vehicle macroscopic motion planning method, where the powertrain is optimized by a proposed global power distribution (GPD) strategy. The HEV powertrain controller, consisting of feedforward and feedback control schemes, is developed for real-time cruise control, where the former is based on the GPD strategy and the latter is based on the receding horizon linear quadratic tracking method. In addition, a mode-switch local optimization method is used to modify the reference speed for passing, traffic jam and light crossing. A co-simulation model, combining the SUMO traffic model and Simulink hybrid powertrain model, is developed and used for validating the proposed EACC strategy. The co-simulation results indicate that the proposed EACC is able to decrease the fuel consumption by more than 30% comparing with the power follower strategy adopting the fastest route. Note that even with the same powertrain controller, the economic route and speed stratgey is able to improve the fuel economy by 14.21%, comparing with the fastest route without optimization.},

We have designed and implemented a generic Future Mobility Sensing (FMS) system to serve these purposes. FMS harnesses various sensing technologies, heterogeneous multi-source data and analytical functionalities with three dedicated platforms, namely 1) the FMS Data Collection Platform, which intertwines sensing objects, machine learning algorithms and user verifications to collect high resolution, multi-day travel data; 2) the FMS Data Management Platform, which provides standardized APIs to access data stored in an interconnected data model; and 3) the FMS Data Fusion and Visualization Platform, which consolidates multi-source data to be interpreted and presented. Together, the three platforms form a mobility sensing flow to facilitate data-driven analysis and decision-making. With FMS, heterogeneous multi-source data are suitably integrated for analysis, and multi-dimensional knowledge is extracted and presented in intuitive and interactive analytical dashboards. The system is intended to be generic to support different requirements of mobility studies, such as travel surveys, as its function modules are reusable and can be customized to support a unified data collection, management, fusion and visualization process. This paper introduces the overall architecture of the FMS system and summarizes various applications that it can support. Specifically, we present a study of commercial vehicle parking in Singapore to demonstrate the capability of the system.},

As the principal contribution of this work, a linear optimization problem for an MPC approach is formulated, which considers downstream propagating waves linked to free-flow traffic, queuing dynamics, and upstream propagating waves related to spillback (i.e. forward and backward moving waves, respectively). The linear optimization problem is obtained by describing link dynamics using the link transmission model, and aggregating the traffic dynamics to (several) tens of seconds. The performance of the proposed controller is compared with two other existing strategies; a store-and-forward model-based, and a cell transmission model-based approach. The total time spent (TTS) by all the vehicles in the network and the computation time is applied as performance indexes for the evaluation of the control strategies. Simulation results show that including upstream propagating waves results in better controller performance, due to the explicit modeling of the impact of link outflow on the maximum link inflow.},

Previous studies of taxis are limited to taxi stands or hail markets at aggregate spatial units. Here we estimate the dynamic demand and supply of taxis in New York City (NYC) at street segment level, using in-vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) data which preserve individual privacy. To this end, we model taxi demand and supply as non-stationary Poisson random fields on the road network, and pickups result from income-maximizing drivers searching for impatient passengers. With 868 million trip records of all 13,237 licensed taxis in NYC in 2009 – 2013, we show that while taxi demand are almost the same in 2011 and 2012, it declined about 2% in spring 2013, possibly caused by transportation network companies (TNCs) and fare raise. Contrary to common impression, street-hail taxis out-perform TNCs such as Uber in high-demand locations, suggesting a taxi/TNC regulation change to reduce congestion and pollution. We show that our demand estimates are stable at different supply levels and across years, a property not observed in existing matching functions. We also validate that taxi pickups can be modeled as Poisson processes. Our method is thus simple, feasible, and reliable in estimating street-hail taxi activities at a high spatial resolution; it helps quantify the ongoing discussion on congestion charges to taxis and TNCs.},

This study introduces a dynamic adaptive algorithm for automated merging control based on a cost function of travel time for both on-ramp and mainline vehicles. The developed algorithm is designed to guide on-ramp vehicles to merge efficiently, without frequent slowdown or wait for merging gaps at the end of the ramp and with minimal disruption to the mainline traffic. The algorithm was evaluated under different mainline traffic demands, ranging from light to heavy conditions, using a simulation model for a one-mile freeway segment with two lanes and a single-lane on-ramp. Platooning is implemented in the simulation based on Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control. The performance of the algorithm is compared to a base case where mainline vehicles cooperatively decelerate to help on-ramp vehicles merge. The results show that the proposed algorithm reduced ramp delays in the range of 38% to 91% for different traffic conditions, without disrupting mainline operation. Additionally, travel time reliability index improved in the range of 18% to 48% under different traffic conditions. According to the simulation results, the proposed automated merging algorithm is henceforth considered reliable, with its promising performance.},

  abstract     = {In the data mining of road networks, trajectory clustering of moving objects is of particular interest for its practical importance in many applications. Most of the existing approaches to this problem are based on distance measurement, and suffer from several performance limitations including inaccurate clustering, expensive computation, and incompetency to handle high dimensional trajectory data. This paper investigates the complex network theory and explores its application to trajectory clustering in road networks to address these issues. Specifically, we model a road network as a dual graph, which facilitates an effective transformation of the clustering problem from sub-trajectories in the road network to nodes in the complex network. Based on this model, we design a label-based trajectory clustering algorithm, referred to as LBTC, to capture and characterize the essence of similarity between nodes. For the evaluation of clustering performance, we establish a clustering criterion based on the classical Davies-Bouldin Index (DB), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to maximize inter-cluster separation and intra-cluster homogeneity. The clustering accuracy and performance superiority of the proposed algorithm are illustrated by extensive simulations on both synthetic and real-world dataset in comparison with existing algorithms.},

In this study, a roadside LiDAR sensor is used to collect 3D point clouds of surrounding objects. An automatic background construction and object detection method is proposed on the basis of the operation principle of the LiDAR sensor. In the algorithm, the discrete horizontal and vertical angular values can be considered as coordinates of pixels in digital images, and the farthest and mean distance of each azimuth are used to construct the background dataset. Then, vehicle and pedestrian points are extracted on the basis of the distance difference of each point with the same angular value between the target frame dataset and the background dataset. A density-based spatial clustering method is employed to group points into clusters and identify vehicles and pedestrians automatically. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is tested for roadside LiDAR data preprocessing under different traffic conditions. Our algorithm can perform well with high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve a larger detection range and exhibit lower time complexity in comparison with a previously proposed algorithm.},

To be specific, a novel train-centric CBTC systems is established based on T2T wireless communication where distributed sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (DS-SPS) is served as the resource allocation scheme in the T2T scenario.

In this paper, we present visions and works on integrating the artificial intelligent transportation systems and the real intelligent transportation systems to create and enhance “intelligence” of IoT-enabled ITS. With the increasing ubiquitous and deep sensing capacity of IoT-enabled ITS, we can quickly create artificial transportation systems equivalent to physical transportation systems in computers, and thus have parallel intelligent transportation systems, i.e. the real intelligent transportation systems and artificial intelligent transportation systems. The evolution process of transportation system is studied in the view of the parallel world. We can use a large number of long-term iterative simulation to predict and analyze the expected results of operations. Thus, truly effective and smart ITS can be planned, designed, built, operated and used. The foundation of the parallel intelligent transportation systems is based on the ACP theory, which is composed of artificial societies, computational experiments, and parallel execution. We also present some case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of parallel transportation systems.},

This paper proposes a machine learning approach for automatic detection of vacant lots in delimited parking spaces where the boundaries of the individual parking lots are predefined, which is then extended to a more general scenario of non-delimited parking spaces. A bag of features (bof) representation for the lots is used with a single svm classifier to discriminate between occupied and vacant lots. For non-delimited spaces, a customized background subtraction algorithm is used to generate proposal regions where vehicles can possibly be found, which are then verified using a bof plus svm approach. When tested on public datasets with images of real parking spaces, the proposed method shows robustness against large intra-class variabilities of vehicles and wide variations in vehicle pose and scale in each parking lot. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the major advantages of the proposed approach are that it requires fewer images to train the classifier, accepts non-rectangular, variable sized images as input and can also be applied to non-delimited parking spaces, making it suitable for practical deployment.},

  abstract     = {The growing variety of data from condition monitoring of high-speed railways offer unprecedented opportunities to improve railway infrastructure maintenance. For condition monitoring of railway catenaries, this paper proposes a data-driven approach that uses a Bayesian network (BN) to integrate the inspection data from catenaries into a key performance indicator (KPI). The BN topology is structured based on the physical relationships among data types, including train speed, dynamic stagger and height of the contact wire, pantograph head acceleration, and pantograph-catenary contact force. The tailored performance indicators are individually defined and extracted from the five types of data as the BN input. As the output of the BN, the KPI is defined as the overall condition level of the catenary considering all defects that can be reflected by the data types. Finally, using historical inspection data and maintenance records from a section of the Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed line in China, the BN parameters are estimated to establish a probabilistic relationship between the input and output. An approach that applies the estimated BN to catenary condition monitoring is proposed. Testing of the BN-based approach using new inspection data shows that the output KPI can adequately represent the catenary condition, leading to a nearly 66.2% reduction in the false alarm rate of defect detection compared with current practice. It is also tested that when the input data quality is not ideal, the approach can still work acceptably on noisy data with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 3 dB or with one type of data missing.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of operator-based vehicle repositioning in free-floating electric car-sharing systems (FFCSs). New algorithmic techniques are developed which derive cost-effective relocation tours by primarily minimizing relocation drivers&#39; walking time. Car repositioning takes place overnight and aims at complete rebalancing of the system i.e., at achieving an optimal, based on user demand, cars distribution among nonoverlapping cells of the FFCS&#39;s operating area. The battery level of the electric cars is also taken into account when deciding if and where each car will be relocated. If k is the number of employees handling car relocations from oversupplied to undersupplied regions, when k = 1 i.e., there exists a single employee carrying out a relocation tour comprising alternating phases of a car relocation followed by walking to the next to be relocated car, we define and solve the Minimum Walking Car Repositioning Problem (MWCRP) whose main objective is to minimize the walking distance in the relocation tour as the walking part of such a tour is tiresome and takes more time than the driving one. We also define and solve the k-MWCRP when k &gt; 1 to handle the case that a team of more than one drivers is employed to take on the relocation plan. It is worth mentioning that these are the first vehicle relocation techniques lowering the relocation cost by mostly minimizing the walking cost. Performance results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the dynamic system optimum (DSO) problem with simultaneous route and departure time assignments for a general traffic network partitioned into multiple regions. Regional traffic congestion is modeled with a well-defined macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) mapping the trip completion rate to the vehicular accumulation. To overcome the limitation of inconsistent flow propagation between region boundaries and the corresponding travel time, the state-dependent regional travel time function is explicitly incorporated in the flow propagation of the conventional MFD dynamics. From a systems perspective, the traffic dynamics within a region can be regarded as a dynamic system with an endogenous time-varying delay depending on the system state. Equilibrium condition for the DSO problem is analytically derived through the lens of Pontryagin minimum principle and is compared against the static SO counterpart. The structure of path specific marginal cost is analyzed regarding the path travel cost and early-late penalty function. In contrast to existing analytical methods, the proposed method is applicable for general MFD systems without linearization of the MFD dynamics. Neither approximation of the equilibrium solution nor constant regional delay assumption is required. Numerical examples are conducted to illustrate the characteristics of DSO traffic equilibrium and the corresponding marginal cost together with other dynamic external costs.},

Intelligent transport systems in particular face this challenge, as interactions with people are often required. The development and testing of technical perception solutions is done mostly on standard vision benchmark datasets for which manual labelling of sensory ground truth has been a tedious but necessary task. Furthermore, rarely occurring human activities are underrepresented in these datasets, leading to algorithms not recognizing such activities. For this purpose, we introduce a modular simulation framework, which offers to train and validate algorithms on various human-centred scenarios. We describe the usage of simulation data to train a state-of-the-art human pose estimation algorithm to recognize unusual human activities in urban areas. Since the recognition of human actions can be an important component of intelligent transport systems, we investigated how simulations can be applied for his purpose. Laboratory experiments show that we can train a recurrent neural network with only simulated data based on motion capture data and 3D avatars, which achieves an almost perfect performance in the classification of those human actions on real data.},

However, considering just traffic-related information to recommend better routes for each vehicle is far from achieving the desired requirements of a good Traffic Management System, which intends to improve not only mobility but also driving experience and safety of drivers and passengers. Context-aware and multi-objective re-routing approaches will play an important role in traffic management. However, most of these approaches are deterministic and can not support the strict requirements of traffic management applications, since many vehicles potentially will take the same route, and, thus, degrade the overall traffic efficiency. In this work, we introduce Safe and Sound (SNS), a non-deterministic multi-objective re-routing approach for improving traffic efficiency and reduce public safety risks (based on criminal events) for drivers and passengers. SNS employs a hybrid architecture and a cooperative re-routing approach for improving system scalability and computation efforts. SNS uses a recurrent neural network to both predict future safety risks dynamics and enable a personalized re-routing in which each vehicle decides the risks it wants to avoid. Simulation results revealed that when compared to state-of-the-art approaches, SNS reduces the CPU time of the re-routing algorithm in approximately 99% and decreases the average safety risk for drivers and passengers in at least 30% while keeping efficient traffic mobility.},

In this paper, we present our latest progress on improving the policy transfer performance under this framework. Concretely, we applied adaptive DOB, so as to more accurately model the inverse system dynamics and increase the cut-off frequency of the Q-filter in the DOB. A closed-loop reference path smoothing algorithm is introduced to alleviate the step disturbance input imposed by the reference trajectory re-planning. On the neural network control policy side, we applied the parallel attribute networks, a hierarchical modular policy network to dynamically handle various driving tasks. We have carried out various simulations and experiments to validate the capability of our proposed method to achieve sim-to-sim and sim-to-real policy transfer.

Specifically, we first present a network flow model for intermodal AMoD, where we capture the coupling between AMoD and public transit and the goal is to maximize social welfare. Second, leveraging such a model, we design a pricing and tolling scheme that allows the system to recover a social optimum under the assumption of a perfect market with selfish agents. Third, we present real-world case studies for the transportation networks of New York City and Berlin, which allow us to quantify the general benefits of intermodal AMoD, as well as the societal impact of different vehicles. In particular, we show that vehicle size and powertrain type heavily affect intermodal routing decisions and, thus, system efficiency. Our studies reveal that the cooperation between AMoD fleets and public transit can yield significant benefits compared to an AMoD system operating in isolation, whilst our proposed tolling policies appear to be in line with recent discussions for the case of New York City.},

  abstract     = {Developing an autonomous driving system which can generate human-like actions requires the ability to utilize the basic driving skills learned from the driving data. The efficiency of the algorithm can be significantly improved if we can decompose the complex driving tasks into motion primitives (MPs) which represent the elementary composition of driving skills. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to represent MPs, extract MPs from unlabeled driving data, and then connect the learned MPs in the established library. By applying a probabilistic inference based on an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and initial segmentation, the extraction method segments the observed trajectories while learning a set of MPs represented by the modified dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). Moreover, the proposed connection algorithm transforms the connection problem into the re-representation problem of the MP sequence. This paper demonstrates that the modified DMP method can not only represent the driver&#39;s trajectory with acceptable accuracy but also have strong generalization ability. We also present how to utilize the mutual dependency between the representation and extraction to achieve MP segmentation and MP library establishment. Besides, this paper shows how the proposed connection algorithm correlates the independent MPs in the sequence to ensure a smooth transition and evaluates the tracking accuracy. The results show that the proposed method realizes the extraction of MPs and the re-generation of trajectory by making use of the interdependence relationship that is often neglected between the representation of a single MP, extraction of different types of MP and combination of multiple MPs.},

  abstract     = {With the goal of maximizing the sum rate of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networks, a well-designed resource-sharing scheme tends to match the ones producing less amount of interference. The statistics also reveals that the interference incurred by a well-designed resource-sharing scheme concentrates at a certain level. This observation hints us that as the non-uniform quantization scheme is used, solely fewer quantization bits are required to capture the main characteristic of the resource-sharing interference. Thus, in this paper, we aim to reduce the overheads for reporting the channel state information (CSI) to avoid any intolerable amount of interference caused by improperly resource sharing between V2I and V2V connections. To achieve this, the non-uniform quantization method is developed to construct the channel-quality indicator (CQI) for capturing the most informative CSI using fewer bits. Taking the conventional interference-aware graph resource-sharing scheme with perfect CSI as the baseline, we find that with regular traffic density, one-bit CQI can achieve equivalent performance. That remarkably saves 95.5% of CSI overheads without sacrificing the sum rate.},

This paper investigates the extent to which strategic behavior on part of the airlines can impact the performance of each mechanism. In addition to increasing system efficiency, the reallocation mechanisms should exhibit desirable fairness and incentive properties, notions that we formally investigate in this paper. We show that neither mechanism has good incentive properties, and we develop simple, non-truthful strategies that airlines can use. Our empirical results show that for the scaled airline preferences mechanism, the best performing strategy depends greatly on the extent to which fairness is enforced. For the two-for-two trades mechanism, a simple threshold strategy can yield significant cost savings relative to the best-response strategy, and system efficiency increases when all airlines use the threshold strategy in equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Curb detection and tracking is an essential component of autonomous vehicle operation in urban environments. Detecting curbs is a particularly challenging task in urban environments that contain countless dynamic objects. Previous studies have approached curb detection using different types of sensor such as cameras, radar, and LIDAR. Among these, LIDAR sensors have superior advantages in regard to detecting curbs because of their robustness in different weather conditions and they can provide accurate distance measurements. Previous methods based on LIDAR have exploited high-resolution 3D point clouds using high-cost LIDARs. However, the processing of large volumes of information is inefficient for autonomous driving technologies because of real time constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time curb detection and tracking algorithm that makes use of a low-resolution LIDAR. The proposed method consists of three steps. First is the extraction of curb candidates based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Second is the selection of the optimal candidate using an optimization framework. Lastly is the tracking of the detected curbs. In the tracking module, we use a combination of spatial consistency and validation gate to track the curb in the occlusion region with dynamic objects. Experiments on a public dataset show that the proposed method achieved 91.54% and 89.76% F 1 score on the straight and curved road while running at about 18 ms per frame, thereby outperforming the state-of-the-art by a large margin. In addition, we integrated the proposed method with the localization module of our autonomous driving platform. The localization module integrated with the proposed method reduces the positional and lateral root mean square (RMS) error of the vehicle localization by 3.58% and 6.68% respectively. In addition, we compare this method with a deep neural network based method from the perspective of a safety-critical system such as self-driving cars.},

  abstract     = {Smart shared mobility is an emerging transportation strategy that promotes sustainable and intelligent transportation. Bike sharing is one mode of smart shared mobility and is gaining popularity in recent years. To ensure a smooth operation of a bike sharing system (BSS), it is essential to redistribute the bicycles, which includes picking up returned bicycles and relocating them to best serve customers. A bike sharing rebalancing problem (BSRP) has thus emerged. This paper addresses a static BSRP which operates during the night when shared bikes are rarely utilized or when the BSS is closed. We studied a single-vehicle BSRP (sBSRP) and multi-vehicle BSRP (mBSRP) with the objective of minimizing the depot inventory cost as well as the traveling cost. For mBSRP, six formulations are presented i.e. five mixed integer programming models (mBSRP1-mBSRP5) and a mixed integer linear programming model (mBSRP6). In addition, an iterative procedure combined with the branch-and-cut algorithm in the CPLEX solver is developed to solve this problem. A real-world case study is employed to test the effectiveness of the formulations, and a set of benchmark instances are adopted to further compare the performances of mBSRP5 and mBSRP6. The experimental results show that mBSRP6 performs the best among the six models, offering the best solution quality and computational efficiency. Finally, mBSRP6 is applied to determine the depot inventory for the case study using random demand datasets.},

The systems include blind spot warning/lane change warning (BSW/LCW), forward collision warning (FCW), intersection movement assist (IMA), pedestrian crash avoidance and mitigation (PCAM), lane departure warning (LDW) and left turn assist (LTA) systems. The method involves the use of meta-analysis and quasi-induced exposure methodologies to estimate the distribution of effectiveness factors across the driver population. These factors include system operating conditions, system adoption rates and system usage features. Then a Monte-Carlo procedure is applied to sample these factors for simulating the practical ADAS effectiveness. The research shows that the practical effectiveness could be as much as 48.25% lower than the ideal effectiveness proposed by previous research. It is also found that BSW/FCW, PCAM, FCW and LDW systems exhibited the highest effectiveness when operating on urban expressways/freeways. On rural multilane highways, such systems are demonstrated to have the least effectiveness. Furthermore, LTA systems are found to perform better at rural intersections than at urban intersections while the conclusion is contrary regarding IMA systems. Among the six systems, BSW/LCW has the most consistent performance among facilities, while LTA is most likely to be affected by facility type. The integrated system of six ADAS systems could prevent at most 29.50% of total crashes on urban multi-lane highways, while its lowest practical effectiveness is 13.72% on rural two-lane highways. Finally, technical and policy implications of the results are discussed.},

However, traffic forecasting has always been considered an “open” scientific issue, owing to the constraints of urban road network topological structure and the law of dynamic change with time. To capture the spatial and temporal dependences simultaneously, we propose a novel neural network-based traffic forecasting method, the temporal graph convolutional network (T-GCN) model, which is combined with the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). Specifically, the GCN is used to learn complex topological structures for capturing spatial dependence and the gated recurrent unit is used to learn dynamic changes of traffic data for capturing temporal dependence. Then, the T-GCN model is employed to traffic forecasting based on the urban road network. Experiments demonstrate that our T-GCN model can obtain the spatio-temporal correlation from traffic data and the predictions outperform state-of-art baselines on real-world traffic datasets.

We consider there are two types of users, i.e. vehicular users (VUs) and static users (SUs), in a vehicular communication network. Since the channel characteristics of VUs and SUs are different, designing a multi-user multiplexing transmission strategy to provide an efficient and reliable transmission for two types of users is quite challenging. We propose a dynamic cross-layer transmission strategy with joint admission control, user association and resource allocation to increase the total throughput of VUs and SUs while satisfying the different quality of service (QoS) requirements. First, we formulate a throughput utility maximization problem subject to the QoS and maximum transmit power constraints. Second, with the help of Lyapunov optimization theory, the problem can be decomposed into three subproblems including traffic admission control, user association and resource allocation. Third, a novel robust resource allocation scheme with discrete-rate hierarchical modulation (HM) is designed for the reliable multiplexing transmission of two types of users. In addition, an optimal algorithm and a low complexity suboptimal algorithm are presented to solve the user association subproblem. For two types of users, comparing with uniform modulation schemes, the proposed transmission strategy with HM scheme can improve the throughput by more than 15%.},

First, a distributed attack detection algorithm is developed to identify any of those attacks. The core of the algorithm lies in that each designed filter can provide two ellipsoidal sets: a state prediction set and a state estimation set. Whether a filter can detect the occurrence of such an attack is determined by the existence of intersection between these two sets. Second, two recovery mechanisms are put forward, through which the adversarial effects of cyber attacks can be mitigated in a timely manner. The recovery mechanisms depend on reliable modifications of the attacked signals required for the computation of the two ellipsoidal sets.

We dynamically match available drivers to randomly arriving passengers and also decide pick-up and drop-off routes. The goal is to minimize a weighted sum of passengers’ waiting time and trip delay time. A spatial-and-temporal decomposition heuristic is applied and each subproblem is solved using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), for which we show properties of the approximated value function at each stage. Our model is benchmarked with the one that optimizes vehicle dispatch without ride-pooling and the one that matches current drivers and passengers without demand forecasting. Using test instances generated based on the New York City taxi data during one peak hour, we conduct computational studies and sensitivity analysis to show (i) empirical convergence of ADP, (ii) benefit of ride-pooling, and (iii) value of future supply-demand information.},

  abstract     = {Power-split hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) employ a speed reduction gear (SRG) mainly to enhance acceleration performance. However, the full potentials of an additional gear on fuel economy and acceleration performance have not yet been thoroughly investigated due to a vast design space: 432 configurations with three design variables (i.e. two planetary gear ratios and a final drive gear ratio). In this paper, a systematic speed reduction gear design methodology is proposed to analyze the impact of a speed reduction (multiplication) gear on the performance of input- and output-split HEVs and select an optimal configuration. First, the physical and virtual design spaces of SRG (SMG) are defined and the relationship between two design spaces are identified. Second, performance metrics are evaluated within the virtual design space using the proposed simplified lever. The proposed approach completely eliminates the redundancy present in the physical design spaces, and thus, the impact of SRG (SMG) on the performance of input- and output-split configurations can be analyzed with the minimum computational burden. Lastly, the selected gear ratio is converted back to the physical planetary gear connections. The results confirm that SRG (SMG) can potentially either improve or deteriorate the acceleration performance and the fuel economy of split HEVs. Therefore, the full potential of speed reduction or multiplication gear should be thoroughly analyzed when designing split hybrid electric vehicles.},

Automated re-scheduling tools have shown the potential to limit such undesirable outcomes. This study presents the network-wide effects of local deployment of an adaptive traffic controller for real-time operations that is built on approximate dynamic programming (ADP). The controller aims to limit train delays by advantageously controlling the sequencing of trains at critical locations. By using an approximation to the optimised value function of dynamic programming that is updated by reinforcement learning techniques, ADP reduces the computational burden substantially. This framework has been established for isolated local control, so here we investigate the effects of distributed deployment. Our ADP controller is interfaced with a microscopic railway traffic simulator to evaluate its effect on a large and dynamic railway system, which controls critical points independently. The proposed approach achieved a reduction in train delays by comparison with First-Come-First-Served control. We also found the improvements to be greater at terminal stations compared to the vicinity of our control areas.},

  abstract     = {Recently, pedestrian detection has made significant advances benefiting from the region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN). However, training R-CNN with a holistic intersection over union (IoU) always brings many flawed positive samples. This paper introduces a strict matching metric, which is beneficial to selecting well-aligned positive samples. Specifically, this matching metric is defined on a set of region-IoUs instead of a holistic IoU, which considers the alignments of different part regions in a whole bounding box simultaneously. A positive sample matches a ground truth only if all its region-IoUs are bigger than a threshold. Secondly, an improved negative example selection strategy using both the classification and localization information is proposed to mine hard negative examples, which can further suppress the false positive detections near the pedestrians. Based on the proposed sample selection strategy, a cascade compact convolutional neural network (CC-CNN) is proposed for accurate pedestrian detection. Each stage of the CC-CNN is constructed with a compact network that only consists of a small number of parameters, thus making the detector suitable to be implemented on onboard embedded systems. Experimental results on two widely used pedestrian datasets demonstrate that the proposed training strategy and the CC-CNN based detector can effectively improve the detection rate and the localization accuracy using fewer parameters.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates whether virtual samples can solve the small sample size (S 3 ) problem of Keep-It-Simple-and-Straightforward Metric Learning (KISSME) in Pedestrian re-identification (Re-ID). Re-ID is a very challenging and important problem in the field of multi-camera surveillance in smart transportation. Among many hand-crafted ways (not deeply-learned ones) to solve it, KISSME has received great attention. Although it has achieved convincing performance in some applications, it encounters an S 3 problem in calculating various classes of covariance matrices whose eigenvalues become too small. Such small eigenvalues cause an instability issue when computing the inverse of covariance matrices, thus resulting in poor Re-ID performance. If we can increase the number of samples, then an S 3 problem is alleviated or eliminated. This work makes a hypothesis that virtual samples can do so, and proposes a new algorithm to generate them. It adopts a Genetic Algorithm to generate virtual features (corresponding to virtual samples) based on the dimension-reduced sample features, which eliminates the process of re-extracting features of newly generated virtual samples and save time. It can clearly increase the magnitude of otherwise small eigenvalues, helps one perform the accurate estimation of the inverse of various covariance matrices and finally alleviates the S 3 problem. Experimental results based on a commonly-used database confirm that the proposed method can significantly improve the matching rate of pedestrian Re-ID, which fully shows that virtual samples are indeed effective for alleviating the S 3 problem in pedestrian Re-ID.},

  abstract     = {Hazardous situations may easily be caused by limited visibility at urban traffic intersections due to buildings, fences, flora, and other obstacles. Thus, drivers approaching an intersection have limited reaction time when other obscured road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists, appear unexpectedly. Previous research has been conducted on applications warning drivers of approaching out-of-sight vehicles. However, less focus has been on the detection and awareness applications revealing the presence of pedestrians. We propose a novel system that displays the driver real-time locations and types of hidden road users at traffic intersections. A roadside unit is installed in the infrastructure which sends safety-critical object data to the vehicle, supporting the real-time decision-making of the driver. The roadside unit consists of a monovision camera streaming video to a computing unit which performs object detection and distance measurements on the detected objects. This paper validates the capability of the proposed system of localizing a pedestrian, and also examines its sensitivity to installation and detection errors. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed system is suitable for the intended application. However, an error in the vertical angle of the roadside unit camera caused an exponential error in the distance approximation in respect to the measured distance. The detection accuracy was noticed to decrease at long distances and in dark surroundings. Moreover, in order to reduce the effect of the presented errors, the camera should be installed as high as possible without hindering its detection capabilities.},

In the STD Modeling phase, we propose an STD modeling method to model both the different regional disturbances caused by various region functions and the spatio-temporal propagating effects. In the Prediction phase, we eliminate the STD from the historical traffic flow to enhance the leaning of inherent traffic patterns and combine the STD at the prediction time interval to consider the future disturbances.

As it is not necessary to monitor the traffic in each link, the proposed estimator can be readily implemented in real life. The technical contributions of this paper are as follows: First, we employ the kernel density estimator (KDE) to model link travel times instead of parametric models, e.g., Gaussian distribution. It is able to capture the dynamic of link travel times that vary with the change of road conditions. The model parameters are estimated with the proposed C-shortest path algorithm, K-means-based algorithm, as well as expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Second, to reduce the complexity of parameter estimation, we further propose a Q-opt and an X-means -based algorithm. Finally, we validate our proposed method using a dataset consisting of 3.0e +07 GPS trajectories collected by the taxicabs in Xi&#39;an, China. With the metrics of Kullback Leibler and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the experimental results show that the link TTDs obtained from our proposed model are in excellent agreement with the empirical distributions, provided that ~70% of the intersections are equipped with traffic detectors.},

  abstract     = {Real-time traffic speed prediction is an essential component of intelligent transportation systems applications on large-scale urban networks, e.g., proactive traffic management, advanced information provision, and prompt incident response. The family of traffic prediction models (e.g., convolutional neural networks) based on multi-detector speed diagrams in the time-space plane has been one of the most frequently used approaches for individual roads and the entire network. However, the predefined stacking sequence of traffic detectors along the spatial dimension of the speed diagram has a significant influence on the prediction performance, which makes network-wide speed prediction more challenging. To tackle the above challenge and better capture complicated traffic dynamics, we propose a novel speed prediction approach, named spatial-temporal deep tensor neural networks (ST-DTNN), for a large-scale urban network with mixed road types. Spatial and temporal dependencies of different road segments are simultaneously taken into account to improve the network-wide prediction accuracy. A scalable deep tensor is constructed for the ST-DTNN to eliminate the potentially negative impact caused by the manually stacking sequence of speed time series collected at different locations. Multi-step ahead traffic speeds can be simultaneously predicted based on probe data for a real-world large-scale urban network with hundreds of detectors installed on freeways, highways, and major/minor arterials. The results demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed ST-DTNN approach. Compared with the benchmark models, the ST-DTNN performs higher prediction accuracy during either peak or off-peak periods within an acceptable training time and has more stable prediction performance on the spatial scale. The proposed approach can be extended to develop network-wide traffic state monitoring, optimize routing in navigation services, and support congestion mitigation.},

In the PVS system, a command center receives requests sent by passengers, periodically assigns them to public vehicles and schedules vehicle routes to serve the requests. However, in the PVS system, the passengers&#39; waiting time is not well utilized. Moreover, it is observed that the driving distance on low-speed roads accounts for a rather high percentage. These two factors impact on system efficiency. In order to utilize the waiting time, we propose to let passengers walk a short distance instead of standing at their origins. At the same time, the driving distance on low-speed roads will be reduced. In this paper, the closest meeting point algorithm is proposed to address the challenge of determining the best pick-up and drop-off locations.

This paper analyses the similarities and differences of drivers&#39; car-following behavior, in terms of time gap, gap distance, and time to collision (TTC), using both China and Sweden datasets from real road driving studies, in a bid to identify how these indicators affect drivers&#39; speed control in car-following situations. The results indicate that the highest frequency of gap distance is observed in the same value range in both datasets, while the highest frequency of time gap in the Sweden dataset is found at a lower value range than the corresponding value range in the China dataset. For both datasets, time gap is observed to be a more reliable indicator for car-following analysis than gap distance since it is less sensitive to speed variations. Furthermore, TTC in the low travel speed ranges (v &lt;; 50 km/h) tends to be steady in comparison with the TTC at other speed ranges, so the time gap in the high-speed ranges is (v &gt; 90 km/h). Therefore, time gap is recommended as the safety indicator for car-following analysis in high-speed conditions, while a combination of time gap and TTC is recommended for low-speed conditions, especially on urban roads.},

Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based detectors achieve the state-of-the-art performance. However, it is difficult to efficiently detect the vehicle and license plate simultaneously in most cases. With a single network, the vehicle can affect the detection of the license plate due to the inclusion relation. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network for detecting the vehicle and the license plate simultaneously in a given image, where two separate branches with different convolutional layers are designed for vehicle detection and license plate detection, respectively. In consideration of the license plate&#39;s small size and fairly obvious features as well as the vehicle&#39;s various size and rather complex features, the license plates are detected with low-level features and the vehicles are localized with multi-level features in corresponding convolutional layers. Moreover, a task-specific anchor design strategy is employed to obtain better predictions. Besides, the attention mechanisms and feature-fusion strategies are utilized to improve the detection performance of small-scale objects. A variety of experiments on real datasets and public datasets verify that our proposed method has fairly high accuracy and efficiency.},

This paper proposes a Conv-LSTM model to predict the positions of turning vehicles at each moment during the turning process in these complicated environments. The model uses convolution, which is an essential part of a convolutional neural network (CNN), to extract higher-level features across different time segments. Afterward, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is employed to obtain the feature sequence with long-term dependence on the features of historical periods. Finally, the initial prediction of the Conv-LSTM is modified by the non-holonomic constraints of vehicles. Left-turning trajectories extracted from a simulation environment are used for model training and testing. As a result, the Conv-LSTM model performs better compared with the CNN and LSTM models. The average offset of every point on the trajectories is reduced by 50.4% and 37.1%, respectively, relative to the CNN and LSTM, and the interactive behaviors during the left-turn process are well reproduced by the proposed model. Another round of testing shows that the generalization ability of proposed model to real environments was initially proved to be feasible with the extracted ground-truth trajectories in the field environment.},

  abstract     = {Traffic signs are critical for maintaining the safety and efficiency of our roads. Therefore, we need to carefully assess the capabilities and limitations of automated traffic sign detection systems. Existing traffic sign datasets are limited in terms of type and severity of challenging conditions. Metadata corresponding to these conditions are unavailable and it is not possible to investigate the effect of a single factor because of the simultaneous changes in numerous conditions. To overcome the shortcomings in existing datasets, we introduced the CURE-TSD-Real dataset, which is based on simulated challenging conditions that correspond to adversaries that can occur in real-world environments and systems. We test the performance of two benchmark algorithms and show that severe conditions can result in an average performance degradation of 29% in precision and 68% in recall. We investigate the effect of challenging conditions through spectral analysis and show that the challenging conditions can lead to distinct magnitude spectrum characteristics. Moreover, we show that mean magnitude spectrum of changes in video sequences under challenging conditions can be an indicator of detection performance. The CURE-TSD-Real dataset is available online at https://github.com/olivesgatech/CURE-TSD.},

The regenerative energy is a kind of energy generated by a braking train, which can be used by other trains nearby. Due to the application of regenerative braking and automatic train operation function, more and more studies focus on using regenerative energy by optimal train control. To maximize the utilization of regenerative energy for a couple of trains, we formulate a model and design an algorithm for maximizing the utilization of regenerative energy (MURE) by using the proposed approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach to adjust the speed curve of the accelerating train. Then, we discuss three approximation methods for the proposed ADP-based approach such as rollout method, interpolation method, and neural network. The rollout algorithm could improve the basic policy for train control with carefully designing. The function approximation method using interpolation could further decrease the energy consumption with assuring punctuality. The neural network approximation usually cannot realize the effect superior to the interpolation strategy due to its complex structure, and it needs more computation time. Finally, the analysis of regenerative energy utilization is given by implementing the numerical experiments with field data from the Yizhuang line, Beijing subway. The numerical results show its effectiveness and stability.},

  abstract     = {Accurately tracking and predicting behaviors of surrounding objects are key prerequisites for intelligent systems such as autonomous vehicles to achieve safe and high-quality decision making and motion planning. However, there still remain challenges for multi-target tracking due to object number fluctuation and occlusion. To overcome these challenges, we propose a constrained mixture sequential Monte Carlo (CMSMC) method in which a mixture representation is incorporated in the estimated posterior distribution to maintain multi-modality. Multiple targets can be tracked simultaneously within a unified framework without explicit data association between observations and tracking targets. The framework can incorporate an arbitrary prediction model as the implicit proposal distribution of the CMSMC method. An example in this paper is a learning-based model for hierarchical time-series prediction, which consists of a behavior recognition module and a state evolution module. Both modules in the proposed model are generic and flexible so as to be applied to a class of time-series prediction problems where behaviors can be separated into different levels. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to a numerical case study as well as a task of on-road vehicle tracking, behavior recognition, and prediction in highway scenarios. Instead of only focusing on forecasting trajectory of a single entity, we jointly predict continuous motions for interactive entities simultaneously. The proposed approaches are evaluated from multiple aspects, which demonstrate great potential for intelligent vehicular systems and traffic surveillance systems.},

In particular, our model rigorously considers the train turn-around constraints, train circulation constraints, and dynamic passenger demands to tackle the train loading capacity constraints. To eliminate the effect of non-linear constraints, we reformulate the original model into its equivalent linear model that can be efficiently solved by linear programming solvers.

In view of this limitation, we provide a novel method for urban rail station characteristics analysis in intelligent transportation considering city land usages. Initially, point of interest (POIs) are divided by the proposed RC-tree (Colored R-tree)-based algorithm into the bounded areas for each station. Second, the Diversity and Proportion approaches are proposed to extract the top-k POIs from bounded areas based on their semantic and spatial characteristics. Then, classify the stations based on the similarity of the extracted top-k POIs. Moreover, we made a case study on real dataset, including a large volume of Automatic Fare Collection system (AFC) records for the experimental evaluations, and the results show that the proposed method can verify the rationality of land use and provide support for the application of transportation model technology.},

In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm to adaptively eliminate linear seams in tunnel lining crack images. By analyzing characteristics of linear seams and cracks, the idea of binning is used to classify those detected line edges with disordered directions into multiple angle subintervals. Then, by calculating the ratio of statistical specific pixels (SSP ratio) on the expanded line edge, the length and binning information are used to select linear seam edges with the use of adaptive expansion algorithm. Finally, the fragmented segmentations of linear seams are adopted so that cracks and linear seams can be clearly separated, and linear seams can be removed.

Understanding and predicting human driving behavior play an important role in the development of assistance systems. In this contribution, the development of a driver assistance system is based on the prediction of driving behaviors. The driving patterns of three different behaviors are modeled including left/right lane change and lane keeping. A driving simulator is used to simulate a highway scene. The implementation of a prediction system based on different machine learning approaches such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Random Forest (RF) is accomplished. In addition, eye-tracking information is integrated. The task is to predict behaviors based on the measurement. As test, a 10-fold cross-validation is used based on data sets from driving simulator and applied to compare the performance of different algorithms. In combination with related results in terms of accuracy (ACC), detection rate (DR), and false alarm rate (FAR), the performance and effectiveness of the developed prediction systems are evaluated. The results show that the performance of RF algorithm is the best of all four algorithms compared. Combining environmental and eye-tracking data the RF algorithm achieved the best results. All ACC values are larger than 99 %. Afterwards, two RF-based prediction models with and without eye-tracking data are developed for online test. Finally, some application samples are suggested for driver assistance. The results calculated by the proposed model are shown on a user interface to help the drivers to see when it is suitable to turn left, to turn right, or to keep the direction.},

  abstract     = {Numerous car-following models have been developed since the 1950s. However, there still exist many traffic phenomena that cannot be demonstrated using the existing models. Therefore, this research proposed a new car-following model, the Asymmetric car-following (ACF) model based on the understanding of driver’s asymmetric behavior, which can explain complex traffic phenomena. We established the asymmetric car-following (ACF) rule under the vehicle’s safety constraints using eight parameters that indicate the driver’s characteristics and vehicle’s performances. To evaluate the ACF model, we performed the simulation for car-following pairs and conducted a comparison analysis with the existing models: Newell, Gipps, GM, and IDM. As a result, the proposed ACF model showed good fitness with the empirical trajectory and the apparent asymmetric behavior compared to others. For further investigation in the congested traffic stream, we simulated a group of vehicles by adding an error term to represent the driver’s unexpected behavior. The simulation showed growth, propagation, and dissipation of the stop-and-go traffic. These results proved that the ACF model has the strength to elaborate on various traffic phenomena, such as traffic hysteresis and stop-and-go traffic.},

However, the massive increases in Machine-type Communication (MTC) highly stress the capacities of the network infrastructure. With the system-immanent limitation of resources in cellular networks and the resource competition between human cell users and MTC, more resource-efficient channel access methods are required in order to improve the coexistence of the different communicating entities. In this paper, we present a machine learning-enabled transmission scheme for client-side opportunistic data transmission. By considering the measured channel state as well as the predicted future channel behavior, delay-tolerant MTC is performed with respect to the anticipated resource-efficiency. The proposed mechanism is evaluated in comprehensive field evaluations in public Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, where it is able to increase the mean data rate by 194% while simultaneously reducing the average power consumption by up to 54%.},

  abstract     = {Driving is a combination of continuous mental risk assessment, sensory awareness, and judgment, all adapting to extremely variable surrounding conditions. Several research projects are working on autonomous vehicle to robotize this complex task. The work presented in this paper focuses on reactive local trajectory planning in uncertain environment. The environment uncertainty is one of the challenges that we face in trajectory planning. For autonomous vehicle, to be efficient, they need to be able to deal with this kind of uncertainty. In this paper, we show that the theory of belief functions with its ability to distinguish between different types of uncertainty is able to provide significant advantages in the context of trajectory planning. Using the belief functions, we build evidential grid that represents the surrounding environment. To plan a local trajectory, we generate a set of clothoid tentacles in the egocentred reference frame related to the ego-vehicle. Those tentacles represent possible trajectories that consider the current dynamical state of the vehicle and make a smooth variation in the vehicle dynamic variables. Once the representation of the environment and the possible trajectories are generated, an evaluation of each trajectory is carried out according to several criteria and the choice of the trajectory is made using the decision formalism of Markov decision process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our evidential approach, we apply it to scenarios where ego-vehicle has to make decision in uncertain dynamical environments, using a driving simulator (SCANeR™ Studio).},

Both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications will be needed to reliably disseminate information in a vehicular network. In this regard, a roadside unit (RSU) equipped with multiple antennas can improve the network capacity. While the traditional approaches assume antennas to experience independent fading, we consider a more practical uplink scenario where antennas at the RSU experience correlated fading. In particular, we evaluate the packet error probability for two renowned antenna correlation models, i.e., constant correlation (CC) and exponential correlation (EC). We also consider intermediate cooperative vehicles for reliable communication between the source vehicle and the RSU. Here, we derive closed-form expressions for packet error probability, which help to quantify the performance variations due to fading parameter, correlation coefficients, and the number of intermediate helper vehicles. To evaluate the optimal transmit power in this network scenario, we formulate a Stackelberg game, wherein, the source vehicle is treated as a buyer and the helper vehicles are the sellers. The optimal solutions for the asking price and the transmit power are devised which maximize the utility functions of helper vehicles and the source vehicle, respectively. We verify our mathematical derivations by extensive simulations in MATLAB.},

  abstract     = {Extreme events can extensively damage power systems, causing customers to experience long-lasting outages. During such events, an electric vehicle (EV) can be used to directly power a house, i.e., vehicle-to-home (V2H). Specifically, the EV serves as a mobile energy storage system-running errands to “transport” energy from other places. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) further allows cooperation among houses. It enables EV fleets to take turns running the errands so that sustained power supply is possible. Moreover, autonomous driving technology can also benefit system adequacy because the charging errands of EVs can be scheduled flexibly without being bonded to human activities. An emergency power supply strategy featuring scheduled EV charging errands as introduced above is proposed. It answers the questions whether and to what extent a system can survive an extended period of outage with the use of EVs only. An optimization problem is formulated with the purpose of maximizing the supply adequacy of the isolated system during the outage period. Both V2H and V2G scenarios are considered in the problem formulation, as well as self-driving capability. The complex optimization problems are solved with genetic algorithm. It is significant to find from the case study that the proposed strategy is able to fully restoring an islanded system when V2G and self-driving EVs are implemented.},

  abstract     = {Synopsis of a long-duration video has many applications in intelligent transportation systems. It can help to monitor traffic with lesser manpower. However, generating meaningful synopsis of a long-duration video recording can be challenging. Often summarized outputs include redundant contents or activities that may not be helpful to the observer. Moving object trajectories are possible sources of information that can be used to generate the synopsis of long-duration videos. The synopsis generation faces challenges due to object tracking, grouping of the trajectories with respect to activity type, object category, and contextual information, and generating smooth synopsis according to a query. In this paper, we propose a method to generate meaningful and smooth synopsis of long-duration videos according to the users’ query. We have tracked moving objects and adopted deep learning to classify the objects into known categories (e.g., car, bike, and pedestrians). We then identify regions in the surveillance scene with the help of unsupervised clustering. Each tube (spatiotemporal object trajectory) is represented by the source and the destination. In the final stage, we take a query from the user and generate the synopsis video by smoothly blending the appropriate tubes over the background frame through energy minimization. The proposed method has been evaluated on two publicly available datasets and our own surveillance datasets. We have compared the method with popular state-of-the-art techniques. The experiments reveal that the proposed method is superior to the existing techniques and it produces visually seamless video synopsis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a method to generate the downward image of current vehicle location using a commercial around view monitor (AVM) is proposed. The proposed system consists of three stages, namely feature tracking, obstacle filtering, and downward view generation. In the feature tracking stage, the Shi-Tomasi corner detection is used and feature tracking is performed with a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) tracker to determine the transformation between AVM images. In the obstacle filtering stage, features on obstacles are filtered by using the difference in a tracking distance between features detected on the ground and features detected on the obstacle. This is performed by using a histogram based on the tracking distance of features. Finally, in the downward view generation stage, transformation between the current AVM image and the previous AVM image is obtained by using the tracked feature pair refined via the aforementioned steps. Specifically, the random sample consensus (RANSAC) method is used to obtain transformations from which the influence of outliers is removed. The downward image of the current vehicle is generated by the obtained transformation and is synthesized to the existing AVM image. The results indicate that the proposed system synthesizes the existing AVM image and the generated downward image of a vehicle in a seamless way by determining the exact pair of matching points between current and the previous AVM images. We believe the proposed system can be utilized in efficient wireless charging system and safe driving system.},

  abstract     = {Visual object tracking has achieved remarkable progress in recent years and has been broadly applied in intelligent transportation systems such as autonomous vehicles and drones to monitor and analyze the behavior of specific targets. One typical tracking approach is the discriminative tracker, which branches into two main categories: the correlation filter (CF) and the convolutional neural network (CNN). However, most of the current researches consider both categories as two separate techniques and only rely on one of them. Thus, a dense cooperation between the CF and the CNN still remains less discovered and the question of how to effectively join both techniques to further boost the tracking performance is still open. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a collaborative architecture which incorporates models constructed with both techniques and dynamically aggregates their response maps for target inference. By an alternating optimization, both models are learned on each other&#39;s errors to persistently improve the classification power of the whole tracker. For further efficiency, we present a faster solver for our utilized CF and an analytical solution for dynamic model weighting. Through experiments on standard benchmarks, we reveal the influence of key factors on the joint learning architecture and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

In this paper, we are proposing a data-driven framework based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and the bidirectional recurrent neural network architecture (B-LSTM) for long-term prediction of VRUs&#39; intention. We evaluated our framework on real-life datasets for agent behavior modeling in traffic environments, and it has achieved an overall average displacement error of only 2.93 and 4.12 pixels over 2.0 and 3.0 s ahead prediction horizons, respectively. In addition, we compared our framework against other baseline models based on sequence prediction models and planning-based approaches. We have outperformed these approaches with the lowest margin of average displacement error of more than 5 pixels. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed framework was evaluated on an additional vehicle-based video sequence dataset for path prediction of pedestrians and it continued to achieve robust results with higher generalization capabilities.},

Differential global positioning system (GPS) is used to measure vehicle positions in high precision. We study factors that affect the driving trajectory, including vehicle speed, road curvature, and sight distance. We find that the human drivers typically do not follow lane centerline and the human-driven trajectories are very different from planners like rapidly exploring random tree (RRT).

  abstract     = {Aggressive driving behavior is one of the leading causes of road accidents worldwide. One way to ameliorate this situation is to collect and analyze driving patterns with the intention of promoting driving awareness, a task that has been called driving analytics (DA). DA employing the driver&#39;s smartphone has attracted attention from the community given its good capabilities to capture, via its integrated sensors, data that could be exploited to infer driving style. Most works in the related literature have represented this sensor information either as statistical scores or in raw format that are later fed into threshold-based heuristics or machine learning (ML) approaches. Based on the hypothesis that better data representations do exist, in this paper, we propose a second-order representation, based on the bag-of-words&#39; strategy, to model accelerometer timestamps associated with aggressive driving maneuvers. We evaluate this representation in two scenarios and three data sets against the best reported work in each of them. In the first scenario, we classify accelerometer samples as either belonging to aggressive or safe driving style. In the second scenario, we approach a multi-class problem, where we are now interested in identifying the exact aggressive maneuver that the accelerometer sample represents. The results show that this novel representation outperforms both state-of-the-art works with 6% and 15% in F-measure for each scenario, respectively. To further investigate the strength of our representation, we make a comparison against similar second-order strategies that have also proved to be successful. Overall, this analysis suggests that this representation constitutes an attractive method for driving behavior classification, boosting discriminative performance of ML approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an alternative method for bus passenger waiting time estimation using passive Wi-Fi data. With the underlying mechanism for Wi-Fi communication, the presence of Wi-Fi enabled devices in a particular area can be passively discoverable. The mobile devices carried by bus passengers can be exploited to estimate passenger waiting time at a bus stop without the passengers&#39; direct participation. Passenger waiting time estimation using such opportunistic data is challenging due to the particular characteristics of the Wi-Fi data collected from bus stop environments. This paper proposes a methodology to handle massive noise in Wi-Fi data and identify the potential Wi-Fi records which are derived from passengers&#39; devices. The filtered data can then be used to estimate passenger waiting time. The Wi-Fi data collected from a bus stop in Hong Kong are used as a case study for evaluating the proposed system. The practicality is investigated in terms of estimation accuracy and insightful analysis.},

  abstract     = {Optimal velocity (OV)-based car-following model can be easily applied to the transportation system composed of intelligent connected vehicle (ICV) via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, since this model only requires space headway and velocity differences of preceding vehicles. However, the sudden velocity changes of the leading vehicle will decrease the control performance of following vehicles. Particularly, the farther the distance between the following vehicle and the leading vehicle is, the worse the control performance of the following vehicle is. Besides this problem, the nonlinear information of OV-based car-following models is often not fully utilized due to the linearization for the convenience of stability analysis and controller design. To address these problems, the factors related to velocity sudden changes are taken into account for each ICV simultaneously and compensated by the proposed feedforward compensator. Based on the compensator, a finite-time traffic flow controller is designed for each ICV to smooth the space headway in traffic flow subject to sudden velocity changes and make full use of the nonlinear information of OV-based model. Finally, the theoretical analysis via Lyapunov approach and the numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The generalized lock scheduling problem (GLSP) is a mixed integer optimization problem which consists of a ship placement (SP) and a lockage operation scheduling (LOS) sub-problem. In previous research, the GLSP is solved by different exact and heuristic methods, which are confirmed inferior with respect to computation time and solution quality. Consequently, none of those methods is efficient for handling practical large-scale GLSP. For the first time, we show that high-quality solutions of GLSP can be efficiently obtained by using an innovative approach proposed in this paper. Specifically, an ingenious solution structure of GLSP is designed, by which the GLSP is converted to a combinatorial optimization problem. Furthermore, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) heuristic based on the principle of destruction and reconstruction of solutions is proposed for solving the GLSP. Test results using a large number of instances reported in the literature are compared with those obtained by two exact methods, the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and combinatorial Benders&#39; decomposition (CBD) method. The results show that our ALNS achieves optimal solutions within less time in terms of most of the small-scale instances. Much better solutions are obtained by the ALNS within a few minutes for those large-scale instances that cannot be solved to optimality by exact methods within 2 h. Especially, the advantage of the proposed method is more remarkable when there is no specific chronological rules forced, which indicates that the proposed method is capable of handling the GLSP in a broader scope of situations.},

The goal is to compute optimal charging schedules that maximize the social welfare of all users given their time preferences and the state of charge of their vehicles. Assuming that users are self-interested agents who may behave strategically to advance their own benefits rather than the social welfare of all agents, we propose an iterative auction, which computes high-quality schedules and, at the same time, preserves users&#39; privacy by progressively eliciting their preferences as necessary. We conduct a game theoretical analysis on the proposed iterative auction to prove its individual rationality and the best response for agents. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the iterative auction can achieve high-efficiency solutions with a partial value information.

  abstract     = {Microscopic traffic models describe how cars interact with their neighbors in an uninterrupted traffic flow and are frequently used for reference in advanced vehicle control design. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanical system-inspired microscopic traffic model using a mass-spring-damper-clutch system. This model naturally captures the ego vehicle&#39;s resistance to large relative speed and deviation from a (driver- and speed-dependent) desired relative distance when following the lead vehicle. Compared with the existing car-following (CF) models, this model offers physically interpretable insights into the underlying CF dynamics and is able to characterize the impact of the ego vehicle on the lead vehicle, which is neglected in the existing CF models. Thanks to the nonlinear wave propagation analysis techniques for mechanical systems, the proposed model, therefore, has great scalability so that multiple mass-spring-damper-clutch systems can be chained to study the macroscopic traffic flow. We investigate the stability of the proposed model on the system parameters and the time delay using the spectral element method. We also develop a parallel recursive least square with inverse QR decomposition (PRLS-IQR) algorithm to identify the model parameters online. These real-time estimated parameters can be used to predict the driving trajectory that can be incorporated into advanced vehicle longitudinal control systems for improved safety and fuel efficiency. The PRLS-IQR is computationally efficient and numerically stable, and therefore, it is suitable for online implementation. The traffic model and the parameter identification algorithm are validated on both the simulations and naturalistic driving data from multiple drivers. Promising performance is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {The first-mile transportation provides a transit service using ridesharing-based vehicles, e.g., feeder buses, for passengers to travel from their homes, workplaces, or public institutions to the nearest public transportation depots (rapid-transit metro or appropriated bus stations) which are located beyond comfortable walking distance. This paper studies the vehicle routing problem (VRP) for the first-mile transportation, which aims at finding the optimal travel routes for a vehicle fleet to deliver passengers from their doorstep to the depots, where the passengers can continue their journeys using fixed-route buses or trains. We focus on the Peak-Hour VRP (PHVRP) for a limited vehicle fleet capacity to serve a large volume of travel requests, with the aim of maximizing the number of served passengers. The PHVRP generalizes the VRP with time window by considering multiple alternative depots for each travel request, such that a request is satisfied if the passenger is taken to one of his/her nearest depots. We formally formulate the PHVRP with constraints on vehicle capacity, pickup time windows, and quality of service regarding riding time, where a novel trip-based constraint model is used. We proposed an ant-colony optimization algorithm for the PHVRP, which is initialized with pheromone information that jointly considers the temporal-spatial distance as well as depot similarity among different travel requests. We introduced a novel scheme (called trip-by-trip scheme) to construct the travel routes by repeatedly forming a single trip for the vehicle with earliest end time until no vehicle can accept any more trips. In constructing a single trip, the algorithm intelligently decides whether or not to end the trip instead of taking more passengers. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated by comparing with optimal solutions on small size instances and with heuristic solutions on large-size instances, using road network in Singapore and synthetic travel requests that are generated based on real bus travel demands.},

  abstract     = {Urban waterways have great potential in cargo transport to relieve the congestion in the overloaded road networks. This paper explores the potential of applying cooperative multi-vessel systems (CMVSs) to improve the safety and efficiency of transport in urban waterway networks. A framework consisting of vessel train formation (VTF) and cooperative waterway intersection scheduling (CWIS) is proposed. Two types of controllers are introduced. Intersection controllers solve the CWIS problems and assign each vessel a desired time of arrival and vessel controllers are responsible for the VTF in waterway segments and the timely arrival at the intersections. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based negotiation framework is proposed for the cooperation among the controllers. The simulation experiments involving the scenarios in which up to 50 vessels sailing in the canal network in Amsterdam are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the simulation of an isolated intersection, rescheduling is triggered when some vessels cannot arrive on time. Although some ASVs arrive later, the time that is needed for all the ASVs to pass through is the same after rescheduling. Moreover, we compare the cooperative situation with the proposed CMVSs with a baseline situation. In the baseline situation, vessels avoid collisions using the generalized velocity obstacle (GVO) method and cross the intersection with a first in, first out rule. The CMVSs show better path following performance, while the GVO method needs fewer velocity changes. From the perspective of efficiency, the CMVSs help to reduce the total time to pass through the intersection.},

  abstract     = {Driver model adaptation (DMA) provides a way to model the target driver when sufficient data are not available. Traditional DMA methods running at the model level are restricted by the specific model structures and cannot make full use of the historical data. In this paper, a novel DMA framework based on transfer learning (TL) is proposed to deal with the adaptation of driver models in lane-changing scenarios at the data level. Under the proposed DMA framework, a new TL approach named DTW-LPA that combines dynamic time warping (DTW) and local Procrustes analysis (LPA) is developed. Using the DTW, the relationship between the datasets for different drivers can be found automatically. Based on this relationship, the LPA can transfer the data in the historical dataset to the dataset of a newly-involved driver (target driver). In this way, sufficient data can be obtained for the target driver. After the data transferring process, a proper modeling method, such as the Gaussian mixture regression (GMR), can be applied to train the model for the target driver. Data collected from a driving simulator and realistic driving scenes are used to validate the proposed method in various experiments. Compared with the GMR-only and GMR-MAP methods, the DTW-LPA shows better performance on the model accuracy with much lower predicting errors in most cases.},

  abstract     = {Pulse and glide (PnG) is a longitudinal control strategy that operates vehicles in a more fuel-efficient way than driving at a constant speed. The pulse phase is an acceleration phase, followed by a deceleration, or glide, phase. Former research on PnG had in common that the acceleration profile during the pulse phase is chosen to operate the engine along the course of optimal engine efficiency. However, this optimal strategy will not be accepted by human drivers due to high acceleration values and sudden changes in acceleration. The purpose of this paper is to assess the driveability of the PnG based on the subjective evaluations from test drives and, as a result, to define a PnG operation that is noticeable only to the skeptical customers. The fuel savings of this PnG operation are simulated afterward. The results of this paper reveal that a PnG operation that is noticeable only to skeptical customers is reached if the acceleration value and the absolute values of the jerk are kept below the specific thresholds. Also, the duration of deceleration needs to be limited. Furthermore, the selection of the target gear after exiting sailing needs to be calibrated specifically for PnG to cope with the engine vibrations. Within the identified thresholds, the fuel savings of PnG are larger than 18% below 48 km/h and decrease gradually with increasing speed. Consequently, PnG can be implemented to the drivers&#39; satisfaction, leading to significant fuel savings. Moreover, as we provide a general link between the acceleration and jerk levels and the corresponding ride comfort, the results can directly be implemented in the trajectory planning of further automated longitudinal vehicle control schemes to attain the desired ride comfort.},

  abstract     = {Queue length is a crucial measure of intersection performance. Probe vehicles (PVs) with advanced sensors are capable of recording vehicle trajectories that can be used to estimate queue length, a technique of which has received considerable attention in the past decade. Noticeably, this technique usually requires high PV penetration rates (e.g., above 25%) in order to ensure estimation accuracy. Though the PVs are expected to increase, their penetration rate will still remain relatively low in the near future. Meanwhile, the initial queue length is another important factor that directly relates to queue dynamics at each cycle. However, most of the studies failed to adequately account for the effect of the initial queue on cyclic queue length estimation. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a cycle-based end of queue estimation method using sampled vehicle trajectory data under relatively low penetration rates. Two major steps are involved: first, vehicle arrival process is modeled as a certain distribution in line with traffic conditions and an expectation maximum (EM) procedure is employed to estimate the arrival rate of each cycle; then, both ends of the queue and initial queue are estimated at each cycle based on shockwave theory. Microscopic traffic simulator VISSIM is utilized to examine the performance of the method. The experimental results reveal that the cycle-based end of the queue can be estimated with desirable accuracy in different scenarios, e.g., undersaturated, oversaturated, and queue spillback conditions. The comparison with the state-of-the-art methods further helps to verify the advantage of the method, especially under low-penetration-rate conditions.},

However, less of them take the variable vehicle velocities into account. In fact, the velocity is an important factor affecting the tracking accuracy. Especially, when an AV is in high velocity, it is not easy to achieve path following with high accuracy. To improve the adaptivity of path following in different velocities, an improved adaptive path following control system (PFCS) constructed by a course angle optimal referential model (CAORM) and a model predictive controller (MPC) is developed in this paper. The CAORM can provide the referential course angle, according to the vehicle longitudinal and lateral velocities, which significantly improves the adaptivity of the proposed PFCS in different velocities. And the CAORM is mainly implemented by a fuzzy inference system and a novel preview model, using human driving experience. The MPC is applied to realize the course control with high accuracy via manipulating the steering angle. Finally, the tracking performance of the PFCS is verified via simulation experiments on the Simulink-CarSim platform.},

  abstract     = {Airport capacity has become a constraint in the air transportation networks due to the growth of air traffic demand and the lack of resources able to accommodate this demand. This paper presents the algorithmic implementations of a decision support system for making a more efficient use of the airspace and ground capacity. The system would be able to provide support for air traffic controllers in handling large amount of flights while reducing to a minimum potential conflicts. In this framework, airspace together with ground airport operations is considered. The conflicts are defined as separation minima violation between aircraft for what concerns airspace and runways and as capacity overloads for taxiway network and terminals. The methodology proposed in this paper consists of an iterative approach that couples optimization and simulation to find solutions that are resilient to perturbations due to the uncertainty present in different phases of the arrival and departure process. An optimization model was employed to find a (sub)optimal solution, while a discrete event-based simulation model evaluated the objective function. By coupling simulation with optimization, we generate more robust solutions resilient to variability in the operations, and this is supported by a case study of Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in sensing and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies generate a huge amount of data. Mobility on demand (MoD) service benefits from the availability of big data in the intelligent transportation system. Given the future travel demand or origin-destination (OD) flows prediction, service providers can pre-allocate unoccupied vehicles to the customers&#39; origins of service to reduce waiting time. Traditional approaches on future travel demand and the OD flows predictions rely on statistical or machine learning methods. Inspired by deep learning techniques for image and video processing, through regarding localized travel demands as image pixels, a novel deep learning model called multi-scale convolutional long short-term memory network (MultiConvLSTM) is developed in this paper. Rather than using the traditional OD matrix which may lead to loss of geographical information, we propose a new data structure, called OD tensor to represent OD flows, and a manipulation method, called OD tensor permutation and matricization, is introduced to handle the high dimensionality features of OD tensor. MultiConvLSTM considers both temporal and spatial correlations to predict the future travel demand and OD flows. Experiments on real-world New York taxi data of around 400 million records are performed. Our results show that the MultiConvLSTM achieves the highest accuracy in both one-step and multiple-step predictions and it outperforms the existing methods for travel demand and OD flow predictions.},

  abstract     = {Protecting the location privacy is one of the main challenges in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Although, standardization bodies, such as IEEE and ETSI, have adopted a pseudonym-based scheme as a solution for this problem, an efficient pseudonym changing and management is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose PRIVANET, a complete and efficient pseudonym changing and management framework. The PRIVANET has a hierarchical structure and considers the vehicular geographic area as a grid. Each cell of this grid contains one or many logical zones, called vehicular location privacy zones (VLPZs). These zones can easily be deployed over the widespread roadside infrastructures (RIs), such as gas stations, to provide a secure changing and management of pseudonyms. The proposed framework consists of different building blocks: 1) an effective VLPZ-based pseudonym changing strategy; 2) a reputation-based mechanism to motivate selfish vehicles to enter VLPZs; 3) an adapted user-centric privacy model; 4) a secure hybrid mechanism for the distribution of pseudonyms sets and CRLs; 5) a method to generate the IP and MAC addresses from the pseudonym; 6) a stochastic model to estimate the number of VLPZs required at a given cell; and 7) a mathematical model for an optimal placement of the VLPZs over RIs to reduce the transportation cost of vehicles in terms of time. An extensive simulation study using a realistic map and with real traffic mobility measurements is carried out to evaluate and validate the performance of the PRIVANET. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Precise destination prediction from partial trajectories have a huge potential impact on intelligent location-based approaches. Traditional prediction approaches, which treat trajectories as one-dimensional sequences and process them in a single scale, fail to capture diverse and rich two-dimensional patterns of trajectories in different spatial scales. Meanwhile, most models treat each portion of a trajectory equally in terms of contributing to final destination prediction. This is in conflict with our observation that there exists some albeit small local areas playing much more important roles for destination prediction than the others. To address these problems, we propose a novel prediction algorithm T-CONV , which models trajectories as two-dimensional images, and then feed them into a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract multi-scale patterns for precise destination prediction. Furthermore, we propose a method to extract regions with different relevance for final output of T-CONV , and further explore the local patterns of important regions by integrating multi-scope local-enhancement areas based on attention mechanism. The comprehensive experiments based on two large-scale real taxi trajectory datasets show that T-CONV can achieve higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the strength of the multi-scale and multi-scope feature extraction mechanisms in trajectory mining.},

A computationally efficient modeling approach is introduced, in which the overtaking problem is formulated by sampling in relative distance to the leading vehicle, replacing velocity state with its inverse and utilizing a nonlinear change of control variables. These three steps achieve a computationally efficient nonlinear control problem that can be solved using the sequential quadratic programming. Measures have been taken to ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear problem, even when the sequential quadratic programming iterates are stopped prematurely. A case study is presented, where this new formulation is compared with the previously published formulations in terms of solution quality and computation time.},

These situations represent only a fraction of the difficulties faced by modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this paper, we present a survey that highlights the role modeling techniques within the realm of deep learning have played within ITS. We focus on how practitioners have formulated problems to address these various challenges, and outline both architectural and problem-specific considerations used to develop solutions.

  abstract     = {With recent advances in learning algorithms and hardware development, autonomous cars have shown promise when operating in structured environments under good driving conditions. However, for complex, cluttered, and unseen environments with high uncertainty, autonomous driving systems still frequently demonstrate erroneous or unexpected behaviors that could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Autonomous vehicles should ideally adapt to driving conditions; while this can be achieved through multiple routes, it would be beneficial as a first step to be able to characterize driveability in some quantified form. To this end, this paper aims to create a framework for investigating different factors that can impact driveability. Also, one of the main mechanisms to adapt autonomous driving systems to any driving condition is to be able to learn and generalize from representative scenarios. The machine learning algorithms that currently do so learn predominantly in a supervised manner and consequently need sufficient data for robust and efficient learning. Therefore, we also perform a comparative overview of 54 public driving datasets that enable learning and publish this dataset index at https://sites.google.com/view/driveability-survey-datasets. Specifically, we categorize the datasets according to the use cases and highlight the datasets that capture the complicated and hazardous driving conditions, which can be better used for training robust driving models. Furthermore, by discussions of what driving scenarios are not covered by the existing public datasets and what driveability factors need more investigation and data acquisition, this paper aims to encourage both targeted dataset collection and the proposal of novel driveability metrics that enhance the robustness of autonomous cars in adverse environments.},

This paper focuses on using the developed TPNs to model variable traffic light control systems. One advantage of the proposed methods is that the traffic light behavior is clearly represented in terms of conditions and events, which result in changes in the pre-emption phase. Moreover, this paper also proposes a new control strategy to eliminate the traffic jam propagation by preventing the traffic flow heading in the direction of an accident. The analysis is performed to demonstrate how the models enforce the phase of traffic transitions by a reachability graph with time information. The liveness and reversibility of the proposed model are verified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to use TPNs to model a variable phase traffic light control system and identify its accident scenarios for the purpose of their complete avoidance.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes three route control strategies for autonomous vehicles (AVs) exiting to off-ramps. First, two microscopic lane-changing models are developed to simulate the off-ramp behaviors for AVs. A risk factor λ is introduced in the discretionary lane-changing (DLC) model, and a five-step process is developed for the mandatory lane-changing (MLC) model. Second, three route control strategies are presented, i.e., grading strategy (GS), half-overlap strategy (HOS), and full-overlap strategy (FOS). Finally, the extensive numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the characteristics of each strategy based on the MATLAB platform. The results indicate that the studied area displays significant variability in spatiotemporal dynamics of average velocity and road capacity under different strategies. It is found that the GS is the most effective control strategy for traffic congestion dissipation and travel delay reduction, followed by the HOS and, then, the FOS. The road capacity under the GS is increased by 19.1% and 7.8% compared to the FOS and the HOS, respectively. Furthermore, the GS consumes lower costs in terms of safety, travel efficiency, and route and lane switch frequency compared to the HOS and FOS, which is verified as the optimal strategy according to overall running cost. The findings of this paper can provide useful references for the design of AVs as well as the management of the automated highway systems.},

An enhanced state observer-based sliding mode control (SMC) strategy is proposed to achieve the control purpose and maintain the lane keeping errors as well as the roll angle within the prescribed performance boundaries. Three contributions are made in this paper. First, a prescribed performance function (PPF) is proposed in the controller design, aiming to implement the error transformation so as to constrain the controlled variables within the prescribed performance boundaries. Second, a modified sliding surface is developed incorporating two nonlinear functions, whose specialities and benefits are taken advantage of: one is a barrier function to restrict the load transfer ratio (LTR) in a safe boundary to guarantee the roll stability; another is a monotonely decreasing function to adaptively change the damping ratio of the closed-loop system to improve the transient performance, including reducing the transient overshoots and steady-state errors. Third, a modified multivariable adaptive SMC controller is proposed to achieve the integrated lane-keeping and roll control in the presence of the input saturation and bound-unknown disturbances. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proved via the Lyapunov function. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified with a high-fidelity and full-car model via the CarSim platform.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) systems provide a fully automatic framework to recognize and classify different vehicle models. Several approaches have been proposed to address this challenge; however, they can perform in restricted conditions. Here, in this paper, we formulate the VMMR as a fine-grained classification problem and propose a new configurable on-road VMMR framework. We benefit from the unsupervised feature learning methods, and in more details, we employ Locality-constraint Linear Coding (LLC) method as a fast feature encoder for encoding the input SIFT features. The proposed method can perform in real environments of different conditions. This framework can recognize 50 models of vehicles and has the advantage to classify every other vehicle not belonging to one of the specified 50 classes as an unknown vehicle. The proposed VMMR framework can be configured to become faster or more accurate based on the application domain. The proposed approach is examined on two datasets, including Iranian on-road vehicle (IORV) dataset and CompuCar dataset. The IORV dataset contains images of 50 models of vehicles captured in real situations by traffic-cameras in different weather and lighting conditions. The experimental results show the advantage of the real-time configuration of the proposed framework over the state-of-the-art methods on the IORV datatset and comparable results on CompuCar dataset with 97.5% and 98.4% accuracies, respectively and acceptable running time.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides a new solution for path following control of autonomous ground vehicles. H 2 control problem is considered to attenuate the effect of the road curvature disturbance. To this end, we formulate a standard model from the road-vehicle dynamics, the a priori knowledge on the road curvature, and the path following specifications. This standard model is then represented in a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy form to deal with the time-varying nature of the vehicle speed. Based on a static output feedback scheme, the proposed method allows avoiding expensive vehicle sensors while keeping the simplest control structure for real-time implementation. The concept of V-stability is exploited using Lyapunov stability arguments to improve the transient behaviors of the closed-loop vehicle system. In particular, the physical upper and lower bounds of the vehicle acceleration are explicitly considered in the design procedure via a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function to reduce drastically the design conservatism. The proposed H 2 design conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with a single line search parameter. The effectiveness of the new path following control method is clearly demonstrated with both theoretical illustrations and hardware experiments under realworld driving situations.},

In this paper, we address the two challenges to the reduction of EV response time: 1) path-searching for a reliable estimated time of arrival (ETA) in ever-changing traffic conditions and 2) elastic signal preemption to reduce the negative impact on the whole traffic flow introduced by prioritizing the EVs. While traditional path-searching methods aim to minimize only the mean value of ETA, our approach minimizes a combination of its mean and variance, as we found that the variance of speed has a significant impact on path searching. The simulation shows that our approach generates paths with reliable ETA, i.e., lower variance with the same level of accuracy. Furthermore, we formulate the elastic signal preemption (ESP) as a set of quadratic programming (QP) problems to find non-intrusive signal schedules to the fast track EVs through junctions without stopping. When the ESP module was applied in the real world, results showed about 30% reduction of response time with little impact on the overall traffic conditions.},

In this paper, we propose a novel deep small-scale sense network (termed SSN) for small-scale pedestrian detection. The proposed architecture could generate some proposal regions which are more effective to detect small-scale pedestrians. Furthermore, we design a novel loss function based on cross entropy loss to increase the loss contribution from hard-to-detect small-scale pedestrians. In addition, a novel evaluation metric is introduced, which can measure the location precision of the pedestrian detection methods. In addition an Asian pedestrian detection dataset named VIP pedestrian dataset is constructed from various road condition data.

  abstract     = {Avoiding collisions with vulnerable road users (VRUs) using sensor-based early recognition of critical situations is one of the manifold opportunities provided by the current development in the field of intelligent vehicles. As, especially, pedestrians and cyclists are very agile and have a variety of movement options, modeling their behavior in traffic scenes becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we propose movement models based on machine learning methods, in particular, artificial neural networks, in order to classify the current motion state and to predict the future trajectory of the VRUs. Both model types are also combined to enable the application of specifically trained motion predictors based on a continuously updated pseudo probabilistic state classification. Furthermore, the architecture is used to evaluate motion-specific physical models for starting and stopping and video-based pedestrian motion classification. A comprehensive dataset consisting of a total of 1068 pedestrian and 494 cyclist scenes acquired at an urban intersection is used for optimization, training, and evaluation of the different models. The results show substantially higher classification rates and the ability, through the machine learning approaches, to earlier recognize motion state changes than by the way of interacting multiple model (IMM) Kalman filtering. The trajectory prediction quality has also been improved for all kinds of test scenes, especially when starting and stopping motions are included. Here, 37% and 41% fewer position errors were achieved on average, respectively.},

For validation purposes, a microscopic traffic simulator is used to generate the data and compare the estimated energy consumption to the measured one.

Differently from traditional approaches to control traffic signaling, the tractability of our framework allows us to effectively model large-scale interconnections and enables the design of critical parameters while considering network-wide measures of efficiency. Motivated by the increasing availability of real-time high-resolution traffic data, we cast an optimization problem that formalizes the goal of optimizing vehicle evacuation by controlling the durations of green lights at the intersections under the current congestion conditions. Our framework allows us to relate efficiency objectives with the optimization of a metric of controllability of the associated dynamical network. We then provide a technique to efficiently solve the optimization by parallelizing the computation among a group of distributed agents. Last, we assess the benefits of the proposed modeling and optimization framework through macroscopic and microscopic simulations on daily commute scenarios for the urban interconnection of Manhattan, NY, USA.},

To support the increasing communication data traffic and guarantee quality-of-service (QoS), spectrum slicing, spectrum allocating, and transmit power controlling are jointly considered. Accordingly, three non-convex network utility maximization problems are formulated to slice spectrum among base stations (BSs), allocate spectrum among autonomous vehicles (AVs) associated with a BS, and control transmit powers of BSs, respectively. Through linear programming relaxation and first-order Taylor series approximation, these problems are transformed into tractable forms and then are jointly solved through an alternate concave search (ACS) algorithm. As a result, the optimal spectrum slicing ratios among BSs, optimal BS-vehicle association patterns, optimal fractions of spectrum resources allocated to AVs, and optimal transmit powers of BSs are obtained. Based on our simulation, a high aggregate network utility is achieved by the proposed spectrum management scheme compared with two existing schemes.},

In this paper, we put forward a method for single-shot segmentation in a feature residual pyramid network (RPNet), which learns the coarse results and residuals of segmentations by decomposing the label at different levels of residual blocks. Specifically speaking, we use the residual features to learn the edges and details, and we also use the top-level feature to learn the coarse segmentation result. At the testing phase, the predicted residuals are used to enhance the details of the coarse segmentation result. Residual learning blocks split the network into several shallow sub-networks by level-wise training, which facilitates the gradient propagation in the RPNet. We then evaluate the proposed method and compare it with the recent state-of-the-art methods on CamVid and Cityscapes datasets. The proposed single-shot segmentation based on the RPNet achieves impressive results with high efficiency on the pixel-level segmentation task.},

This task is normally modeled as a multiclass classification problem, where the goal is to select, among a set of already known locations, the next taxi destination. We present a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approach that models the taxi drivers&#39; behavior and encodes the semantics of visited locations by using geographical information from Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs). In particular, the RNNs are trained to predict the exact coordinates of the next destination, overcoming the problem of producing, in output, a limited set of locations, seen during the training phase. The proposed approach was tested on the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge 2015 dataset-based on the city of Porto-, obtaining better results with respect to the competition winner, whilst using less information, and on Manhattan and San Francisco datasets.},

The proposed method, nonlinear hybrid impedance controller, consists of desired impedance pinion angle generator and a super-twisting sliding mode controller for pinion angle tracking. The desired impedance transfer function of the driver&#39;s torque to the steering wheel angle reflects the driver&#39;s torque to the steering control. The desired impedance pinion angle is generated using the desired impedance transfer function and the desired pinion angle derived by the lateral controller.

Unlike existing methods, this framework does not rely on sophisticated dynamic models or high-fidelity simulations; it combines the power of data and domain knowledge to generate a model that can be trained quickly and adapted easily to different rail systems. In addition, the framework includes a module to generate a training dataset, tackling a typical challenge in real-world system monitoring, namely, the lack of labeled data due to practical limits. Based on the multi-output support vector regression (MSVR), the proposed framework can monitor the stiffness and damping coefficients of the suspension system using vibration signals measured on trains in real time. The framework comprises three modules. First, a simple suspension system dynamics model is built to generate a training dataset. Furthermore, key features are extracted from frequency response curves to reflect the impact of spring and damper degradation. Subsequently, a supervised learning model based on the MSVR is built to predict the stiffness and damping coefficients of suspension systems from features extracted in the second module. Once the model is built, real-time monitoring can be achieved by feeding the vibration signals as they are collected during operations. The proposed framework was evaluated on simulation data for its accuracy and tested on real-world operational data for its practicability.},

By representing the switching communication topology by a Markovian chain, the platoon control system is modeled as a Markovian switching time-delay system with disturbance. In the context of Markovian jumping system theory, a platoon control methodology is obtained to guarantee that the tracking errors can be stabilized mean-square exponentially with a given disturbance attenuation level. The platoon controllers with both fixed and variable gains are suggested. The results are extended to cover partially unknown transition rates of the Markov chains. The numerical examples with comparative results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained vehicle recognition is challenging due to the large intra-class variation in vehicle pose and viewpoint. Many existing methods, especially convolution neural network (CNN)-based methods, solve this problem via detecting and aligning parts individually, and do not consider the interaction between parts, which is very important for effective part detection and vehicle recognition. In this paper, we propose a global topology constraint network for fine-grained vehicle recognition, which adopts the constraint of global topology relationship to depict the interaction between parts and integrates it into CNN in an efficient way. Different CNNs for image classification truncated at intermediate layer can be used for part detection. The global topology relationship between parts is encoded into kernel of depthwise convolution layer, and can be learned from training images. The response under global topology constraint reflects the probability of topology relationship between parts existing in input image. All responses build the description for classification with translation invariance. Through training the whole network, the back-propagation of gradient information of kernel for global topology relationship will guide former layers to better detect useful parts, and thereby improve vehicle recognition. Our proposed method does not require additional annotation, such as bounding box or part annotation, and can be trained in an end-to-end way. We conduct comparison experiments on public Stanford Cars and CompCars datasets, which both show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.},

We propose a neural network model accepting time-series vehicle sensor data and forward-facing videos as input for learning classification of crash-related events and varying types of such events. To elaborate, a novel recurrent neural network structure is introduced, namely, denoising gated recurrent unit with decay, in order to deal with time-series automobile sensor data with missing value and noises. Our model detects crash and near-crash events based on a large set of time-series data collected from naturalistic driving behavior. Furthermore, the model classifies those events involving pedestrians, a vehicle in front, or a vehicle on either side. The effectiveness of our model is evaluated with more than two thousand 30-s clips from naturalistic driving behavior data. The results show that the model, including sensory encoder with denoising gated recurrent unit with decay, visual encoder, and attention mechanism, outperforms gated recurrent unit with decay, gated CNN, and other baselines not only in event classification and but also in event-type classification.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have shown that a homogenous urban road network exists a well-defined macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), which can be used for perimeter control conveniently. Most of the existing perimeter control strategies are model-based control methods, leading to the result that the control effect may be not good enough if the traffic model is not accurate. In this paper, a novel data-driven strategy called model free adaptive control (MFAC) method is proposed for multi-region perimeter control in order to get rid of the dependency of the aforementioned model-based MFD-based perimeter control methods. Due to the fact that the multi-region urban traffic system (MRUTS) is a complex interconnected system, a decentralized estimation and decentralized MFAC (DED-MFAC) method is utilized to deal with the strong-coupled characteristic of the traffic system. In this framework, MFD is used to determine the desired accumulations in each region and generate the throughput data of the urban traffic system, since the acquisition of trip completion flow is more difficult than accumulations. In addition, route choice is also integrated in the proposed policy to further improve the performance of the urban traffic system. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that it can only use the traffic data instead of the traffic model for real-time perimeter control. The effectiveness of the proposed perimeter control scheme is tested in simulation for a multi-region system, and the results show that it is superior to some other commonly used perimeter control methods.},

  abstract     = {Object tracking is crucial for planning safe maneuvers of mobile robots in dynamic environments, in particular for autonomous driving with surrounding traffic participants. Multi-stage processing of sensor measurement data is thereby required to obtain abstracted high-level objects, such as vehicles. This also includes sensor fusion, data association, and temporal filtering. Often, an early-stage object abstraction is performed, which, however, is critical, as it results in information loss regarding the subsequent processing steps. We present a new grid-based object tracking approach that, in contrast, is based on already fused measurement data. The input is thereby pre-processed, without abstracting objects, by the spatial grid cell discretization of a dynamic occupancy grid, which enables a generic multi-sensor detection of moving objects. On the basis of already associated occupied cells, presented in our previous work, this paper investigates the subsequent object state estimation. The object pose and shape estimation thereby benefit from the freespace information contained in the input grid, which is evaluated to determine the current visibility of extracted object parts. An integrated object classification concept further enhances the assumed object size. For a precise dynamic motion state estimation, radar Doppler velocity measurements are integrated into the input data and processed directly on the object-level. Our approach is evaluated with real sensor data in the context of autonomous driving in challenging urban scenarios.},

Different data acquisition techniques based on GPS, radar, and computer vision systems have been already focused in recent years. Although the published studies in many cases include a validation of the developed methods, a more specific analysis on the performance of the vehicle position estimation is necessary. This paper presents a systematic approach to measure the performance of the position estimators based on a comparison of the automatically recorded results to manually generated ground truth of individual vehicle positions in video segments. Furthermore, the methods described in this paper enable a straight forward error handling, which is very useful in the development of position estimators.

A subway network is a real-world example of complex networks in the transportation domain, which has attracted growing attention in network analysis recently. Analyzing human mobility patterns, specifically in ranking subway stations closely bounded by urban subway planning and individuals&#39; travel experience, is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking method of station importance (SIRank) by utilizing human mobility patterns and improved PageRank algorithm. Specifically, by analyzing human mobility patterns of the subway system in Shanghai, we demonstrate both static and dynamic characteristics using two network models (Shanghai subway static network and Shanghai subway passenger network). In particular, the SIRank focuses on bi-directional passenger flow analysis between origins and destinations to iteratively generate the importance value for each station. We implement a range of the experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of SIRank using the real-world subway transaction datasets. The results demonstrate that the hit ratio in SIRank reaches 60% in the top five stations, which is much higher than that of ranking by a weighted mixed index (WMIRank) and ranking by node degree (NDRank) approaches.},

To resolve the high energy consumption issue, in this paper, we present EnTrans, which enables transportation mode detection by using only the kinetic energy harvester as an energy-efficient signal source. The proposed idea is based on the intuition that the vibrations experienced by the passenger during traveling with different transportation modes are distinctive. Thus, voltage signal generated by the energy harvesting devices should contain sufficient features to distinguish different transportation modes. We evaluate our system using over 28 h of data, which is collected by eight individuals using a practical energy harvesting prototype. The evaluation results demonstrate that EnTrans is able to achieve an overall accuracy over 92% in classifying five different modes while saving more than 34% of the system power compared to conventional accelerometer-based approaches.},

In this paper, we present an analytical framework that models downlink traffic in a drive-thru-Internet scenario by means of a multidimensional Markov process: the packet arrivals in the RSU buffer constitute Poisson processes and the transmission times are exponentially distributed. Taking into account the state space explosion problem associated with multidimensional Markov processes, we use iterative perturbation techniques to calculate the stationary distribution of the Markov chain.

This integrated model predicts the energy consumption on all road segments in the road network and applies shortest path algorithms to calculate energy-efficient routes. A temperature-dependent model of the battery internal resistance based on real-world data translates the energy consumption prediction into driving range. The graph representation of the road network is transformed from a node-based graph to an edge-based graph to allow cost allocation of one edge based on the characteristics of the preceding edge. The integrated model is used to perform an analysis of energy-efficient routes for a real-life scenario. The analysis showed that the energy-optimal route is different from the time- and distance-optimal route with energy-efficiency gains up to 37% for the chosen scenario. The energy-efficient route tends to lean toward a distance-optimal route in the case of low auxiliary consumption and to lean toward a time-optimal route in the case of high auxiliary consumption. The energy-efficient route generation is tested in real life for one case of the chosen scenario. The measured results showed a good match with the predicted values for the energy consumption with a 9% mean relative error and preserved the ranking of all routes in terms of the travel distance, travel time, and energy consumption. The proposed integrated model is a functional model for energy consumption in real-life that differentiates many energy consumption influencing factors and produces energy-efficient routes with good accuracy.},

This data is being used to support air transportation research in performance study, trajectory prediction, procedure analysis, and airspace design. However, aircraft states contained in ADS-B messages are limited. More performance parameters are downlinked as Mode-S Comm-B replies, upon the automatic and periodic interrogation of air traffic control secondary surveillance radar. These replies reveal aircraft airspeed, turn rate, target altitude, and so on. They can be intercepted using the same 1090-MHz receiver that receives the ADS-B messages. However, a third-party observer does not know the interrogations, which originated the Comm-B replies. Thus, it is difficult to decode these messages without knowing the type and source aircraft. Furthermore, the parity check also cannot be performed without knowing the interrogations. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic-probabilistic method to decode the Comm-B replies and to check the correctness of the messages. Based on a reference dataset provided by air traffic control of the Netherlands, the method yields a success rate of 97.68% with an error below 0.01%. The performance of the proposed method is further examined with data from eight different regions of the world.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to propose a new optimal hierarchical clustering approach to 3D mobile light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The hierarchical clustering is performed on unorganized point clouds based on a proximity matrix that consists of a distance term and a direction term. In the dissimilarity calculation of two clusters, a pair of points from each of two clusters is selected, respectively, and Euclidean distances between the points are employed to define the distance term. The direction term is obtained by the differences of normal vectors at chosen points. The main contribution is that the cluster combination in the hierarchical clustering is optimized by a point-based graph model. The cluster combination is formulated as a problem of matching, optimized by finding the minimum-cost perfect matching in a bipartite graph. The results show that the proposed hierarchical clustering method succeeds in segmenting object from point clouds without any human-computer interaction and outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation approaches in terms of completeness and correctness.},

  abstract     = {In many parts of the world, passengers traveling on underground metro systems do not enjoy uninterrupted Internet connectivity. This results in passenger frustration since during such trips the access of online social media services is a highly popular activity. Being the world&#39;s oldest underground metro system, London&#39;s underground is a typical transportation environment, where the Internet connectivity is often not available during journeys which predominantly take place underground along sub-surface and deep-level track lines. To alleviate the absence of continuous connectivity, we designed DeepOpp, a context-aware mobile system that facilitates offline access to online social media content. The DeepOpp operates efficiently due to its opportunistic approach: it executes content prefetching and caching operations when adequate urban 3G or WiFi signal is detected. The functionality of DeepOpp includes the crowdsourcing of measurements of signal characteristics (strength, bandwidth availability, and latency) which are subsequently used in predicting mobile network signal coverage and initiating data prefetching operations. During data prefetching, an optimization scheme selectively specifies the social media content to be cached based on current network conditions and device storage availability. We implemented DeepOpp as an Android application which we trialled during real trips on the London underground. Our evaluations show that the DeepOpp offers significant reduction when compared with existing approaches in terms of power usage and the volume of data downloaded. Even though we only tested DeepOpp in the London underground metro system, its feature set makes it readily applicable in similar underground metro systems (in cities like New York, Paris, and Shanghai) as well as in situations, where mobile device users suffer from significant connectivity interruptions.},

  abstract     = {Although 3-D reconstruction of dynamic road environment by moving cameras has been broadly applied in recognition and navigation systems, this task is still considered challenging, especially under circumstances with moving objects, where the reconstruction precision is strongly harassed by the ghosting problem. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing 3-D maps of complete static scenes, based on a combination of an elaborately designed moving-object filtering mechanism and a map repairing and blank refilling procedure, where both plausible color and depth information from stereo image pairs are utilized. In this approach, first, we employ the planarity knowledge into the initial depth map based on the simple linear iterative cluster (SLIC) superpixel segmentation. The dynamic area in the image is determined under the supervision of odometry calculation. After wiping off moving objects, by collaboratively repairing color and depth information, the final 3-D map containing only static scene is obtained. The experimental results on extensive challenging real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {A ground vehicle navigation approach in a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-challenged environments is developed, which uses signals of opportunity (SOPs) in a closed-loop map-matching fashion. The proposed navigation approach employs a particle filter that estimates the ground vehicle&#39;s state by fusing pseudoranges drawn from ambient SOP transmitters with road data stored in commercial maps. The problem considered assumes the ground vehicle to have a priori knowledge about its initial states as well as the position of SOPs. The proposed closed-loop approach estimates the vehicle&#39;s states for subsequent time as it navigates without the GNSS signals. In this approach, a particle filter is employed to continuously estimate the vehicle&#39;s position and velocity along with the clock error states of the vehicle-mounted receiver and SOP transmitters. The simulation and experimental results with cellular long-term evolution (LTE) SOPs are presented, evaluating the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed framework in different driving environments. The experimental results demonstrate a position root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of: 1.6 m over a 825-m trajectory in an urban environment with five cellular LTE SOPs, 3.9 m over a 1.5-km trajectory in a suburban environment with two cellular LTE SOPs, and 3.6 m over a 345-m trajectory in a challenging urban environment with two cellular LTE SOPs. It is demonstrated that incorporating the proposed map-matching algorithm reduced the position RMSE by 74.88%, 58.15%, and 46.18% in these three environments, respectively, from the RMSE obtained by an LTE-only navigation solution.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs) are considered to be the next big thing that will remarkably change our lives, since this kind of technology is able to make our lives and roads safer. Due to the very fast move and high dynamic in VANETs, it is important to quickly ascertain the reliability of information. Although intrusion detection system (IDS) has been proposed as a reliable approach to protect VANETs against attacks, its overhead is serious, which spends too much time on detection, especially when the number of vehicles increases. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel filter model based on a hidden generalized mixture transition distribution model (HgMTD) in VANETs, called FM-HgMTD, which can quickly filter the messages from neighboring vehicles so as to reduce the overhead and detection time. It adopts a well-known multi-objective optimization (NSGA-II) algorithm combined with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to forecast the future states of neighboring vehicles and then to filter out malicious messages, by monitoring the change of the state pattern of each neighboring vehicle. In addition, a timeliness method is used to maintain the accuracy of the forecast. The experiments show that IDS with the proposed FM-HgMTD has better performance than other available IDSs in terms of detection rate, detection time, and overhead.},

However, existing challenges need to be addressed for VEC&#39;s resources to be used in an efficient manner. The fundamental challenges arise from high vehicular mobility and intermittent or lack of connectivity. In this paper, we model the computation offloading task in VEC, with the goal of assessing the ability to simulate the elements that contribute to enhancing its performance in VEC. In addition, we propose the Mobility Prediction Retrieval (MPR) data retrieval protocol, which allows VEC to efficiently retrieve the output processed data of the offloaded application by using both vehicles and road side units as communication nodes. The developed protocol uses geo-location information of the network infrastructure and the users to accomplish an efficient data retrieval in a Vehicular Edge Computing environment. Finally, the experiments performed show that the proposed protocol to achieves a more reliable data retrieval with lower communication delay when compared to related techniques.},

The proposed FOg Computing in UAS Software-defined mesh network (FOCUS) paradigm aims to realize an implementable network design that considers practical issues of aerial connectivity and computation. It allocates UASs to the tasks of data forwarding and in-network fog computing while maximizing number of ground-users in UAS coverage. FOCUS improves efficient utilization of network resources by introducing on-board computation and innovates on top of software-defined networking stack by integrating the capabilities of network and ground controllers to enable simultaneous orchestration of both UASs and communication flows. There are three main contributions of the paper: First, a SDN-based architecture is designed enabling autonomous configuration of computation and communication as well as managing multi-hop aerial links. Second, a global optimization problem to achieve optimal forwarding and computational allocation is formulated using Open Jackson Network model and solved via a heuristic approach with well defined complexity. Third, FOCUS framework is implemented on a small-scale testbed of Intel ® Aero UASs performing image analysis with a full software stack. Experiments reveal at least 32% latency improvement in computation service time compared to traditional centralized computation at the end-server or greedy task allocation schemes within the network.},

Vehicular clouds were inspired by the reality of present-day vehicles featuring an impressive array of on-board compute, storage and sensing capabilities and by the insight that these on-board capabilities are a vast untapped resource that, at the moment, is wasted. Harvesting these vehicular resources and putting them to work in a meaningful and productive way promises to have a significant and lasting societal impact. One of the defining ways in which vehicular clouds differ from conventional clouds is resource volatility. As vehicles enter and leave the cloud, new compute resources become available while others depart, creating a volatile environment where reasoning about fundamental performance metrics becomes very challenging. Given that vehicular clouds and their numerous variants have becomes a very active field of research, this seems to be a good moment to survey the state of the art of vehicular cloud research. In this survey, we adopt an inclusive rather than an exclusive definition of various flavors of vehicular clouds. Vehicular clouds, in their many incarnations, have a huge array of potential applications. In order to bring this potential to fruition, significant research challenges have to be overcome.

The underlying business model of cloud computing is the familiar “pay-as-you-go” model of metered services, where a user pays for whatever he/she uses and no more, and where additional demand for service can be met in real time. This powerful idea was suggested, at least in part, by the pervasive low-cost high-speed Internet, a good handle on virtualization, and advances in parallel and distributed computing. Three aspects are novel in conventional cloud computing: First, it gives users the illusion of infinite computing resources available to them on demand. Second, it eliminates the up-front financial commitment by cloud users, allowing them to increase hardware/software resources as needed. Third, it gives users the ability to pay for resources on a short-term basis and release them when they are no longer needed.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that the function of a city influences the utility of social media data in travel demand models by generating models for eight US cities with different functions. Data from Twitter and Foursquare, as well as other socio-demographic information, are considered as independent variables in Origin-Destination trip regression models generated via a Random Forest regression technique. Model performance with and without use of social media data are compared via 10-fold cross-validation. The results indicate that the accuracy of the models for all eight cities improved when independent variables based on social media data were included. The performance was most improved in metropolitan areas, followed by rural and tourist areas. Inspired by this finding, we conclude that the city function influences the utility of social media data in travel demand models. Meanwhile, we create models based on trip purpose and transport mode to explore other factors that may impact the efficiency of applying social media data in transport research.},

  abstract     = {The cycle-based volume is critical for traffic state estimation and signal control optimization at signalized intersections. Traditional volume estimation mainly depends on fixed detectors represented by loop detectors, but limited spatial coverage and detection failure are also prominent. With the development of vehicle positioning, smartphone-based navigation, and connected-vehicle technologies, massive high-resolution trajectory data have recently become available, which can provide rich and timely information on the traffic arrival and departure processes at signalized intersections. Hence, the studies utilizing trajectory data for estimating the queue length and traffic volume at intersections has received increasing attention in the past few years. However, the most existing studies have demanded a comparatively high penetration rate and adopted site-specific assumptions for unsteady arrival patterns. In contrast, this paper solely used trajectory data for cycle-based flow estimation through a generic hybrid method that combined a probabilistic model and shockwave theory to maximize the utilization of limited captured trajectories, especially under a low penetration rate. In this method, within each cycle, the volume of stopped vehicles is estimated based on the shockwave theory, while the volume of non-stopped vehicles is modeled as a parameter estimation problem of a time-dependent constrained Poisson distribution, where the time headway correspondingly obeys an M3 distribution. The cycle-based volume is solved by a maximum likelihood estimation using an expectation-maximization procedure. An empirical case study was conducted with various signal timing schemes and the results showed satisfactory robustness with an accuracy of more than 90% under a penetration rate of 7.6%.},

  abstract     = {Accurately estimated data transmission ability is important in operating a vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET), which has limited bandwidth and highly dynamic typology. The mobility behavior of traditional wireless networks is different from VANET&#39;s, and existing results on the former are not applicable to VANET directly. Most existing studies on VANET capacity estimation focus on asymptotic descriptions. In them, messages sent and received by vehicle nodes are composed of data packets, and vehicle nodes can move along roads only. In this paper, a modeling and calculation approach for accurate VANET capacity is proposed. We transfer vehicle nodes to data packets and then abstract data packets that can move along roads into data flow in virtual pipelines. Then, we derive a fluid mechanics-based data flow model and propose capacity calculation equations. According to network scale, network capacity is divided into following three stages: linear growth, maintenance, and decline. This paper demonstrates that the data flow model-based capacity is consistent with that of simulation results.},

  abstract     = {The IEEE 802.11p-based dedicated short range communication (DSRC) is essential to enhance driving safety and improve road efficiency by enabling rapid cooperative message exchanging. However, there is a lack of good understanding on the DSRC performance in urban environments for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, which impedes its reliable and efficient application. In this paper, we first conduct intensive data analytics on V2V performance, based on a large amount of real-world DSRC communications trace collected in Shanghai city, and obtain several key insights as follows. First, among many context factors, the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) link condition is the major factor degrading V2V performance. Second, the durations of line-of-sight (LoS) and NLoS transmission conditions follow power law distributions, which indicate that the probability of experiencing long LoS/NLoS conditions both could be high. Third, the packet inter-reception (PIR) time distribution follows an exponential distribution in the LoS conditions but a power law in the NLoS conditions, which means that the consecutive packet reception failures rarely appear in the LoS conditions but can constantly appear in the NLoS conditions. Based on these findings, we propose a context-aware reliable beaconing scheme, called CoBe, to enhance the broadcast reliability for safety applications. The CoBe is a fully distributed scheme, in which a vehicle first detects the link condition with each of its neighbors by machine learning algorithms, then exchanges such link condition information with its neighbors, and finally selects the minimal number of helper vehicles to rebroadcast its beacons to those neighbors in bad link condition. To analyze and evaluate the CoBe performance, a two-state Markov chain is devised to model beaconing behaviors. The extensive trace-driven simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of CoBe.},

  abstract     = {Low delay and high reliability of safety broadcast messages are critical to future intelligent transport systems (ITS). The main objective of this paper is to propose a novel safety broadcast system model to satisfy the latency and reliability requirements of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) applications. Second, using this proposed model, a comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted under different technologies (cellular and IEEE 802.11p) for different vehicle densities in rural and urban scenarios based on a realistic system-level simulator. The performance is further improved by using application layer raptor Q codes as compared to the standard repetition codes proposed in the literature. Results show a coverage improvement of 144 m (rural) and 45 m (urban) using cellular V2V with raptor Q codes as compared to IEEE 802.11p for a target end-to-end delay of 5 ms. This is because IEEE 802.11p suffers from preamble channel estimation especially in urban areas with high collision rate due to the hidden terminal problems. In case of a traffic jam, with higher vehicle density, full duplex (FD) operation is needed for cellular V2V to achieve the target delay. FD operation satisfies the latency requirements even when half the resources are available for V2V transmissions.},

The Internet of Things and vehicular communication technologies facilitate rapid development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). While most studies focus on standalone CAV technologies, collective CAV control has much potential. With the connectivity and automation of CAVs, we can employ dynamic lane reversal (DLR) to optimize the travel schedules of CAVs for performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose the dynamic lane reversal-traffic scheduling management (DLR-TSM) scheme for CAVs. The system collects the travel requests from CAVs and determines their optimal schedules and routes over dynamically reversible lanes. We formulate the routing and scheduling problem on DLR as an integer linear program. To address the scaling effect, an algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers is designed to solve the problem in a distributed manner. We extensively evaluate the DLR-TSM and the distributed algorithm with real-world transportation data. The simulation results show that the DLR-TSM can significantly improve the travel times of CAVs and the distributed algorithm can dramatically reduce the required computational time.},

This paper provides a proof of concept of Virtual coupling by introducing a specific operating mode within the European rail traffic management system/European train control system (ERTMS/ETCS) standard specification, and by defining a coupling control algorithm accounting for time-varying delays affecting the communication links. To that aim, we define one ploy to enrich the ERTMS/ETCS with Virtual coupling without changing its working principles and we borrow a numerical analysis methodology used to study platooning in the automotive field.

It is still a challenging task owing to several reasons, including the diversity of pedestrian appearances, the subtle pose difference between adjacent orientations, and similar poses with different orientations such as axisymmetric orientations. These problems render the task highly difficult. Recent studies involving convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attempted to solve these problems. However, their performance is still far from satisfactory for application in intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based two-stream network for continuous orientation estimation. The network can learn representations based on the spatial co-occurrence of visual patterns among pedestrians. To boost estimation performance, we applied a coarse-to-fine learning approach that consists of two learning stages. We investigated continuous orientation performance on the TUD Multiview Pedestrian dataset and the KITTI dataset and compared them with the state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our method outperforms other existing methods.},

Based on this, the decision-making system is established according to the Markov decision process (MDP) and the feedback value of each decision sequence is calculated by the integrated threat assessment function, thus the safest trajectory for the current moment can be determined by optimal search. Finally, the decision-making system is verified in the overtaking and cut-in scenario by Carsim and Simulink co-simulation.

To reduce the considerable requirement of fine annotations, a CNN-based classifier is trained by considering both supervised samples with manually labeled object classes and pairwise constraints, where a data sample is composed of a segment as the foreground and neighborhood points as the background. A special loss function is designed to account for both annotations and constraints, where the constraint data are encouraged to be assigned to the same semantic class. A dataset containing 1838 frames of LiDAR data, 39 934 pairwise constraints and 57 927 human annotations is developed. The performance of the method is examined extensively.

  abstract     = {With the continuous expansion of transportation networks in the urbanization process, monitoring network-wide traffic dynamics with the link resolution has become a significant challenge. Moreover, applying the traditional link-based data into traffic states identification over large-scale networks requires expensive costs. Fortunately, nowadays, we can collect large amounts of trip-based data which makes it possible to tackle this problem. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework to infer network-wide link travel time with trip-based data from automatic vehicle identification (AVI) detectors. Different from the link-based data, the AVI data contains multiple attributes, such as trip origin, destination, time stamps, and vehicle license plate. Thus, it is more possible to infer individual traces at a network-wide scale with the AVI detectors. In the proposed framework, we first develop the probabilistic trip travel time allocation (PTTA) model to assign the trip travel time of each vehicle into its traversed links. Especially, the combination impacts of signal control and traffic flow on link travel time are introduced in this model for each allocation. Then, we extract available allocations covered by divided intervals for real-time estimation of network-wide average link travel time. A real-world data set was collected from Xuancheng, Anhui, China. The empirical results show that the performance of PTTA model has a superior level on allocation accuracy over similar methods, and the proposed framework is proved to be reliable at a network-wide scale when the AVI detection sparsity of network is within a certain range.},

  abstract     = {Monocular visual-inertial measurement unit (IMU) odometry has been widely used in various intelligent vehicles. As a popular technique, detector–descriptor-based visual-IMU odometry is effective and efficient due to the fact that local descriptors are robust against occlusions, background clutter, and abrupt content changes. However, to our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive and comparative evaluation study on the performance of different combinations of detectors and descriptors recently developed. In order to bridge this gap, we conduct such a comparative study in a unified framework. In particular, six typical routes with different lengths, shapes, and road scenes are selected from the well-known KITTI dataset. We first evaluate the performance of different combinations of salient point detectors and local descriptors using the six routes. Then, we tune the parameters of the best detector or descriptor obtained for each route, to further augment the results. This paper provides not only comprehensive benchmarks for assessing various algorithms but also instructive guidelines and insights for developing detectors and descriptors to handle different road scenes.},

  abstract     = {The failure to estimate friction on the road is a significant cause of roadway departure crashes. It is even more relevant to autonomous vehicles (AVs) as they are currently not designed to measure the skid resistance of roads. Most traditional measurements are too inefficient for real-time AV control. Thus, in this paper, we propose a dynamic method to estimate pavement friction level using computer vision. We collect 100 sets of high-quality road images and their resistance values to train the model, and design two major methods for analysis: 1) texture identification, consisting of grayscale-enhanced local binary pattern and the gray-level gradient co-occurrence matrix and 2) a deep neural network based on domain knowledge (TLDKNet). We introduce two standards of classification for model training and propose three indices-underestimation error, overestimation error, and accuracy-to verify the performance of our algorithms. The results showed the great correlation between pavement texture and skid resistance. The TLDKNet yielded the best performance with an accuracy of 90.67% and only 2.67% underestimation error, showing that it is sufficiently conservative with regard to safety. Based on the proposed method of estimation, a framework for anti-skid driving control is developed regarding the car-following behavior and turning movements. The anti-skid control framework provides new insights into enhancing the AV safety performance.},

Considering the disturbances in traction force generated by the traction system, a dynamic model with actuator uncertainties modeled as input distribution matrix uncertainty is established. Then, a new sliding-mode controller with design conditions is proposed for the healthy train system, which can drive the tracking error dynamical system to a predesigned sliding surface in finite time and maintain the sliding motion on it thereafter. In order to deal with the actuator uncertainties and unknown faults simultaneously, the adaptive technique is combined with the fault-tolerant sliding-mode control design together to guarantee that the asymptotical convergence of the tracking errors is achieved. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive fault-tolerant sliding-mode control scheme is extended to the cases of the actuator uncertainties with unknown bounds and the unparameterized actuator faults. Finally, the case studies on a real train dynamic model are presented to explain the developed fault-tolerant control scheme.

This paper proposes a solution to assess the brain fatigue workload of pilots through an instantaneous spectral entropy feature and an infinitely warped model. The instantaneous characteristics of electroencephalography (EEG) signals are extracted by Hilbert transform, and Euclidean norm weighted permutation entropy is proposed. The infinitely warped model is a new automatic learning model for detecting arbitrary shapes of EEG data. In addition, we propose a rapid learning framework to learn mental fatigue by integrating Treelet transform and infinitely warped models. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our approach is better able to handle complex data in complex shapes.

  abstract     = {Due to the characteristics of urban vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), many difficulties exist when designing routing protocols. In this paper, we focus on designing an efficient routing strategy for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication in urban VANETs. Because, the characteristics of urban VANET routing performance are affected mainly by intersections, traffic lights, and traffic conditions, we propose an intersection-based distributed routing (IDR) strategy. In view of the fact that traffic lights are used to cause vehicles to stop at intersections, we propose an intersection vehicle fog (IVF) model, in which waiting vehicles dynamically form a collection or fog of vehicles at an intersection. Acting as infrastructure components, the IVFs proactively establish multihop links with adjacent intersections and analyze the traffic conditions on adjacent road segments using fuzzy logic. This approach offloads a large part of the routing work. During routing, the IVFs adjust the routing direction based on the real-time position of the destination, thus avoiding rerouting. Each time an IVF makes a distributed routing decision, the IDR model employs the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to identify an optimal routing path whose connectivity is based on the traffic conditions existing in the multihop links between intersections. Because of the high connectivity of the routing path, the model requires only packet forwarding and not carrying when transmitting along the routing path, which reduces the transmission delay and increases the transmission ratio. The presented mathematical analyses and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed routing strategy is feasible and that it achieves relatively high performance.},

  abstract     = {The visual environment perception plays an irreplaceable role for autonomous driving. Wider and deeper convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are explored in most approaches which focus on improving performance. However, for real-world applications, the environment perception need to be accurate enough to ensure safety and fast enough to guarantee prompt control. Toward this goal, we propose a deeply supervised Z-style residual network (DSZRNet) to join object and lane detection via a unified architecture, named DSZRNet, which consists of three main parts: 1) the Z-style structure commits to fuse the feature information of shallow and deep layers for effective and robust representations; 2) the residual net is to gradually improve the location accuracy; and 3) the deeply supervised lane detection branch is grafted on the shared convolutional layers by adding only a little computational burden. Our DSZRNet is simple and can be trained end-to-end. To effectively evaluate the proposed approach, a large-scale China urban traffic (LSCUT) dataset is collected which contains objects that have a large intra-class distance because of the large-scale variance, occlusions, etc, and a variable number of lanes. Besides, the real-world computer vision KITTI dataset is also used for performance evaluation. The experimental results we obtained demonstrate that the DSZRNet gains the best tradeoff between the detection speed and detection accuracy than the other published works, and it is well suited for environment perception for autonomous driving. The download links of the LSCUT dataset will be at: https://github.com/DaiCV/LSCUT.},

The online controller aims at enhancing tram reliability by adopting three control strategies-green extension, vehicle holding, and speed guidance-to instruct the trams to travel within appropriate progressions. The real-world case studies are presented to demonstrate that, comparing with the state-of-the-practice approach, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the service quality by shortening tram running time and passenger waiting time, and to mitigate the negative impact on other vehicles by avoiding triggering unnecessary green extensions.},

Moreover, the vehicle lateral stability is very crucial in emergency scenarios. Due to complex traffic conditions and various road frictions, emergency brake may cause a vehicle to lose its lateral stability. Therefore, this paper proposes a lateral-stability-coordinated collision avoidance control system (LSCACS) based on the model predictive control (MPC). First, the proposed LSCACS decides which control mode to be implemented based on vehicle dynamics states, including a normal driving mode, a full auto brake mode, and a brake and stability mode. The MPC is used in the upper controller to calculate the desired deceleration and additional yaw moment. The lower controller calculates the desired tire forces of four wheels and realizes them by certain wheel cylinder hydraulic pressures. The LSCACS is validated by hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests, and the results show LSCACS&#39;s effectiveness and great performance of the collision avoidance and lateral stability.},

The information generated by these sensors can be used to offer a wide range of on-demand services, such as congestion notification, parking lots, and video surveillance. These services need a reliable and low latency unicast communication scheme in order to efficiently deliver the information requested by drivers. In this paper, a local traffic aware unicast routing scheme is proposed. To overcome network fragmentation, the proposed scheme relies on base stations and virtual base stations to transmit information from source car to the destination car using backhaul link. In this model, as base stations are sparsely deployed in the junction areas, a car moving in the junction area acts as a virtual base station node to support the routing process in the absence of a base station. Moreover, it avoids the impact of unreliable channel on information delivery. In the proposed scheme, each base station and virtual base station uses the short status messages (beacons) exchanged by the cars to form a local database of car locations. The stored information is used to find a base station or virtual base station that offers a minimum delay path to the destination car. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing routing schemes in terms of end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio. The proposed scheme is also validated by a connected car prototype built in an indoor laboratory environment.},

For an automatic driving vehicle, the “pulse-and-glide” strategy is known to be optimal, and many analyses have been performed on this strategy in offline optimization. However, there is no pulse-and-glide algorithm that is implementable in real-time without loss of optimality. This paper presents the solution structure of an optimal control problem for the pulse-and-glide driving strategy. The solution structure is used in designing a real-time implementable algorithm that determines the optimal speed trajectory and the optimal gear shifting trajectory for pulse-and-glide operation. The optimal problem is formulated in a speed-acceleration domain (v-a domain) not in a time-velocity domain, which greatly reduces the complexity of the problem. Therefore, an optimal solution can be achieved by using the necessary conditions with a small number of grid search computations. The algorithm achieved 3%-5% fuel savings compared to the cruising case. In contrast, the previous real-time implementable pulse-and-glide method found in other literature achieved only 2%-3% savings with the same road conditions. By introducing a new domain for the problem formulation, the designed algorithm can be used in real-time without loss of optimality.},

A combination of a potential field like function and reachability sets of a vehicle are used to identify safe zones on a road that the vehicle can navigate towards. These safe zones are provided to a tube-based robust model predictive controller as reference to generate feasible trajectories for combined lateral and longitudinal motion of a vehicle. The strengths of the proposed framework are: 1) it is free from non-convex collision avoidance constraints; 2) it ensures feasibility of trajectory even if decelerating or accelerating while performing lateral motion; and 3) it is real-time implementable. The ability of the proposed framework to plan feasible trajectories for high-speed overtaking is validated in a high-fidelity IPG CarMaker and Simulink co-simulation environment.},

  abstract     = {Fairness and efficiency are two key requirements that have to be guaranteed in channel resource allocation in cooperative vehicle safety systems. Existing channel access control strategies, however, rely on each individual node to adjust networking parameters independently according to its locally measured state information, thus leading to unfairness. Although some coordinated strategies have been proposed to resolve this issue, they pay little attention to the efficiency. In order to achieve the tradeoff between fairness and efficiency, in this paper, we propose a utility function in terms of inter-packet reception time required to capture the performance of consecutive successful packets&#39; reception under various vehicle densities. A channel access control problem among vehicles is then formulated as a non-cooperation game model. This model utilizes a punishment function to penalize a node that monopolizes the channel resources and hence can enable nodes to coordinate with each other to achieve desired fairness and efficiency. Next, a distributed decision-making scheme for channel access control is designed. It adjusts transmission rate in a coordinated manner and can guide each node to reach a Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium point. The experimental results validate that the proposed strategy can result in fair channel resource allocation and ensure high-tracking accuracy for each vehicle under dynamic traffic conditions.},

All the existing algorithms focus on a single background model to cope with all types of challenging and complex video environments. In this paper, a real-time pixel level classification method is proposed that uses its previous output history to update its parameters. The model has three components designed to handle various types of challenging background environments. For each pixel, three sub-parts, namely the Adaptive Background Model, the Neighborhood Background Model, and the Change Detection Background Model are constructed to detect various types of complex background changes. A pixel level model updating method uses the previous foreground/background binary classification results to periodically refresh all the three background models. This update method helps to recognize the foreground accurately by adjusting the algorithmic parameters to efficiently detect complex background changes.

However, it is still not entirely clear how much influence of the AV&#39;s cut-in behavior would lay on the surrounding drivers in urban traffic. To investigate this question, we design a series of driving scenarios and analyze the impact of different cut-in maneuvers performed by the human-like AV on the surrounding drivers&#39; comfort. Ten volunteer drivers participate in our experiment and take a series of trials in a driving simulator. The experimental results demonstrate that the relative distance between the AV and the target car on the adjacent lane has a more significant effect on the surrounding drivers&#39; comfort than the relative speed does. In addition, different parameters should be considered with different cut-in scenarios. This conclusion could provide practical support to make a friendly cut-in decision for the AVs.},

The methodology is applied to a metro line in Stockholm, Sweden. The prediction accuracy is evaluated with respect to absolute passenger loads and discrete crowding levels. When available, predictions with real-time load data significantly outperform historical averages, with accuracy improvements varying in magnitude across target stations and train cars depending on load variability.

Notwithstanding their relevance, these graphs are created and maintained manually for most applications, in both research and practice. In this paper, we develop a heuristic method for automatically generating multiscale graph representations without significantly compromising their topological properties. This makes the resulting graphs widely applicable. The method is demonstrated on the open street map network of Amsterdam with four different application cases. Various graph metrics are used for evaluating the performance of coarsening on the topological characteristics of the network. Our results show that the method is able to successfully reduce the Amsterdam network by up to 96% of its original size at a computation time of no more than 15 min with a limited loss of information, indicated by the preservation of key network characteristics. For example, the method maintains trip length distributions and limits the maximum shortest path deterioration between any major origin and destination nodes to no more than 0.025% for the coarsest graph. Moreover, by setting its parameters it can cater for preservation of important network elements or entire sub-networks, which is of special importance in multiscale traffic modeling and simulation. The versatility of the algorithm-in contrast to algorithms dedicated to for example traffic assignment applications-makes it useful for a wide range of applications within the transportation domain and beyond. To support further research an open-source implementation of the algorithm is made available.},

Moreover, the group consisted of irregular passengers is called irregular travel group. In this paper, we propose an approach to recognize irregular travel groups based on cascade clustering. Firstly, passengers&#39; travel sequences of active state in hours are extracted as representations of travel patterns according to the records of smart cards in a continuous time period. The sequences are clustered with the K-means algorithm to detect irregular passengers. Then, travel similarities between the derived irregular passengers are measured and irregular travel groups are recognized based on DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. The proposed method is applied to real Beijing subway smart card data, and the results are validated with the data derived from SINA Micro-blogs. Experimental results show that the detected irregular passengers&#39; movement areas are consistent with the ground truth.},

  abstract     = {Fast and accurate detection of vehicles on road traffic scenes captured by traffic surveillance cameras, is essential for large-scale deployment of automated traffic surveillance systems. The state-of-the-art techniques typically employ background modeling for low-complexity foreground detection. However, this is a challenging problem as these methods need to be robust to varying road scene conditions (such as illumination changes, camera jitter, stationary vehicles, and heavy traffic) leading to huge computation cost. In this paper, we propose a highly accurate yet low-complexity foreground (i.e., vehicle) detection technique, which can effectively deal with the varying road scene conditions, and generate accurate pixel-level foreground masks in real-time. We propose a novel robust block-based feature suitable for modeling road background and detecting vehicles as foreground, and employ Bayesian probabilistic modeling on these features. The experimental evaluations on widely used traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable accuracy to the existing state-of-the-art techniques but at a much higher processing frame rate (40x speedup over PAWCS). The real-time performance of the proposed system has also been demonstrated by implementing it on a low-cost embedded platform, Odroid XU-4, that still achieves a frame rate of over 80 frames/s, thereby enabling the real-time detection of foreground objects in road scenes.},

Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown dramatic performance improvements for computing the matching cost in the stereo matching. However, the performance of CNN-based approaches relies heavily on datasets, requiring a large number of ground truth data which needs tremendous works. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework to learn CNNs for matching cost computation in an unsupervised manner. Our method leverages an image domain learning combined with stereo epipolar constraints. By exploiting the correspondence consistency between stereo images, our method selects putative positive samples in each training iteration and utilizes them to train the networks. We further propose a positive sample propagation scheme to leverage additional training samples. Our unsupervised learning method is evaluated with two kinds of network architectures, simple and precise CNNs, and shows comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art methods including both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches on KITTI, Middlebury, HCI, and Yonsei datasets. This extensive evaluation demonstrates that the proposed learning framework can be applied to deal with various real driving conditions.},

However, most current literatures on population synthesis, which is the fundamental building block of disaggregated travel demand forecasting and agent-based traffic simulation, only considers the household impact. This paper makes two contributions in this regard. First, a methodological issue is identified: the existence of multiple social relationships (e.g., a dual set of constraints from social institutions or structures) makes it more difficult to generate a consistent synthetic population, meaning that this population satisfies constraints from more than one type of social organizations. A tensor decomposition method is then proposed to generate a consistent population with multi-social relationships. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this type of methodological issue has been addressed. Our sample-based method constitutes an improvement compared to existing approaches in that it can respect constraints from multiple social organizations without reducing accuracy. A numerical test concerning individual, household, and enterprise, using Chinese national population and economic census data, indicates that the new method can lead to stable and relatively small errors in total.

  abstract     = {The efficient use of the road network for freight transport has a big impact on travel times, pollution, and fuel consumption, as well as on the mobility of passenger vehicles. In today&#39;s road network, truck drivers make uncoordinated selfish routing decisions, which may easily congest an initially uncongested route as many truck drivers make the same selfish decision by choosing the same route in an effort to minimize their travel time without accounting for the fact that others do the same, given the same available traffic information. In this paper, we propose a coordinated system for truck drivers, using monetary incentives and fees, to balance the traffic load and improve the overall traffic conditions and time delays experienced by both truck and passenger vehicle drivers. The basic characteristics of the mechanisms presented are that they are budget balanced, do not penalize the truck drivers compared to the user equilibrium, and they assume voluntary participation. Two models of voluntary participation are considered: weak and strong voluntary participation. In the first, each one of the drivers prefers all the drivers (including self) to participate in the mechanism than not. In the second model, each one of the truck drivers prefers to participate in the system, provided that all the others do. For each model of voluntary participation, an incentive mechanism is designed. A special emphasis is given to the fairness of the proposed mechanisms. The numerical examples are used to demonstrate the results and the efficiency of the solution techniques.},

  abstract     = {The traffic driving environment is a complex and dynamic changing scene in which drivers have to pay close attention to salient and important targets or regions for safe driving. Modeling drivers&#39; eye movements and attention allocation in traffic driving can also help guiding unmanned intelligent vehicles. However, until now, few studies have modeled drivers&#39; true fixations and allocations while driving. To this end, we collect an eye tracking dataset from a total of 28 experienced drivers viewing 16 traffic driving videos. Based on the multiple drivers&#39; attention allocation dataset, we propose a convolutional-deconvolutional neural network (CDNN) to predict the drivers&#39; eye fixations. The experimental results indicate that the proposed CDNN outperforms the state-of-the-art saliency models and predicts drivers&#39; attentional locations more accurately. The proposed CDNN can predict the major fixation location and shows excellent detection of secondary important information or regions that cannot be ignored during driving if they exist. Compared with the present object detection models in autonomous and assisted driving systems, our human-like driving model does not detect all of the objects appearing in the driving scenes, but it provides the most relevant regions or targets, which can largely reduce the interference of irrelevant scene information.},

The station has available cheaper, but limited, energy from renewable energy sources (RES). The EVs are capable of and willing to participate in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) energy transfers that are used to reduce the charging cost and increase the RES utilization. The algorithms are centralized and aim to minimize the total charging cost for the EVs. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer programming (MIP) one and we solve it optimally assuming full knowledge of the EV demand and energy generation. Later, we propose an online algorithm that iteratively calls the offline one and copes with unknown future interruptions by arriving the EVs and with the inability to predict accurately RES production. In addition, a novel technique called virtual demand is developed that increases the demand of already existing EVs, in order to store renewable energy and later transfer it via V2V to EVs that will arrive at the CS in the future. This technique is used for mitigating the inefficiency due to the uncertainty about future actions that real-time scheduling entails. In a setting with up to 150 EVs and using real data regarding the RES production, our algorithms are shown to have low execution times, while the use of virtual demand increases RES utilization by 12% and reduces cost by 3.3%.},

While the CIC regulates the safe and efficient relative motion of vehicles in the intersection, a high-level hybrid queuing model is proposed to describe the dynamics of the vehicle queues associated to each intersection lane. This model, including constraints, is used to design an optimal access management approach based on the model predictive control that minimizes the time that the vehicles spend within the intersection, thereby optimizing the traffic throughput of the intersection. The performance of this methodology is studied by means of two representative examples. The impact of the design parameters of the optimal access management approach is shown for a T-intersection case study. Moreover, using a real-life five lane intersection case study, the proposed approach is compared to a vehicle-actuated traffic light approach, and a first come first served approach. The comparison shows the benefits of the automated optimal serving of vehicles from different lanes.},

We propose a provably safe hierarchical-distributed solution to balance computational complexity and optimality of the system operation. In our design, a central intersection manager communicates with vehicles heading toward the intersection, groups them into clusters (termed bubbles) as they appear, and determines an optimal schedule of passage through the intersection for each bubble. The vehicles in each bubble receive their schedule and implement local distributed control to ensure system-wide inter-vehicular safety while respecting speed and acceleration limits, conforming to the assigned schedule, and seeking to optimize their individual trajectories. Our analysis rigorously establishes that the different aspects of the hierarchical design operate in concert and that the safety specifications are satisfied. We illustrate its execution through a suite of simulations and compare its performance against optimized signal-based coordination over a wide range of system parameters.},

We propose a driving-behavior-based State-of-Charge (SoC) prediction (DBSP) algorithm to overcome this problem. This algorithm can determine whether drivers can reach their destinations while also predicting the SoC if drivers were to return the trip. First, two supercapacitor equivalent circuit models are established with one based on the historical average power and the other based on the equivalent current, which is proposed in this algorithm. Then, based on the equivalent transformation of the two models, an analytical expression relating the historical average power and the predicted SoC is derived by using the equivalent current as a “bridge.” Therefore, the predicted SoC can be dynamically adjusted in response to recorded historical data, including the output power, speed, and distance of EVs powered by supercapacitors. The simulation results demonstrate that the total prediction error is less than 0.5% of the real SoC at different initial SoC and temperature, which represents idealized behavior-based driving. In contrast, in actual driving experiments, the total prediction error is less than 3% of the real SoC at different initial SoC and temperature.},

First, the desired acceleration based on the CTH and the sailboat velocity needed to converge to the platooning is defined. Second, a control of sailboat orientation to manage the sailboat acceleration is proposed. The proposed platooning strategy adapts to the specific characteristics of sailboats, which are different from other motorized marine vehicles. Two tack strategies can be used for the method: the first is to regulate the sailboat velocity; the second is to go front of the wind while staying in a short corridor. The desired acceleration for fulfilling the platooning has been derived and validated.

  abstract     = {With the increasing concerns on energy consumption and operating cost in metro systems, energy saving on train operation attracts significant attentions. Previous studies have mainly focused on optimal control of a single train and energy-efficient train timetabling. The former does not consider the synchronization of motoring and braking trains, which cannot ensure the proper utilization of regenerative energy on the metro lines without energy storage systems. The latter includes scheduling train operations to synchronize motoring and braking trains for the better utilization of regenerative energy. However, the overlapping time of motoring and braking trains is usually as short as a few seconds and the energy reduction might be made impossible by train delays, which are common in practice. This paper presents a model framework, on the extents of motoring/braking of train acceleration and station stopping, as well as the locations of switching train operation modes, for real-time cooperative control of multiple metro trains. The objective is to minimize the net energy consumption with the consideration of utilizing regenerative energy. A cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm is developed to attain the solution of the proposed model. Case studies on a real-life metro line demonstrate the energy saving performance of the proposed approach compared with separate train control and timetable optimization, from no disturbance to a good range of delays. The results also indicate that the partial motoring in train acceleration and partial braking in station stopping achieve better net energy reduction, in comparison with full motoring/braking preferred in previous studies.},

It enables vehicles that have sufficient resources to act as mobile cloud servers by offering a variety of services to users&#39; vehicles. In this context, to consume a cloud service on the move, a user vehicle must first identify the most stable vehicles, relative to his/her motion, which are able to provide the service, and then select the most suitable service according to his/her preferences, while both provider vehicles and their services are described by attributes or quality constraints. Therefore, we introduce a generic relative motion model, as a generic link stability metric, upon which vehicles can form a stable cloud, and we address the VC service selection by using linguistic quantifiers and fuzzy quantified propositions, to define our flexible quantified service selection (FQSS) scheme, which aggregates efficiently both user preferences and service constraints and ranks service providers from the most to the least satisfactory. To break ties among the top-ranked service providers, we make use of our parameters for ranking refinement, called least satisfactory proportion (lsp) and greatest satisfactory proportion (gsp). The simulation results show that our link stability achieves generic motion, by modeling a wider range of vehicle motion types, and our FQSS scheme allows a good successful service consumption rate while reducing latency.},

The proposed method aims at elevating the detection performance in multiple-target environment, where the sea clutter samples are often contaminated by the interfering target pixels, the azimuth ambiguities, and the breakwater. As a consequence, the parameters used for statistical modeling are over-estimated, resulting in a degradation of the CFAR detection rate. Inspired by the traditional two-parameter CFAR (TP-CFAR) detector of Gaussian clutter, OR-CFAR designs an adaptive threshold-based clutter truncation method to eliminate the high-intensity outliers from the clutter samples in the local reference window, and the probability density function (PDF) of the sea clutter can be accurately modeled through the newly raised TMLE. Furthermore, the optimal truncation depth used for clutter truncation and PDF modeling is evaluated and selected properly to get the best detection results. The OR-CFAR greatly enhances the CFAR detection rate in multiple-target environment, and it is computationally simple and efficient, which has a great application value. The Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR data are used for experiments to show the better detection performance of OR-CFAR.},

Specifically, when CAVs travel along an arterial corridor with signalized intersections, they can not only be driven automatically using pre-designed control models but can also communicate with other CAVs and the roadside infrastructure. In this paper, we describe a cooperative eco-driving (CED) system targeted for signalized corridors, focusing on how the penetration rate of CAVs affects the energy efficiency of the traffic network. In particular, we propose a role transition protocol for CAVs to switch between a leader and following vehicles in a string. Longitudinal control models are developed for conventional vehicles in the network and for different CAVs based on their roles and distances to intersections. A microscopic traffic simulation evaluation has been conducted using PTV VISSIM with realistic traffic data collected for the City of Riverside, CA, USA. The effects on traffic mobility are evaluated, and the environmental benefits are analyzed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) model. The simulation results indicate that the energy consumption and pollutant emissions of the proposed system decrease, as the penetration rate of CAVs increases. Specifically, more than 7% reduction on energy consumption and up to 59% reduction on pollutant emission can be achieved when all vehicles in the proposed system are CAVs.},

The framework consists of two phases, i.e., online trajectory mapping and trajectory compression. In the phase of online trajectory mapping, we develop a light-weighted yet efficient map matcher, namely, Spatial-Directional Matching (SD-Matching), to align the noisy and sparse GPS points upon the underlying road network, which fully explores the usage of vehicle heading direction collected from the GPS trajectory data. In the phase of online trajectory compression, we propose a novel compressor based on the heading change at intersections, namely, Heading Change Compression (HCC), aiming at finding a concise and compact trajectory representation. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework using real-world datasets in the city of Beijing, China. We further deploy the system in the real world in the city of Chongqing, China. The experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the SD-Matching algorithm achieves a higher mean accuracy but consumes less time than the state-of-the-art algorithm, namely, Spatial-Temporal Matching (ST-Matching) and 2) the HCC algorithm also outperforms baselines in trading-off compression ratio and computation time.},

  abstract     = {Identifying the structure of cities has long been studied in urban planning and traffic modeling. This study presents a reliable method that reveals the structure of cities mainly based on clustering analysis using a new similarity measure. Several previous studies have used well-known clustering algorithms in machine learning fields, such as &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -means clustering based on temporal mobility patterns of regions, whereas other studies have applied community detection algorithms on networks that depict traffic flows. However, the former does not reflect spatial interactions among places or areas, and the latter groups’ places or areas with different land uses into the same cluster. To address these issues in existing approaches, this study proposes a new similarity method that considers not only temporal mobility patterns of areas but also spatial interactions with other areas. Moreover, the study combines spectral clustering repeated several times with hierarchical clustering to obtain a reliable structure that keeps the contiguity of clusters and determine the hierarchy of different areal units. The application of the proposed method to the data for Seoul, South Korea, reveals that the proposed clustering process divides a city into relatively homogeneous areas in terms of land uses. The flow maps based on the clustering results also revealed the spatial interactions between different areas and identify the polycentric structure of Seoul.},

The delivery plan needs to simultaneously minimize the total traveling cost and balance the profits among all transport companies. This transportation practice engenders a new variant of vehicle routing problems, called the vehicle routing problem with outsourcing and profit balancing (VRPOPB). The profits are balanced by maximizing the minimum unit profit of all transport companies, which can effectively avoid the occurrence of distorted solutions. We develop two multi-objective local search (MOLS) algorithms for the problem, where the second one enhances the first one by incorporating several additional techniques. To evaluate our algorithms, we conduct extensive experiments on 57 generated instances and a real case obtained from a food importer in Hong Kong. The computational results clearly demonstrate that our enhanced MOLS algorithm is able to achieve satisfactory solutions.},

  abstract     = {To accurately estimate freeway traffic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal cell-based model by taking traffic dynamics into account. High-fidelity vehicle trajectory data is used to construct a spatiotemporal traffic (ST) diagram and to calculate the exact CO 2 emissions of the traffic in the ST diagram. The factors impacting the CO 2 emissions in the ST diagram are selected and taken as model inputs. Firstand second-order regression models are employed to fit the exact CO 2 emissions. It is found that the relationship between complicated traffic dynamics and CO 2 emissions can be simply described by using a linear or nearly linear function; i.e., for larger cells (such as 90·150 sec·m) that are used to construct an ST diagram, a first-order regression model is able to well reflect the relationship, while for small cells (such as 30·50 sec·m) a second-order model is more accurate. To validate the proposed model, another trajectory dataset that was collected in a different freeway segment is introduced, and the transferability and predictability of the model are demonstrated. The proposed spatiotemporal cell-based model allows us to accurately estimate CO 2 emissions by inputting the prevailing ST diagram. It opens a gate for estimating CO 2 emissions from widely available low-fidelity traffic data, since the ST diagram can be constructed by using various traffic flow data, such as loop detector data and floating car data.},

Ensemble learning has been widely recognized for its powerful generalization capability, high accuracy, and rapid convergence. However, applying the ensemble learning approach to steering detection of the smartphone-based vehicle entails many challenges due to the limitation of smartphone storage, the constraint on power consumption, and the requirement of being real-time. To address these challenges, we propose a series of techniques to reduce the complexity of the model and energy consumption, while at the same time maintaining high detection accuracy. The performance of the proposed system has been demonstrated using a real dataset and can achieve an accuracy of 97.37%.

  abstract     = {One of the fundamental challenges in the design of perception systems for autonomous vehicles is validating the performance of each algorithm under a comprehensive variety of operating conditions. In the case of vision-based semantic segmentation, there are known issues when encountering new scenarios that are sufficiently different to the training data. In addition, even small variations in environmental conditions, such as illumination and precipitation, can affect the classification performance of the segmentation model. Given the reliance on visual information, these effects often translate into poor semantic pixel classification which can potentially lead to catastrophic consequences when driving autonomously. This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the robustness of semantic segmentation models and provides a number of metrics to evaluate the classification performance over a variety of environmental conditions. The process incorporates an additional sensor (lidar) to automate the process and improve the system integrity, eliminating the need for labor-intensive hand labeling of validation data. The experimental results are presented based on multiple datasets collected at different times of the year with different environmental conditions. We extract the ”Road” class using the lidar to demonstrate the concepts, but this could be extended to other classes with different feature detection algorithms. These results show that the semantic segmentation performance varies depending on the weather, camera parameters, and existence of shadows. The results also demonstrate how the metrics can be used to compare and validate the performance after making improvements to a model, and compare the performance of different networks.},

This paper presents a novel triple-channel deep IO network architecture based on the physical and mathematical models of IMUs. The proposed method simulates the noise model in the training phase and becomes robust to noise during testing. Besides, the proposed network architecture also considers the time interval between two consecutive IMU readings (sampling time) so that it is robust to the change of IMU frequency and the missing of IMU information. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work reviewing and analyzing the existing IO methods used by the deep-learning-based visual-IO approaches. The proposed network architecture outperforms all the existing solutions on the IMU readings of the challenging Micro Aerial Vehicle dataset and improves the accuracy by approximately 25%.},

  abstract     = {Transit signal priority (TSP) is an effective strategy to control bus schedule adherence, increase ride comfort, and, in turn, reduce fuel consumption. However, its provision may cause negative externalities on general traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate how coordinated in-vehicle driver advisory systems (DASs) can partly reduce the signal priority control requests. Such cooperative solution, enabled by the connectivity between vehicles and the signal control system, allows combining signal adjustments with dwelling and speed advisories. We show that combining in-vehicle advisory with signal priority can reduce stops at signals, decrease trip time when compared with TSP used alone and, in some case, achieve the same performance without resorting to TSP. In addition, we demonstrate that DASs used alone have marginal impact on trip times, hence can be applied unconditionally. A simulation-based analysis indicates that the effectiveness of a control strategy-or a combination of different strategies-depends on the bus stop placement. When it comes to reduction of stop frequency at traffic signals, speed and dwell time advisories used together deliver similar performance to an unconditional TSP with green signal extensions and recalls lasting up to 10 s.},

This is mainly due to the deviation in departure time and aircraft speed from their scheduled values. This may lead to the arrival of aircraft to certain routes at unscheduled times, causing an unexpected demand on those routes. The uncertainty of demand creates several difficulties in air transportation systems, including higher workloads for air traffic controllers, higher delays, travel costs, as well as safety risk. In this study, we propose a robust flight routing and scheduling scheme while considering both departure and speed uncertainty present in the air traffic network. Following robust optimization, we ensure that the capacity violations are eliminated from the system. The ATFM problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) problem with the objective of minimizing expected total delay of the system while maintaining required in-trail separation between aircraft even under uncertainty. In addition, we use an optimal flight level assignment method and speed assignment strategy to minimize the system delay and to fully utilize the system capacity. Furthermore, a greedy strategy with parallel computation is presented with the problem decomposed into a set of maximum independent sets to reduce the computational complexity in solving large-scale ATFM problems.

It has an hierarchical closed-loop architecture for driver-vehicle control systems, including structures and contact interfaces of human and vehicle bodies. HuMADS is based on the OpenSim simulation platform. The developed system regulates the human model dynamics, such that the human model can react realistically to vehicle maneuver motions. The usability of the HuMADS is demonstrated through the simulation of coordinated gas/brake pedal operation and wheel-steering in highway driving tasks. The simulated vehicle dynamics and vehicle maneuvers are comparable with previously published experimental data of car-following driving. In addition, the proposed controllers successfully maintain the human body’s balance inside the vehicle during vehicle maneuvers. We are convinced that the HuMADS has potential as a tool for the development of intelligent transportation systems and investigation of integrated safety.},

The stability of the proposed car-following model is analyzed using the perturbation method. In addition, a nonlinear consensus-based longitudinal control algorithm is designed by considering the interactions between CVs, and an artificial function-based lateral control algorithm is presented. The convergence of the longitudinal and lateral control algorithms is analyzed using the Hurwitz stable theorem and Lyapunov technique, respectively. Also, the string stability of the vehicular platoon is performed based on the infinity-norm method. Finally, field experiments are conducted using four CVs under the scenarios of platoon forming, vehicle merging, and vehicle diverging. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the trajectory and velocity profiles.},

First, the points covering the road surface are extracted using the voxel-based upward growing and the improved region growing. Then, lane markings are extracted and identified according to the multi-thresholding and the geometric filtering. Finally, transition lines are generated through a combination of the lane node structure generation algorithm and the cubic Catmull-Rom spline algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that transition lines can be successfully generated for both T- and cross-intersections with promising accuracy. In the validation of lane marking extraction using the manually interpreted lane marking points, the method can achieve average precision, recall, and F1-score of 90.80%, 92.07%, and 91.43%, respectively. The success rate of transition line generation is 96.5%. Furthermore, the buffer-overlay-statistics (BOS) method validates that the proposed method can generate lane centerlines and transition lines within 20-cm-level localization accuracy from the MLS point clouds.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides a critical review on the state-of-the-art pedestrian and evacuation dynamics so as to comprehensively comprehend the motion behaviors of pedestrians from observations to simulation aspects. Types of typical data collection methods, namely the field survey, the controlled experiment, and the animal experiment, are classified, and the connections and differences of these three observation methods are explored. Pedestrians&#39; complex behaviors characterized by the self-organization phenomena and movement data characterized by the fundamental diagram are then studied after the data collections, which can be used to calibrate and validate the pedestrian models. The mathematical models for pedestrian dynamics from both tactical level and operational level are also highlighted. The simulation data produced by the mathematical models could further reproduce pedestrian behaviors during the observations and contribute to decision makings for improving the evacuation efficiency. The applications of pedestrian models for behavior analysis, evacuation simulation, and layout design are also presented. Some challenges and future directions in the pedestrian and evacuation dynamics are also put forward. Findings presented in this study are helpful for researchers who want to understand the pedestrian and evacuation dynamics and to perform further research in this field.},

  abstract     = {Self-driving vehicles will soon be a reality, as main automotive companies have announced that they will sell their driving automation modes in the 2020s. This technology raises relevant controversies, especially with recent deadly accidents. Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are still popular and attractive thanks to the improvement they represent to people&#39;s way of life (safer and quicker transit, more accessible, comfortable, convenient, efficient, and environment-friendly). This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques over the last decade with a focus on highway planning. In the context of this article, motion planning denotes path generation and decision making. Highway situations limit the problem to high speed and small curvature roads, with specific driver rules, under a constrained environment framework. Lane change, obstacle avoidance, car following, and merging are the situations addressed in this paper. After a brief introduction to the context of autonomous ground vehicles, the detailed conditions for motion planning are described. The main algorithms in motion planning, their features, and their applications to highway driving are reviewed, along with current and future challenges and open issues.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a concept, herein called Combined Alternate-Direction Lane Assignment and Reservation-based Intersection Control (CADLARIC), for organizing directionally unrestricted traffic flows in automated vehicle environment. In the proposed concept, vehicles can use lanes traditionally reserved for the opposite direction of travel. This concept allows left and right turning vehicles to align themselves in an appropriate lane before reaching the downstream intersection, so that they can smoothly go through the intersection without having any conflicts with vehicles from the other movements. Conflicts between through movements are handled by a reservation-based algorithm. To simulate the proposed concept, i.e. allow flexibility of such driving maneuvers that cannot be accomplished in the other existing simulation tools, a new microsimulation platform is developed. The proposed CADLARIC control scheme is evaluated through a comparison with a conventional fixed-time signal control and Fully Reservation-Based Intersection Control (FRIC). The results show that CADLARIC: (i) significantly outperforms other control methods in terms of the traffic performance (i.e. delays and stops); and (ii) generates a reduction of conflicting situations at the network level when compared to FRIC.},

The controller combines a rule-based holding criterion with a cooperative intelligent transportation systems based strategy, namely green light optimal dwell time adaptation (GLODTA), which exploits signal phase and timing information to modify dwell times at stops. In order to address the bi-objective criterion, holding control is integrated with transit signal priority (TSP) and an additional driving advisory system, which adjusts speed to reduce stopping at signals. The different controllers are evaluated using simulation of major bus line in Luxembourg City. The results show that buses are efficiently operated without necessarily providing additional priority via TSP, hence without negatively affecting the capacity of the private vehicles system. The new controller improves further the performance in terms of regularity and reduces the number of stops at traffic lights.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose the Road Data Enrichment (RoDE), a framework that fuses data from heterogeneous data sources to enhance Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) services, such as vehicle routing and traffic event detection. We describe RoDE through two services: (i) Route service, and (ii) Event service. For the first service, we present the Twitter MAPS (T-MAPS), a low-cost spatiotemporal model to improve the description of traffic conditions through Location-Based Social Media (LBSM) data. As a case study, we explain how T-MAPS is able to enhance routing and trajectory descriptions by using tweets. Our experiments compare T-MAPS&#39; routes against Google Maps&#39; routes, showing up to 62% of route similarity, even though T-MAPS uses fewer and coarse-grained data. We then propose three applications, Route Sentiment (RS), Route Information (RI), and Area Tags (AT), to enrich T-MAPS&#39; suggested routes. For the second service, we present the Twitter Incident (T-Incident), a low-cost learning-based road incident detection and enrichment approach built using heterogeneous data fusion. Our approach uses a learning-based model to identify patterns on social media data which is then used to describe a class of events, aiming to detect different types of events. Our model to detect events achieved scores above 90%, thus allowing incident detection and description as a RoDE application. As a result, the enriched event description allows ITS to better understand the LBSM user&#39;s viewpoint about traffic events (e.g., jams) and points of interest (e.g., restaurants, theaters, stadiums).},

The concept of spatial area occupancy and temporal area occupancy combined with back-pressure (SAO-BP and TAO-BP) control are appropriate for heterogeneous traffic in the absence of lane discipline. We conducted an extensive simulation study to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms using the Vissim-MATLAB simulation environment. Our results suggest that the proposed SAO-BP and TAO-BP control algorithms significantly improve the performance of traffic network compared with vehicle actuated control and aggregated queue-based back-pressure control deployed on the same network.},

  abstract     = {The increase in traffic volumes in urban areas makes network delay and capacity optimisation challenging. However, the introduction of connected vehicles in intelligent transport systems presents unique opportunities for improving traffic flow and reducing delays in urban areas. This paper proposes a novel traffic signal control algorithm called Multi-mode Adaptive Traffic Signals (MATS) which combines position information from connected vehicles with data obtained from existing inductive loops and signal timing plans in the network to perform decentralised traffic signal control at urban intersections. The MATS algorithm is capable of adapting to scenarios with low numbers of connected vehicles, an area where existing traffic signal control strategies for connected environments are limited. Additionally, a framework for testing connected traffic signal controllers based on a large urban road network in the city of Birmingham (UK) is presented. The MATS algorithm is compared with MOVA on a single intersection, and a calibrated TRANSYT plan on the proposed testing framework. The results show that the MATS algorithm offers reductions in mean delay up to 28% over MOVA, and reductions in mean delay and mean numbers of stops of up to 96% and 33% respectively over TRANSYT, for networks with 0-100% connected vehicle presence. The MATS algorithm is also shown to be robust under non-ideal communication channel conditions, and when heavy traffic demand prevails on the road network.},

State equations reflect the simple vehicle kinematics for position and speed, with the acceleration acting as a control input. Initial and final states (position and speed) are fixed. For the fuel consumption estimation, a number of alternatives are employed. To start with, a realistic, but nonlinear and non-smooth formula from the literature is considered. Simple smoothing procedures are then applied to enable the application of powerful numerical algorithms for the efficient solution of the resulting nonlinear optimal control problem. Furthermore, simpler quadratic approximations of the nonlinear formula are also considered, which enable analytical problem solutions. A comprehensive comparison on the basis of various driving scenarios demonstrates that the often utilized, but sometimes strongly questioned, square-of-acceleration term delivers excellent approximations for fuel minimizing trajectories in the present setting. A GLOSA (Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory) approach, based on the analytical solution of an optimal control problem is also presented.},

Previous theoretical work has provided provable performance guarantees in terms of stability, and throughput optimality of the GPA controller in a continuous averaged dynamical queueing network model. In this paper, we first provide and implement two discretized versions of the GPA controller in the SUMO micro simulator. We then compare, in an artificial Manhattan-like grid, the performance of the GPA controller with those of the MaxPressure controller, which is another distributed feedback controller that requires more information than the GPA. Finally, to show that the GPA controller is easily implementable in a real-world scenario, we apply it to a previously published realistic traffic scenario for the city of Luxembourg and compare its performance with the static controller provided with the scenario as well as with the cyclic MaxPressure controller. The simulations show that the GPA controller outperforms both the fixed time and the cyclic MaxPressure controllers for the Luxembourg scenario, and behaves better than the MaxPressure pressure controller in the Manhattan-grid when the demands are low.},

  abstract     = {The expansion of road infrastructure, in spite of increasing congestion levels, faces severe restrictions from all sorts: economical, environmental, social, or technical. An efficient and, usually, less expensive alternative to improve mobility and the use of available infrastructure is the adoption of traffic management. A particular case of interest occurs when inbound and outbound traffic on a given facility is unbalanced throughout the day. This scenario may benefit of a lane management strategy called tidal flow (or reversible) lane control, in which case the direction of one or more contraflow buffer lanes is reversed according to the needs of each direction. This paper proposes a simple and practical real-time strategy for efficient motorway tidal flow lane control. A state-feedback switching policy based on the triangular fundamental diagram, that requires only aggregated measurements of density, is adopted. A theoretical analysis based on the kinematic wave theory shows that the strategy provides a Pareto-optimal solution. Microsimulations using empirical data from the A38(M) Aston Expressway in Birmingham, UK, are used to demonstrate the operation of the proposed strategy. The robustness of the switching policy to parameter variations is demonstrated by parametric sensitivity analysis. Simulation results confirm an increase of motorway throughput and a smooth operation for the simulated scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Road vehicles are characterized by increasing levels of automation and it is vital to understand the future impact on transport efficiency. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is one of the first and most common automated functionalities available in privately owned vehicles. The effect of ACC on traffic flow has been widely studied by making assumptions on its operating strategy and on some of its important parameters such as the response time and the desired time headway. In the literature, these parameters are usually set to low values, based on the vehicle controller&#39;s theoretical ability to respond within a very short time frame. Response time is known to be an important parameter in defining the capacity of the road and therefore, assuming a very short response time, studies usually conclude that systems like the ACC will contribute increasing the road capacity significantly. The present study aims at measuring the actual response time of an ACC-enabled vehicle in car-following conditions. A new methodology for the estimation of the controller&#39;s response time and the desired time-gap was developed to this objective. Results show that the response time of the particular ACC controller was in the range 0.8s-1.2s, which is similar to what is commonly assumed for human drivers. In this light, the results of the present study question the common assumption that ACC or other automation technologies necessarily improve traffic flow and increase road capacity.},

  abstract     = {Current Urban Traffic Control (UTC) systems rely heavily on inductive loop detectors. The emergence of Connected Vehicles (CV) opens new possibilities for improving signal control, while reducing the need for loop detectors. However, for low penetration rates, the CV measurements are sporadic and thus difficult to exploit by existing UTC systems. In this paper, a methodology that enables cycle-to-cycle traffic state estimation and prediction based on limited CV measurements is presented. Furthermore, the proposed formulation enables fusion of CV with other data sources and their integration in any UTC system. The developed Extended Observer (EO) is a discrete-time, variable-dimension implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter. It does not require loop detectors and is independent of the type of signal control. The evaluation focuses on the queue length estimation. Especially in oversaturation, the EO outperforms the CV measurements for all examined penetration rates. Moreover, the highest benefit is observed for the lowest penetration rates. The results show that for oversaturation and low penetration rates the EO improves the CV measurements 13-31%. In addition, the EO is tested with an adaptive UTC system by feeding the fused estimation from CV and camera measurements. The error in queue length estimation from the EO is significantly lower than the error based on stochastic arrivals. Additionally, the results show a reduction in delays at the examined signal and the complete intersection. Overall, this paper sheds light on the potential benefits from enhancing limited CV measurements in order to contribute immediately to current UTC systems.},

  abstract     = {Precise vehicle positioning is a key element for the development of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). In this context, we present a distributed processing technique to augment the performance of conventional Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) exploiting Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication systems. We propose a method, referred to as Implicit Cooperative Positioning with Data Association (ICP-DA), where the connected vehicles detect a set of passive features in the driving environment, solve the association task by pairing them with on-board sensor measurements and cooperatively localize the features to enhance the GNSS accuracy. We adopt a belief propagation algorithm to distribute the processing over the network, and solve both the data association and localization problems locally at vehicles. Numerical results on realistic traffic networks show that the ICP-DA method is able to significantly outperform the conventional GNSS. In particular, the analysis on a real urban road infrastructure highlights the robustness of the proposed method in real-life cases where the interactions among vehicles evolve over space and time according to traffic regulation mechanisms. Performances are investigated both in conventional traffic-light regulated scenarios and self-regulated environments (as representative of future automated driving scenarios) where vehicles autonomously cross the intersections taking gap-availability decisions for avoiding collisions. The analysis shows how the mutual coordination in platoons of vehicles eases the cooperation process and increases the positioning performance.},

  abstract     = {Calibration and validation have long been a significant topic in traffic model development. In fact, when moving to dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models, the need to dynamically update the demand and supply components creates a considerable burden on the existing calibration algorithms, often rendering them impractical. These calibration approaches are mostly restricted either due to non-linearity or increasing problem dimensionality. Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) has been proposed for the DTA model calibration, with encouraging results, for more than a decade. However, it often fails to converge reasonably with the increase in problem size and complexity. In this paper, we combine SPSA with principal components analysis (PCA) to form a new algorithm, we call, PC–SPSA. The PCA limits the search area of SPSA within the structural relationships captured from historical estimates in lower dimensions, reducing the problem size and complexity. We formulate the algorithm, demonstrate its operation, and explore its performance using an urban network of Vitoria, Spain. The practical issues that emerge from the scale of different variables and bounding their values are also analyzed through a sensitivity analysis using a non-linear synthetic function.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach using parallel data and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enhance traffic data imputation. Parallel data is a recently proposed method of using synthetic and real data for data mining and data-driven process, in which we apply GANs to generate synthetic traffic data. As it is difficult for the standard GAN algorithm to generate time-dependent traffic flow data, we made twofold modifications: 1) using the real data or the corrupted ones instead of random vectors as latent codes to generator within GANs and 2) introducing a representation loss to measure discrepancy between the synthetic data and the real data. The experimental results on a real traffic dataset demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of traffic data imputation.},

These Siamese trackers share a similar framework in which each tracker consists of two network branches for exploring semantic information. However, the performance of Siamese trackers is limited by an insufficient semantic template and an unsatisfactory updating strategy. To tackle these problems, we propose a manifold Siamese network for visual tracking that can simultaneously utilize semantic and geometric information. A manifold sample pool is constructed to exploit the manifold structure of image object sequences. This sample pool is dynamically learned via a fast Gaussian mixture model (GMM). After obtaining a manifold sample template, we design a deep architecture based on a correlation filter (CF) network and append a novel manifold feature branch. The network remains fully convolutional and can train a template to discriminate exemplar image and arbitrarily size search image. Then, a triplet occlusion score function cooperates with an effective update method that is established to prevent model drift. Extensive experiments show that the proposed tracking algorithm performs favorably compared with the state-of-the-art methods on three standard benchmark datasets at a high framerate, which is very suitable for autonomous driving.},

Unlike the dynamical system model, where bottleneck delays need to be intentionally constructed to yield the equilibrium flow vector and green-time proportion vector, we propose a novel control policy to fill the gap by only adjusting the green-time proportion vector. We derive a sufficient condition for the existence of equilibrium of the dynamical system under the mild constraints that 1) the travel cost function and stage pressure function should be continuous functions and 2) the flow and green-time proportion swap processes project all flow and green-time proportion vectors on the boundary of the feasible region onto itself. We derive the condition of unique equilibrium for fixed green-time proportion vector and show that with varying green-time proportion vector, the set of equilibria is a compact, non-convex set, and with the same partial derivative of travel cost function with respect to the flow and green-time proportion vectors. Finally, we prove the stability of the proposed dynamical system by using Lyapunov stability analysis.},

In this paper, we propose three enhancements for CNN-based visual object detection for ADAS. To address the large object scale variation challenge, deconvolution and fusion of CNN feature maps are proposed to add context and deeper features for better object detection at low feature map scales. In addition, soft non-maximal suppression (NMS) is applied across object proposals at different feature scales to address the object occlusion challenge. As the cars and pedestrians have distinct aspect ratio features, we measure their aspect ratio statistics and exploit them to set anchor boxes properly for better object matching and localization. The proposed CNN enhancements are evaluated with various image input sizes by experiments over KITTI dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements with good detection performance over KITTI test set.},

Unlike existing methods, our method aims to detect and recognize obstacles on the road rather than all the obstacles in the view. The proposed method involves two stages aiming at an increased quality of the results. The first stage is to locate the positions of obstacles on the road. In order to accurately locate the on-road obstacles, we propose an obstacle detection method based on the U-V disparity map generated from a stereo vision system. The proposed U-V disparity algorithm makes use of the V-disparity map that provides a good representation of the geometric content of the road region to extract the road features, and then detects the on-road obstacles using our proposed realistic U-disparity map that eliminates the foreshortening effects caused by the perspective projection of pinhole imaging. The proposed realistic U-disparity map greatly improves the detection accuracy of the distant obstacles compared with the conventional U-disparity map. Second, the detection results of our proposed U-V disparity algorithm are put into a context-aware Faster-RCNN that combines the interior and contextual features to improve the recognition accuracy of small and occluded obstacles. Specifically, we propose a context-aware module and apply it into the architecture of Faster-RCNN. The experimental results on two public datasets show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance under various driving conditions.},

This paper presents new methods within each framework and assesses their respective abilities to reconstruct signals, with the particular emphasis on sparse recovery, ability to incorporate prior information, and scalability. We then apply these methods to route flow estimation in traffic networks of various sizes and network topologies. We find that both compressed sensing and Bayesian inference approaches are appropriate for structured recovery but have scalability limitations. The convex optimization approach does not directly incorporate prior information, but scales well and has been shown to achieve 90% route flow accuracy on a full-scale network of over 10 000 links and 280 000 routes on a synthetic benchmark based on the I-210 corridor near Los Angeles, CA, USA.},

The model was built using the FORTRAN programing language. It was developed based on car-following, discretionary lane changing, mandatory lane changing, gap acceptance and narrow lanes rules. Data from four sources (including data taken from different UK motorway sites) were collected and analyzed. The data were used in the verification, calibration and validation processes of the model. Observations from motorway roadwork sites with the narrow lanes scheme show certain prominent drivers&#39; behaviors, namely avoiding passing HGVs traveling on adjacent lanes and lane repositioning before passing a HGV. Such behaviors were included in the modeling process which suggested that the presence of HGVs had a noticeable impact on reducing section capacity.},

  abstract     = {Pavement crack detection is a critical task for insuring road safety. Manual crack detection is extremely time-consuming. Therefore, an automatic road crack detection method is required to boost this progress. However, it remains a challenging task due to the intensity inhomogeneity of cracks and complexity of the background, e.g., the low contrast with surrounding pavements and possible shadows with a similar intensity. Inspired by recent advances of deep learning in computer vision, we propose a novel network architecture, named feature pyramid and hierarchical boosting network (FPHBN), for pavement crack detection. The proposed network integrates context information to low-level features for crack detection in a feature pyramid way, and it balances the contributions of both easy and hard samples to loss by nested sample reweighting in a hierarchical way during training. In addition, we propose a novel measurement for crack detection named average intersection over union (AIU). To demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the proposed method, we evaluate it on five crack datasets and compare it with the state-of-the-art crack detection, edge detection, and semantic segmentation methods. The extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms these methods in terms of accuracy and generalizability.

This paper presents a defender-attacker-defender model to analyze the potential impacts of intelligent attacks and worst case disruptions on the U.S. air transportation network, as well as possible protection steps that could be taken to minimize the negative outcomes of such disruptions. Furthermore, to analyze the effects of intermodal connections on the resilience of the air network, a second layer representing a hypothetical bus network is added to the model and studied. We use these models, supported by publicly available data, to identify routes likely to be attacked by intelligent adversaries and those critical to the resilient operation of the air network in such scenarios.

This paper first comprehensively reviews the physical connectivity metrics and applies these metrics to evaluate the connectivity of China&#39;s high-speed railway system. Then, through integrating the real-world network topology and travel demand data, we conduct the first data-driven research on comparing the physical connectivity with the logical connectivity of railway systems. The experiments demonstrate that the physical connectivity metrics cannot well represent the connectivity of railway systems, due to the neglect of the heterogeneous distribution and temporal patterns of the passenger flows.},

Then, based on the car-calling demand data from Didi Chuxing, Chengdu, China, and taxi demand data from the New York City, the numerical results show that the MTL-TCNN outperforms both classic methods (i.e., historical average (HA), v -support vector machine ( v -SVM), and XGBoost) and the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches [e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM)] in both the single task learning (STL) and multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios.

Recent advances in deep learning algorithms have motivated researchers to use neural networks to perform this task. In this paper, we look at traffic sign detection as an image segmentation problem and propose a deep convolutional neural network-based approach to solve it. To this end, we propose a new network, the SegU-Net, which we form by merging the state-of-the-art segmentation architectures-SegNet and U-Net to detect traffic signs from video sequences. For training the network, we use the Tversky loss function constrained by an L1 term instead of the intersection over union loss traditionally used to train segmentation networks. We use a separate network, inspired by the VGG-16 architecture, to classify the detected signs. The networks are trained on the challenge free sequences of the CURE-TSD dataset. Our proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art object detection networks, such as the Faster R-CNN inception Resnet V2 and R-FCN Resnet 101, by a large margin and obtains a precision and recall of 94.60% and 80.21%, respectively, which is the current state of the art on this part of the dataset. In addition, the network is tested on the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) dataset, where it achieves a precision and recall of 95.29% and 89.01%, respectively. This is on a par with the performance of the aforementioned object detection networks. These results prove the generalizability of the proposed architecture and its suitability for robust traffic sign detection in autonomous vehicles.},

This information can be used to support traffic signal timing optimization in real time. A dynamic predictive traffic signal control framework for isolated intersections is proposed in a cross-sectional VII environment, which has the ability to predict vehicle arrivals and use this to optimize traffic signals. The proposed dynamic predictive control framework includes a dynamic platoon dispersion model (DPDM) which uses the vehicles&#39; speed data from the cross-sectional VII environment, as opposed to traditional vehicle passing/existing data, to predict the arriving flow distribution at the downstream stop-line. Then, a dynamic programming algorithm based on the exhaustive optimization of phases (EOP) is proposed working in rolling optimization (RO) scheme with a 2s time horizon. The signal timings are continuously optimized by regarding the minimization of intersection delay as the optimization objective, and setting the green time duration of each phase as a constraint. In the end, the proposed dynamic predictive control framework is tested in a simulated cross-sectional VII environment and a case study carried out based on a real road network. The results show that the proposed framework can reduce the average delay and queue length by up to 33% and 35%, respectively, compared with the traditional full-actuated control.},

In this paper, a set of light-weight features is proposed to enhance the pedestrian detection performance when a small-medium scale of training data with low-resolution images is available. To address this issue, a difference matrix projection (DMP) is developed to compute aggregated multi-oriented pixel differences using global matrix operations. Both the pixel differences and aggregation are computed using global matrix projection to avoid the laborious iterative operations. We tested our method on the INRIA, Daimler Chrysler classification (Daimler-CB), NICTA, and Caltech Pedestrian datasets.

It provides an accurate and timely way to manage traffic-sign inventory with a minimal human effort. In the computer vision community, the recognition and detection of traffic signs are a well-researched problem. A vast majority of existing approaches perform well on traffic signs needed for advanced driver-assistance and autonomous systems. However, this represents a relatively small number of all traffic signs (around 50 categories out of several hundred) and performance on the remaining set of traffic signs, which are required to eliminate the manual labor in traffic-sign inventory management, remains an open question. In this paper, we address the issue of detecting and recognizing a large number of traffic-sign categories suitable for automating traffic-sign inventory management. We adopt a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach, the mask R-CNN, to address the full pipeline of detection and recognition with automatic end-to-end learning. We propose several improvements that are evaluated on the detection of traffic signs and result in an improved overall performance. This approach is applied to detection of 200 traffic-sign categories represented in our novel dataset. The results are reported on highly challenging traffic-sign categories that have not yet been considered in previous works. We provide comprehensive analysis of the deep learning method for the detection of traffic signs with a large intra-category appearance variation and show below 3% error rates with the proposed approach, which is sufficient for deployment in practical applications of the traffic-sign inventory management.},

In this paper, a self-learning approach is proposed, toward specifying a pedestrian detector for each video scene without any human annotation involved. Object locations in video frames are treated as latent variables and a progressive latent model (PLM) is proposed to solve such latent variables. The PLM is deployed as components of object discovery, object enforcement, and label propagation, which are used to learn the object locations in a progressive manner. With the difference of convex (DC) objective functions, PLM is optimized by a concave-convex programming algorithm. With specified network branches and loss functions, PLM is integrated with deep feature learning and optimized in an end-to-end manner. From the perspectives of convex regularization and error rate estimation, detailed optimization analysis and learning stability analysis of the proposed PLM are provided. The extensive experiments demonstrate that even without annotation involved the proposed self-learning approach outperforms weakly supervised learning approaches, while achieving comparable performance with transfer learning approaches.},

This is a critical component of autonomous vehicles or robots on the road for handling localization failures. In this paper, based on reduced dimension scan representations learned from neural networks, a solution to global localization is proposed by achieving place recognition first and then metric pose estimation in the global prior map. Specifically, we present a semi-handcrafted feature learning method for 3D Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds using artificial statistics and siamese network, which transforms the place recognition problem into a similarity modeling problem. Additionally, the sensor data using dimension reduced representations require less storage space and make the searching easier. With the learned representations by networks and the global poses, a prior map is built and used in the localization framework. In the localization step, position only observations obtained by place recognition are used in a particle filter algorithm to achieve precise pose estimation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our place recognition and localization approach, KITTI benchmark and our multi-session datasets are employed for comparison with other geometric-based algorithms. The results show that our system can achieve both high accuracy and efficiency for long-term autonomy.},

  abstract     = {Battery swapping stations (BSSs) present an alternative way of charging electric vehicles (EVs) that can lead toward a sustainable EV ecosystem. Although research focusing on the BSS strategies has been ongoing, the results are fragmented. Currently, an integrated way of considering stochastic EV station visits through planning and operations has not been fully investigated. To create comprehensive and resilient battery swapping stations, a two-stage optimization with recourse is proposed. In the planning stage, the investment for battery purchases is recommended even before the EV station visit uncertainties are made known. In the operation stage, the battery allocation decisions, such as charging, discharging, and swapping are then coordinated. To apply the recourse strategy in creating representative scenarios, the EV station visit distribution techniques are also proposed using a modified K-means clustering method. Aside from the sensitivity analysis made with swapping prices and charging intervals, the strategy comparisons with conventional strategies have also demonstrated the practicality of the BSS coordination to future electricity and transportation networks.},

The eccentricity vector of the intermediate orbits and the true anomalies corresponding to the impulsive points are chosen as the optimization variables. Based on the patched conic theory, candidate solution can be analytically derived, constraints are removed from the optimization model, and the original problem is converted to a parameter optimization problem. The only difficulty lies in the initialization because the number of optimization variables increases linearly with N, which can be very large. This is settled by a hybrid optimization algorithm that comprises two searching methods. The problem is solved first by an improved particle swarm optimization method and, then, by an adaptive conjugate gradient method. The proposed method is adaptive to problems with any finite N and can calculate the optimal N in any transfer scenarios. The simulation validates the proposed method with some well-known cases and demonstrates its adaptation to N.},

Considering the situation of path overlapping between selected routes in the process of customer-searching, a mixed path size logit (MPSL) model is proposed to analyze route choice behaviors through considering spatio-temporal features of route including customer generation rate, path travel time, cumulative intersection delay, path distance, and path size. Specially, customer generation rate is defined as attraction strength based on historical pick-up records in the route, the intersection travel delay and path travel time are estimated based on large scaled taxi global positioning system (GPS) trajectories. In the experiment, the GPS data were collected from about 36000 taxi vehicles in Beijing at 30-s interval during six months. In the model application, an area of approximately 10 square kilometers in the center of Beijing is selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results indicated that the MPSL model could effectively analyze the route choice behavior in customer-searching process and express higher accuracy than traditional multinomial logit model and basic PSL model.},

To overcome the error magnification phenomena of traditional combination methods and to improve prediction performance, this paper proposes an improved Bayesian combination model with deep learning (IBCM-DL) for traffic flow prediction. First, an IBCM framework is established based on the new BCM framework proposed by Wang. Then, correlation analysis is used to analyze the relevance between the historical traffic flow and the traffic flow within the current interval. Three sub-predictors including the gated recurrent unit neural network (GRUNN), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) are incorporated into the IBCM framework to take advantage of each method. The real-world traffic volume data captured by microwave sensors located on the expressways of Beijing was used to validate the proposed model in multiple scenarios. The overall results illustrate that the IBCM-DL model outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and stability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the problem of integrated berth and quay crane allocation (I-BCAP) in general seaport container terminals and propose the model predictive allocation (MPA) algorithm and preconditioning methods for solving the I-BCAP. First, we propose a dynamical modeling framework based on discrete-event systems (DESs), which describes the operation of a berthing process with multiple discrete berthing positions and multiple quay cranes. Second, based on the discrete-event model, we propose the MPA algorithm for solving the I-BCAP using the model predictive control (MPC) principle with a rolling event horizon. The validation and performance evaluation of the proposed modeling framework and allocation method are done using: 1) extensive Monte Carlo simulations with realistically generated datasets; 2) real dataset from a container terminal in Tanjung Priuk port, located in Jakarta, Indonesia; and 3) real life field experiment at the aforementioned container terminal. The numerical simulation results show that our proposed MPA algorithm can improve the efficiency of the process where the total handling and waiting cost is reduced by approximately 6%–9% in comparison with the commonly adapted method of first-come first-served (FCFS) (for the berthing process) combined with the density-based quay cranes allocation (DBQA) strategy. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO)-based and genetic algorithm (GA)-based method proposed in the recent literature. The real life field experiment shows an improvement of about 6% in comparison with the existing allocation method used in the terminal.},

The main contribution of this paper consists in decomposing the GP regression into spatial zones, where quasi-constant velocity models are valid. Such obtained models are employed to build a set of Kalman filters that encode observed vehicle&#39;s dynamics. This paper shows how proposed filters enable the online identification of abnormal motions. Detected abnormalities can be modeled and learned incrementally, automatically by intelligent systems. The proposed methodology is tested on real data produced by a vehicle that interacts with pedestrians in a closed environment. Automatic detection of abnormal motions benefits the traffic scene understanding and facilitates to close the gap between human driving and autonomous vehicle awareness.},

  abstract     = {Public transport buses have uncertainties associated with its arrival/travel times, due to several factors such as signals, dwell times at bus stops, seasonal variations, fluctuating travel demands, and so on. In the developing world, these uncertainties are further magnified by the presence of excess vehicles, diverse modes of transport, and acute lack of lane discipline. Hence, the problem of bus arrival time prediction continues to be a challenging one especially in developing countries. This paper proposes a new methodology for bus arrival time prediction in real time. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed method explicitly learns the spatial (and temporal) correlations/patterns of traffic in a novel fashion. Specifically, it first detects the unknown order of spatial dependence and then learns linear, non-stationary spatial correlations for this detected order. It learns temporal correlations between successive trips as a function of their time difference. To make the optimal prediction feasible, the learnt predictive model is rewritten in a suitable linear state-space form, and then, an appropriate Kalman filter (KF) is applied. The performance was evaluated with real field data and compared with existing methods.},

It consists in regularizing the problem using one camera to obtain vehicle class probabilities using a set of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and, then, uses the Gradient boosting-based classifier to fuse the continuous class probabilities with the discrete class labels obtained from the OS.

In this paper, however, it has been shown that these benchmark figures for the original HOG-linear SVM detector grossly underestimate its true working potential. An improved SVM training methodology has been proposed that can make this important detector yield up to 14% lower miss rates than being currently reported on standard datasets. The proposed method accomplishes this by considering only a small set of the most relevant training examples and mitigating the class imbalance problem through manipulation of misclassification cost ratios. The second contribution of this work is the investigation of quantization errors which are induced when fast look-up table (LUT)-based kernel SVM classification is used. Based on the findings, a non-linear quantization scheme for the HOG features has been proposed to facilitate fast evaluation of kernel SVM resulting in up to 4% further reduction in miss rates without incurring additional computational cost. Hence, the linear and kernel SVM-based detectors proposed in this paper not only serve as much more stringent benchmarks for pedestrian detection but also provide the practitioners with an improved training framework for similar detection tasks involving other features and objects. The retrained models have been publicly released and provide a much better replacement for those currently being shipped with OpenCV and MATLAB computer vision libraries.},

  abstract     = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to revolutionize the transportation industry, mainly through allowing for a real-time and seamless exchange of information between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Although connectivity and automation are projected to bring about a vast number of benefits, they can give rise to new challenges in terms of safety, security, and privacy. To navigate roadways, CAVs need to heavily rely on their sensor readings and the information received from other vehicles and roadside units. Hence, anomalous sensor readings caused by either malicious cyber attacks or faulty vehicle sensors can result in disruptive consequences and possibly lead to fatal crashes. As a result, before the mass implementation of CAVs, it is important to develop methodologies that can detect anomalies and identify their sources seamlessly and in real time. In this paper, we develop an anomaly detection approach through combining a deep learning method, namely convolutional neural network (CNN), with a well-established anomaly detection method, and Kalman filtering with a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\chi ^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -detector, to detect and identify anomalous behavior in CAVs. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the developed approach can detect anomalies and identify their sources with high accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score. In addition, this developed approach outperforms the anomaly detection and identification capabilities of both CNNs and Kalman filtering with a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\chi ^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -detector method alone. It is envisioned that this research will contribute to the development of safer and more resilient CAV systems that implement a holistic view toward intelligent transportation system (ITS) concepts.},

  abstract     = {Navigation of land or self-driving vehicles is essential for safe and accurate travel. The global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), such as global positioning system (GPS) are the primary sources of navigation information for such purpose. However, high-rise buildings in urban canyons block the GPS satellites signals. Alternatively, inertial navigation system (INS) is typically working as a backup. A reduced inertial sensor system (RISS) is used instead of the full INS to achieve the same purpose in land vehicles navigation with fewer sensors and computations. Unfortunately, the RISS solution drifts over time, but this can be mitigated when integrated with the GPS. However, the integration solution drifts in the case of GPS signal loss (outages). Therefore, the position errors grow especially during extended periods of GPS outages. Azimuth/heading angle is critical to keep the vehicle on the route. In this paper, an azimuth update estimated from a calibrated magnetometer is introduced to improve the accuracy of the overall system. A new approach is proposed for pre-processing the magnetometer data utilizing a discrete-cosine-transform (DCT)-based pre-filtering stage. The obtained azimuth is utilized in updating the RISS system during the whole trajectory and mainly during GPS outage periods. The proposed approach significantly decreases both the azimuth error and the position error growth rate when driving in urban canyons where the GPS signals are blocked. Finally, the proposed system was tested on a real road trajectory data for a metropolitan area. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the whole system improved, especially during the GPS outage periods.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new framework into future data-driven railway condition monitoring systems (RCM). For this purpose, we have proposed an edge processing unit that includes two main parts: a data classification model that classifies Internet of Things (IoT) data into maintenance-critical data (MCD) and maintenance-non-critical data (MNCD) and a data transmission unit that, based on the class of data, employs appropriate communication methods to transmit data to railway control centers. For the transmission of MNCD, we propose a travel pattern method that employs train stations as points of data offloading so that trains can deliver data as well as passengers at stations. The performance of our proposed solution is successfully validated via three various data sets under different operating conditions.},

In this paper, we concentrate on the modeling of multi-link small-scale fading (SSF) channels in high-speed train (HST) communication networks with distributed base stations according to the classical geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM). To appropriately describe a multi-link propagation scenario in the HST communication network, a novel geometrical model considering a line-of-sight component, a single-bounced one-ring model, and a double-bounced ellipse-ring model is proposed. Based on the proposed GBSM, the expression of multi-link channel impulse responses (CIRs) is obtained, and multi-link cross-correlation functions are derived and used for numerical analysis. In addition, realistic channel measurements are conducted in the existing HST long-term evolution (LTE) networks and multi-link CIRs are acquired using a time delay window-based partitioning scheme. Finally, the SSF cross-correlation coefficient is extracted by the multi-link channel data and is used to validate the utility of the proposed model.},

The proposed PD can operate in real time because all AKSVM computations are approximated via simple atomic operations.

For sea transport, this includes various aspects like human safety at sea and at port, and also environmental safety and sustainability. In heavy-traffic regions where the waters are congested and vessels sail very closely together, ensuring these safety needs can be challenging. In this paper, we leverage on the rich information transmitted through the automatic identification system (AIS) and propose, for the first time, an integrated simulation-optimization approach for real time collision avoidance. This enables capturing of stochastic dynamic behavior of vessels for better prediction and fast trajectory optimization for application in real time. Specifically, a realistic agent-based model is developed based on behavioral learning in a real-environment, and incorporated into a fast collision avoidance optimization model in real time to provide robust collision avoidance that is able to account for future stochastic consequences of the actions taken. To achieve this, we develop: 1) a vessel pattern recognition method that mines the rich AIS data to produce realistic trajectory models; 2) an agent-based simulation model to enhance future trajectory prediction; and 3) a fast surrogate-based sampling technique to generate collision avoidance maneuvers for vessel captains in real time. To illustrate the feasibility of the approach, we use the case of the Singapore strait, one of the busiest straits in the world.},

  abstract     = {Traffic data estimation plays an important role because traffic data often suffers from missing data problems, caused by a variety of reasons, i.e., temporary deployment of sensors, sensor malfunction and communication failure. Existing research on missing data estimation has mostly focused on using data-driven or model-driven models to estimate the missing data, and there is a lack of study on the achievable estimation accuracy and the conditions to achieve accurate missing data estimation. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits of missing traffic data estimation accuracy in urban networks using the spatial-temporal random effects model. We derive the squared flow error bound (SFEB) for the cases of the Fisher matrix being a singular and non-singular matrix, respectively. We show that the sufficient and necessary condition of the existence of an unbiased estimator is that the number of missing points is less than or equal to the rank of the Fisher matrix. For the case that no unbiased estimator can be found, we derive an inequality for the SPEB and show that the SFEB is readily determined by the covariance matrix of the unknown (missing) parameter vector, flow correlation between the unknown and the available data, and the sensor locations. Furthermore, we develop an optimal spatial-temporal Kriging estimator which is efficient in both cases where the causal relationship among available data points exists or does not exist. Our theoretical findings can be used to develop a sensor location optimization strategy to minimize the SFEB.},

Such measures direct travelers toward routes that benefit the road network. As such, some travelers need to act socially and take a detour. This paper explores the impacts on network performance and equity that result from the application of a social routing service. We complement the existing work by using a large-scale real-world road network, by assessing impacts on the individual level and by discussing our findings in the light of observed individual compliance behavior obtained from a field experiment. Our results show that 3.6% of total travel time within our road network could be reduced when all trips are made in compliance with the received advice. However, based on the observed compliance behavior, a social routing service is expected to direct only a minority of travelers toward social routes. We show how the attained travel time savings vary with the assumed compliance rate, e.g., to achieve 50% of the potential travel time savings, about 30% of travelers need to be willing to take a detour. Moreover, we find that lower the compliance among travelers, the more the social travelers need to compensate for the selfish behavior of others by taking longer detours. Finally, we demonstrate that the impacts on network performance and equity highly depend on the spatial distribution of social travelers among origins and destinations.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a multiobjective optimization approach for path planning of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). A unique feature of the technique is the unification of the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) with good seamanship’s practice along with hierarchical (rather than simultaneous) inclusion of objectives. The requirements of collision avoidance are formulated as mathematical inequalities and constraints in the optimization framework and thus collision-free manoeuvres and COLREGs-compliant behaviours are provided in a seafarer-like way. Specific expert knowledge is also taken into account when designing the multiobjective optimization algorithm. For example, good seamanship reveals that if allowed, an evasive manoeuvre with course changes is always preferred over one with speed changes in practical maritime navigation. As a result, a hierarchical sorting rule is designed to prioritize the objective of course/speed change preference over other objectives such as path length and path smoothness, and then incorporated into a specific evolutionary algorithm called hierarchical multiobjective particle swarm optimization (H-MOPSO) algorithm. The H-MOPSO algorithm solves the real-time path planning problem through finding solutions of the formulated optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed H-MOPSO algorithm is demonstrated through both desktop and high-fidelity networked bridge simulations.},

However, it is difficult to achieve high reliability in wireless medium as the transmission is vulnerable to various wave propagation issues. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing emergency message dissemination schemes in the literature, achieves a predefined reliability in lossy channel. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called reliable emergency message dissemination scheme (REMD), which achieves a predefined reliability for message dissemination while satisfying delay requirements, for various channel conditions. We aim to guarantee very high reliability (e.g., 99%) in each hop, with low control overhead while keeping low end-to-end latency for time-critical applications. We employ zero-correlated unipolar orthogonal codes to combat hidden terminal problem. We exploit periodic beacons, to accurately estimate reception quality of 802.11p wireless link in each cell; then, we use this information to determine the optimal number of broadcast repetitions in each hop. In addition, to ensure reliability in multi-hop, we utilize cooperative communication. The simulation results show that REMD outperforms the existing well-known schemes in the literature. Furthermore, REMD satisfies latency requirements for time-critical vehicular applications and has less network overhead than the existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Cycling is an increasingly popular mode of travel in cities, but its poor safety record currently acts as a hurdle to its wider adoption as a real alternative to the private car. A particular source of hazard appears to originate from the interaction of cyclists with motorized traffic at low speeds in urban areas. But while technological advances in recent years have resulted in numerous attempts at systems for preventing cyclist-vehicle collisions, these have generally encountered the challenge of accurate cyclist localization. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing an innovative bicycle localization algorithm, which is derived from the geometrical relationships and kinematics of bicycles. The algorithm relies on the measurement of a set of kinematic variables (such as yaw, roll, and steering angles) through low-cost on-board sensors. It then employs a set of Kalman filters to predict-correct the direction and position of the bicycle and fuse the measurements in order to improve positioning accuracy. The capabilities of the algorithm are then demonstrated through a real-world field experiment using an instrumented bicycle, called “iBike”, in an urban environment. The results show that the proposed fusion achieves considerably lower positioning errors than that would be achieved based on dead-reckoning alone, which makes the algorithm a credible basis for the development of future collision warning and avoidance systems.},

The IKF is similar to the distributed Kalman filter (DKF) in terms of architecture, method of representation of equations, and use of neighborhood weight matrix while IKF appears to be a general form of DKF. In this method, a network of IKF nodes is constructed such that each node is associated with every target. There are edges between nodes for which the corresponding targets have effect on each other. Time-varying weights are used to control the interaction information exchanged among IKF nodes. The method of calculating interaction weights in the weight matrix plays a key role on the estimation results.

A global navigation satellite system (GNSS) coupled with dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) links is a candidate for the localization system required for vehicular relative positioning. The vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) exchange of safety-related data such as raw GNSS measurements, as accurate and frequent as possible, via DSRC links allows the vehicular localization mechanism to maintain real-time relative positioning (RRP) vectors. However, V2V DSRC safety messages may include inaccurate positioning data or may fast become outdated, and/or DSRC links may occasionally fail due to various adverse scenarios including network overheads that drop the bandwidth of vehicular ad-hoc networks. Hence, each DSRC-enabled vehicle may not necessarily know the latest positioning data of neighboring vehicles. This calls upon reliable and accurate relative position prediction mechanisms to cover the DSRC-related deficiencies of relative positioning. This paper, at first, studies the benefits of a terrestrial communications system complementing DSRC-based V2V RRP and then considers position prediction techniques suitable for V2V RRP and examines a few existing solutions and makes a detailed comparison based on a set of required positioning performance parameters for vehicle safety application.},

  abstract     = {In order to reduce passenger delays and prevent severe overcrowding in the subway system, it is necessary to accurately predict the short-term passenger flow during special events. However, few studies have been conducted to predict the subway passenger flow under these conditions. Traditional methods, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, were commonly used to analyze regular traffic demands. These methods usually neglected the volatility (heteroscedasticity) in passenger flow influenced by unexpected external factors. This paper, therefore, proposed a generic framework to analyze short-term passenger flow, considering the dynamic volatility and nonlinearity of passenger flow during special events. Four different generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models, along with the ARIMA model, were used to model the mean and volatility of passenger flow based on the transit smart card data from two stations near the Olympic Sports Center, Nanjing, China. Multiple statistical methods were applied to evaluate the performance of the hybrid models. The results indicate that the volatility of passenger flow had significant nonlinear and asymmetric features during special events. The proposed framework could effectively capture the mean and volatility of passenger flow, and outperform the traditional methods in terms of accuracy and reliability. Overall, this paper can help transit agencies to better understand the deterministic and stochastic changes of the passenger flow, and implement precautionary countermeasures for large crowds in a subway station before and after special events.},

  abstract     = {Currently, there are many approaches for vehicle classification, but there is no specific study on automated, rear view, and video-based robust vehicle classification. The rear view is important for intelligent transportation systems since not all states in the United States require a frontal license plate on a vehicle. The classification of vehicles, from their rear views, is challenging since vehicles have only subtle appearance differences and there are changing illumination conditions and the presence of moving shadows. In this paper, we present a novel multi-class vehicle classification system that classifies a vehicle into one of four possible classes (sedan, minivan, SUV, and a pickup truck) from its rear view video, using physical and visual features. For a given geometric setup of the camera on highways, we make physical measurements on a vehicle. These measurements include visual rear ground clearance, the height of the vehicle, and the distance between the license plate and the rear bumper. We call these distances as the physical features. The visual features, also called appearance-based features, are extracted using convolutional neural networks from the input images. We achieve a classification accuracy of 93.22% and 91.52% using physical and visual features, respectively. Furthermore, we achieve a higher classification accuracy of 94.81% by fusing both the features together. The results are shown on a dataset consisting of 1831 rear view videos of vehicles and they are compared with various approaches, including deep learning techniques.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, and deep neural networks further enhance its learning power. However, the centralized RL is infeasible for large-scale ATSC due to the extremely high dimension of the joint action space. The multi-agent RL (MARL) overcomes the scalability issue by distributing the global control to each local RL agent, but it introduces new challenges: now, the environment becomes partially observable from the viewpoint of each local agent due to limited communication among agents. Most existing studies in MARL focus on designing efficient communication and coordination among traditional Q-learning agents. This paper presents, for the first time, a fully scalable and decentralized MARL algorithm for the state-of-the-art deep RL agent, advantage actor critic (A2C), within the context of ATSC. In particular, two methods are proposed to stabilize the learning procedure, by improving the observability and reducing the learning difficulty of each local agent. The proposed multi-agent A2C is compared against independent A2C and independent Q-learning algorithms, in both a large synthetic traffic grid and a large real-world traffic network of Monaco city, under simulated peak-hour traffic dynamics. The results demonstrate its optimality, robustness, and sample efficiency over the other state-of-the-art decentralized MARL algorithms.},

  abstract     = {For rail wear measurement, the process of profile registration is critical. Nowadays, the widely used method is the rail waist double circle segment method (DCS). However, this method may be invalid in actual applications because of the influence of the following two factors: one is the outliers mixed into profiles and the other is the profile diversity. The former induces the misalignment between the measured profile and the standard one, and the latter may destroy the integrity of rail waist, which makes that the measured profile cannot be matched with the standard one through DCS. To solve the two problems, a hybrid profile registration method is proposed in this paper. First, by locating new matching primitives to realize coarse registration, we check the profile integrity fast. Then, for complete profile, we rematch its original measured profile with the standard one finely based on DCS to detect and remove the outliers correctly. The efficiency and superiority of the proposed method were verified by numerous experiments. The results show that the average score of F1-Measure for outlier detection reaches 0.95, which outperforms some classical models obviously. Meanwhile, the result of the profile integrity check is also basically coincided with the real face of test zones. Furthermore, the system can run at a speed of 21.95 km/h under our experimental setup, which is far higher than that of the rail maintenance train (up to 5 km/h).},

This paper consists of two main parts: preceding vehicle state estimation and following vehicle controller. First, the prospective information of the preceding vehicle, such as position, velocity, and acceleration, can be derived through radar sensor, and the control force of the preceding vehicle can be transmitted to the following vehicles through V2V communication. A Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model is then utilized to estimate the preceding vehicle model, and the predicted state sequence of the preceding vehicle can be obtained. Second, based on these predicted data, the following vehicle is controlled by the proposed ANFPC scheme to maintain each vehicle within the desired distance headway and thus achieve string stability of vehicle platooning and fuel efficiency. The experimental results on the CarSim environment show that the proposed control strategy for the CACC system can significantly reduce the fuel consumption while ensuring driving comfort and safety.},

  abstract     = {Determining safe and fast routes for first responders is an important issue in a disaster response. Especially when different types of disasters (e.g., toxic plumes, fires, and floods) occur and affect transportation networks simultaneously, special routing strategies (e.g., detour) would be needed to ensure the safety for responders. On the other hand, after disasters happen, a quick response time is required, and the responders should move as fast as possible and even go through certain obstacles to reach the disaster sites to deliver emergency services. In this paper, we study path planning through moving obstacles, taking into account the influence of obstacles on the status of road networks and the speed of rescue vehicles. A set of algorithms is proposed to deal with not only geometries but also the properties of moving obstacles to support route generation. Based on the Dijkstra algorithm, a new routing algorithm is designed and developed, which aims at minimizing the risk while constraining the travel time of routes. We validate our approach with a set of experiments on some navigation cases. The experimental results show the promise of the algorithm in the generation of feasible and safe routes for first responders to pass through moving obstacles.},

  abstract     = {Routing protocols for vehicular ad hoc networks resort to clustering in order to optimize network performance. Concerning the optimized link state routing protocol and the plethora of its derivatives, the multipoint relaying (MPR) technique has proven its efficiency as an accurate clustering scheme over the last two decades. However, it has been emphasized recently that the MPR technique, which was originally designed for open areas, does not benefit from the particular configuration of road sections, which are intrinsically spatially constrained. A clustering scheme exploiting this particularity, namely chain-branch-leaf (CBL), has been introduced in order to enhance the flooding of broadcast traffic, including that related to routing operations. In this paper, both MPR and CBL are evaluated through MATLAB simulation over several scenarios based on realistic road configurations and traffic generated with SUMO simulator. The results show that CBL actually reduces the number of nodes acting as relays (cluster-heads) in the network, thus decreasing the routing traffic related to creation and retransmission of topology control messages. Also, they show that, with CBL, the nodes chosen as relays remain longer in this role, thus favoring the overall network stability, and that most of the nodes remain attached longer to the same relay than with the MPR technique.},

Reducing pedestrian - vehicle conflict points and expanding network capacities are two possible approaches to improving operational efficiency, especially when network accessibility varies in different evacuation stages. This paper integrates two types of network reconfiguration strategies, namely, the use of contraflow lane reversal for road lanes and pedestrian walkways and time-dependent conflict point elimination by separating pedestrian and vehicle flows with physical barriers at road intersections, to strategize pedestrian and vehicle moving directions during a mass evacuation. A multiobjective optimization model is formulated to adaptively select the appropriate locations for barriers according to different evacuation phases, and the model is solved by a modified genetic algorithm-based heuristic approach. An experiment on optimizing an urban regional evacuation network configuration in the case of a toxic gas leak accident was carried out to validate the proposed model. The numerical results show an increase of approximately 15% in the maximum evacuee throughput and a reduction of approximately 65% in the average exposure risk of evacuees of the optimal plans compared with the uncontrolled plan.},

Furthermore, we apply this model to estimate the proportion of drivers cruising in the neighborhood of Belltown, Seattle, WA, USA. Using occupancy approximated by parking transaction data, we estimate the percentage of drivers cruising for curbside parking by comparing the rate of drivers unable to find parking to bulk through-traffic measurement data. We find percentages of up to 50% for a Belltown&#39;s 1st Ave. depending on the time, day, and direction of travel. We then calculate a per vehicle travel-time cost to social welfare incurred by this proportion: upward of a 10% increase in travel time to all drivers along 1st Ave. Last, we introduce a simulation tool and test assumptions made when estimating interesting performance metrics like the probability of a block-face being full. Our results suggest that while assuming exponential service time distributions is not justified, mean rate solutions under a Markovian relaxation of the problem is comparable to service times representative of parking transaction data in simulation.},

  abstract     = {Urban traffic passenger flows prediction is practically important to facilitate many real applications including transportation management and public safety. Recently, deep learning based approaches are proposed to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of the traffic passenger flows. However, it is still very challenging to handle some complex factors such as hybrid transportation lines, mixed traffic, transfer stations, and some extreme weathers. Considering the multi-channel and irregularity properties of urban traffic passenger flows in different transportation lines, a more efficient and fine-grained deep spatio-temporal feature learning model is necessary. In this paper, we propose a deep irregular convolutional residual LSTM network model called DST-ICRL for urban traffic passenger flows prediction. We first model the passenger flows among different traffic lines in a transportation network into multi-channel matrices analogous to the RGB pixel matrices of an image. Then, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates irregular convolutional residential network and LSTM units to learn the spatial-temporal feature representations. To fully utilize the historical passenger flows, we sample both the short-term and long-term historical traffic data, which can capture the periodicity and trend of the traffic passenger flows. In addition, we also fuse other external factors further to facilitate a real-time prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on different types of traffic passenger flows datasets including subway, taxi and bus flows in Beijing as well as bike flows in New York. The results show that the proposed DST-ICRL significantly outperforms both traditional and deep learning based urban traffic passenger flows prediction methods.},

  abstract     = {The video-based separation of foreground (FG) and background (BG) has been widely studied due to its vital role in many applications, including intelligent transportation and video surveillance. Most of the existing algorithms are based on traditional computer vision techniques that perform pixel-level processing assuming that FG and BG possess distinct visual characteristics. Recently, state-of-the-art solutions exploit deep learning models targeted originally for image classification. Major drawbacks of such a strategy are the lacking delineation of FG regions due to missing temporal information as they segment the FG based on a single frame object detection strategy. To grapple with this issue, we excogitate a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) pipelines that harness seminal ideas, viz., fully convolutional networking, 3D transpose convolution, and residual feature flows. Thence, an FG-BG segmenter is implemented in an encoder-decoder fashion and trained on representative FG-BG segments. The model devises a strategy called double encoding and slow decoding, which fuses the learned spatio-temporal cues with appropriate feature maps both in the down-sampling and up-sampling paths for achieving well generalized FG object representation. Finally, from the Sigmoid confidence map generated by the 3D CNN-LSTM model, the FG is identified automatically by using Nobuyuki Otsu&#39;s method and an empirical global threshold. The analysis of experimental results via standard quantitative metrics on 16 benchmark datasets including both indoor and outdoor scenes validates that the proposed 3D CNN-LSTM achieves competitive performance in terms of figure of merit evaluated against prior and state-of-the-art methods. Besides, a failure analysis is conducted on 20 video sequences from the DAVIS 2016 dataset.},

  abstract     = {Pantograph is one of the most important components in electrical railway vehicles. To guarantee steady power supply for the train, the surface of the pantograph slide plate should be smooth enough so that the catenary can move on it from one side to the other side steadily with low friction. In addition, the thickness of the pantograph slide plate cannot be smaller than the lower limit for the sake of safety. Therefore, periodical inspection and maintenance of the pantograph slide plate are significant in terms of safe and stable operation. In this paper, an innovative and intelligent method based on deep learning and image processing technologies is proposed for the online condition monitoring of the pantograph slide plate. In the first stage, the surface defect detection and recognition method of the pantograph slide plate is proposed. Four typical surface defects of the slide are considered, and a deep learning model, pantograph defect detection neural network (PDDNet), is trained for the defect detection and recognition. In the second stage, five key criteria for qualifying the wear condition are proposed. The wear edge estimation based on image processing technology is investigated in detail. Furthermore, they are used to calculate the wear depth and evaluate the wear condition of the pantograph slide. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed PDDNet can detect the surface defects and also recognize the four kinds of defects with a sound accuracy. The wear depth estimation results are compared with on-site measurement data, and the proposed method can achieve high estimation accuracy.},

In this paper, we first defined a multiobjective carpool service problem with time windows (MOCSPTW) by considering four optimized objectives; subsequently, we propose a coevolutionary algorithm for two solution sets, population and archive, using objective-wise local search and set-based simulated binary operation in order to address the MOCSPTW. In the evolution module of the proposed algorithm, three different methods, namely, objective-wise local search in an archive, set-based simulated binary operation in a population, and set-based simulated binary operation both in a population and in an archive, were used to generate the offspring. Meanwhile, the E-domination and normal domination in the update module were adopted to control the convergence and diversity of the population and archive. In the experimental result, 48 sets of tests, including three moving patterns in a metropolitan area for the MOCSPTW, were prepared. The results of the quantitative comparison and objective visualization showed that the proposed algorithm can obtain superior Pareto-optimal solutions regarding convergence and diversity compared with a fast nondominated sorting genetic algorithm.},

Therefore, the necessity of its research has risen. In this paper, an IVN environment is introduced, and the constraints and characteristics of an intrusion detection system (IDS) design for IVNs are presented. A survey of the proposed IDS designs for the IVNs is conducted, and the corresponding drawbacks are highlighted. Various optimization objectives are considered and comprehensively compared.

To make it a reality, autonomous vehicles require the ability to communicate with other road users and understand their intentions. Such interactions are essential between vehicles and pedestrians, the most vulnerable road users. Understanding pedestrian behavior, however, is not intuitive and depends on various factors, such as demographics of the pedestrians, traffic dynamics, environmental conditions, and so on. In this paper, we identify these factors by surveying pedestrian behavior studies, both the classical works on pedestrian-driver interaction and the modern ones that involve autonomous vehicles. To this end, we will discuss various methods of studying pedestrian behavior and analyze how the factors identified in the literature are interrelated. We will also review the practical applications aimed at solving the interaction problem, including design approaches for autonomous vehicles that communicate with pedestrians and visual perception and reasoning algorithms tailored to understanding pedestrian intention. Based on our findings, we will discuss the open problems and propose future research directions.},

Current algorithms used for parking space detection based on the WMSNs have been well studied but not without eliminating the geomagnetic field interference. Electric railway systems, such as subways and light rail systems, produce magnetic field radiation that interferes with the geomagnetic field. The electric railway magnetic field interference has increased and is prominent in urban settings; therefore, it is imperative to filter out the interference in order to increase the detection accuracy. This paper proposes an algorithm for parking space detection, which can effectively eliminate the geomagnetic background interference. We solve the parking detection problem through signal filtering technology. Based on mathematical morphology, we designed two filters for extracting morphological structures from interfered magnetic signals. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm is more accurate than the existing algorithms.},

Authentication technologies based on existing security policies and access control rules in such networks assume full trust on roadside unit (RSU) and authentication servers. The disclosure of authentication parameters enables user&#39;s traceability over the network. VANETs&#39; trusted entities (e.g., RSU) can utilize such information to track a user traveling behavior, violating user privacy and anonymity. In this paper, we proposed a novel, light-weight, adaptive group-based zero knowledge proof-authentication protocol (AGZKP-AP) for VANETs. The proposed authentication protocol is capable of offering various levels of users&#39; privacy settings based on the type of services available on such networks. Our scheme is based on the zero-knowledge-proof crypto approach with the support of tradeoff options. Users have the option to make critical decisions on the level of privacy and the amount of resources usage they prefer such as short system response time versus the number of private information disclosures. Furthermore, AGZKP-AP is incorporated with a distributed privilege control and revoking mechanism that render user&#39;s private information to law enforcement in case of a traffic violation.},

Some famous applications include vehicle traffic loading on roads (from Google MAP), video sharing for fans group (from Facebook or Youtube), and so on. However, to achieve real-time active safe driving (RT-ASD) under unstable driving in high-threat areas on roads becomes an open issue in cloud computing-based intelligent transportation system. This paper proposes a predictive backward shockwave analysis approach (PSA) to achieve the RT-ASD based on the analyses of macroscopic traffic shockwave (PSA_MA) and microscopic car-following (PSA_mi). The PSA contributes in several aspects to active safe driving: 1) predicting and analyzing high threat of backward shockwaves from the gathered big data of the driving state information vehicles; 2) informing the analyzed threat messages to the vehicles in high-threat areas via the 3-Tier hierarchical cloud computing mechanism; 3) reducing the driving threat certainly; and 4) PSA_MA and PSA_mi can be applied for achieving active safe driving in autonomous self-driving vehicles and human-driving vehicles. The numerical results show that the PSA outperforms in approaches to relative error rate prediction, the accuracy of the backward shockwave determination, average vehicle velocity, average travel time, number of goodput vehicles, time-to-collision, and distance-to-collision.},

  abstract     = {Both distracted and aggressive driving are habitual in nature, constituting an insurance risk, which has been difficult to quantify. Here, in this paper, we propose a method that produces short term predictions for these two dangerous driving behaviors. The method feeds an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm with the most informative features of a set of physiological and vehicular variables. The XGB algorithm operates on a learning window covering the last 30 seconds to make fast track predictions (FT) for the next 10 seconds. For aggressive driving, FT predictions are final, while for distracted driving, FT predictions are weighted over one minute, to form a meta-prediction. This more deliberative process for predicting distractions fits their intermittent manifestation. The method has been tested on SIM 1, a publicly available dataset from a distracted driving experiment. In this dataset, the drivers ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n=59$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) are labeled as distracted based on the presence of mental activity or physical interactions antagonistic to the driving task; their driving style is defined by steering and acceleration, and is classified as aggressive or normal. The method attains classification performance that exceeds 87%. Alerting drivers when distractions and aggressiveness have taken hold on them can provide sobering awareness, given that people drift into these states subconsciously. The behavioral modification effects of such awareness mechanisms are rooted in Cognitive Behavioral Theory. The proposed method can also be used in future vehicles with advanced automation, weighing in the computer’s decision to wrest vehicular control from an unrepentant driver.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth in connected vehicles and related innovative applications, it is getting keen interest among the researchers. Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) comprise of interconnected vehicles with sensing capabilities to exchange traffic, weather and emergency information. Intelligent transportation system (ITS) supports better coordination among vehicles and in providing reliable services. In VANET, topology is dynamic due to the high mobility of vehicles, therefore, the existing topology-based schemes are not suitable. In this paper, we have explored position based routing (PBR) protocols for VANETs by presenting a taxonomy. The existing survey papers have focused on PBR schemes but we have further focused on considering PBR for the city environment along with connectivity aware routing schemes. Moreover, linear programming, genetic algorithms, and regression-based schemes are also included. To further evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of PBR schemes, a categorical evaluation of different architectures, path strategies, and carry-forward strategies are presented. Currently, no architecture is presented for FoG-oriented VANET using parked vehicles as guards for anchor points or junctions. To fill this aspiring demand, we have presented a FoG-oriented VANET architecture that can support the PBR by utilizing road junctions for path selection. It also involves the vehicles in the parking area for packet transmission. Further, we have proposed to use parked vehicles near junction as an option for selecting guarding vehicle along with ITS as well. It reduces the probability of extensive carry forward-based communication due to the absence of guarding nodes. The records at parked vehicles can be upgraded at neighboring parked vehicles as well during the beaconing or exchange of data messages. The architecture supports better packet delivery ratios, end-to-end delay, transmission time, and communication cost. Moreover, opportunities and challenges of the proposed architecture are also explored to attract researchers toward this area of research.},

The SIEP has been shown to improve the performance of existing automatic ramp merging control strategies while increasing the level of safety during the merging maneuver. The performance and advantages of the SIEP-based approach have been assessed only through numerical simulations. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the performance and safety of this SIEP-based approach to ramp merging control using a lab-based test-bed. We employed a novel Pc metric, which is based on the concept of probability of collision, to perform a systematic validation of the SIEP safety. Such a metric serves as a standardized methodology to quantitatively compare the SIEP-based approach with those in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Visual time-sharing (VTS) behavior characterizes an inattentive driver. Because inattention has been identified as the major contributing factor in traffic crashes, understanding the relationship between VTS and crash risk could help reduce the crash risk through the development of inattention countermeasures. The aims of this paper are: 1) to develop a reference model of the VTS behavior and 2) reveal if vehicle automation influences the VTS behavior. The reference model was based on naturalistic eye-tracking data. The VTS sequences were extracted from routine driving data (including manual and automated driving). We used Bayesian generalized linear mixed models for a range of on- and off-path glance-based metrics. Each parameter was estimated with a probability distribution and summarized with credible intervals containing the model parameters with 95% probability. The reference model not only corroborates previous findings from the driving simulator experiments and on-road studies, but also captures the characteristics of on-path and off-path glance behavior in greater detail. The model demonstrated that: 1) there was minimal change in the VTS behavior due to automation and 2) the percentage of time that glances fell on-path (PRC) was greater for all routine driving (~80%) than for the VTS sequences (~50%). The PRC was the only metric that was sensitive to the VTS, but it did not differentiate between manual and automated driving. Our model, by describing a measure of inattention (VTS behavior), can be used in future driver models to improve the computer simulations used to design ADASs and evaluate their safety benefits. In addition, the model could serve as a detailed reference for inattention guidelines.},

  abstract     = {Recovering an absolute metric scale from a monocular camera is a challenging but highly desirable problem for monocular camera-based systems. By using different kinds of cues, various approaches have been proposed for scale estimation, such as camera height and object size. In this paper, first, we summarize different kinds of scale estimation approaches. Then, we propose a robust divide-and-conquer absolute scale estimation method based on the ground plane and camera height by analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. By using the estimated scale, an effective scale correction strategy has been proposed to reduce the scale drift during the monocular visual odometry estimation process. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method have been verified on both public and self-collected image sequences.},

  abstract     = {An automated parking system allows drivers to park cars free of stress and collisions in parking lots. Most commercial systems use ultrasonic sensors and require a scanning process to search for a vacant parking space between two adjacent vehicles. If automated parking fails, drivers must return to the initial position for further scanning or take the steering wheel to complete the remaining parking procedure. To improve such limitations, we propose a re-plannable automated parking system with a standalone around view monitor. The proposed system can constantly reflect several errors and risks of perception, positioning, and control in real-life situations, and then re-generate the parking path to improve the parking precision and avoid any collisions. To realize this automated parking system, we propose a new system architecture and introduce four core modules: environmental perception, precise positioning, parking path planning, and vehicle control. In our experiments, we evaluated the system in narrow parking lots with a perpendicular parking space defined as &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$2.1 \times 5.0$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; m.

In order to target the communication/computation delays, the paper suggests the exploitation of fog-based architectures for localized AEMoD system operations. These emerging architectures are soon to become widely used, allowing for all localized operational decisions to be made with very low latency by fog controllers located close to the end applications (e.g., each city zone for AEMoD systems). As for the charging delays, an optimized multi-class charging and dispatching queuing model, with partial charging option for AEMoD vehicles is developed for each of these zones. The stability conditions of this model and the optimal number of classes are then derived. The decisions on the proportions of each class vehicles to partially/fully charge or directly serve customers are optimized to minimize the maximum and average system response times using convex optimization and Lagrangian analysis. The results show the merits of our proposed model and optimized decision scheme compared to both the always-charge and the equal-split scheme. Furthermore, the comparison of the maximum and average response time minimization results shows a very low variance in performance, which suggests by using the linear programming solution for lower complexity.},

We utilize the linear fractional transformation and the M-Δ uncertain interconnection structure to represent the uncertainties in the block-diagonal matrix Δ. The uncertain gains are directly incorporated in the uncertain interconnection structure, while the uncertain time delays are taken into account using the Rekasius substitution that preserves the tightness of the robustness bounds. This modeling framework scales are well for large-size connected vehicle systems. We demonstrate through two case studies how parameters in the connected cruise controller can be selected to ensure the robust string stability.

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving is one of the most important AI applications and has attracted extensive interest in recent years. A large number of studies have successfully applied reinforcement learning techniques in various aspects of autonomous driving, ranging from low-level control of driving maneuvers to higher level of strategic decision-making. However, comparatively less progress has been made in investigating how co-existing autonomous vehicles would interact with each other in a common environment and how reinforcement learning can be helpful in such situations by applying multiagent reinforcement learning techniques in the high-level strategic decision-making of the following or overtaking for a group of autonomous vehicles in highway scenarios. Learning to achieve coordination among vehicles in such situations is challenging due to the unique feature of vehicular mobility, which renders it infeasible to directly apply the existing coordinated learning approaches. To solve this problem, we propose using dynamic coordination graph to model the continuously changing topology during vehicles&#39; interactions and come up with two basic learning approaches to coordinate the driving maneuvers for a group of vehicles. Several extension mechanisms are then presented to make these approaches workable in a more complex and realistic setting with any number of vehicles. The experimental evaluation has verified the benefits of the proposed coordinated learning approaches, compared with other approaches that learn without coordination or rely on some traditional mobility models based on some expert driving rules.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification plays an important role in video surveillance applications. Despite the efforts made on this problem in the past few years, it remains a challenging task due to various factors such as pose variation, illumination changes, and subtle inter-class difference. We believe that the key information for identification has not been well explored in the literature. In this paper, we first collect a vehicle dataset `VAC21&#39; which contains 7129 images of five types of vehicles. Then, we carefully label the 21 classes of structural attributes hierarchically with bounding boxes. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset with several detailed attributes labeled. Based on this dataset, we use the state-of-the-art one-stage detection method, Single-shot Detection, as a baseline model for detecting attributes. Subsequently, we make a few important modifications tailored for this application to improve accuracy: 1) adding more proposals from low-level layers to improve the accuracy of detecting small objects and 2) employing the focal loss to improve the mean average precision. Furthermore, the results of the attribute detection can be applied to a series of vision tasks that focus on analyzing the images of vehicles. Finally, we propose a novel region of interests (ROIs)-based vehicle re-identification and retrieval method in which the ROIs&#39; deep features are used as discriminative identifiers, encoding the structure information of a vehicle. These deep features are input to a boosting model to improve the accuracy. A set of experiments are conducted on the dataset VehicleID and the experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

We show how to construct complex behaviors by re-using elementary neural network building blocks that can be trained and tested extensively; one of our goals is to mitigate the “black box” and verifiability issues that affect end-to-end trained networks. By structuring complex behaviors within a subsumption architecture, we retain the ability to learn (mostly at motor primitives level) with the ability to create complex behaviors by subsuming the (well-known) learned elementary perception-action loops. The learning process itself is simplified, since the agent needs only to learn elementary behaviors. At the same time, the structure imposed with the subsumption architecture ensures that the agent behaves in predictable ways (e.g., treating all obstacles uniformly). We demonstrate these ideas for longitudinal obstacle avoidance behavior, but the proposed approach can also be adapted to other situations.},

In the train marshalling problem (TMP), the objective is to perform this rearrangement of the railcars with the use of as few classification tracks as possible. The problem has been shown to be NP-hard, and several exact and approximation algorithms have been developed for it. In this paper, we propose a novel exact dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for the TMP. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm (which is exponential in the number of destinations and linear in the number of railcars) is lower than that of the best presently available algorithm for the problem, which is an inclusion-exclusion-based DP algorithm. In practice, the proposed algorithm can provide a substantially improved performance compared to its inclusion-exclusion-based counterpart, as demonstrated by the experimental results.},

This new approach combines the advantages of both the random matrix theory and the sparse property to provide enhanced vehicle localization capabilities. In this method, measurement noises are assumed to be non-Gaussian distributed, and a generalized error distribution is adopted as an approximation to non-Gaussian densities. To ensure the robustness and the stability of the proposed approach, road-test experiments in various scenarios, including free, partial, and complete GPS outages, were performed based on the geometric dilution of precision metric. During complete outages, the SG-WP fuses all available INS measurements to improve the vehicle position prediction, whereas in free outages, only GPS information is processed. Besides, information from both GPS and INS are taken as inputs during partial outages, and the slide window is then introduced to regulate the flow data. The experimental comparison with the existing prediction methods reveals that the proposed method can achieve accurate and reliable positioning for land vehicles in all considered environments when the measurement noises are Gaussian or non-Gaussian distributed.},

The proposed method is evaluated on more than 10 000 kilometers of driving data collected from approximately 200 drivers. To validate the interpretation of the clusters, we compare the data associated with different clusters and relate the results to real-world knowledge of driving behavior.

In ASER, a probabilistic network model is developed to predict pick-up probability and capacity of each location by using Kalman filtering method. To recommend profitable driving routes to taxi drivers, ASER takes the load balance between passengers and taxis into consideration and the shortest expected cruising distance is introduced to formulate potential cruising distance of taxis. Moreover, MapReduce and a novel data structure kdS-tree are applied to improve recommendation efficiency. ASER is evaluated on two real trajectory datasets from San Francisco, CA, USA, and Wuhan, China.

Over the last few years, the traffic data that we have at our disposal have significantly increased, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Most existing travel demand prediction methods mainly focus on capturing recurrent mobility trends that relate to habitual/routine behavior, and on exploiting short-term correlations with recent observation patterns. However, valuable information that is often available in the form of unstructured data is neglected when attempting to improve forecasting results. Particularly, under non-recurrent conditions, such as large events, or incidents, we need much better models. In this paper, we explore time-series data and semantic information combinations using machine learning and deep learning techniques in the context of creating a prediction model that is able to capture in real-time future stressful situations of the studied transportation system. We apply the proposed approaches in event areas in New York using publicly available taxi data. We empirically show that the proposed models are able to significantly reduce the error in the forecasts.

  abstract     = {Using brain signals rather than limbs to drive a vehicle can help persons with disabilities to extend their movement range and, thus, to improve their self-independence. However, the driving performance of brain-controlled vehicles (BCVs) is poor. In this paper, to improve the performance of BCVs, we propose a new shared control method based on the model predictive control (MPC) strategy. Particularly, to maintain the maximum control authority of brain-control drivers while ensuring the safety of BCVs, the MPC controller is designed by introducing a penalty on the deviation from drivers output in the cost function and setting safety constraints. Driver-and-hardware-in-the-loop experiments are conducted under two road-keeping scenarios and one obstacle-avoidance scenario with different subjects to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in avoiding roadway departures and obstacles while maintaining the control authority of users.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the employment status of passengers in public transit systems is significant for transport operators in many real applications such as forecasting travel demand and providing personalized transportation service. This paper develops a deep learning approach to infer a passenger&#39;s employment status by using smart card data (SCD) with a household survey. This paper first extracts an individual passenger&#39;s weekly travel patterns in different travel modes from the raw SCD as a three-dimensional image. A deep learning architecture, called a thresholding multi-channel convolutional neural network, was developed to predict an individual&#39;s employment status. The approach proposed here solves two critical problems of using the SCD for employment status studies. First, it automatically incorporates learning temporal features in different travel modes without the need for handcrafted travel feature design. Second, it considers the class-imbalance problem by leveraging the ensemble of oversampling and thresholding techniques. By applying our approach to a real dataset collected from the metropolitan area of London, U.K., about 72% of passengers were correctly categorized into six types of employment statuses. The promising results show the tight correlation between temporal travel behavior, mode choice, and social-demographic roles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to infer employment status by using the SCD.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel adaptive traffic signal control scheme that addresses a mixed manual-automated traffic scenario in a typically isolated intersection. The traffic signals are optimized in a receding horizon control framework that aims at minimizing the total crossing time of all vehicles, considering their dynamical states. The control scheme ensures comfortable crossing of manually driven vehicles by retaining the basic features of the traditional signal management systems. The optimal signal changing times are broadcasted one cycle ahead, which enables the automated vehicles to tune their speed in order to cross the intersection with minimum stop-delay. More specifically, the framework optimizes the green time of each signal without considering the existing cycle-split concept explicitly. The proposed signal control scheme is evaluated in microscopic traffic simulation considering the different proportion of turning traffic at the intersection and various penetration rates of the automated vehicles. It is observed that the optimization process usually results in the shortest possible green period of each signal that can be realized without reducing the capacity of the intersection at any traffic volumes. Consequently, the resulting short signal cycle which is adaptive to the traffic around the intersection improves the average speed and reduces both the traffic density and the number of idling vehicles. As a consequence, the fuel consumption efficiency and the rate of CO 2 emission around the intersection are also reduced. These results are compared with both the traditional fixed time and the actuated signal control schemes. As the portion of the automated vehicles increases in the case of the proposed scheme, the overall traffic flow performance further improves.},

  abstract     = {Realizing the ultra-low latency and high-accuracy solutions for rear-end collision is still challenging, especially under the condition in which many uncertainties exist. This paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based warning algorithm for rear-end collision avoidance. Three key issues are addressed by applying the neural network approach, including noises in positioning, inaccurate risk assessment, and enhanced comfort level of passengers. First, to filter the noises in positioning, wireless vehicular communications are leveraged; accurate relative lane positioning can be achieved to justify when two vehicles are in the same lane. Second, an online neural network model is developed to assess the risk of collisions in real time while driving. The algorithm can converge fast to a globally optimal solution and adapt to different traffic environments. Third, to maximize the comfort of passengers during the braking process, a graded warning strategy is developed at the prerequisite of guaranteed safety. With the above schemes sewed in to one framework, our proposal can achieve rear-end warning with reduced missing alarm rate, accurate risk assessment and enhanced comfort to passengers. The extensive simulations validate the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposal in terms of relative lane positioning, risk assessment, and collision avoidance.},

We also used the CNN on acceleration data collected by smartphones to extract the knowledge regarding driving style, vehicle, environment, and human characteristics. We found that this novel idea was more successful for evaluating the driving style compared with the previous machine learning algorithms. However, we faced over-fitting in the training process of the CNN and to avoid this, we proposed the state-of-the-art learning method applying two adaptive regularization schemes called adaptive dropout and adaptive weight decay. To evaluate these techniques, first, we checked the results on three popular large-scale datasets. When we proved the efficiency, we utilized them on two transportation data sets. In transportation-modes dataset, the accuracy was at least 95.8%&#39;; and regarding the driving-style dataset, the classification accuracy was 95%.

In this paper, we consider the impact of link qualities and vehicular mobility and investigate how to select broadcast relays to minimize the broadcast delay and maximize the broadcast efficiency. We first propose a novel broadcast scheme based on the prediction of dynamics (BPD), which utilizes the dynamic information to achieve the model-based prediction and combines the sender-based and receiver-based relay selection schemes for multi-hop broadcast. Then, we propose a novel metric called the expected remaining delay (D) and implement it in BDP (BPD-D) for minimizing the broadcast delay. We also propose a novel metric called the expected rebroadcast efficiency (E) and implement it in BDP (BPD-E) for maximizing the broadcast efficiency. The simulation results show that our proposed BPD-D and BPD-E broadcast protocols outperform the conventional protocols, while BPD-D can achieve the least delay and BPD-E has the highest dissemination efficiency.},

We show how a predictive model of traffic flows can be created from mobile network signaling data. To achieve this, we estimate the vehicular density inside specific areas using a polynomial function of the inner and exiting mobile phone handovers performed by the base stations covering those areas. We can then use the aggregated handovers as flow proxies alongside the density proxy to directly estimate an average velocity within an area. We evaluate the model in a simulation study of Luxembourg city and generalize our findings using a real-world data set extracted from the LTE network of a Luxembourg operator. By predicting the real traffic states as measured through floating car data, we achieve a mean absolute percentage error of 11.12%. Furthermore, in our study case, the approximations of the network macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFD) of road network partitions can be generated. The analyzed data exhibit low variance with respect to a quadratic concave flow-density function, which is inline with the previous theoretical results on MFDs and are similar when estimated from simulation and real data. These results indicate that mobile signaling data can potentially be used to approximate MFDs of the underlying road network and contribute to better estimate road traffic states in urban congested networks.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion in major cities around the globe is a daunting problem that is getting worse as the speed of urbanization keeps increasing. The role of traffic lights (TLs) at intersections in regulating flows cannot be underestimated. Even though there are a variety of actuated traffic signals based on cameras or loop detectors, the vast majority of existing TLs in the world employ a timer-based decision logic which is clearly not very effective. In this paper, we present a new scheme for controlling traffic at intersections, which is known as dedicated short-range communications (DSRCs)-actuated traffic control. The proposed approach leverages the presence of DSRC radios in vehicles and gives priority (by displaying green light) to approaches (roads) that include DSRC-equipped vehicles (such as 10% or 20% of vehicles having DSRC radios). Using this priority mechanism, it is shown that the average waiting time at each TL can be significantly reduced. This, in turn, can reduce the average commute time of urban workers during rush hours substantially. One of the great advantages of the presented approach is that it can function well with even a low percentage of DSRC-equipped vehicles. Given that many industry forecasts predict a gradual penetration rate for the DSRC technology, this is a very attractive feature. It is also shown that the proposed new approach leads to a cost-effective solution for urban traffic control since the hardware and software platforms needed for its implementation are low cost.},

  abstract     = {Monitoring the occupancy of on-street parking spaces on a city-wide scale is still an open issue. Past research demonstrated the viability of parking crowd-sensing by means of the standard on-board sensors of probe vehicles, foreseeing the use of high-mileage vehicles, like taxis. Nevertheless, the achievable spatio-temporal sensing coverage has never been deeply investigated. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of taxi fleets of different sizes to crowd-sense on-street parking availability. We considered 579 road segments in San Francisco (USA), covered both by sensors of the SFpark project and by the GPS traces of 536 taxis. For each of these segments, we computed the taxi transit frequencies, representing the achievable coverage by vehicles equipped with sensors detecting empty parking spots. By combining these frequencies with parking occupancy data coming from SFpark, we estimated the potential quality of crowd-sensed on-street parking information for different fleet sizes. Moreover, we investigated the impact of different misdetection amounts, and Kalman filters to handle them. The results show that a total of 300 taxis can crowd-sense on-street parking availability with an error of up to ±1 stall in 86% of the cases. Moreover, the quality of the sensors is as important as the fleet size (300 taxis with 10% probability of misreadings provide availability information comparable to 486 taxis with 16% probability), while the use of Kalman filters did not lead to statistically significant improvements. In conclusion, the traffic management authorities should consider parking crowd-sensing via probe vehicles as a promising alternative to the expensive deployment of the static parking sensors.},

  abstract     = {This paper capitalizes on the increasingly high relevance gained by data-intensive technologies in the development of intelligent transportation system, which calls for the progressive adoption of adaptive, self-learning methods for solving modeling, simulation, and optimization problems. In this regard, certain mechanisms and processes observed in nature, including the animal brain, have proved themselves to excel not only in terms of efficiently capturing time-evolving stimuli, but also at undertaking complex tasks by virtue of mechanisms that can be extrapolated to computer algorithms and methods. This paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-the-art around the application of bioinspired methods to the challenges arising in the broad field of intelligent transportation system (ITS). This systematic survey is complemented by an initiatory taxonomic introduction to bioinspired computational intelligence, along with the basics of its constituent techniques. A focus is placed on which research niches are still unexplored by the community in different ITS subareas. The open issues and research directions for the practical implementation of ITS endowed with bioinspired computational intelligence are also discussed in detail.},

With this newly proposed concept, a vehicle’s driving behaviour will no longer be solely based on the driver’s limited and incomplete observation. By taking advantages of the shared information, driving behaviours of CAVs can be improved greatly to a more responsible, accurate and efficient level. This study proposed a reinforcement-learning-based car following model for CAVs in order to obtain an appropriate driving behaviour to improve travel efficiency, fuel consumption and safety at signalized intersections in real-time. The result shows that by specifying an effective reward function, a controller can be learned and works well under different traffic demands as well as traffic light cycles with different durations.

HDPL is one of the most promising applications in the field of cooperative driving. The goal of this application is to improve fuel and road efficiency without impairing safety. The level of efficiency improvement depends on the instantaneous channel quality. Strong multipath components, which arise from other vehicles, traffic signs, and surrounding buildings in such a highly dynamic vehicular environment, significantly influence the instantaneous link quality between communicating vehicles in a platoon. An emerging concept of vehicle sensor-aided predictive communications has shown its potential to improve direct-link communication. In this paper, the applicability of this approach is evaluated in terms of inter-vehicle distance error, which reflects the difficulties that the control algorithm has to cope with in the communications conditions. The simulation results show that the proposed sensor-based approach significantly improves the platoon performance even if affected by multiple dynamic scattering reflections at the same time.},

Specifically, the same basic deep learning architecture that is a shortly and densely connected convolutional neural network is utilized to extract the basic feature maps of an input square vehicle image in the first stage. Then, the quadruple directional deep learning networks utilize different directional pooling layers, i.e., horizontal average pooling layer, vertical average pooling layer, diagonal average pooling layer, and anti-diagonal average pooling layer, to compress the basic feature maps into horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and anti-diagonal directional feature maps, respectively. Finally, these directional feature maps are spatially normalized and concatenated together as a quadruple directional deep learning feature for vehicle re-identification.

The global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) suffer from signal blockage and severe multipath in urban canyons, which degrades the positioning accuracy and availability. Therefore, vehicles solely relying on positioning from GNSS receivers have limited performance. In this research, we present a novel unified cooperative positioning solution which enhances positioning accuracy and availability in urban canyons. The proposed system exploits the fact that vehicles have different positioning resources and is based on angle approximation, which artificially generates the hindered pseudorange by sharing angle information between vehicles using dedicated short-range communication. In addition, we propose a system that employs the proposed cooperative technique to assist the loose integration between the inertial navigation system (INS) and the GPS system (using extended Kalman filter) during partial GPS outages. Using raw data from inertial sensors and GPS receivers in the real road trajectories, we implement the cooperative INS/GPS loose integration and show that our cooperative integrated system outperforms the non-cooperative integrated system. The performance metrics used are the 2-D positioning root-mean-square error, the maximum 2-D positioning error, and the positioning accuracy gain (PAG). Specifically, the PAG gain is around 88%, 80%, and 60% when the number of blocked satellites is one, two, and three, respectively.},

However, conventional lane-keeping assistance systems (LKASs) have a limited level of automation, while fully autonomous lane-keeping systems have shortcomings regarding reliability. To address these issues, an advanced LKAS with two switchable assistance modes, namely, the lane departure prevention mode and the lane-keeping co-pilot mode, is proposed in this paper. First, the system structure is constructed. Then, the functions and control strategies for the two assistance modes are defined. Next, the controller algorithms are designed using the learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) method to compensate for modeling errors. Within the framework of LBMPC, an oracle is built to learn the unmodeled dynamics using an extended Kalman filter. Moreover, optimization problems are formulated to achieve the control objectives regarding driving safety and driver acceptance. Finally, driver-in-the-loop experiments carried out on a driving simulator prove that both assistance modes are effective. Furthermore, the lane-keeping co-pilot mode can help reduce the driving burden in the sense of avoiding frequent steering correction.},

  abstract     = {Visual tracking of multiple objects is an essential component for a perception system in autonomous driving vehicles. One of the favorable approaches is the tracking-by-detection paradigm, which links current detection hypotheses to previously estimated object trajectories (also known as tracks) by searching appearance or motion similarities between them. As this search operation is usually based on a very limited spatial or temporal locality, the association can fail in cases of motion noise or long-term occlusion. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking method that solves this problem by putting together information from both enlarged structural and temporal domain. For efficiency without loss of optimality, this approach is decomposed in to three stages, with each dealing with only one constrained association task, and thus, it follows the alternating optimization fashion. In our approach, detections are first assembled into small tracklets based on meta-measurements of object affinity. The association task for tracklets-to-tracks is solved by structural information based on a motion pattern between them. Here, we propose new rules to decouple the processing time from the tracklet length. Furthermore, constraints from temporal domain are introduced to recover objects, which are long-time disappearing due to failed detection or long-term occlusion. By putting together the heterogeneous domain information, our approach exhibits an improved state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. With relatively little processing time, an online and real-time tracking is also permitted in our approach.},

However, it is difficult to collect sufficient representative training data to construct generic detection models, which are applicable to all drivers. Consequently, this paper proposes a new personal-based hierarchical DMS (HDMS). During driving, the first layer of the proposed HDMS detects normal and abnormal driving behavior based on normal personal driving models represented by sparse representations. When abnormal driving behavior is detected, the second layer of the HDMS further determines whether the behavior is drowsy driving behavior or distracted driving behavior. The experimental results obtained for three datasets show that the proposed HDMS outperforms existing state-of-the-art DMS methods in detecting normal driving behavior, drowsy driving behavior, and distracted driving behavior.},

We empirically evaluate and compare the presented methods on a contributed dataset of 11447 labeled traffic scenes. Our results indicate that excellent classification results can be achieved with very short image representations, and that fine-tuning on the target dataset image data is not mandatory.

The proposed architecture consists of calibration network and depth fusion network, where both networks are designed considering the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for mobile devices. The calibration network first corrects an initial extrinsic parameter to align the input sensor coordinate systems. The accuracy of calibration is markedly improved by formulating the calibration in the depth domain. In the depth fusion network, complementary characteristics of sparse LiDAR and dense stereo depth are then encoded in a boosting manner. Since training data for the LiDAR and stereo depth fusion are rather limited, we introduce a simple but effective approach to generate pseudo ground truth labels from the raw KITTI dataset. The experimental evaluation verifies that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI benchmark. We also collect data using our proprietary multi-sensor acquisition platform and verify that the proposed method generalizes across different sensor settings and scenes.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has shown great potential in enhancing traffic efficiency and sustainability. While past research efforts focused on the development of CACC systems and their demonstrations, very few of them considered in detail how to form a CACC platoon in real traffic, where the proper identification of preceding vehicle is required. To ensure safe and reliable CACC operations, the following vehicle needs to establish the correct connection with its preceding vehicle. Although this can be done by matching information shared by surrounding vehicles with the ego-vehicle&#39;s radar measurements, the existence of sensor/global positioning system (GPS) errors makes it a challenging task. Considering possible sensor/GPS errors in real traffic, this paper proposes a procedure of identifying preceding vehicle under fully connected vehicle environment and evaluates three preceding vehicle identification systems (PVIS), namely, location-based PVIS, distance-based PVIS, and integrated PVIS combining both location and distance information. The mathematical models of PVISs are developed. The performance evaluation of the PVISs is conducted based on real vehicle trajectory data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) program, which reflects how vehicles&#39; relative positions change in a high-density segment of highway. The feasibility, performance, and potential of the three PVISs are compared. The results show that location-based PVIS requires a relative positioning accuracy below 1.1 m to ensure an acceptable identification time with zero failure rate. The integrated PVIS has the best performance, providing 99% confidence in identifying preceding vehicle within 1.3 s under typical sensor error settings.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a speed control method termed variable speed release (VSR) to increase bottleneck capacity. The main idea is to increase the speed of vehicles approaching a bottleneck to reduce the probability of traffic breakdown and sustain higher flow, thereby achieving a higher system throughput. This paper provides insight into the mechanism of improvement through modeling and a numerical experiment. The results suggest that the proposed VSR control would be particularly effective with smaller response time, which can be realized by connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies. This paper also provides conditions in which VSR control would be effective or should be complemented with other control methods such as variable speed limit and ramp metering control. The results of evaluation by microscopic simulations demonstrate significant improvements of system throughput, particularly in a CAV environment.},

The mapping is performed through an original representation of the conflict-resolution problem in terms of a conflict graph, where the nodes of the graph represent flights and the edges represent a potential conflict between flights. The representation allows a natural decomposition of a real-world instance related to wind-optimal trajectories over the Atlantic Ocean into smaller subproblems that can be discretized and are amenable to be programmed in quantum annealers. In this paper, we tested the new programming techniques, and we benchmark the hardness of the instances using both classical solvers and the D-Wave 2X and D-Wave 2000Q quantum chip. The preliminary results show that for reasonable modeling choices, the most challenging subproblems which are programmable in the current devices are solved to optimality with 99% of probability within a second of annealing time.},

  abstract     = {A few recent developments have demonstrated that deep-learning-based solutions can outperform traditional algorithms for automated pavement crack detection. In this paper, an efficient deep network called CrackNet-V is proposed for automated pixel-level crack detection on 3D asphalt pavement images. Compared with the original CrackNet, CrackNet-V has a deeper architecture but fewer parameters, resulting in improved accuracy and computation efficiency. Inspired by CrackNet, CrackNet-V uses invariant spatial size through all layers such that supervised learning can be conducted at pixel level. Following the VGG network, CrackNet-V uses 3 × 3 size of filters for the first six convolutional layers and stacks several 3 × 3 convolutional layers together for deep abstraction, resulting in reduced number of parameters and efficient feature extraction. CrackNet-V has 64113 parameters and consists of ten layers, including one pre-process layer, eight convolutional layers, and one output layer. A new activation function leaky rectified tanh is proposed in this paper for higher accuracy in detecting shallow cracks. The training of CrackNet-V was completed after 3000 iterations, which took only one day on a GeForce GTX 1080Ti device. According to the experimental results on 500 testing images, CrackNet-V achieves a high performance with a Precision of 84.31%, Recall of 90.12%, and an F-1 score of 87.12%. It is shown that CrackNet-V yields better overall performance particularly in detecting fine cracks compared with CrackNet. The efficiency of CrackNet-V further reveals the advantages of deep learning techniques for automated pixel-level pavement crack detection.},

In this paper, based on cuboid-shape, three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary wideband geometry-based stochastic models (GBSMs) for HST tunnel scenarios are proposed. By considering the influence of the tunnel walls, a theoretical channel model is first established, which assumes clusters with an infinite number of scatterers randomly distributed on the tunnel walls. The corresponding simulation model is then developed and the method of equal areas is employed to obtain the discrete parameters, such as the azimuth and elevation angles. We derive and investigate the most important channel statistical properties of the proposed 3D GBSMs, including the time-variant autocorrelation function, spatial cross-correlation function, and Doppler power spectrum density. It is indicated that all statistical properties of the simulation model, verified by simulation results, can match very well with those of the theoretical model. Furthermore, a validation is presented by comparing the stationary regions of our proposed tunnel channel model to those of relevant measurement data.},

To address the problem, we propose an end-to-end system called Line-CNN (L-CNN), in which the key component is a novel line proposal unit (LPU). The LPU utilizes line proposals as references to locate accurate traffic curves, which forces the system to learn the global feature representation of the entire traffic lines. We benchmark the proposed L-CNN on two public datasets including MIKKI and TuSimple, and the results suggest that L-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, L-CNN can run at approximately 30 f/s on a Titan X GPU, which indicates the practicability and effectiveness of L-CNN for real-time intelligent self-driving systems.},

  abstract     = {ITS-G5 is a communication system for vehicle-to-everything communication for road safety and traffic efficiency applications. On the lower layers, it is based on IEEE 802.11 standard and uses a simple ad hoc mode with a random medium access control scheme. Ad hoc networking is realized by a geographical routing scheme that provides single- and multi-hop communication over ITS-G5 links for periodic and event-driven broadcast messages. Specifically, contention-based forwarding (CBF) allows for efficient and reliable multi-hop packet transport by overhearing and timer-based transmission control. To cope with the channel congestion, decentralized congestion control (DCC) adjusts the message rate and ensures that the network load keeps below a predefined threshold of the bandwidth. To enforce a node&#39;s message rate, a “ Gatekeeper” above the MAC and beneath CBF is added. Under high network load, this Gatekeeper introduces an additional queuing delay seen by CBF, which can cause its overhearing function to fail. This contribution studies multi-hop forwarding in the context of DCC with the Gatekeeper and LIMERIC as a rate adaptation algorithm. We propose a congestion-enabled forwarding scheme that, in comparison to existing approaches considering DCC and forwarding separately, restores the efficient operation of CBF, and improves the communication performance in terms of reliability and latency for mixed data traffic composed of single- and multi-hop packets with different priorities. The simulations show the performance improvements in a freeway scenario. An analysis assesses the boundary conditions for CBF and the Gatekeeper. Moreover, the analysis corroborates the simulation.},

The proposed clustering algorithm models the problem as a matching problem between two disjoint sets of agents, namely, centroids and data points. This novel view of the clustering problem allows the proposed algorithm to be multi-objective, where each agent may have its own objective function. The proposed algorithm is used to maximize the purity and similarity in each cluster simultaneously. Our algorithm shows promising performance when tested using two different transportation datasets. The first dataset includes speed measurements along a section of Interstate 64 in the state of Virginia, while the second dataset includes the bike station status of a bike sharing system (BSS) in the San Francisco Bay Area. We clustered each dataset separately to examine how traffic and bike patterns change within clusters and then determined when and where the system would be congested or imbalanced, respectively. Using a spatial analysis of these congestion states or imbalance points, we propose potential solutions for decision makers and agencies to improve the operations of I-64 and the BSS. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces better results than classical K -means clustering algorithms when applied to our datasets with respect to a time event. The contributions of our paper are: 1) we developed a multi-objective clustering algorithm; 2) the algorithm is scalable (polynomial order), fast, and simple; and 3) the algorithm simultaneously identifies a stable number of clusters and clusters the data.},

Taking advantage of such predictive information generally produces more accurate dynamic models and better surveillance performance. This paper is concerned with the route-based dynamic modeling along with the route-aided tracking. First, the evolution of the positions across the route is formulated as a stationary Markov process from the characteristics of the route-based dynamics, which follows that the second- and third-order models of the straight-line route-based motions are constructed. This novel modeling strategy is in reverse to the conventional ones starting from the acceleration and its resultant dynamic models are easy to implement due to the linearity with respect to the system states. Second, an optimal initialization technique for route-aided tracking is proposed by utilizing the stationary process information sufficiently. Furthermore, an extension to the circular route-based dynamic modeling and a combinational modeling structure are also presented. Finally, in the context of aerial surveillance, numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic modeling and to verify the theoretical results given in the paper.},

Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) algorithm has been used here for estimating the source activations on the surface of the neo-cortex. sLORETA transforms the surface or scalp EEG data to the corresponding corticular dipole sources at each voxel on a simulated neo-cortex. For the characterization of the underlying neural patterns, approximate and sample entropies in voxels nearest to specific electrodes for different subjects and varying fatigue levels have been computed. Approximate entropy, sample entropy, and modified sample entropy are used here as the measures of complexity, similarity, and regularity in the sources. As a further investigation, these measures computed over all the stages are used to train a support vector machine, which classifies the measured values between alert and extremely fatigued states. As a result, several observations on the nature of change of the chaotic entropies are provided, and up to 86% classification accuracy is obtained.},

  abstract     = {Vigilance decrement in driving tasks has been reported to be a major factor in fatal accidents and could severely endanger public transportation safety. However, efficient approaches for estimating vigilance in real driving environment are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for implementing continuous vigilance estimation using forehead electrooculograms (EOGs) acquired by wearable dry electrodes in both simulated and real driving environments. To improve the feasibility of this approach for real-world applications, a forehead EOG-based electrode placement with only four electrodes is designed. Flexible dry electrodes and an acquisition board are integrated as a wearable device for recording EOGs. Twenty and ten subjects participated in the simulated and real-world driving environment experiments, respectively. Accurate eye movement parameters from eye-tracking glasses are extracted to calculate the PERCLOS index for vigilance annotation. This is because the vigilance state is a temporally dynamic process, and a continuous conditional random field and a continuous conditional neural field are introduced to construct more accurate vigilance estimation models. To evaluate the efficiency of our system, systematic experiments are performed in real scenarios under various illumination and weather conditions following laboratory simulations as preliminary studies. The experimental results demonstrate that the wearable dry electrode prototype, which has a relatively comfortable forehead setup, can efficiently capture vigilance dynamics. The best mean correlation coefficients achieved by our proposed approach are 71.18% and 66.20% in laboratory simulations and real-world driving environments, respectively. The cross-environment experiments are performed to evaluate the simulated-to-real generalization and a best mean correlation coefficient of 53.96% is achieved.},

The main challenge is the high mobility of vehicles. In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm for quickly discovering neighbor node in such a dynamic environment. The proposed rapid discovery algorithm is based on a novel mobility prediction model using Kalman filter theory, where each vehicular node has a prediction model to predict its own and its neighbors&#39; mobility. This is achieved by considering the nodes&#39; temporal and spatial movement features. The prediction algorithm is reinforced with threshold triggered location broadcast messages, which will update the prediction model parameters, and improve the efficiency of the neighbor discovery algorithm. Through extensive simulations, the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency properties of our proposed algorithm are demonstrated. Compared with other methods of neighbor discovery, which are frequently used in HP-AODV, ARH, and ROMSG, the proposed algorithm needs the least overheads and can reach the lowest neighbor error rate while improving the accuracy rate of neighbor discovery. In general, the comparative analysis of different neighbor discovery methods in routing protocol is obtained, which shows that the proposed solution performs better than HP-AODV, ARH, and ROMSG.},

  abstract     = {The increasing integration of electric vehicles (EVs) is adding higher future potentials for the smart grid because the residual energy stored in EV batteries can be discharged to support the grid when needed. However, the stochasticity of EV user behaviors pose challenges to the regulators of distribution systems. How the regulators decide upon a control strategy for the vehicle to grid and how EV users respond to the strategy will significantly influence the variation of load profiles in the planning horizon. In this paper, a comprehensive cost analysis is performed to obtain the optimal planning scheme, considering the variation in EV penetration, charging preference, and customer damage cost. The economics and stability of the planned distribution system are assessed with real-world travel records and cost statistics to quantitatively show the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm and the importance of user behavior concern.},

  abstract     = {Secure message dissemination is an important issue in vehicular networks, especially considering the vulnerability of vehicle-to-vehicle message dissemination to malicious attacks. Traditional security mechanisms, largely based on message encryption and key management, can only guarantee secure message exchanges between a known source and destination pairs. In vehicular networks, however, every vehicle may learn its surrounding environment and contributes as a source, while in the meantime, acting as a destination or a relay of information from other vehicles, and message exchanges often occur between “stranger” vehicles. This makes secure message dissemination against malicious tampering much more intricate. For secure message dissemination in vehicular networks against insider attackers, who may tamper the content of the disseminated messages, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the transmitted messages becomes a major concern which the traditional message encryption and key management-based approaches fall short to provide. However, it is challenging for a vehicle to distinguish which message is true when the messages received from multiple nearby vehicles are conflicting. In this paper, by incorporating the underlying network topology information, we propose an optimal decision algorithm that is able to maximize the chance of making a correct decision on the message content, assuming the prior knowledge of the percentage of malicious vehicles in the network. Furthermore, a novel heuristic decision algorithm is proposed that can make decisions without the aforementioned knowledge of the percentage of malicious vehicles. The simulations are conducted to compare the security performance achieved by our proposed decision algorithms with that achieved by the existing ones that do not consider or only partially consider the topological information to verify the effectiveness of the algorithms. Our results show that by incorporating the network topology information, the security performance can be much improved. This paper sheds light on the optimum algorithm design for secure message dissemination.},

As a result of this situation, this paper proposes a method that detects obstacles behind a vehicle using a rearview camera with a fisheye lens. The proposed method represents obstacles by means of the Stixel World, and it consists of two stages: free space boundary detection and obstacle height estimation. In the first stage, obstacles are three-dimensionally reconstructed, and the 3D points are spatially interpolated and sequentially accumulated. An occupancy grid map is generated with depth and incidence angle axes to effectively handle a wide field-of-view situation. In the second stage, this method combines some complementary information to reliably estimate the obstacle height using spare 3D points. Three cost maps based on 3D points, color similarity, and edge strength are calculated and fused in height and incidence angle axes. The free space boundary and the obstacle height are estimated by finding the optimal paths in the occupancy grid map and the fused cost map, respectively. Finally, Stixels are generated by integrating the free space boundary and obstacle height. In the experiment, the proposed method was quantitatively evaluated and compared with the previous methods in various road, obstacle, and background conditions.},

Such tasks involve studying the dynamic accessibility of the urban structures over multiple geospatial and temporal constraints, which is an important topic in geographical sciences and urban transportation. In this paper, we present a new computational model and a visualization system that help domain users to interactively study the jointly constrained accessible regions, street segments, and Points of Interest (POIs). In particular, Urban Structure Accessibility Visualization system is built upon a new Min-Max Joint Set model, where specifically designed set operations not only represent the accessible regions but also compute the minimum and maximum access times to urban structures from the joint constraints. The computation and visualization are supported by a new graph model that accommodates the real-world dynamic traffic situation and the geographical settings of urban street segments and POIs. The visualization system allows the users to conveniently construct and manage accessible regions and visually explore the urban structures inside them.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a four-wheel electric braking system configuration is proposed for electric vehicles and its braking performance is compared with other conventional braking system configurations at different initial vehicle speeds and different road conditions in the case of emergency braking. In order to make the vehicle wheel slip ratio track the optimal slip ratio, a control method that combines sliding mode control and extended state observer is designed. Neural-network sliding mode control is designed for the driver&#39;s braking command tracking in the normal braking condition. In order to improve braking energy recovery, a new braking torque distribution strategy is developed for the proposed four-wheel electric braking system based on the motor characteristics and vehicle dynamics. The designed braking torque distribution strategy is able to improve the energy recovery by adjusting the braking torque distribution ratio between the front and rear wheel braking torque while tracking the driver&#39;s braking command. Numerical simulations have been conducted and the simulation results show that although the braking performance of the four-wheel electric braking system is worse than the conventional braking system at high initial braking speed, it still is able to meet the vehicle braking international standards and simplifies the braking system structure and saves cost. The proposed braking torque distribution strategy can improve energy recovery efficiency compared with the average allocation strategy and deceleration based allocation strategy. The simulation results show that the four-wheel electric braking system configuration with the proposed braking torque distribution strategy is suitable for low to medium speed light electric vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Recently, vehicle type recognition in surveillance images with deep learning has received significant attention in various applications of intelligent transportation systems. However, annotating large-scale images from many surveillance images is tedious and time-consuming, which impedes its application in the real world. This paper aims to resolve this problem by reducing manual labeling in surveillance images, and then maximizing the effect of the few tagged data. Thus, a deep active learning method with a new query strategy is proposed in this paper for vehicle type recognition in surveillance images. First, the proposed method constructs a memory space using a large-scale fully labeled auxiliary dataset collected from the Internet. Subsequently, two metrics, the similarity measurement in memory space and the entropy, are used to simultaneously emphasize the diversity and uncertainty in the query strategy. Moreover, an additional label-consistent term apart from the hyper-parameters is used to adaptively adjust the combination of the two principles in active learning. The proposed method was evaluated on the Comprehensive Cars dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method could effectively reduce the annotation cost by up to 40% in surveillance vehicle type recognition compared with the random selection method.},

Over the last few decades, the popularization of vehicle navigation systems has brought the era of big data to the taxi industry. Existing destination prediction approaches are mainly based on various Markov chain models or trip matching ideas, which require geographical information and may encounter the problem of data sparsity. Other machine learning prediction models are still unsatisfactory in providing favorable results. In this paper, first, we propose use of a novel and efficient data embedding method for time-related feature pre-processing. The key idea behind this is to embed the data into a two-dimensional space before feature selection. Second, we propose use of a novel data-driven ensemble learning approach for destination prediction. This approach combines the respective superiorities of support vector regression and deep learning at different segments of the whole trajectory. Our experiments are conducted on two real data sets to demonstrate that the proposed ensemble learning model can get superior performance for taxi destination prediction. Comparisons also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed data embedding method in the deep learning model.},

We observe this complex phenomena through the interactions between vehicles exchanging messages via vehicle to vehicle communication. Results are based on real-time simulation generated scenarios extended from the real-world traffic travel and activity patterns simulation cologne scenario. We evaluate a voting procedure that provides deeper insights using cooperation between vehicles, belief functions (BF) aimed at improving representation of information and a data association technique (DAT) aimed at data mining and extracting the association rules from the exchanged messages. Methods are tested and compared using a microscopic urban mobility simulator, SUMO, and a network simulator, ns-2, for the simulation of communication between CVs. Compared with the back-propagation algorithm (BP) extensively used in the past literature, our performance evaluation shows that the proposed methods enhance the estimation of the cause of congestion by 48% for the proposed VP, 58% for the BF, 71% for the DAT, and 70% for β-DAT. The methods also enhance detection time from 7.09% to 10.3%, and β-DAT outperforms BP by approximately 1.25% less false alarms triggered by the network, which can be significant in the context of real-time decision making. We show that a market penetration rate between 63% and 75% is enough to ensure satisfactory performance.},

A discrete-time preview controller is then designed on the top of a linear augmented error system, in which the disturbances within a finite preview window are augmented as part of the state vector. The obtained optimal steering control law is in an analytic form and consists of two parts: 1) a feedback control responding to tracking errors and 2) a feedforward control dealing with the future road curvatures. The designed control&#39;s nature, capacity, computation load, and underlying mechanism are revealed by the analysis of system responses in the time domain and the frequency domain, theoretical steady-state error, and comparison with the model predictive control (MPC). The algorithm was implemented on an automated vehicle platform, a hybrid Lincoln MKZ.

First, the different vehicular sensing and communication technologies and their protocol stacks, to provide reliable information to the information-aware CAV controller, are thoroughly discussed. Diverse human factors, such as user comfort, preferences, and reliability, to design the CAV systems for mass adaptation are also discussed. Then, the different layers of a CAV controller (route planning, driving mode execution, and driving model selection) considering human factors and information through connectivity are reviewed. In addition, the critical challenges for the sensing and communication technologies, human factors, and information-aware controller are identified to support the design of a safe and efficient CAV system while considering user acceptance and comfort. Finally, the promising future research directions of these three aspects are discussed to overcome existing challenges to realize a safe and operationally efficient CAV.},
