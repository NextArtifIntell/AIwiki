  abstract     = {A key problem in the formation control of homogeneous multiagent systems is the collision-free convergence of the agent positions into a desired formation. It is a typical NP-hard problem by considering the problem as optimizing the assignment of multiple destinations to the same number of agents deployed in an open space. It becomes even harder if the collision avoidance is required during the motion of agents, and thus, a suboptimal but efficient solution is adequate. The traditional methods make it by accurate preplanning of the motion trajectory of each single agent, or simply letting them reach an equilibrium as a tradeoff between the collision avoidance and the desired formation. In this article, a distributed control algorithm embedded with an assignment switch scheme is proposed to guarantee that the asymptotic convergence to the desired formation is achieved with no collisions between agents. By the proposed algorithm, the agents keep moving in straight lines toward their respective destinations until they are going to collide if they do not stop, at which moment the agents will communicate their information locally to switch their destination assignments so that they will continue to move in different directions and avoid potential collisions. Distributed control rules are also defined to confine the motion space of each agent for collision avoidance. It has been rigorously proven that the positions of all agents converge to the desired formation with no collision under random initial deployment. In addition, a detailed parameter design procedure is provided for both setting and controlling of the formation. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations and actual experiments in the outdoor environment are implemented and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) integrates the benefits of human operator and a collaborative robot in tasks involving physical interaction, with the aim of increasing the task performance. However, the design of interaction controllers that achieve safe and transparent operations is challenging, mainly due to the contradicting nature of these objectives. Knowing that attaining perfect transparency is practically unachievable, controllers that allow better compromise between these objectives are desirable. In this article, we propose a multicriteria optimization framework, which jointly optimizes the stability robustness and transparency of a closed-loop pHRI system for a given interaction controller. In particular, we propose a Pareto optimization framework that allows the designer to make informed decisions by thoroughly studying the tradeoff between stability robustness and transparency. The proposed framework involves a search over the discretized controller parameter space to compute the Pareto front curve and a selection of controller parameters that yield maximum attainable transparency and stability robustness by studying this tradeoff curve. The proposed framework not only leads to the design of an optimal controller, but also enables a fair comparison among different interaction controllers. In order to demonstrate the practical use of the proposed approach, integer and fractional order admittance controllers are studied as a case study and compared both analytically and experimentally. The experimental results validate the proposed design framework and show that the achievable transparency under fractional order admittance controller is higher than that of integer order one, when both controllers are designed to ensure the same level of stability robustness.},

  abstract     = {Energy efficiency is a crucial issue towards long-term deployment of compliant robots in the real world. In the context of variable impedance actuators (VIAs), one of the main focuses has been on improving energy efficiency through reduction of energy consumption. However, the harvesting of dissipated energy in such systems remains under-explored. This study proposes a variable damping module design enabling energy regeneration in VIAs by exploiting the regenerative braking effect of dc motors. The proposed damping module uses four switches to combine regenerative and dynamic braking, in a hybrid approach that enables energy regeneration without a reduction in the range of damping achievable. A physical implementation on a simple VIA mechanism is presented in which the regenerative properties of the proposed module are characterized and compared against theoretical predictions. To investigate the role of variable regenerative damping in terms of energy efficiency of long-term operation, experiments are reported in which the VIA, equipped with the proposed damping module, performs sequential reaching to a series of stochastic targets. The results indicate that the combination of variable stiffness and variable regenerative damping results in a 25\% performance improvement on metrics incorporating reaching accuracy, settling time, energy consumption and regeneration over comparable schemes, where either stiffness or damping are fixed.},

To this end, a random-set-based local SLAM approach is undertaken at each vehicle by regarding the map as a random finite set and updating the first-order moment, called probability hypothesis density (PHD), of its multiobject density. Consensus on map PHDs is adopted in order to spread the map information through the team of vehicles also taking into account the different and time-varying fields of view of the team members. The convergence of the consensus strategy is analyzed theoretically, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed on both simulated and experimental datasets.

Their success is mainly related to the improved robustness to image nonideal conditions (e.g., blur, high or low contrast, texture-poor scenarios). However, most of the data-driven State-of-the-Art (SotA) approaches do not provide any kind of information about the uncertainty of their estimates, which is crucial to effectively integrate them into robotic navigation systems. Inspired by this considerations, we propose uncertainty-aware VO (UA-VO), a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture that computes relative pose predictions by processing sequence of images and, at the same time, provides uncertainty measures about those estimations. The confidence measure computed by UA-VO considers both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties and accounts for heteroscedasticity, i.e., it is sample-dependent. We assess the benefits of UA-VO with different typology of experiments on three publicly available datasets and on a brand new set of sequences, we gathered to extend the evaluation.},

We present complex (CPL)-SLAM, an efficient and certifiably correct algorithm to solve planar graph-based SLAM using the complex number representation. We formulate and simplify planar graph-based SLAM as the maximum likelihood estimation on the product of unit complex numbers, and relax this nonconvex quadratic complex optimization problem to convex complex semidefinite programming (SDP). Furthermore, we simplify the corresponding complex SDP to Riemannian staircase optimization (RSO) on the complex oblique manifold that can be solved with the Riemannian trust region method. In addition, we prove that the SDP relaxation and RSO simplification are tight as long as the noise magnitude is below a certain threshold. The efficacy of this work is validated through applications of CPL-SLAM and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods on planar graph-based SLAM, which indicates that our proposed algorithm is capable of solving planar graph-based SLAM certifiably, and is more efficient in numerical computation and more robust to measurement noise than existing state-of-the-art methods.

In this article, we provide the first dynamic model for concentric tube continuum robots by adapting the partial differential equations of a dynamic Cosserat rod to describe the coupled inertial dynamics of precurved concentric tubes. This generates an initial-boundary-value problem that can capture robot vibrations over time. We solve this model numerically at high time resolutions using implicit finite differences in time and arc length. This approach is capable of resolving the high-frequency torsional dynamics that occur during unstable “snapping” motions and provides a simulation tool that can track the true robot configuration through such transitions. Furthermore, it can track slower oscillations associated with bending and torsion as a robot interacts with tissue at real-time speeds. Experimental verification of the model shows that this wide range of effects is captured efficiently and accurately.},

Multiway data association methods provide a mechanism to improve alignment accuracy of pairwise associations and ensure their consistency. However, existing methods that solve this computationally challenging problem are often too slow for real-time applications. Furthermore, some of the existing techniques can violate the cycle consistency principle, thus drastically reducing the fusion accuracy. This article presents the consistent lifting, embedding, and alignment rectification (CLEAR) algorithm to address these issues. By leveraging insights from the multiway matching and spectral graph clustering literature, CLEAR provides cycle-consistent and accurate solutions in a computationally efficient manner. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets are carried out to demonstrate the scalability and superior performance of our algorithm in real-world problems. This algorithmic framework can provide significant improvement in the accuracy and efficiency of existing discrete assignment problems, which traditionally use pairwise (but potentially inconsistent) correspondences.

This style of actuation presents several possible benefits over modern actuation styles in emerging robotic prosthetic legs, which include free-swinging knee motion, compliance with the ground, negligible unmodeled actuator dynamics, less acoustic noise, and power regeneration. Benchtop tests establish that both joints can be backdriven by small torques ($\sim$1-3 N$\cdot$m) and confirm the small reflected inertia. Impedance control tests prove that the intrinsic impedance and unmodeled dynamics of the actuator are sufficiently small to control joint impedance without torque feedback or lengthy tuning trials. Walking experiments validate performance under the designed loading conditions with minimal tuning. Finally, the regenerative abilities, low friction, and small reflected inertia of the presented actuators reduced power consumption and acoustic noise compared to state-of-the-art powered legs.},

Unlike current methods, the approach can estimate both the position and size in parallel with a single straight trajectory. Neither multipolarization nor reactive self-alignment control are necessary to locate the object. The approach is a purely model-based heuristic that selects the best ellipsoid parameters among a set of potential candidates. It is based on a set of four electric measurements recorded at several positions along the robot trajectory along which the displacement is measured. The efhciency of the method is assessed over numerous experiments with different objects, several positions, and orientations, and two different kinds of water (fresh and salt water). Despite some model simplifications and experimental errors, location and size estimation errors are on average below 1 cm and 15\%, respectively, while offering promising perspectives for real-time computation.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the static workspace (SW) of aerial cable towed robots (ACTRs) with land-fixed winches and provides an optimization approach to maximize the size of such a workspace. In the structure of the studied robots, land-fixed winches beside the ACTRs, actuated by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are used to manipulate a platform to reach high-altitude poses and balance platform&#39;s interaction force/moment in such poses. Capability of UAVs in choosing and holding different positions and orientations enables the studied robots to adapt their available net wrench set (AW) to various required net wrench sets. In order to find the SW of ACTRs with land-fixed winches, at first, AW of a generic robot for a given arrangement of UAVs is developed analytically. Then, a geometrical approach is provided to find all collision-free arrangements of the UAVs. Based on that, a performance index is derived and optimized to find an optimal collision-free arrangement of the UAVs, which maximizes the magnitude of the force that can be balanced by the platform in any arbitrary direction. Finally, the application of the proposed optimization approach in size maximization of the SW is shown in an example.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a model predictive controller (MPC) developed for the autonomous steering of concentric tube robots (CTRs). State-of-the-art CTR control relies on differential kinematics developed by local linearization of the CTRs mechanics model and cannot explicitly handle constraints on robot&#39;s joint limits or unstable configurations commonly known as snapping points. The proposed nonlinear MPC explicitly considers constraints on the robot configuration space (i.e., joint limits) and the robot&#39;s workspace (i.e., mixed boundary conditions on robot curvature). Additionally, the MPC calculates control decisions by optimizing the model-based predictions of future robot configurations. This way, it avoids configurations it cannot recover from, i.e., joint limits, singular configurations, and snapping. The proposed controller is evaluated via simulations and experimental studies with a variety of trajectories of increasing complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of MPC to avoid singularities while satisfying robot mechanical constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution enables following of trajectories unattainable by state-of-the-art controllers with mean error corresponding to 1\% of robot arclength.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic model has broad applications in motion planning, feedforward controller design, and disturbance observer design. Particularly, with the increasing application of model-based control in industrial robots, there has been a resurgence of research interest in accurate identification of dynamic models. However, on the one hand, most existing identification methods directly rely on least squares or weighted least squares (WLS), which suffer from outliers and could lead to physical infeasible solutions. On the other hand, nonlinearity of the friction model is seldom treated in a unified way with linear regression. Moreover, recent researches have shown that proper exciting trajectories are crucial to the identification accuracy, but few of previous works take measurement noise into consideration when optimizing the exciting trajectories. In this article, we propose an iterative approach which integrates WLS, iteratively reweighted least squares with linear matrix inequality constraints, and nonlinear friction models so that the above-mentioned issues can be properly solved altogether. Our research also reveals that performance can be improved by including priori knowledge of measurement noise in the optimization of exciting trajectories. The proposed approach is supported by experimental analysis of four different combinations within the framework on a 6-DoF industrial robot.},

In this task, an agent has to navigate in an environment to reach a user specified target, only through vision. Recent fruitful approaches rely on deep reinforcement learning, which has proven to be an effective framework to learn navigation policies. However, current state-of-the-art methods require to retrain, or at least fine-tune, the model for every new environment and object. In real scenarios, this operation can be extremely challenging or even dangerous. For these reasons, we address generalization in target-driven visual navigation by proposing a novel architecture composed of two networks, both exclusively trained in simulation. The first one has the objective of exploring the environment, while the other one of locating the target. They are specifically designed to work together, while separately trained to help generalization. In this article, we test our agent in both simulated and real scenarios, and validate its generalization capabilities through extensive experiments with previously unseen goals and unknown mazes, even much larger than the ones used for training.},

The proposed system is built upon on the classical teach-and-repeat framework, which is widely adopted in infrastructure inspection, aerial transportation, and search-and-rescue. For these applications, a human&#39;s intention is essential for deciding the topological structure of the flight trajectory of the drone. However, poor teaching trajectories and changing environments prevent a simple teach-and-repeat system from being applied flexibly and robustly. In this article, instead of commanding the drone to precisely follow a teaching trajectory, we propose a method to automatically convert a human-piloted trajectory, which can be arbitrarily jerky, to a topologically equivalent one. The generated trajectory is guaranteed to be smooth, safe, and dynamically feasible, with a human preferable aggressiveness. Also, to avoid unmapped or moving obstacles during flights, a fast local perception method and a sliding-windowed replanning method are integrated into our system, to generate safe and dynamically feasible local trajectories onboard. We name our system as teach-repeat-replan. It can capture users&#39; intention of a flight mission, convert an arbitrarily jerky teaching path to a smooth repeating trajectory, and generate safe local replans to avoid unexpected collisions. The proposed planning system is integrated into a complete autonomous quadrotor with global and local perception and localization submodules. Our system is validated by performing aggressive flights in challenging indoor/outdoor environments. We release all components in our quadrotor system as open-source ros packages.},

  abstract     = {Designing a hummingbird-inspired, at-scale, tail-less flapping-wing micro aerial vehicle (FWMAV) is a challenging task in order to achieve animallike flight performance under the constraints of size, weight, power, and actuation limitations. It is even more challenging to design such a vehicle with a pair of independently controlled wings equipped with a total of only two actuators. This article details a systematic solution for the design optimization and prototyping of such FWMAVs. The proposed solution covers the complete system models and analysis of wing-actuation dynamics, control authorities, body dynamics, mechanical limitations, and electrical constraints. Each subsystem, as well as the overall system, is experimentally validated. This comprehensive approach can facilitate the design of such FWMAVs with different optimization goals. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in this article, we conduct three different design optimization tasks, which yield three different prototype systems: optimizing the lift-to-weight ratio, optimizing control bandwidth, and optimizing control authority. We first construct a vehicle with an optimized lift-to-weight ratio. Based on it, the other two platforms with different design optimization goals are presented for better flight performance. Flight tests were performed on each prototype to validate their flight performance and design goals. Compared to optimized control bandwidth, we demonstrate that the vehicle with optimized control authorities is significantly more capable in terms of flight performance. It shows sustained stable flight in both hovering and heavy load carrying (more than 60\% of the vehicle&#39;s total weight), which is hard for the other two platforms to achieve.},

  abstract     = {To date, many gait generation strategies have been designed for robots with leg configurations that model those of natural creatures. However, their leg configurations are limited to the 2 × N type, such as hexapod or myriapod; hence, simultaneously, the potential ability of legged robots is implicitly limited. We consider single-legged modular robots that can be arranged to form a cluster with arbitrary 2-D leg configurations. By choosing configurations appropriately, these robots have the potential to perform several types of tasks, as is the case for reconfigurable modular robots. However, to use appropriate configurations for a given task, a unified gait generation system for various configurations of a cluster is required. In this article, we propose an autonomous distributed control system for each single-legged modular robot to collectively achieve static walking of the cluster with various leg configurations on planar ground. Moreover, our system is an autonomous distributed system with scalability and fault tolerance, in which each module determines the moving pattern of its foot through local communication without global information, such as the entire leg configuration of the cluster. We verified that several types of clusters achieved static walking using our system not only in dynamic simulations, but also in real robot experiments.},

One major impediment is that the intermediate policy during the training procedure may result in behaviors that are not only harmful to the system itself but also to the environment. In essence, imposing safety guarantees for learning algorithms is vital for autonomous systems acting in the real world. In this article, we propose a computationally effective and general safe learning framework, specifically for complex dynamical systems. With a proper definition of the safe region, a supervisory control strategy, which switches the actions applied on the system between the learning-based controller and a predefined corrective controller, is given. A simplified system facilitates the estimation of the safe region for the high-dimensional dynamical system. During the learning phase, the belief of the safe region is updated with the actual execution results of the corrective controller, which in turn enables the learning-based controller to have more freedom in choosing its actions. Two examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework, one simple inverted pendulum to illustrate the online adaptation method, and one quadcopter control task to show the overall performance.},

This method is the first to empower agents with the ability to plan online in hybrid spaces; optimizing over discrete contact locations, contact sequence patterns, continuous trajectories, and force profiles for co-manipulation tasks. This is particularly important in large object co-manipulation that requires changes of grasp-holds and plan adaptation.

Experimental results demonstrate that the electrical regenerative energy per step is 1.53 ± 0.29 J on average.

Each robot is equipped with laser range sensors, and it builds its occupancy grid map by repeatedly combining its own distance measurements with map information that is broadcast by neighboring robots. Using results on average consensus over time-varying graph topologies, we prove that all robots&#39; maps will eventually converge to the actual map of the environment. In addition, we demonstrate that a technique based on topological data analysis, developed in our previous work for generating topological maps, can be readily extended for adaptive thresholding of occupancy grid maps.

We formulate physical constraints that constrain the maximum and minimum length of each actuator, the minimum distance between unconnected actuators, the minimum angle between connected actuators, and constraints that ensure the robot avoids singular configurations. We present two planning algorithms that allow a linear actuator robot to locomote. The first algorithm repeatedly solves a nonlinear optimization problem online to move the robot&#39;s center of mass in a desired direction for one time step. This algorithm can be used for an arbitrary linear actuator robot but does not guarantee persistent feasibility.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose an online 3-D planning algorithm for a drone to race competitively against a single adversary drone. The algorithm computes an approximation of the Nash equilibrium in the joint space of trajectories of the two drones at each time step, and proceeds in a receding horizon fashion. The algorithm uses a novel sensitivity term, within an iterative best response computational scheme, to approximate the amount by which the adversary will yield to the ego drone to avoid a collision. This leads to racing trajectories that are more competitive than without the sensitivity term. We prove that the fixed point of this sensitivity enhanced iterative best response satisfies the first-order optimality conditions of a Nash equilibrium. We present results of a simulation study of races with 2-D and 3-D race courses, showing that our game theoretic planner significantly outperforms a model predictive control (MPC) racing algorithm. We also present results of multiple drone racing experiments on a 3-D track in which drones sense each others&#39; relative position with onboard vision. The proposed game theoretic planner again outperforms the MPC opponent in these experiments where drones reach speeds up to 1.25 m/s.},

  abstract     = {An accurate characterization of pose uncertainty is essential for safe autonomous navigation. Early pose uncertainty characterization methods proposed by Smith, Self, and Cheeseman (SCC) used coordinate-based first-order methods to propagate uncertainty through nonlinear functions such as pose composition (head-to-tail), pose inversion, and relative pose extraction (tail-to-tail). Characterizing uncertainty in the Lie algebra of the special Euclidean group results in better uncertainty estimates. However, existing Lie-group-based uncertainty propagation techniques assume that individual poses are independent. After solving a pose graph, however, the entire trajectory is jointly distributed as factors induce correlation. Hence, the independence assumption does not capture reality. In addition, prior work has focused primarily on the pose composition operation. This article develops a framework for modeling the uncertainty of jointly distributed poses and describes how to perform the equivalent of the SSC pose operations while characterizing uncertainty in the Lie algebra. Evaluation on simulated and open-source datasets shows that the proposed methods result in more accurate uncertainty estimates and thus more accurate filtering of potential loop closures. An accompanying C++ library implementation is also released.},

The proposed approach takes advantage of the robustness properties of sliding mode control (SMC) and the prediction capabilities of model predictive control (MPC). SMC theory is employed to compensate unmodeled system dynamics and disturbances, ensuring accurate tracking and enforcement of a desired end-point impedance during interaction with the environment. Differently from other schemes, the sliding manifold is expressed directly in the task space and the approach is generalized to redundant manipulators by projection of the manifolds into joint space. Chattering attenuation is provided by a second-order integral sliding mode control law. These features are exploited by the MPC to guarantee motion and actuation constraint fulfillment based on the nominal feedback linearized robot model. A formal analysis of the control system is given along with the relevant proofs. The resulting model predictive sliding mode controller is able to cope with delays acting on the control input torque. The effectiveness of the approach is validated in simulation on a 4-DOF planar robot, and its viability on real platforms through experiments on a 7-DOF prototype ABB YuMi robot arm.},

When the Frobenius norm is taken as the measure of closeness, the solution is usually computed using the singular value decomposition (SVD). A closed-form formula exists but, as it involves the roots of a polynomial of third degree, it is assumed to be too complicated and numerically ill-conditioned. In this article, we show how, by carefully using some algebraic recipes scattered in the literature, it is possible to derive a simple and yet numerically stable formula for most practical applications. Moreover, by relying on a result that permits obtaining the quaternion corresponding to the sought optimal rotation matrix, we present another closed-form formula that provides a good approximation to the optimal one using only the elementary algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These two closed-form formulas are compared with respect to the SVD in terms of accuracy and computational cost.},

We use this flow-field to achieve noncontact manipulation of nonmagnetic microbeads with average diameter of 30 μm in 2-D space. Our noncontact manipulation strategy capitalizes on exerting a rotational magnetic torque on the magnetic dipole of the microrobot. The induced flow-field enables microbeads in the surrounding fluid to orbit the microrobot along a sprocketlike trajectory due to a periodic and asymmetric flow-field caused by the two tails. A hydrodynamic model of the two-tailed microrobot and the orbiting microbeads is developed based on the method of regularized Stokeslets for computing Stokes flows. The relations between the angular velocity of the orbiting microbeads and the rotation frequency of the microrobot, their proximity (p), and tail length ratio of the microrobots are studied theoretically and experimentally. Our simulations and experimental results show that the angular velocity of the orbiting microbeads decreases nearly as | p | -2 with the distance to the microrobot and its tail length ratio. We also demonstrate closed-loop control of the microbeads toward target positions along sprocketlike trajectories with an average position error of 23.1 ± 9.1 μm (n = 10), and show the ability to swim away without affecting the positioning accuracy after manipulation.},

Throwing has the potential to increase the physical reachability and picking speed of a robot arm. However, precisely throwing arbitrary objects in unstructured settings presents many challenges: from acquiring objects in grasps suitable for reliable throwing, to handling varying object-centric properties (e.g., mass distribution, friction, shape) and complex aerodynamics. In this work, we propose an end-to-end formulation that jointly learns to infer control parameters for grasping and throwing motion primitives from visual observations (RGB-D images of arbitrary objects in a bin) through trial and error. Within this formulation, we investigate the synergies between grasping and throwing (i.e., learning grasps that enable more accurate throws) and between simulation and deep learning (i.e., using deep networks to predict residuals on top of control parameters predicted by a physics simulator). The resulting system, TossingBot, is able to grasp and successfully throw arbitrary objects into boxes located outside its maximum reach range at 500+ mean picks per hour (600+ grasps per hour with 85\% throwing accuracy); and generalizes to new objects and target locations.},

After formulating both manipulators and actuators as geometry elements, deformation can be efficiently computed by solving a constrained optimization problem. Because of its efficiency, forward and inverse kinematics for soft manipulators can be solved by an iterative algorithm with a low computational cost. Meanwhile, components with multiple materials can also be geometrically modeled in our framework with the help of a simple calibration.

Despite the large utility, camera attributes have been empirically determined to function in a highly passive manner, yielding vision algorithm failure under radical illumination variance. Recent studies have proposed exposure and gain control schemes that could maximize image information and eschew saturation. In this article, we propose a proactive control scheme for the camera&#39;s two dominant attributes-exposure time and gain control. Unlike existing approaches, we formulate this camera attribute control as an optimization problem in which the underlying function is not known a priori. We first define a new metric of the image regarding these two major attributes to include both image gradients and signal-to-noise ratio simultaneously. Based on this metric, we introduce a new formulation for this attribute control via Bayesian optimization (BO) and learn the environmental change from the captured image. During the control, to mitigate the burden of image acquisition and Bayesian optimization, images are synthesized using a camera response function and avoided the actual frame grab from the camera. The proposed method was validated in light-flickering indoor, outdoor near sunset, and indoor-outdoor transient environments where light changes rapidly, supporting 20-40 Hz frame rates.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present an automatic pose generation approach for robotic 3-D scanning systems designed for the reverse engineering of mechanical parts. 3-D scanning of an object is usually a highly complicated process that involves aligning multiple measurements from different viewpoints, fusing the merged data, and finally reconstructing the underlying surface. The reconstruction is often performed in isolation to the acquisition step. In contrast, the measured data often exhibit holes owing to limited viewpoints or noises in measurements, which can be observed after the postprocessing. Previous approaches either use the predefined scan paths without knowledge of the actual surface, or calculate the scan path based on the approximated smooth surface enclosing the incomplete scanned measurement. The need for an accurate 3-D scanning of mechanical parts often arises for reverse engineering purposes, as their shape often exhibits sharp corners or continuous shape of primitives (planes, cylinders, etc.), which the existing pipelines do not consider. We suggest a 3-D scan pipeline specifically designed to generate optimal scan paths of mechanical parts from incomplete data with limited fields of view. Our pipeline detects primitives from the scanned partial data, and utilizes the detection to approximate the underlying shape of the ground truth object; thus, it suggests the next-best-view of the scanner from the scarce measurements. In this regard, the suggested method is the first working pipeline specifically designed for scanning mechanical parts; furthermore, it outperforms previous approaches in terms of an efficient scan path generation.},

  abstract     = {Ophthalmic microsurgery is technically difficult because the scale of required surgical tool manipulations challenge the limits of the surgeon&#39;s visual acuity, sensory perception, and physical dexterity. Intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging with micrometer-scale resolution is increasingly being used to monitor and provide enhanced real-time visualization of ophthalmic surgical maneuvers, but surgeons still face physical limitations when manipulating instruments inside the eye. Autonomously controlled robots are one avenue for overcoming these physical limitations. In this article, we demonstrate the feasibility of using learning from demonstration and reinforcement learning with an industrial robot to perform OCT-guided corneal needle insertions in an ex vivo model of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) surgery. Our reinforcement learning agent trained on ex vivo human corneas, then outperformed surgical fellows in reaching a target needle insertion depth in mock corneal surgery trials. This article shows the combination of learning from demonstration and reinforcement learning is a viable option for performing OCT-guided robotic ophthalmic surgery.},

Motivated by this problem, we introduce counting temporal logics-formal languages that enable concise expression of multirobot task specifications over possibly infinite horizons in this article. We first introduce a general logic called counting linear temporal logic plus (cLTL+), and propose an optimization-based method that generates individual trajectories such that satisfaction of a given cLTL+ formula is guaranteed when these trajectories are synchronously executed. We then introduce a fragment of cLTL+, called counting linear temporal logic (cLTL), and show that a solution to a planning problem with cLTL constraints can be obtained more efficiently if all robots have identical dynamics. In the second part of this article, we relax the synchrony assumption and discuss how to generate trajectories that can be asynchronously executed, while preserving the satisfaction of the desired cLTL+ specification. In particular, we show that when the asynchrony between robots is bounded, the method presented in this article can be modified to generate robust trajectories. We demonstrate these ideas with an experiment and provide numerical results that showcase the scalability of the method.},

The method uses as prediction model a dynamically extended Linear Inverted Pendulum with Zero Moment Point (ZMP) velocities as control inputs, producing in real time a gait (including footsteps with timing) that realizes omnidirectional motion commands coming from an external source. The stability constraint links future ZMP velocities to the current state so as to guarantee that the generated Center of Mass (CoM) trajectory is bounded with respect to the ZMP trajectory. Being the MPC control horizon finite, only part of the future ZMP velocities are decision variables; the remaining part, called tail, must be either conjectured or anticipated using preview information on the reference motion. Several options for the tail are discussed, each corresponding to a specific terminal constraint. A feasibility analysis of the generic MPC iteration is developed and used to obtain sufficient conditions for recursive feasibility. Finally, we prove that recursive feasibility guarantees stability of the CoM/ZMP dynamics. Simulation and experimental results on NAO and HRP-4 are presented to highlight the performance of IS-MPC.},

In this article, we address the issue by taking advantage of the geometric constraints among the multiple sensors. An online method is proposed to estimate the initial values of velocity, gravity, IMU biases, and simultaneously calibrate the extrinsic parameters of camera-camera and camera-IMU pairs for bootstrapping a smoothing-based stereo VIO system. The method includes a three-step process to incrementally solve several linear equations in a coarse-to-fine manner. It back-propagates historically estimated results to update weight factors and remove outliers, and employs a convergence criterion to monitor and terminate the process. It also includes an optional global optimization for further refinement. The method is evaluated in terms of accuracy, robustness, convergence, consistency, and tunable parameters using both simulated and public datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the initial values and the extrinsic parameters.},

However, searching for a global optimum morphology in an intensely nonlinear design space is difficult, especially if stochastic seeding is used. In contrast to optimization, we encode design requirements into a polynomial system with a huge number of isolated roots. Each root describes an alternate robot morphology in the design space. Following this, the computation of nearly all isolated roots constitutes design space exploration. Previously, these systems were intractable, due to the heavy burden of degenerate roots. We relieve this burden by using the finite root generation (FRG) method to enable the discovery of nearly all isolated roots for a certain six-bar design problem for the first time. The FRG synthesis method enables the design of a transmission function from motor dynamics to a loaded end effector to influence the overall dynamic behavior. In an example, we formulate synthesis equations which were previously intractable, obtain 1 528 608 isolated roots (estimated 99.0\%), and find 3764 physical designs.

In this article, we use probabilistic roadmaps (PRMs) as the sampling-based planner, and AutoRL as the RL method in the indoor navigation context. We evaluate the method with a simulation for kinematic differential drive and kinodynamic car-like robots in several environments, and on differential-drive robots at three physical sites. Our results show that PRM-RL with AutoRL is more successful than several baselines, is robust to noise, and can guide robots over hundreds of meters in the face of noise and obstacles in both simulation and on robots, including over 5.8 km of physical robot navigation.},

We demonstrate that leveraging the proxy collision detector results in up to an order of magnitude faster performance in robot simulation and planning than state-of-the-art collision detection libraries. Our results show that Fastron learns a model more than 100 times faster than a competing C-space modeling approach, while also providing theoretical guarantees of learning convergence. Using the open motion planning libraries (OMPLs), we were able to generate initial motion plans across all experiments with varying robot and environment complexities and workspace obstacle locations. With Fastron, we can repeatedly generate new motion plans at a 56 Hz rate, showing its application toward autonomous surgical assistance task in shared environments with human-controlled manipulators. All performance gains were achieved despite using only CPU-based calculations, suggesting further computational gains with a GPU approach that can parallelize tensor algebra.

  abstract     = {Passive reaction effects in grasp stability analysis occur when the contact forces and joint torques applied by a grasp change in response to external disturbances applied to the grasped object. For example, nonbackdrivable actuators (e.g., highly geared servos) will passively resist external disturbances without an actively applied command; for numerous robot hands using such motors, these effects can be highly beneficial as they increase grasp resistance without requiring active control. In this article, we introduce a grasp stability analysis method that can model these effects, and, for a given grasp, distinguish between disturbances that will be passively resisted and those that will not. We find that, in order to achieve this, the grasp model must include accurate energetic constraints. One way to achieve this is to consider the maximum dissipation principle (MDP), a part of the Coulomb friction model that is rarely used in grasp stability analysis. However, the MDP constraints are nonconvex, and difficult to solve efficiently. We thus introduce a convex relaxation method, along with an algorithm that successively refines this relaxation locally in order to obtain solutions to arbitrary accuracy efficiently. Our resulting algorithm can determine if a grasp is passively stable, solve for equilibrium contact forces and compute optimal actuator commands for stability. Its implementation is publicly available as part of the open-source GraspIt! simulator.},

Unlike many existing studies that solely support motion synchronization, the first contribution of the proposed work is to propose a solution for orientation regulation when several slave robots have differing motions. In other words, we propose a solution for self-regulated orientation for dual-arm robots. A second contribution in the article allows the master with fewer degrees of freedom (DoF) to control the slaves (with higher DoF), while the orientation of the slaves is self-regulated. The system further offers a novel force regulation that enables the slave robots to have a smooth and balanced robot-environment interaction with proper force directions. Finally, the proposed approach provides adequate force feedback about the environment to the operator and assists the operator in identifying different motion situations of the slaves. Our approach demonstrates that the forces from the slaves will not interrupt the operator&#39;s perception of the environment. To validate the proposed system, experiments are conducted using a platform consisting of two 7-DoF slave robots and one 3-DoF master haptic device. The experiments demonstrated good results in terms of position, orientation, and force regulation.},

It is possible to calculate the support function of a convex body in a closed form. For complex continuous, especially nonconvex, surfaces, however, this calculation can be far more difficult and no general solution is available so far, which limits the applicability of those related algorithms. This article first presents a branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) algorithm to calculate the support function of complex continuous surfaces. An upper bound of the support function over a surface domain is derived. While a surface domain is divided into subdomains, the upper bound of the support function over any subdomain is proved to be not greater than the one over the original domain. Then, as the B&amp;B algorithm sequentially divides the surface domain by dividing its subdomain having a greater upper bound than the others, the maximum upper bound over all subdomains is monotonically decreasing and converges to the exact value of the desired support function. Furthermore, with the aid of the B&amp;B algorithm, this article derives new algorithms for the minimum distance between complex continuous surfaces and for globally optimal grasps on objects with continuous surfaces. A number of numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a fully distributed cooperation scheme for networked mobile manipulators. To achieve cooperative task allocation in a distributed way, an adaptation-based estimation law is established for each robotic agent to estimate the desired local trajectory. In addition, wrench synthesis is analyzed in detail to lay a solid foundation for tight cooperation tasks. Together with the estimated task, a set of distributed adaptive (DA) controllers is proposed to achieve motion synchronization of the mobile manipulator ensemble over a directed graph with a spanning tree irrespective of the kinematic and dynamic uncertainties in both the mobile manipulators and the tightly grasped object. The controlled synchronization alleviates the performance degradation caused by the estimation/tracking discrepancy during the transient phase. The proposed scheme requires no persistent excitation condition and avoids the use of noisy Cartesian-space velocities. Furthermore, it is independent from the object&#39;s center of mass by employing formation-based task allocation and a task-oriented strategy. These attractive attributes facilitate the practical application of the scheme. It is theoretically proven that convergence of the cooperative task tracking error is guaranteed. Simulation results, as well as manipulation experiments with three mobile manipulators involved, validate the efficacy and demonstrate the expected performance of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of mass transport cloaking using mobile robots. The robots move along a predefined curve that encloses a safe zone and carry sources that collectively counteract a chemical agent released in the environment. The goal is to steer the mass flux around a desired region so that it remains unaffected by the external concentration. We formulate the problem of controlling the robot positions and release rates as a partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization, where the propagation of the chemical is modeled by the advection-diffusion (AD) PDE. We use a neural network (NN) to approximate the solution of the PDE. Particularly, we propose a novel loss function for the NN that utilizes the variational form of the AD-PDE and allows us to reformulate the planning problem as an unsupervised model-based learning problem. Our loss function is discretization-free and highly parallelizable. Unlike passive cloaking methods that use metamaterials to steer the mass flux, our method is the first to use mobile robots to actively control the concentration levels and create safe zones independent of environmental conditions. We demonstrate the performance of our method in simulations.},

Its usefulness in parallel mechanisms is certainly apparent, and its application to solve motion planning problems, or other higher level questions, has been seldom queried, or limited to nonredundant systems. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of the use of the Jacobian matrix under redundancy, in particular when applied to kinematically redundant parallel architectures with non-serially connected actuators. These architectures have become fairly popular recently as they allow the end-effector to achieve full rotations, which is an impossible task with traditional topologies.The problems with the Jacobian matrix in these novel systems arise from the need to eliminate redundant variables forming it, resulting in both situations where the Jacobian incorrectly identifies singularities (false positive), and where it fails to identify singularities (false negative). These issues have, thus far, remained unaddressed in the literature. We highlight these limitations herein by demonstrating several cases using numerical examples of both planar and spatial architectures.},

Current methods to address this problem operate mainly under the assumption that the robot never changes its assembly mode nor gets close to Type 2 singularities. Nonetheless, recent works proved that a parallel robot can change its assembly mode, thanks to dedicated trajectory generation and control. Such a feature allows increasing the operational workspace of such manipulators. Hence, correctly tracking the end-effector pose while crossing Type 2 singularities is mandatory for a practical usage of this workspace enhancement method. However, on Type 2 singularities, several solutions of the forward geometric model merge, making current tracking methods ineffective. To fill this gap, we propose a two-step pose tracking methodology. First, a differential inclusion based on kinematics and dynamics is solved. Second, joint measurements are used to tighten resulting enclosures. The effectiveness of this method is discussed, thanks to experimental data gathered on a planar parallel robot.},

However, when it comes to grasping highly flexible objects such as textiles, we face the dual problem: it is the object that will adapt to the shape of the hand or gripper. In this context, the classic grasp analysis or grasping taxonomies are not suitable for describing textile objects grasps. This article proposes a novel definition of textile object grasps that abstracts from the robotic embodiment or hand shape and recovers concepts from the early neuroscience literature on hand prehension skills. This framework enables us to identify what grasps have been used in literature until now to perform robotic cloth manipulation, and allows for a precise definition of all the tasks that have been tackled in terms of manipulation primitives based on regrasps. In addition, we also review what grippers have been used. Our analysis shows how the vast majority of cloth manipulations have relied only on one type of grasp, and at the same time we identify several tasks that need more variety of grasp types to be executed successfully. Our framework is generic, provides a classification of cloth manipulation primitives and can inspire gripper design and benchmark construction for cloth manipulation.},

Designing a control law for motion planning, that incorporates the state and control constraints, while respecting the configuration manifold, is a challenging problem. In this article, we derive a discrete-time model of the WIP system using discrete mechanics and generate optimal trajectories for the WIP system by solving a discrete-time constrained optimal control problem. Furthermore, we describe a nonlinear continuous-time model with parameters for designing a closed-loop linear-quadratic regulator (LQR). A dual control architecture is implemented in which the designed optimal trajectory is, then, provided as a reference to the robot with the optimal control trajectory as a feedforward control action, and an LQR in the feedback mode is employed to mitigate noise and disturbances for ensuing stable motion of the WIP system. While performing experiments on the WIP system involving aggressive maneuvers with fairly sharp turns, we found a high degree of congruence in the designed optimal trajectories and the path traced by the robot while tracking these trajectories. This corroborates the validity of the nonlinear model and the control scheme. Finally, these experiments demonstrate the highly nonlinear nature of the WIP system and robustness of the control scheme.},

This measure is typically formulated as a constant that depends on the wheel load, wheel dimensions, and soil that the WMR is designed for. This article proposes a novel variable RC that responds to terrain deformation. This variable RC is then applied to controllers for WMRs that estimate driving torques and slip ratios on deformable terrain. Simple yet accurate models of RC are developed from both experimental results and theoretical analysis, and these models are then compared with other methods. The proposed RC models give more accurate and more computationally efficient estimations of driving torques and slip ratios for WMRs, with average estimation errors less than 6\% and the shortest computation time in experiments. The two proposed estimators are then applied to the design of the tracking-control systems for a WMR running on deformable terrain. Experiments with simulated sandy terrain demonstrate that both proposed control systems are feasible, and the slip estimation effectively decreases velocity tracking errors from more than 20\% to less than 10\%.},

For the selected robotic application-balance control of a two-wheeled robot, the contribution lies in the system-specific analysis that further enhances the computational performance toward an agile mobility. This novelty is with respect to a state-of-the-art ARE solver. An offline/a priori analytical formulation replaces the very first stage of the solving process, which more efficiently integrates the ARE solver into the SDRE design framework. Notably, all the results not only benefit the classical SDRE scheme but, more significantly, favor the proposed alternative SDRE owing to its much better computational efficiency-mainly in terms of time while promisingly for memory saving. In addition, simulations reveal more potential advantages using the variants-such as the control effort efficiency or required regulation time-within and beyond the scope of SDRE.},

Legged locomotion constitutes a floating-based movement, whose dynamic is underactuated with respect to the inertial frame.

This article presents a motion planning framework for a legged robot that uses its limbs for nonprehensile manipulation, as well as locomoting motions. First, issues related to the description of the robot-object-environment system and the task are presented. The velocity constraint that prevents separation and the force constraint that restricts interactive forces are then integrated into the system dynamic model to produce bounds on the system acceleration as a function of the system state. Then, we solve the motion planning problem by reducing the system dimensions in operational space and programming feasible trajectories within the phase plane. This approach is employed to control the quadruped robot TITAN-VIII to manipulate objects and locomote itself using Drive Mode, Inchworm Mode, Scoot Mode, and Throw Mode. Experimental results obtained through simulations and physical tests are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {The human input has enabled autonomous systems to improve their capabilities and achieve complex behaviors that are otherwise challenging to generate automatically. Recent work focuses on how robots can use such inputs-such as, demonstrations or corrections-to learn intended objectives. These techniques assume that the human`s desired objective already exists within the robot&#39;s hypothesis space. In reality, this assumption is often inaccurate: there will always be situations where the person might care about aspects of the task that the robot does not know about. Without this knowledge, the robot cannot infer the correct objective. Hence, when the robot&#39;s hypothesis space is misspecified, even methods that keep track of uncertainty over the objective fail because they reason about which hypothesis might be correct, and not whether any of the hypotheses are correct. In this article, we posit that the robot should reason explicitly about how well it can explain human inputs given its hypothesis space and use that situational confidence to inform how it should incorporate the human input. We demonstrate our method on a 7 degrees-of-freedom robot manipulator in learning from two important types of human inputs: demonstrations of motion planning tasks and physical corrections during the robot&#39;s task execution.},

In this article, we present a generic error modeling method of serial robots and extend to parallel robots by finite and instantaneous screw (FIS) theory. The differential map and the explicit description of FIS on the robot motions enable a concise error modeling of the serial robot. The identifiability of errors in serial robot is discussed. The maximum independent errors are proved to be 4r + 2p + 6, where r and p are the numbers of revolute and prismatic joints, respectively. Based on the error mapping of serial limbs, reciprocal twist and wrench are introduced to consider the interaction among limbs and reveal the error propagation of the parallel robot. Then, the identification algorithms with high robustness and efficiency are investigated for the serial and parallel robots. Specifically, the conventional ill-conditioning problems of parallel robots are addressed. Finally, the proposed kinematic calibration framework for both types of robots are compared with the existing methods, and verified by simulations and experiments. The results show that our calibration approach improves the robot accuracy in a robust and efficient manner.},

Partial knowledge refers to a subspace of SE(3) determined by the desired task, generally mixing both position and orientation variables, and is mathematically approximated by parametric expressions. The proposed scheme, which utilizes the notion of virtual constraints and the prescribed performance control methodology, is proved to be passive with respect to the interaction force, while guaranteeing constraint satisfaction in all cases.

The method leverages supervised learning concepts in order to train a reward model from data. It is applied to a gait rehabilitation robot with the goal of teaching the robot how to walk patients physiologically. In this context, the reward model judges the physiology of the gait cycle (instead of therapists) using sensor measurements provided by the robot and the automatic feedback controller chooses the input settings of the robot to maximize the reward. The key advantage of the proposed method is that only a few input adaptations are necessary to achieve a physiological gait cycle. Experiments with nondisabled subjects show that the proposed method permits the incorporation of human expertise into a control law and to automatically walk patients physiologically.},

Next, the active and passive transmission properties of motion and force in UCMs are analyzed on the defined four subspaces of tangent and cotangent spaces of joint space. Synthesizing the classification and the transmission properties of UCMs, the congruent relationship between mechanical structure and transmission function is established, and different cases of UCMs are discussed and compared. A novel type of UCMs can achieve the independent regulation of passive stiffness, active force, and active motion that is useful for improving the transmission performance in robotic and prosthetic hands.

  abstract     = {Series elastic actuation (SEA) has become prevalent in applications involving physical human-robot interaction, as it provides considerable advantages over traditional stiff actuators in terms of stability robustness and force control fidelity. Several impedance control architectures have been proposed for SEA. Among these alternatives, the cascaded controller with an innermost velocity loop, an intermediate torque loop, and an outermost impedance loop is particularly favored for its simplicity, robustness, and performance. In this article, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for passively rendering null impedance and virtual springs with this cascade-controller architecture. Based on the newly established conditions, we provide nonconservative passivity design guidelines to haptically display these two impedance models, which serve as the basic building blocks of various virtual environments, while ensuring the safety of interaction. We also demonstrate the importance of including physical damping in the actuator model for deriving the passivity conditions, when integrators are utilized. In particular, we prove the unintuitive adversary effect of physical damping on the passivity of the system by noting that the damping term reduces the system $Z$-width, as well as introducing an extra passivity constraint. Finally, we experimentally validate our theoretical results using an SEA brake pedal.},

Although there have been attempts to apply physical constraints on the air chamber to achieve larger stroke lengths and increased force-length ratios, it has been difficult to achieve the above two goals while maintaining a compact form factor. In this article, we propose flat inflatable artificial muscles that have large contraction ratios (up to 0.5) and show increased forces in wider ranges of contractions by adding an internal geometric constraint. Addition of an external constraint, such as rigid plates, further increased the maximum contraction ratio (up to 0.553) through a synergistic effect. We show that various force-length relations can be achieved by adjusting the height of the plates. Theoretical models based on the geometry and the principle of virtual work are experimentally validated using actuator prototypes made of heat-sealable plastic sheets. Also, compact capacitive sensors are integrated in design for proprioceptive feedback of the proposed actuators, and their feasibility and effectiveness are experimentally evaluated through closed-loop control.},

In the proposed approaches, only image position information of three feature points from an overhead camera is used for controller design, while information from other sensors (such as wheel encoders) is not required. Furthermore, either offline or online camera calibration is not necessary, and no knowledge about the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is needed, which also can greatly simplify the controller implementation.

In this article, we use the term mechanically realizable manifolds to refer to the subset of such manifolds (in either posture or torque space) that can be achieved via mechanical coupling of the joints in underactuated hands. We present a method to optimize the design parameters of an underactuated hand in order to shape the mechanically realizable manifolds to fit a predefined set of desired grasps. Our method guarantees that the resulting synergies can be physically implemented in an underactuated hand, and will enable the resulting hand to both reach the desired grasp postures and achieve quasi-static equilibrium while loading the grasps. We demonstrate this method on three concrete design examples motivated by a real use case, and evaluate and compare their performance in practice.},

The model approximates the human as an optimal agent, with a reward function obtained through inverse reinforcement learning. Second, a planner uses this model to generate communicative actions that maximize the robot&#39;s transparency and efficiency. We implemented the planner on a mobile robot, using a wearable haptic device for explicit communication. In a user study of an indoor human-robot pair orthogonal crossing situation, the robot is able to actively communicate its intent to users in order to avoid collisions and facilitate efficient trajectories. Results show that the planner generated plans that are easier to understand, reduce users` effort, and increase users&#39; trust of the robot, compared to simply performing collision avoidance. The key contribution of this article is the integration and analysis of explicit communication (together with implicit communication) for social navigation.},

  abstract     = {Synthesizing legged locomotion requires planning one or several steps ahead (literally): when and where, and with which effector should the next contact(s) be created between the robot and the environment? Validating a contact candidate implies a minima the resolution of a slow, nonlinear optimization problem, to demonstrate that a center of mass (CoM) trajectory, compatible with the contact transition constraints, exists. We propose a conservative reformulation of this trajectory generation problem as a convex 3-D linear program, named convex resolution of centroidal dynamic trajectories (CROC). It results from the observation that if the CoM trajectory is a polynomial with only one free variable coefficient, the nonlinearity of the problem disappears. This has two consequences. On the positive side, in terms of computation times, CROC outperforms the state of the art by at least one order of magnitude, and allows to consider interactive applications (with a planning time roughly equal to the motion time). On the negative side, in our experiments, our approach finds a majority of the feasible trajectories found by a nonlinear solver, but not all of them. Still, we demonstrate that the solution space covered by CROC is large enough to achieve the automated planning of a large variety of locomotion tasks for different robots, demonstrated in simulation and on the real HRP-2 robot, several of which were rarely seen before. Another significant contribution is the introduction of a Bezier curve representation of the problem, which guarantees that the constraints of the CoM trajectory are verified continuously, and not only at discrete points as traditionally done. This formulation is lossless, and results in more robust trajectories. It is not restricted to CROC, but could rather be integrated with any method from the state of the art.},

This article aims to fill the performance-efficiency gap with an enhancement applied to feature-based VSLAM. We present good feature matching, an active map-to-frame feature matching method. Feature matching effort is tied to submatrix selection, which has combinatorial time complexity and requires choosing a scoring metric. Via simulation, the Max-logDet matrix revealing metric is shown to perform best. For real-time applicability, the combination of deterministic selection and randomized acceleration is studied. The proposed algorithm is integrated into monocular and stereo feature-based VSLAM systems.

In this article, we argue that it is not necessary to optimize walking over several steps to ensure gait viability and show that it is sufficient to merely select the next step timing and location. Using this insight, we propose a novel walking pattern generator that optimally selects step location and timing at every control cycle. Our approach is computationally simple compared to standard approaches in the literature, yet guarantees that any viable state will remain viable in the future. We propose a swing foot adaptation strategy and integrate the pattern generator with an inverse dynamics controller that does not explicitly control the center of mass nor the foot center of pressure. This is particularly useful for biped robots with limited control authority over their foot center of pressure, such as robots with point feet or passive ankles. Extensive simulations on a humanoid robot with passive ankles demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in various walking situations, including external pushes and foot slippage, and emphasize the importance of step timing adaptation to stabilize walking.},

The shape display is implemented as an inflatable silicone membrane with embedded particle jamming cells that change stiffness and soft pneumatic actuators that control the distance between points on the surface. The device was modeled as a mass-spring system, and this model is used to develop a control sequence for a device to match a target shape. Due to constraints in actuation imposed by the 3-D geometry of the device, we developed an automatic design algorithm for the display, so that a display can be custom-designed to reach a set of target shapes using a relatively small number of actuators.},

  abstract     = {Contact-rich manipulation tasks in unstructured environments often require both haptic and visual feedback. It is nontrivial to manually design a robot controller that combines these modalities, which have very different characteristics. While deep reinforcement learning has shown success in learning control policies for high-dimensional inputs, these algorithms are generally intractable to train directly on real robots due to sample complexity. In this article, we use self-supervision to learn a compact and multimodal representation of our sensory inputs, which can then be used to improve the sample efficiency of our policy learning. Evaluating our method on a peg insertion task, we show that it generalizes over varying geometries, configurations, and clearances, while being robust to external perturbations. We also systematically study different self-supervised learning objectives and representation learning architectures. Results are presented in simulation and on a physical robot.},

Additionally, significant force compliance can be achieved to guarantee the wearer&#39;s safety when the interaction torque is large.

The main challenge of the problem, which is to simultaneously fulfill both relative localization and control tasks, is efficiently and novelly resolved by embedding a distance-displacement-based persistently excited adaptive relative localization technique into a time-varying formation with bounded control input (PEARL-TVF). By assuming that the leader is globally reachable and by selecting proper parameters, it is shown that the PEARL-TVF ensures exponentially convergent localization, which leads to exponentially convergent formation when the leader&#39;s behavior is deterministic, and bounded formation error for a nondeterministic leader. Numerical simulations and experiments on quadcopters are provided to verify the theoretical findings.},

This article presents the novel design of a multi-DOF sensor-enabled RCE for colonoscopies (Endoculus) and evaluates porcine in vivo and ex vivo performance. The novelty of the design includes a custom “double-worm” drive that removes axial gear forces while reducing radial moments, and the full parameterization of gear geometries allows for size minimization via an optimization routine over design constraints. Two independently controlled motors drive micro-pillared treads above and below the device allowing for two-degrees of freedom (2-DOF) skid-steering, even in a collapsed lumen. The Endoculus contains all functionality of a traditional endoscope: a camera, adjustable light emitting diodes (LEDs), channels for insufflation and irrigation, and a tool port for endoscopy instruments (e.g., forceps, snares, etc.). Additionally, the Endoculus carries an inertial measurement unit, magnetometer, motor encoders, and motor current sensors to aid in future autonomy strategies. Porcine surgical evaluation demonstrated locomotion up to 40 mm/s on the colon mucosa, 2-DOF steering, the ability to traverse haustral folds, and functionality of endoscopy tools. This platform will enable future validation of feedback control, localization, and mapping algorithms in the unconventional in vivo environment.},

Using a unique implementation of sampling-based model predictive optimization, we demonstrate the ability to motion plan around obstacles on vertical walls and experimentally demonstrate this on TAILS by navigating through traditionally difficult narrow gap problems.},

The optimization problem, its numerical solution, and an experimental evaluation are demonstrated using a PUMA manipulator with custom regenerative drives. Power flows, stored regenerative energy, and efficiency are evaluated. Tracking of optimal trajectories is enforced on the robot using a standard robust passivity based control approach. Experimental results show that when following optimal trajectories, a reduction of about $\text{10}\text{--}\text{22}\%$ in energy consumption can be achieved for the conditions of the study, relative to the nonregenerative case.},

This design is converted into a computer-aided design (CAD) model and 3-D printed using flexible and rigid polymer composite materials. Two CAD modeling methods for this design are compared in terms of structural stiffness and durability in the printed outcomes. For each design, two soft materials are used for preliminary evaluation of the material effect in these properties. The best combination of the model and material is selected to fabricate the three fingers of the robotic gripper. Each finger has a single cable routed along the structure.

In this article, we focus on investigating state estimation of a freely swimming robotic fish in multiple motions, including rectilinear motion, turning motion, gliding motion, and spiral motion. The state refers to motion parameters, including linear velocity, angular velocity, motion radius, etc., and trajectory of the robotic fish. Specifically, for each motion, a pressure variation (PV) model that links motion parameters to PVs surrounding the robotic fish is first built; then, a linear regression analysis method is used for determining the model parameters. Based on the acquired PV model, motion parameters can be estimated by solving the PV model inversely using the PVs measured by the ALLS. Finally, a trajectory estimation method is proposed for estimating trajectory of the robotic fish based on the ALLS-estimated motion parameters. The experimental results show that the robotic fish is able to estimate its trajectory in the aforementioned multiple motions with the aid of ALLS, with small estimation errors.},

The modular design produces a highly versatile platform as it is reconfigurable by the addition or removal of flight modules, adjustment of the modules&#39; arrangement, or change of payloads. To facilitate the flight control, we propose an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based estimation strategy for rapid computation of the robot&#39;s configuration. When combined with the adaptive geometric controller for further refinement of uncertain parameters, stable flights are accomplished with minimal manual intervention or tuning required by a user. To this end, we demonstrate hovering and trajectory tracking flights through various robot configurations with different dummy payloads, weighing ≈200-800 g, using four to eight propelling modules. The results reveal that stable flights are attainable thanks to the proposed IMU-based estimation method. The flight performance is markedly improved over time through the adaptive scheme, with position errors of a few centimeters after the parameter convergence.},

Legged locomotion over soft terrain is difficult due to the presence of unmodeled contact dynamics that WBCs do not account for. This introduces uncertainty in locomotion and affects the stability and performance of the system. In this article, we propose a novel soft terrain adaptation algorithm called STANCE: Soft Terrain Adaptation and Compliance Estimation. STANCE consists of a WBC that exploits the knowledge of the terrain to generate an optimal solution that is contact consistent and an online terrain compliance estimator that provides the WBC with terrain knowledge. We validated STANCE both in simulation and experiment on the Hydraulically actuated Quadruped (HyQ) robot, and we compared it against the state-of-the-art WBC. We demonstrated the capabilities of STANCE with multiple terrains of different compliances, aggressive maneuvers, different forward velocities, and external disturbances. STANCE allowed HyQ to adapt online to terrains with different compliances (rigid and soft) without pretuning. HyQ was able to successfully deal with the transition between different terrains and showed the ability to differentiate between compliances under each foot.},

A local model-based approximate dynamic programming method is implemented to approximate the value function in a local neighborhood of the agent. By performing local approximations, prior knowledge of the locations of avoidance regions is not required. To alleviate the a priori knowledge of the number of avoidance regions in the operating domain, an extension is provided that modifies the value function approximation. The developed feedback-based motion planning strategy guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of the approximated control policy to the optimal policy while also ensuring the agent remains outside avoidance regions. Simulations are included to demonstrate the preliminary development for a kinematic unicycle and generic nonlinear system. Results from three experiments are also presented to illustrate the performance of the developed method, where a quadcopter achieves approximate optimal regulation while avoiding three mobile obstacles. To demonstrate the developed method, known avoidance regions are used in the first experiment, unknown avoidance regions are used in the second experiment, and an unknown time-varying obstacle directed by a remote pilot is included in the third experiment.},

  abstract     = {Controlling a robot astronaut to move in the same way as a human astronaut to realize a wide range of motion in a space station is an important requirement for the robot astronauts that are meant to assist or replace human astronauts. However, a robot astronaut is a nonlinear and strongly coupled multibody dynamic system with multiple degrees of freedom, whose dynamic characteristics are complex. Therefore, implementing a robot astronaut with wide-ranging motion control in a space station is a tremendous challenge for robotic technology. This article presents a wide-ranging stable motion control method for robot astronauts in space stations based on human dynamics. Focusing on the astronauts&#39; parking motion in a space station, a viscoelastic dynamic humanoid model of parking under microgravity environment was established using a mass-spring-damper system. The model was used as the expected model for stable parking control of a robot astronaut, and the complex dynamic characteristics were mapped into the robot astronaut system to control the stable parking of the robot astronaut in a manner similar to a human astronaut. This provides a critical basis for implementing robots that are capable of steady wide-ranging motion in space stations. The method was verified on a dynamic system of a robot astronaut that was constructed for this research. The experimental results showed that the method is feasible and effective and that it is a highly competitive solution for robot astronauts with human-like moving capabilities in space stations.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a distributed finite element algorithm that allows swarms of mobile robots to persistently monitor environmental quantities such as temperature or salinity. The robots deploy themselves into the environment, covering the domain and dividing it into nonoverlapping regions. Each robot estimates the environment over its own region using local measurements and communication with nearby robots. The algorithm ensures that each robot&#39;s estimate constitutes a piece of a global estimate that spans the entire domain, fuses the whole swarm&#39;s measurements, and accounts for the spatial correlation between measurement and estimation locations. By incorporating spatial correlation without requiring the transmission of measurements or measurement locations, the algorithm decouples its communication requirements from the spatial statistics of the environment and enables robots with fixed capabilities to monitor environments with different spatial correlation lengths. Analysis and simulation demonstrate that, as the number of robots increases, the memory and communication requirements of each individual robot decrease until reaching a minimum, after which the resolution of the environmental model increases. Additional robots, therefore, add computational resources to the swarm rather than introducing extra computational burdens.},

These representations are able to capture the variability of the demonstrations from a teacher as a probability distribution over trajectories, providing a sensible region of exploration and the ability to adapt to changes in the robot environment. However, to be able to capture variability and correlations between different joints, a probabilistic movement primitive requires the estimation of a larger number of parameters compared to their deterministic counterparts, which focus on modeling only the mean behavior. In this article, we make use of prior distributions over the parameters of a probabilistic movement primitive to make robust estimates of the parameters with few training instances. In addition, we introduce general purpose operators to adapt movement primitives in joint and task space. The proposed training method and adaptation operators are tested in a coffee preparation and in robot table tennis task. In the coffee preparation task we evaluate the generalization performance to changes in the location of the coffee grinder and brewing chamber in a target area, achieving the desired behavior after only two demonstrations. In the table tennis task we evaluate the hit and return rates, outperforming previous approaches while using fewer task specific heuristics.},

  abstract     = {Recent work has shed light on the often unreliable performance of constrained least-squares estimation methods for robot mass-inertial parameter identification, particularly for high degree-of-freedom systems subject to noisy and incomplete measurements. Instead, differential geometric identification methods have proven to be significantly more accurate and robust. These methods account for the fact that the mass-inertial parameters reside in a curved Riemannian space, and allow perturbations in the mass-inertial properties to be measured in a coordinate-invariant manner. Yet, a continued drawback of existing geometric methods is that the corresponding optimization problems are inherently nonconvex, have numerous local minima, and are computationally highly intensive to solve. In this paper, we propose a convex formulation under the same coordinate-invariant Riemannian geometric framework that directly addresses these and other deficiencies of the geometric approach. Our convex formulation leads to a globally optimal solution, reduced computations, faster and more reliable convergence, and easy inclusion of additional convex constraints. The main idea behind our approach is an entropic divergence measure that allows for the convex regularization of the inertial parameter identification problem. Extensive experiments with the 3-DoF MIT Cheetah leg, the 7-DoF AMBIDEX tendon-driven arm, and a 16-link articulated human model show markedly improved robustness and generalizability vis-à-vis existing vector space methods while ensuring fast, guaranteed convergence to the global solution.},

This survey article focuses on the extreme other end of the spectrum: how can a robot adapt with only a handful of trials (a dozen) and a few minutes? By analogy with the word “big-data,” we refer to this challenge as “micro-data reinforcement learning.” In this article, we show that a first strategy is to leverage prior knowledge on the policy structure (e.g., dynamic movement primitives), on the policy parameters (e.g., demonstrations), or on the dynamics (e.g., simulators). A second strategy is to create data-driven surrogate models of the expected reward (e.g., Bayesian optimization) or the dynamical model (e.g., model-based PS), so that the policy optimizer queries the model instead of the real system. Overall, all successful micro-data algorithms combine these two strategies by varying the kind of model and prior knowledge. The current scientific challenges essentially revolve around scaling up to complex robots, designing generic priors, and optimizing the computing time.},

Examples of unexpected changes include the sudden introduction of stationary or dynamic obstacles in the environment and change in the reachable area for coverage (e.g., due to imperfect base localization by an industrial robot). Thus, a novel adaptive CPP approach is developed that is efficient to respond to changes in real-time while aiming to achieve complete coverage with minimal cost. As part of the approach, a total reward function that incorporates three rewards is designed where the first reward is inspired by the predator-prey relation, the second reward is related to continuing motion in a straight direction, and the third reward is related to covering the boundary. The total reward function acts as a heuristic to guide the robot at each step. For a given map of an environment, model parameters are first tuned offline to minimize the path length while assuming no obstacles. It is shown that applying these learned parameters during real-time adaptive planning in the presence of obstacles will still result in a coverage path with a length close to the optimized path length. Many case studies with various scenarios are presented to validate the approach and to perform numerous comparisons.},

This article presents robotic manipulation of deformable cells for orientation control (both out-of-plane and in-plane), which is required in both clinical (e.g., in vitro fertilization) and biomedical (e.g., clone) applications. Compared to manual cell orientation control based on empirical experience, the robotic approach, based on modeling and path planning, effectively rotates a cell, while consistently maintaining minimal cell deformation to avoid cell damage. A force model is established to determine the minimal force applied by the micropipette to rotate a spherical or, more generally, ellipsoidal oocyte. The force information is translated into indentation through a contact mechanics model, and the manipulation path of the micropipette is formed by connecting the indentation positions on the oocyte. An optimal controller is designed to compensate for the variations of mechanical properties across oocytes. The polar body of an oocyte is detected by deep neural networks with robustness to shape and size differences. In experiments, the system achieved an accuracy of 97.6\% in polar body detection and an accuracy of 0.7° in oocyte orientation control with maximum oocyte deformation of 2.70 μm throughout the orientation control process.},

For the automated control of such a microrobotic system with small size and large population, conventional methods using precise robot models and robot-robot communications lose effectiveness due to the complex locomotion of micro/nano agents in a swarm and difficult implementation of onboard actuators and sensors for individual motion control and motion feedback. This article proposes a statistics-based approach and reports the fully automated control of a swarm of paramagnetic nanoparticles including the swarm pattern formation, identification, tracking, motion control, and real-time distribution monitoring/control. By establishing the swarm statistics, collective behaviors of a nanoparticle swarm can be quantitatively analyzed by computers. Algorithms are designed based on the statistics to automatically generate and identify the vortex-like paramagnetic nanoparticle swarm (VPNS), which present robustness to the dose and initial distribution of the nanoparticle swarm. In order to robustly track a VPNS, a statistics-based tracking method is proposed, in which 500 boundary points of the VPNS are extracted and the VPNS distribution is optimally recognized. And, with the proposed gathering improvement control, experiments show that over 70\% nanoparticles can be gathered in the VPNS. Furthermore, an automated motion control scheme for the VPNS is proposed which shows high-accuracy trajectory tracking performance (tracking error: &lt;; 5\% body length). Besides, real-time monitoring of the distribution region/density and control of the distribution area for a nanoparticle swarm are also realized by using the statistics. Experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method in automated control of paramagnetic nanoparticle swarms.},

High-performance pHRI requires robust and stable controllers suitable for multiple degrees of freedom (DoF) and highly nonlinear robots. In this article, we describe a cascade-loop pHRI controller, which relies on human force and pose measurements and can adapt to varying robot dynamics online. It can also adapt to different users and simplifies the interaction by making the robot behave according to a prescribed dynamic model. In our controller formulation, two neural networks (NNs) in the “outer-loop” predict human motion intent and estimate a reference trajectory for the robot that the “inner-loop” controller follows. The inner-loop imposes a prescribed error dynamics (PED) with the help of a model-free neuroadaptive controller (NAC), which uses a NN to feedback linearize the robot dynamics. Lyapunov stability analysis gives weight tuning laws that guarantee that the error signals are bounded and the desired reference trajectory is achieved. Our control scheme was implemented on a Personal Robot 2 robot and validated through an exploratory experimental study in point-to-point collaborative motion. Results indicate fast convergence of our controller, and the resulting tracking error, motion jerk, and human control effort are comparable with other methods that require prior training, knowledge, and calibration.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a novel stochastic algorithm called simultaneous sensor calibration and deformation estimation (SCADE) to address the problem of modeling deformation behavior of a generic continuum manipulator (CM) in free and obstructed environments. In SCADE, using a novel mathematical formulation, we introduce a priori model-independent filtering algorithm to fuse the continuous and inaccurate measurements of an embedded sensor (e.g., magnetic or piezoelectric sensors) with an intermittent but accurate data of an external imaging system (e.g., optical trackers or cameras). The main motivation of this article is the crucial need of obtaining an accurate shape/position estimation of a CM utilized in a surgical intervention. In these robotic procedures, the CM is typically equipped with an embedded sensing unit (ESU) while an external imaging modality (e.g., ultrasound or a fluoroscopy machine) is also available in the surgical site. The results of two different set of prior experiments in free and obstructed environments were used to evaluate the efficacy of SCADE algorithm. The experiments were performed with a CM specifically designed for orthopaedic interventions equipped with an inaccurate Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) ESU and overhead camera. The results demonstrated the successful performance of the SCADE algorithm in simultaneous estimation of unknown deformation behavior of the utilized unmodeled CM together with realizing the time-varying drift of the poor-calibrated FBG sensing unit. Moreover, the results showed the phenomenal out-performance of the SCADE algorithm in estimation of the CM&#39;s tip position as compared to FBG-based position estimations.},

  abstract     = {The control of a robot in its task space is a standard approach nowadays. If the system is kinematically redundant with respect to this goal, one can even execute additional subtasks simultaneously. By utilizing null space projections, for example, the whole stack of tasks can be implemented within a strict task hierarchy following the order of priority. One of the most common methods to track multiple task-space trajectories at the same time is to feedback-linearize the system and dynamically decouple all involved subtasks, which finally yields the exponential stability of the desired equilibrium. In this article, we provide a hierarchical multi-objective controller for trajectory tracking that ensures both asymptotic stability of the equilibrium and a desired contact impedance at the same time. In contrast to the state of the art in prioritized multi-objective control, feedback of the external forces can be avoided and the natural inertia of the robot is preserved. The controller is evaluated in simulations and on a standard lightweight robot with torque interface. The approach is predestined for precise trajectory tracking where dedicated and robust physical-interaction compliance is crucial at the same time.},

The method relies on a self-sensing algorithm that exploits measurements of electrical quantities (i.e., membrane voltage and current) to perform a real-time estimation of DE displacement and force. By combining self-sensing feedback with a SC algorithm, active shaping of the membrane force-displacement response is achieved without introducing additional electro-mechanical sensors in the system, thus, making it possible to design compact, lightweight, and low-cost DE robotic systems. A description of the novel self-sensing scheme is initially performed. To cope with the strong system nonlinearity, a robust design method to synthesize a SC law is subsequently proposed. An extensive experimental campaign is, then, carried out, with the goal of evaluating the performance of both sensor-based and sensorless SC. Quantitative accuracy of both control architectures is finally assessed and compared.},

The model is exploited to estimate the relative velocity of the object with respect to the fingers, so as to control the grip force to counteract possible slipping events due to external disturbances. Force/tactile feedback, the only perception source used by the algorithms, is suitably exploited not only for safe grasping of a variety of objects with uncertain weight and inertial properties, but also for in-hand manipulation actions, like object pivoting or gripper pivoting. Since the algorithm is based on the control of the object velocity, accuracy of the desired object positioning depends on the initial grasp configuration, as well as on the accuracy of the friction model parameters. Such manipulation skills are evaluated in the execution of various pick and place tasks typical of an in-store logistic scenario.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study multirobot task allocation problems where task costs vary. The variation may be, for example, due to the revelation of new information or other dynamic circumstances. As robots update their cost estimates, typically they will update task assignments to reflect the new information using additional communication and computation. In dynamic settings, the robots are continually repairing the optimality of the system&#39;s task assignments, which can incur substantial communication and computation. We investigate how one can reduce communication and centralized computation expense during execution by using a prior model of how costs may change and performing upfront computation of possible robot-task assignments. First, we develop an algorithm that partitions a team of robots into several independent subteams that are able to maintain global optimality by communicating entirely amongst themselves. Second, we propose a method for computing the worst-case cost suboptimality if robots persist with the initial assignment and perform no further communication and computation. Finally, we introduce an algorithm to assess whether cost changes affect the optimality of the current assignment through a succession of local communication exchanges. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are helpful in reducing the degree of centralization needed by a multirobot system (e.g., the third method gave at least 45\% reduction of global communication across all scenarios studied). The methods are valuable in transitioning multirobot techniques, which have met with success in structured applications (such as factories and warehouses) to the broader, wilder world.},

The evasion team, initially lying in the play region, aims to send as many team members into the target region as possible, while the pursuit team with its team members initially distributed in both play region and target region, strives to prevent that by capturing the evaders. We aim at investigating a task assignment about the pursuer-evader matching, which can maximize the number of the evaders who can be captured before reaching the target region safely when both teams play optimally. To address this, two winning regions for a group of pursuers to intercept an evader are determined by constructing an analytical barrier which divides these two parts. Then, a task assignment to guarantee the most evaders intercepted is provided by solving a simplified 0-1 integer programming instead of a nondeterministic polynomial problem, easing the computation burden dramatically. It is worth noting that except the task assignment, the whole analysis is analytical. Finally, simulation results are also presented.},

In this article, we develop two highly efficient deterministic algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and proximal block coordinate descent (BCD) frameworks. Particularly, the proposed BCD algorithm is guaranteed convergent. Furthermore, on the slack variable in the BCD algorithm, which indicates the inliers and outliers, we establish some meaningful properties, such as support convergence within finite iterations and convergence to restricted strictly local minimizer. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, the new algorithms with initialization from a randomized or convex relaxed algorithm can achieve improved solution quality while being much more efficient (e.g., more than an order of magnitude faster). An application of the new ADMM algorithm in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has also been provided to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Experimental results show that the new approach: 1) allows users to continuously drive the mobile robot via BMI; 2) leads to significant improvements in the navigation performance; and 3) promotes a better coupling between user and robot.

Homogeneous reconfiguration can manage the transformation of the whole configuration of the robot structure, whereas heterogeneous reconfiguration can manage not only this transformation, but also the permutation process for navigating all modules to their exact target positions in the transformed configuration. However, the transformation process and time-consuming permutation process cannot always be executed simultaneously in heterogeneous reconfiguration. As a result, it takes much more time to reconfigure heterogeneous modular robots than it does to reconfigure homogeneous ones. In the previous research, linear homogeneous transformation algorithms for modular robots have been proposed. However, only quadratic permutation algorithms are available for heterogeneous lattice modular robots. This article studies a reconfiguration algorithm for heterogeneous lattice modular robots with linear operation time cost. The algorithm is based on simultaneous tunneling and permutation; a robot transforms its configuration via homogeneous tunneling motion, but permutation of each module&#39;s position is carried out simultaneously during the tunneling transformation. The approach also makes the time cost for the whole permutation process linear. To achieve this, the idea of a transparent meta-module is introduced, which allows the modules belonging to a meta-module to pass through the spaces occupied by other meta-modules. The algorithm is provided in both centralized and distributed form. We prove the correctness and completeness of the proposed algorithm. We also show some results of the reconfiguration simulation of heterogeneous modular robots with three-dimensional 2 × 2 × 2 cubic meta-modules by the proposed algorithm.},

Despite significant progress, most of the research has focused on open-loop control systems, in which robots execute predetermined actions, independent of the animal behavior. In this article, we integrate mathematical modeling of social behavior toward the design of realistic feedback laws for robots to interact with a live animal. In particular, we leverage recent advancements in data-driven modeling of zebrafish behavior. Ultimately, we establish a novel robotic platform that allows real-time actuation of a biologically-inspired three-dimensionally printed zebrafish replica to implement model-based control of animal behavior.

  abstract     = {Dynamically changing environments, unreliable state estimation, and operation under severe resource constraints are fundamental challenges that limit the deployment of small autonomous drones. We address these challenges in the context of autonomous, vision-based drone racing in dynamic environments. A racing drone must traverse a track with possibly moving gates at high speed. We enable this functionality by combining the performance of a state-of-the-art planning and control system with the perceptual awareness of a convolutional neural network. The resulting modular system is both platform independent and domain independent: it is trained in simulation and deployed on a physical quadrotor without any fine-tuning. The abundance of simulated data, generated via domain randomization, makes our system robust to changes of illumination and gate appearance. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on the task of agile drone flight. We extensively test the precision and robustness of our system, both in simulation and on a physical platform, and show significant improvements over the state of the art.},
