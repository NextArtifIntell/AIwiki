We study this problem in the high dimensional asymptotic regime, where m, n → ∞, while m/n → δ with δ being a fixed number, and show that if m n (1)) · n, then any estimator is asymptotically orthogonal to the true signal vector x * .

  abstract     = {Compressive phase retrieval refers to the problem of recovering a structured n-dimensional complex-valued vector from its phase-less under-determined linear measurements. The non-linearity of the measurement process makes designing theoretically-analyzable efficient phase retrieval algorithms challenging. As a result, to a great extent, existing recovery algorithms only take advantage of simple structures such as sparsity and its convex generalizations. The goal of this article is to move beyond simple models through employing compression codes. Such codes are typically developed to take advantage of complex signal models to represent the signals as efficiently as possible. In this work, it is shown how an existing compression code can be treated as a black box and integrated into an efficient solution for phase retrieval. First, COmpressive PhasE Retrieval (COPER) optimization, a computationally-intensive compression-based phase retrieval method, is proposed. COPER provides a theoretical framework for studying compression-based phase retrieval. The number of measurements required by COPER is connected to κ, the α-dimension (closely related to the ratedistortion dimension) of a given family of compression codes. To finds the solution of COPER, an efficient iterative algorithm called gradient descent for COPER (GD-COPER) is proposed. It is proven that under some mild conditions on the initialization and the compression code, if the number of measurements is larger than Cκ 2 log 2 n, where C is a constant, GD-COPER obtains an accurate estimate of the input vector in polynomial time. In the simulation results, JPEG2000 is integrated in GD-COPER to confirm the state-of-the-art performance of the resulting algorithm on real-world images.},

A popular model for estimating x 0 is the nonlinear least squares x̂ := argmin x |||Ax| - y|| 2 . One has already developed many efficient algorithms for solving the model, such as the seminal error reduction algorithm. In this paper, we present the estimation performance of the model with proving that ||x̂ - x 0 || ≲ ||η|| 2 /√m under the assumption of A being a Gaussian random matrix. We also prove the reconstruction error ||η|| 2 /√m is sharp. For the case where x 0 is sparse, we study the estimation performance of both the nonlinear Lasso of phase retrieval and its unconstrained version. Our results are non-asymptotic, and we do not assume any distribution on the noise η. To the best of our knowledge, our results represent the first theoretical guarantee for the nonlinear least squares and for the nonlinear Lasso of phase retrieval.},

Side information for each node in the graph is modeled by a random vector in which either the vector dimension or the LLR of each component with respect to node labels is independent of n. These two models represent the variation in quality and quantity of side information. Under maximum likelihood detection, we calculate tight necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery of the labels. We demonstrate how side information needs to evolve with n in terms of either its quantity, or quality, to improve the exact recovery threshold. A similar set of results are obtained for weak recovery. Under belief propagation, tight necessary and sufficient conditions for weak recovery are calculated when the LLRs are constant, and sufficient conditions when the LLRs vary with n. Moreover, we design and analyze a local voting procedure using side information that can achieve exact recovery when applied after belief propagation.},

  abstract     = {The classical problem of supervised learning is to infer an accurate estimate of a target variable Y from a measured variable X using a set of labeled training samples. Motivated by the increasingly distributed nature of data and decision making, this paper considers a variation of this classical problem in which the inference is distributed between two nodes, e.g., a mobile device and a cloud, with a rate constraint on the communication between them. The mobile device observes X and sends a description M of X to the cloud, which computes an estimate Y̑ of Y. We follow the recent minimax learning approach to study this inference problem and show that it corresponds to a one-shot minimax noisy lossy source coding problem. We then establish information theoretic bounds on the risk-rate Lagrangian cost, leading to a general method for designing a near-optimal descriptor-estimator pair. A key ingredient in the proof of our result is a refined version of the strong functional representation lemma previously used to establish several one-shot source coding theorems. Our results show that a naive estimate-compress scheme for rate-constrained inference is not optimal in general. When the distribution of (X, Y) is known and the error is measured by the logarithmic loss, our bounds on the risk-rate Lagrangian cost provide a new one-shot operational interpretation of the information bottleneck. We also demonstrate a way to bound the excess risk of the descriptor-estimator pair obtained by our method.},

We avail ourselves to a procedure that can test a group of multiple individuals, with the test result coming out positive iff at least one individual in the group is infected. With all tests conducted in parallel, what is the least number of tests required to identify the status of all individuals? In a recent test design [Aldridge et al. 2016] the individuals are assigned to test groups randomly with replacement, with every individual joining an almost equal number of groups. We pinpoint the sharp threshold for the number of tests required in this randomised design so that it is information-theoretically possible to infer the infection status of every individual. Moreover, we analyse two efficient inference algorithms. These results settle conjectures from [Aldridge et al. 2014, Johnson et al. 2019].},

In this paper, we study the support recovery problem in the phase retrieval model consisting of noisy phaseless measurements, which arises in a diverse range of settings such as optical detection, X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and coherent diffractive imaging. Our focus is on information-theoretic fundamental limits under an approximate recovery criterion, considering both discrete and Gaussian models for the sparse non-zero entries, along with Gaussian measurement matrices. In both cases, our bounds provide sharp thresholds with near-matching constant factors in several scaling regimes on the sparsity and signal-to-noise ratio. As a key step towards obtaining these results, we develop new concentration bounds for the conditional information content of log-concave random variables, which may be of independent interest.},

For sets |A|, |B| = Θ(2 n ) it is well known that the largest (smallest) probability is approximately attained by concentric (anti-concentric) Hamming balls, and this can be proved via the hypercontractive inequality (reverse hypercontractivity). Here we consider the case of |A|, |B| = 2 Θ (n). By applying a recent extension of the hypercontractive inequality of Polyanskiy-Samorodnitsky (J. Functional Analysis, 2019), we show that Hamming balls of the same size approximately maximize P[X ∈ A, Y ∈ B] in the regime of p → 1. We also prove a similar tight lower bound, i.e. show that for p → 0 the pair of opposite Hamming balls approximately minimizes the probability P[X ∈ A, Y ∈ B].},

This general strategy turns out to be sample-optimal even for distribution testing among private-coin protocols. Interestingly, we propose a public-coin protocol that outperforms simulate-and-infer for distribution testing and is, in fact, sample-optimal.

The referee uses the players&#39; messages to solve an inference problem on the unknown distribution that generated the samples. We derive lower bounds for the sample complexity of learning and testing discrete distributions in this informationconstrained setting. Underlying our bounds is a characterization of the contraction in chi-square distance between the observed distributions of the samples when information constraints are placed. This contraction is captured in a local neighborhood in terms of chi-square and decoupled chi-square fluctuations of a given channel, two quantities we introduce. The former captures the average distance between distributions of channel output for two product distributions on the input, and the latter for a product distribution and a mixture of product distribution on the input. Our bounds are tight for both publicand privatecoin protocols. Interestingly, the sample complexity of testing is order-wise higher when restricted to private-coin protocols.},

  abstract     = {The spread spectrum signal detection problem is examined in colored noise with an unknown covariance matrix. When the receiver is equipped with a symmetrically spaced linear array, persymmetry exists in the received data. We exploit the persymmetric structures to design adaptive detectors according to the principles of generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), Wald test, and Rao test. It turns out that the proposed GLRT has the same form as the proposed Wald test, and the Rao test does not exist. We prove that the proposed detector exhibits a constant false alarm rate against the unknown noise covariance matrix. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed detector has better performance than its non-persymmetric counterpart.},

Present methods of sparse and robust regression are based on ℓ 1 -penalization, and their theoretical properties are not well-investigated. In contrast, we use a general class of folded concave penalties that ensure sparse recovery and consistent estimation of regression coefficients. We propose an alternating algorithm based on the Concave-Convex procedure to obtain our estimate, and demonstrate its robustness properties using influence function analysis. Under some conditions on the fixed design matrix and penalty function, we prove that this estimator possesses large-sample oracle properties in an ultrahigh-dimensional regime. The performance and effectiveness of our proposed method for parameter estimation and prediction compared to state-of-the-art are demonstrated through simulation studies.},

In addition, we consider communication from Alice to Bob over a noisy channel N, instead of the noiseless channel, as is usually considered in state redistribution. We take a natural approach towards the solution of this problem where we “embed” the promise as part of the state and then invoke known protocols for quantum state redistribution composed with known protocols for transfer of quantum information over noisy channels. Using our approach, we are able to reproduce the Alpha-bit capacities with or without entanglement assistance in Hayden and Penington, using known protocols for quantum state redistribution and quantum communication over noisy channels. Furthermore, we generalize the entanglement assisted classical Alpha-bit capacity, showing that any quantum state redistribution protocol can be used as a black box to simulate classical communication.},

The sender wishes to reliably communicate a common (or public) message to both receivers as well as individualized and confidential messages to the primary receiver only. The third party receiver must be kept completely ignorant of the confidential message but there are no secrecy requirements associated to the individualized message. A trade-off arises between the rates of the three messages: when one of the rates is high, the other rates may need to back off to guarantee the reliable transmission of all three messages. In addition, the confidentiality requirement implies availability of local randomness at the transmitter in order to implement a stochastic encoding. This article studies the trade-off between the rates of the common, individualized and confidential messages as well as that of the local randomness in the one-shot regime of a quantum broadcast channel. We provide an achievability region, by proving a conditional version of the convex-split lemma combined with the position-based decoding, as well as a (weak) converse region. We study the asymptotic behaviour of our bounds and recover several well-known asymptotic results in the literature, including simultaneous transmission of classical and quantum information.},

Each family of Rudin-Shapiro-like sequences is obtained from a starting sequence (which we call the seed) by a recursive construction that doubles the length of the sequence at each step, and many sequences produced in this manner have exceptionally low aperiodic autocorrelation. Borwein and Mossinghoff showed that the asymptotic autocorrelation merit factor for any such family is at most 3, and found the seeds of length 40 or less that produce the maximum asymptotic merit factor of 3. The definition of Rudin-Shapiro-like sequences was generalized by Katz, Lee, and Trunov to include sequences with arbitrary complex coefficients, among which are families of low autocorrelation polyphase sequences. Katz, Lee, and Trunov proved that the maximum asymptotic merit factor is also 3 for this larger class. Here we show that a family of such Rudin-Shapiro-like sequences achieves asymptotic merit factor 3 if and only if the seed is either of length 1 or is the interleaving of a pair of Golay complementary sequences. For small seed lengths where this is not possible, the optimal seeds are interleavings of pairs that are as close as possible to being complementary pairs, and the idea of an almost-complementary pair makes sense of remarkable patterns in previously unexplained data on optimal seeds for binary Rudin-Shapiro-like sequences.},

In particular, we settle some of their conjectures. More precisely, we prove two results. First, for a prime p ≥ 5, the maximal cross-correlation of the family of the φ(p-1) different Welch Costas permutations of {1, . . . , p-1} is (p - 1)/t, where t is the smallest prime divisor of (p - 1)/2 if p is not a safe prime and at most 1 + p 1/2 otherwise. Here φ denotes Euler&#39;s totient function and a prime p is a safe prime if (p - 1)/2 is also prime. Second, for a prime power q ≥ 4 the maximal cross-correlation of a subfamily of Golomb Costas permutations of {1, . . . , q - 2} is (q - 1)/t - 1 if t is the smallest prime divisor of (q - 1)/2 if q is odd and of q - 1 if q is even provided that (q - 1)/2 and q - 1 are not prime, and at most 1 + q 1/2 otherwise. Note that we consider a smaller family than Drakakis et al. Our family is of size φ(q - 1) whereas there are φ(q - 1) 2 different Golomb Costas permutations. The maximal cross-correlation of the larger family given in the tables of Drakakis et al. is larger than our bound (for the smaller family) for some q.},

  abstract     = {Given a vectorial function F : F 2 n → F 2 m , the indicator 1 GF of its graph G F = {(x,F(x));x ∈ F 2 n } allows to express the algebraic degree of F in a simple way. Exploiting the formula, obtained in a previous article, for the graph indicator of a composite function G o F, that involves only a sum of products of 1 GF and 1 GG , we deduce the exact expression as well as bounds on the algebraic degree of G o F, whose efficiency comes from the fact that the algebraic degree of the product of two Boolean functions is bounded above by the sum of their algebraic degrees, while for a composition, it is bounded above by their product. One of these bounds, that depends on the algebraic degrees of G and 1 GF , is tight, general, simple, and most often efficient (for the case where it is not efficient, we give an improved bound, that is a little more complex). As far as we know, it is the first efficient upper bound ever found, that works without any condition on the vectorial functions. It provides a new criterion for the choice of S-boxes in block ciphers. It implies as a corollary a known bound assuming the divisibility of the Walsh transform values by a power of 2. It gives a better view why this latter bound works. All the bounds generalize to more than two functions and this represents also an improvement over the state of the art. When F is a permutation, our expression of the algebraic degree of G o F simplifies into a formula involving the algebraic degrees of the products of a coordinate function of G and coordinate functions of F -1 . This implies another known bound showing that the algebraic degree of F -1 has more impact on that of G o F than that of F itself. Our approach by graph indicators gives a more complete explanation to this interesting fact. Our results include all the known efficient bounds as particular cases, and clarify the reasons why they work. We also deduce the exact expression of the algebraic degree of the composition of any number of functions, leading to a bound that is much more efficient than what we obtain by applying the known bound several times. We also obtain two bounds on the algebraic degree of G o F, where F is a permutation, given the divisibility by powers of 2 of some Walsh transform values of component functions of F and their sums with a coordinate function of G. We compare all the bounds of this kind obtained so far and show how they are complementary, and we study the generalizations of all (known and new) bounds of this kind to the composition of more than two functions.},

Each legitimate source wants to communicate with its intended destination node while ensuring that every WN is unable to detect the presence of the communication. In this scenario, we study the throughput scaling law. Due to the covert communication constraint, the transmit powers are necessarily limited. Under this condition, we introduce a preservation region around each WN. This regionsuitably modified by taking a detour around each preservation region. To avoid the concentration of detours resulting extra relaying burdens, we distribute the detours evenly over a wide region. In the proposed HC scheme, we control the symbol power and the scheduling of distributed multiple-input multiple-output transmission. We also present upper bounds on the throughput scaling under the assumption that every active LN consumes the same average transmit power over the time period in which the WNs observe the channel outputs. For 0 &lt;; κ &lt;; 1, these upper bounds match with the achievable throughput scalings.},

Our work effectively shows that having multiple transmit antennas - while providing full multiplexing gains - can also simultaneously completely remove the performance penalties that are typically associated to cache-size unevenness. Focusing on the multiple-input single-output Broadcast Channel, the work first identifies the performance limits of the extreme case where cache-aided users coincide with users that do not have caches, and then expands the analysis to the case where both user groups are cache-aided but with heterogeneous cache-sizes. In the first case, the main contribution is a new algorithm that employs perfect matchings on a bipartite graph to offer full multiplexing as well as full coded-caching gains to both cache-aided as well as cache-less users. An interesting conclusion is that, starting from a single-stream centralized coded caching setting with normalized cache size -y, then adding L antennas allows for the addition of up to approximately L/γ extra cache-less users, at no added delay costs. Similarly surprising is the finding that, beginning with a single-antenna hybrid system (with both cache-less and cache-aided users), then adding L - 1 antennas to the transmitter, as well as endowing the cache-less users with a cumulative normalized cache size Γ 2 , increases the Degrees of Freedom by a multiplicative factor of up to Γ 2 + L.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) links with one-bit output quantization in terms of achievable rates and characterize their performance loss compared to unquantized systems for general channel statistical models and general channel state information (CSI) at the receiver. One-bit ADCs are particularly suitable for large-scale millimeter wave MIMO Communications (massive MIMO) to reduce the hardware complexity. In such applications, the signal-to-noise ratio per antenna is rather low due to the propagation loss. Thus, it is crucial to analyze the performance of MIMO systems in this regime by means of information-theoretical methods. Since an exact and general information-theoretic analysis is not possible, we resort to the derivation of a general asymptotic expression for the mutual information in terms of a second-order expansion around zero SNR. We show that up to second order in the SNR, the mutual information of a system with two-level (sign) output signals incorporates only a power penalty factor of π/2 (1.96 dB) compared to systems with infinite resolution for all channels of practical interest with perfect or statistical CSI. An essential aspect of the derivation is that we do not rely on the common pseudo-quantization noise model.},

For this setting, we present an exact characterization of the bee-identification error exponent, and show that independent barcode decoding is optimal, i.e., joint decoding of the bee barcodes does not result in a better error exponent relative to independent decoding of each noisy barcode. This is in contrast to the result without absentee bees, where joint barcode decoding results in a significantly higher error exponent than independent barcode decoding. We also define and characterize the `capacity&#39; for the bee-identification problem with absentee bees, and prove a strong converse for the same.},

One is the source resolvability problem (resolvability problem for short) and the other is the intrinsic randomness problem. In the literature, optimum achievable rates in these two problems with respect to the variational distance as well as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence have already been analyzed. On the other hand, in this study we consider these two problems with respect to f-divergences. The f-divergence is a general non-negative measure between two probabilistic distributions on the basis of a convex function f. The class of f-divergences includes several important measures such as the variational distance, the KL divergence, the Hellinger distance and so on. Hence, it is meaningful to consider the random number generation problems with respect to f-divergences. In this paper, we impose some conditions on the function f so as to simplify the analysis, that is, we consider a subclass of f-divergences. Then, we first derive general formulas of the first-order optimum achievable rates with respect to f-divergences. Next, we particularize our general formulas to several specified functions f. As a result, we reveal that it is easy to derive optimum achievable rates for several important measures from our general formulas. The second-order optimum achievable rates and optimistic optimum achievable rates have also been investigated.},

Instead of requiring the code to be error-free, we allow for it to have a non-vanishing error probability. We derive one-shot bounds on the optimal average codeword length by proposing two new information quantities; namely, the conditional and unconditional ε-cutoff entropies. Using these one-shot bounds, we obtain the second-order asymptotics of the problem under two different formalisms-the average and maximum probabilities of error over the realization of the side-information. While the first-order terms in the asymptotic expansions for both formalisms are identical, we find that the source dispersion under the average error formalism is, in most cases, strictly smaller than its maximum error counterpart. Applications to a certain class of guessing problems, previously studied by Kuzuoka (2020), are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {A single-sensor two-detectors system is considered where the sensor communicates with both detectors and Detector 1 communicates with Detector 2, all over noise-free rate-limited links. The sensor and both detectors observe discrete memoryless source sequences whose joint probability mass function depends on a binary hypothesis. The goal at each detector is to guess the binary hypothesis in a way that, for increasing observation lengths, the probability of error under one of the hypotheses decays to zero with largest possible exponential decay, whereas the probability of error under the other hypothesis can decay to zero or to a small positive number arbitrarily slow. For the setting with positive communication rates from the sensor to the detectors and when both detectors are interested in maximizing the error exponent under the same hypothesis, we characterize the set of all possible exponents in a special case of testing against independence. In this case the cooperation link allows Detector 2 to increase its Type-II error exponent by an amount that is equal to the exponent attained at Detector 1. We also provide a general inner bound on the set of achievable error exponents that shows a tradeoff between the exponents at the two detectors in most cases. When the two detectors aim at maximizing the error exponent under different hypotheses and the distribution at the Sensor is different under the two hypotheses, then we show that such a tradeoff does not exist. We propose a general scheme that allows each detector to attain the same exponent as if it was the only detector in the system. For the setting with zero-rate communication on both links, we exactly characterize the set of possible exponents and the gain brought up by cooperation, in function of the number of bits that are sent over the two links. Notice that, for this setting, tradeoffs between the exponents achieved at the two detectors arise only in few particular cases. In all other cases, each detector achieves the same performance as if it were the only detector in the system.},

Our focus in this work is on the two extreme points: the point when the storage cost is minimal, and the point when the download cost is minimal. Two novel outer bounds are provided, which have the following implications at these two extreme points. When the messages are stored without any redundancy across the databases, the optimal PIR strategy is to download all the messages; on the other hand, for PIR capacity-achieving codes, each database can reduce the storage cost, from storing all the messages, by no more than one message on average. To better understand the second extreme point, we then focus on the two-message two-database case, and show that a stronger outer bound can be derived through a novel pseudo-message technique. This stronger outer bound suggests that a precise characterization of the storage-download tradeoff may require more sophisticated bounding techniques.},

  abstract     = {We study a guessing game where Alice holds a discrete random variable X, and Bob tries to sequentially guess its value. Before the game begins, Bob can obtain side-information about X by asking an oracle, Carole, any binary question of his choosing. Carole&#39;s answer is however unreliable, and is incorrect with probability ϵ. We show that Bob should always ask Carole whether the index of X is odd or even with respect to a descending order of probabilities - this question simultaneously minimizes all the guessing moments for any value of ϵ. In particular, this result settles a conjecture of Burin and Shayevitz. We further consider a more general setup where Bob can ask a multiple-choice M-ary question, and then observe Carole&#39;s answer through a noisy channel. When the channel is completely symmetric, i.e., when Carole decides whether to lie regardless of Bob&#39;s question and has no preference when she lies, a similar question about the ordered index of X (modulo M) is optimal. Interestingly however, the problem of testing whether a given question is optimal appears to be generally difficult in other symmetric channels. We provide supporting evidence for this difficulty, by showing that a core property required in our proofs becomes NP-hard to test in the general M-ary case. We establish this hardness result via a reduction from the problem of testing whether a system of modular difference disequations has a solution, which we prove to be NP-hard for M ≥ 3.},

The codes proposed in this work can trade between the repair bandwidth of nodes (number of downloaded symbols from each surviving node in a repair process) and the required storage overhead of the system. These codes work for general system parameters (n, k, d), which are the total number of nodes, the number of nodes suffice for data recovery, and the number of helper nodes in a repair process, respectively. The proposed construction offers a unified scheme to develop exact-repair regenerating codes for the entire trade-off, including the MBR and MSR points. We conjecture that the new storage-vs.-bandwidth trade-off achieved by the proposed codes is optimum. Some other key features of this code include: the construction is linear; the required field size is only Θ(n); and the code parameters and in particular sub-packetization level is at most (d - k +1) k ; which is independent of the number of the parity nodes. Moreover, the proposed repair mechanism is helperindependent, that is the data sent from each helper only depends on the identity of the helper and failed nodes, but independent of the identity of other helper nodes participating in the repair process.},

Second, we introduce an approximate variant of the gradient coding problem, in which we settle for approximate gradient computation instead of the exact one. This approach enables graceful degradation, i.e., the ℓ 2 error of the approximate gradient is a decreasing function of the number of stragglers. Our main result is that normalized adjacency matrices of expander graphs yield excellent approximate gradient codes, which enable significantly less computation compared to exact gradient coding, and guarantee faster convergence than trivial solutions under standard assumptions. We experimentally test our approach on Amazon EC2, and show that the generalization error of approximate gradient coding is very close to the full gradient while requiring significantly less computation from the workers.},

It is proved that there are only five classes of possible parameters with which optimal binary LRCs exist.

The node size (or sub-packetization) in this construction scales as exp(Θ(n h )), where h is the number of failed nodes and n is the code length. In this paper, we give new explicit constructions of optimal MDS codes for all possible parameters under the cooperative model, and the node size of our new constructions only scales as exp(O(n)) for any number of failed nodes. Furthermore, it is known that any optimal MDS code under the cooperative model (including, in particular, our new code construction) also achieves optimal repair bandwidth under the centralized model, where the amount of data exchanged between failed nodes is not included in the repair bandwidth.

  abstract     = {The problem of X-secure T-private information retrieval from MDS coded storage is studied in this paper, where the user wishes to privately retrieve one out of K independent messages that are distributed over N servers according to an MDS code. It is guaranteed that any group of up to X colluding servers learn nothing about the messages and that any group of up to T colluding servers learn nothing about the identity of desired message. A lower bound of achievable rates is proved by presenting a novel scheme based on cross-subspace alignment and a successive decoding with interference cancellation strategy. For large number of messages (K → ∞) the achieved rate, which we conjecture to be optimal, improves upon the best known rates previously reported in the literature by Raviv and Karpuk, and generalizes an achievable rate for MDS-TPIR previously found by Freij-Hollanti et al. that is also conjectured to be asymptotically optimal. The setting is then expanded to allow unresponsive and Byzantine servers. Finally, the scheme is applied to find a new lower convex hull of (download, upload) pairs of secure and private distributed matrix multiplication that generalizes, and in certain asymptotic settings strictly improves upon the best known previous results.},

  abstract     = {Vector linear solvability of non-multicast networks depends upon both the characteristic of the finite held and the dimension of the vector linear network code. In the literature, the dependency on the characteristic of the finite held and the dependency on the dimension have been studied separately. In this paper, we show the interdependency between the characteristic of the finite held and the dimension of the vector linear network code that achieves a vector linear network coding (VLNC) solution in non-multicast networks. For any given network Al, we dehne P(N, d) as the set of all characteristics of finite fields over which the network N has a d-dimensional VLNC solution. To the best of our knowledge, for any network N shown in the literature, if P(N, 1) is non-empty, then P(N, 1) = P(N, d) for any positive integer d. We show that, for any two non-empty sets of primes P 1 and P 2 , there exists a network N such that P(N, 1) = P 1 , but P(N, 2) = {P 1 , P 2 }. We also show that there are networks exhibiting a similar advantage (the existence of a VLNC solution over a larger set of characteristics) if the dimension is increased from 2 to 3. However, such behaviour is not universal, as there exist networks which admit a VLNC solution over a smaller set of characteristics of finite fields when the dimension is increased. Using the networks constructed in this paper, we further demonstrate that: (i) a network having an m 1 -dimensional VLNC solution over a finite held of some characteristic and an m 2 -dimensional VLNC solution over a finite held of some other characteristic may not have an (m 1 + m 2 )-dimensional VLNC solution over any finite held; (ii) there exist a class of networks for which scalar linear network coding (SLNC) over non-commutative rings has some advantage over SLNC over finite fields: the least sized non-commutative ring over which each network in the class has an SLNC solution is significantly lesser in size than the least sized finite held over which it has an SLNC solution.},

  abstract     = {An index code for broadcast channel with receiver side information is locally decodable if each receiver can decode its demand by observing only a subset of the transmitted codeword symbols instead of the entire codeword. Local decodability in index coding is known to reduce receiver complexity, improve user privacy and decrease decoding error probability in wireless fading channels. Conventional index coding solutions assume that the receivers observe the entire codeword, and as a result, for these codes the number of codeword symbols queried by a user per decoded message symbol, which we refer to as locality, could be large. In this paper, we pose the index coding problem as that of minimizing the broadcast rate for a given value of locality (or vice versa) and designing codes that achieve the optimal trade-off between locality and rate. We identify the optimal broadcast rate corresponding to the minimum possible value of locality for all single unicast problems. We present new structural properties of index codes which allow us to characterize the optimal trade-off achieved by: vector linear codes when the side information graph is a directed cycle; and scalar linear codes when the minrank of the side information graph is one less than the order of the problem. We also identify the optimal trade-off among all codes, including non-linear codes, when the side information graph is a directed 3-cycle. Finally, we present techniques to design locally decodable index codes for arbitrary single unicast problems and arbitrary values of locality.},

In particular, for the shift-XOR minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) codes, our decoding and repair schemes have the optimal transmission bandwidth and can be implemented in-place without extra storage space for intermediate XOR results. Technically, our schemes involve an in-place algorithm for solving a system of shift-XOR equations, called shift-XOR elimination, which does not have the bandwidth overhead generated by shift operations as in the previous zigzag algorithm and has lower computation complexities compared with the zigzag algorithm. The decoding and repair of shift-XOR MBR/MSR codes are decomposed into a sequence of systems of shift-XOR equations, and hence can be solved by a sequence of calls to the shift-XOR elimination. As the decompositions of the decoding and repair depend only on the PM construction, but not the specific shift and XOR operations, our decoding and repair schemes can be extended to other MBR/MSR codes using the PM construction. Due to its fundamental role, the shift-XOR elimination is of independent interest.},

In this article, we introduce the notion of complete 3-MDP convolutional codes, which are a generalization of complete MDP convolutional codes, and describe their decoding properties. In particular, we present a decoding algorithm for decoding erasures within a given time delay T and show that complete T-MDP convolutional codes are optimal for this algorithm. Moreover, using a computer search with the MAPLE software, we determine the minimal binary and non-binary field size for the existence of (2, 1, 2) complete 3-MDP convolutional codes and provide corresponding constructions. We give a description of all (2, 1, 2) complete MDP convolutional codes over the smallest possible fields, namely F 13 and F 16 and we also give constructions for (2, 1, 3) complete 4-MDP convolutional codes over F 128 obtained by a randomized computer search.},

  abstract     = {Reed-Muller (RM) codes were introduced in 1954 and have long been conjectured to achieve Shannon&#39;s capacity on symmetric channels. The activity on this conjecture has recently been revived with the emergence of polar codes. RM codes and polar codes are generated by the same matrix G m = [ 1 1 1 0 ] ⊗m but using different subset of rows. RM codes 1 1 select simply rows having largest weights. Polar codes select instead rows having the largest conditional mutual information proceeding top to down in Gm; while this is a more elaborate and channel-dependent rule, the top-to-down ordering allows Arıkan to show that the conditional mutual information polarizes, and this gives directly a capacity-achieving code on any symmetric channel. RM codes are yet to be proved to have such a property, despite the recent success for the erasure channel. In this article, we connect RM codes to polarization theory. We show that proceeding in the RM code ordering, i.e., not top-to-down but from the lightest to the heaviest rows in G m, the conditional mutual information again polarizes. Here “polarization” means that almost all the conditional mutual information becomes either very close to 0 or very close to 1. Polarization itself is a necessary condition for RM codes to achieve capacity on symmetric channels while polarization together with a strong order on the conditional mutual information gives a sufficient condition, where strong order means that rows with larger weight always correspond to larger conditional mutual information. Although we are not able to prove the strong order, we establish a partial order on the conditional mutual information, which is a subset of the strong order. While the main results of this article-polarization together with the partial order-provide some advances on the capacity-achieving conjecture of RM codes, we emphasize that our results do not allow us to prove the conjecture.},

Using this technique, we develop a general approach for obtaining fine-grained, entrywise bounds for iterative stochastic procedures in the presence of probabilistic dependency. We demonstrate the power of this approach in analyzing two of the most important algorithms for matrix completion: (i) the non-convex approach based on Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) for a rank-constrained formulation, also known as the Singular Value Projection algorithm, and (ii) the convex relaxation approach based on nuclear norm minimization (NNM). Using this approach, we establish the first convergence guarantee for the original form of PGD without regularization or sample splitting, and in particular shows that it converges linearly in the infinity norm. For NNM, we use this approach to study a fictitious iterative procedure that arises in the dual analysis. Our results show that NNM recovers an d-by-d rank-r matrix with O(μr log(μr)d log d) observed entries. This bound has optimal dependence on the matrix dimension and is independent of the condition number. To the best of our knowledge, none of previous sample complexity results for tractable matrix completion algorithms satisfies these two properties simultaneously.},

These problems are of interest in, e.g., computational imaging applications relying on optical multiplexing or single-pixel imaging. However, the realization of such modalities is often hindered by the coherence between the Hadamard and Haar bases. The variable and multilevel density sampling strategies solve this issue by adjusting the subsampling process to the local and multilevel coherence, respectively, between the two bases; hence enabling successful signal recovery. In this work, we compute an explicit sample-complexity bound for Hadamard-Haar systems as well as uniform and non-uniform recovery guarantees; a seemingly missing result in the related literature. We explore the faithfulness of the numerical simulations to the theoretical results and show in a practically relevant instance, e.g., single-pixel camera, that the target signal can be recovered from a few Hadamard measurements.},

When the observations are noisy, it is critical to ensure support stability, where the deconvolution does not lead to spurious, or oppositely, missing estimates of the point sources. In this paper, we study the resolution limit of stably recovering the support of two closely located point sources using the Beurling-LASSO estimator, which is a convex optimization approach based on total variation regularization. We establish a sufficient separation criterion between the sources, depending only on the PSF, above which the Beurling-LASSO estimator is guaranteed to return a stable estimate of the point sources, with the same number of estimated elements as that of the ground truth. Our result highlights the impact of PSF on the resolution limit in the noisy setting, which was not evident in previous studies of the noiseless setting. Towards the end, we show that the same resolution limit applies to resolving two close-located sources in conjunction of other well-separated sources.},

  abstract     = {In the sparse polynomial multiplication problem, one is asked to multiply two sparse polynomials f and g in time that is proportional to the size of the input plus the size of the output. The polynomials are given via lists, F and G of their coefficients. Cole and Hariharan (STOC 02) have given a nearly optimal algorithm when the coefficients are positive, and Arnold and Roche (ISSAC 15) devised an algorithm running in time proportional to the “structural sparsity” of the product, i.e. the set (F) + (G). The latter algorithm is particularly efficient when there are not “too many cancellations” of coefficients in the product. In this work we give a clean, nearly optimal algorithm for the sparse polynomial multiplication problem.},

  abstract     = {We consider the classical sequential binary hypothesis testing problem in which there are two hypotheses governed respectively by distributions P 0 and P 1 and we would like to decide which hypothesis is true using a sequential test. It is known from the work of Wald and Wolfowitz that as the expectation of the length of the test grows, the optimal type-I and type-II error exponents approach the relative entropies D(P 1 ∥P 0 ) and D(P 0 ∥P 1 ). We refine this result by considering the optimal backoff-or second-order asymptotics-from the corner point of the achievable exponent region (D(P 1 ∥P 0 ), D(P 0 ∥P 1 )) under two different constraints on the length of the test (or the sample size). First, we consider a probabilistic constraint in which the probability that the length of test exceeds a prescribed integer n is less than a certain threshold 0 &lt;; ε &lt;; 1. Second, the expectation of the sample size is bounded by n. In both cases, and under mild conditions, the second-order asymptotics is characterized exactly. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate our results.},

  abstract     = {The k-vectors algorithm for learning regression functions proposed here is akin to the well-known k-means algorithm. Both algorithms partition the feature space, but unlike the k-means algorithm, the k-vectors algorithm aims to reconstruct the response rather than the feature. The partitioning rule of the algorithm is based on maximizing the correlation (inner product) of the feature vector with a set of k vectors, and generates polyhedral cells, similar to the ones generated by the nearest-neighbor rule of the k-means algorithm. Similarly to k-means, the learning algorithm alternates between two types of steps. In the first type of steps, k labels are determined via a centroid-type rule (in the response space), which uses a surrogate hinge-type loss function to the mean squared error loss function. In the second type of steps, the k vectors which determine the partition are updated according to a multiclass classification rule, in the spirit of support vector machines. It is proved that both steps of the algorithm only require solving convex optimization problems, and that the algorithm is empirically consistent - as the length of the training sequence increases to infinity, fixedpoints of the empirical version of the algorithm tend to fixed points of the population version of the algorithm. Learnability of the predictor class posit by the algorithm is also established.},

  abstract     = {In many statistical linear inverse problems, one needs to recover classes of similar objects from their noisy images under an operator that does not have a bounded inverse. Problems of this kind appear in many areas of application. Routinely, in such problems clustering is carried out at a pre-processing step and then the inverse problem is solved for each of the cluster averages separately. As a result, the errors of the procedures are usually examined for the estimation step only. The objective of this paper is to examine, both theoretically and via simulations, the effect of clustering on the accuracy of the solutions of general ill-posed linear inverse problems. In particular, we assume that one observes X m = Af m + δε m , m = 1, ⋯ , M, where functions f m an be grouped into K classes and one needs to recover a vector function f = (f 1 , ⋯ , f M ) T . We construct an estimator for f as a solution of a penalized optimization problem which corresponds to the clustering before estimation setting. We derive an oracle inequality for its precision and confirm that the estimator is minimax optimal or nearly minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor of the number of observations. One of the advantages of our approach is that we do not assume that the number of clusters is known in advance. Subsequently, we compare the accuracy of the above procedure with the precision of estimation without clustering, and clustering following the recovery of each of the unknown functions separately. We conclude that clustering at the pre-processing step is beneficial when the problem is moderately ill-posed. It should be applied with extreme care when the problem is severely ill-posed.},

  abstract     = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a thriving unsupervised machine learning technique that has led to significant advances in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, among others. However, GANs are known to be difficult to train and usually suffer from mode collapse and the discriminator winning problem. To interpret the empirical observations of GANs and design better ones, we deconstruct the study of GANs into three components and make the following contributions. Formulation: we propose a perturbation view of the population target of GANs. Building on this interpretation, we show that GANs can be connected to the robust statistics framework, and propose a novel GAN architecture, termed as Cascade GANs, to provably recover meaningful low-dimensional generator approximations when the real distribution is high-dimensional and corrupted by outliers. Generalization: given a population target of GANs, we design a systematic principle, projection under admissible distance, to design GANs to meet the population requirement using only finite samples. We implement our principle in three cases to achieve polynomial and sometimes near-optimal sample complexities: (1) learning an arbitrary generator under an arbitrary pseudonorm; (2) learning a Gaussian location family under total variation distance, where we utilize our principle to provide a new proof for the near-optimality of the Tukey median viewed as GANs; (3) learning a low-dimensional Gaussian approximation of a high-dimensional arbitrary distribution under Wasserstein distance. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off in the approximation error and statistical error in GANs, and demonstrate how to apply our principle in practice with only empirical samples to predict how many samples would be sufficient for GANs in order not to suffer from the discriminator winning problem. Optimization: we demonstrate alternating gradient descent is provably not locally asymptotically stable in optimizing the GAN formulation of PCA. We found that the minimax duality gap being non-zero might be one of the causes, and propose a new GAN architecture whose duality gap is zero, where the value of the game is equal to the previous minimax value (not the maximin value). We prove the new GAN architecture is globally asymptotically stable in solving PCA under alternating gradient descent.},

  abstract     = {When estimating coefficients in a linear model, the (sparse) composite quantile regression was first proposed in Zou and Yuan (2008) as an efficient alternative to the (sparse) least squares to handle arbitrary error distribution. The highly nonsmooth nature of the composite loss in the sparse composite quantile regression makes its theoretical analysis as well as numerical computation much more challenging than the least squares method. The theory in Zou and Yuan (2008) was proven under fixed-dimension asymptotics and the estimator was computed via linear programming that does not scale well with high dimensions. In this paper, we study the sparse composite quantile regression under ultrahigh dimensionality and make three contributions. First, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis of both the lasso and the folded concave penalized composite quantile regression, which reveals a practical way of achieving the oracle estimator. Second, we construct a novel information criterion for selecting the regularization parameter in the folded concave penalized composite quantile regression and prove its selection consistency. Third, we exploit the structure of the composite loss and design a specialized optimization algorithm for computing the penalized composite quantile regression via the alternating direction method of multipliers. We conduct extensive simulations to illustrate the theoretical results. Our analysis provides a unified treatment of the concentration inequalities involving the composite loss. Those inequalities could be of independent interest.},

In this paper, we propose the concept of vanishing flats, which supplies a combinatorial viewpoint on the planarity. First, the number of vanishing flats of $f$ can be regarded as a measure of the distance between $f$ and the set of almost perfect nonlinear functions. In some cases, the number of vanishing flats serves as an “intermediate” concept between differential uniformity and differential spectrum, which contains more information than differential uniformity, however less than the differential spectrum. Secondly, the set of vanishing flats forms a combinatorial configuration called partial quadruple system, since it conveys a detailed structural information about $f$ . We initiate this study by considering the number of vanishing flats and the partial quadruple systems associated with monomials and Dembowski-Ostrom polynomials. In addition, we present an application of vanishing flats to the partition of a vector space into disjoint equidimensional affine spaces. We conclude the paper with several further questions and challenges.},

Earlier results on homogeneous random K-out graphs H(n; K n ), where all nodes select the same number K of other nodes, reveal that H(n; K n ) is connected with high probability (whp) if K n ≥ 2 which implies that H(n; μ, K n ) is connected whp if K 1,n ≥ 2. In this paper, we investigate the connectivity of inhomogeneous random K-out graphs H(n; μ, Kn) for the special case when K 1,n = 1, i.e., when each class 1 node selects only one other node. We show that H (n; μ, K n ) is connected whp if K r,n is chosen such that lim n→∞ K r,n = ∞. However, any bounded choice of the sequenceKr,n gives a positive probability of H (n; μ, K n ) being asymptotically not connected in the limit of large n.

These two settings had in the past been studied separately; the setting of imperfect current CSIT has attracted considerable interest over the last decade, while the setting of delayed CSIT was studied in the seminal work of Maddah-Ali and Tse in 2010 1 where an optimal DoF of K/ Σ k=1 K 1/k was established. Since k=1 then there have been several efforts to combine the two settings of delayed and imperfect-current CSIT. Our work establishes for the first time the optimal DoF in this joint setting, capitalizing on a novel transmission scheme that is presented here, which combines a structurally new approach of handling past and current interference, to achieve the optimal performance. We establish the once elusive optimal DoF to be of the form 1 αK + (1 - α)K/(K/ Σ k=1 K 1/k). This further shows that the two k=1 types of DoF gains, from current and delayed CSIT, can be combined additively.},

It is well known that superposition coding, namely separately encoding the independent messages, is optimal for symmetric multilevel diversity coding (SMDC) (Yeung-Zhang 1999). In the current paper, we consider weakly secure SMDC where security constraints are injected on each individual message, and provide a complete characterization of the conditions under which superposition coding is sum-rate optimal. Two joint coding strategies, which lead to rate savings compared to superposition coding, are proposed, where some coding components for one message can be used as the encryption key for another. By applying different variants of Han&#39;s inequality, we show that the lack of opportunity to apply these two coding strategies directly implies the optimality of superposition coding. It is further shown that under a set of particular security constraints, one of the proposed joint coding strategies can be used to construct a code that achieves the optimal rate region.},

  abstract     = {Complementary set sequences (CSSs) are useful for dealing with the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) problem in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In practical OFDM transmission, however, certain sub-carriers maybe reserved and/or prohibited to transmit signals, leading to the so-called spectral null constraint (SNC) design problem. For example, the DC sub-carrier is reserved to avoid the offsets in D/A and A/D converter in the LTE systems. While most of the current research focus on the design of low PAPR CSSs to improve the code-rate, few works address the aforementioned SNC in their designs. This motivates us to investigate CSSs with SNC as well as low PAPR property. In this article, we present systematic constructions of CSSs under SNCs and low PAPR. First, we show that mutually orthogonal complementary sets (MOCSs) can be used as seed sequences to generate new CSSs with SNC and low PAPR, and then provide an iterative technique for the construction of MOCSs which can be further used to generate complementary sets (CSs) with low PAPRs and spectral nulls at varying positions in the designed sequences. Next, inspired by a recent idea of Chen, we propose a novel construction of these seed MOCSs with non-power-of-two lengths from generalized Boolean functions.},

In all cases, the number of over-the-air bits that each cooperation bit buys is shown to be equal to either 0, 1, 1/2 or 1/3. The most interesting aspect of the result is the 1/3 slope, which appears only under finite precision CSIT and strong interference, and as such has not been encountered in previous studies that invariably assumed perfect CSIT. Indeed, the achievability and converse for the parameter regimes with 1/3 slope are the most challenging aspects of this work. In particular, the converse relies on non-trivial applications of Aligned Images bounds.},

In this work we consider all stationary stochastic processes with trajectories in a prescribed set of (bi-)infinite sequences and find uniform lower and upper bounds for certain compression rates in terms of metric mean dimension and mean box dimension. An essential tool is the recent Lindenstrauss-Tsukamoto variational principle expressing metric mean dimension in terms of rate-distortion functions. We obtain also lower bounds on compression rates for a fixed stationary process in terms of the rate-distortion dimension rates and study several examples.},

Examples of such data arise in social networks, molecular and systems biology, and web graphs, as well as in several other application areas. Our goal is to design schemes that can efficiently compress such graphical data without making assumptions about its stochastic properties. Namely, we wish to develop a universal compression algorithm for graphical data sources. To formalize this goal, we employ the framework of local weak convergence, also called the objective method, which provides a technique to think of a marked graph as a kind of stationary stochastic processes, stationary with respect to movement between vertices of the graph. In recent work, we have generalized a notion of entropy for unmarked graphs in this framework, due to Bordenave and Caputo, to the case of marked graphs. We use this notion to evaluate the efficiency of a compression scheme. The lossless compression scheme we propose in this paper is then proved to be universally optimal in a precise technical sense. It is also capable of performing local data queries in the compressed form.},

  abstract     = {We consider the information-theoretic optimality of treating inter-cell interference as noise (multi-cell TIN) in downlink cellular networks. We focus on scenarios modeled by the Gaussian interfering broadcast channel (IBC), comprising K mutually interfering Gaussian broadcast channels (BCs), each formed by a base station communicating independent messages to an arbitrary number of users. We establish a new power allocation duality between the IBC and its dual interfering multiple access channel (IMAC), which entails that the corresponding generalized degrees-of-freedom regions achieved through multi-cell TIN and power control (TINA regions) for both networks are identical. As by-products of this duality, we obtain an explicit characterization of the IBC TINA region from a previously established characterization of the IMAC TINA region; and identify a multi-cell convex-TIN regime in which the IBC TINA region is a polyhedron (hence convex) without the need for time-sharing. We then identify a smaller multi-cell TIN regime in which the IBC TINA region is optimal and multi-cell TIN achieves the entire capacity region of the IBC, up to a constant gap. This is accomplished by deriving a new genie-aided outer bound for the IBC, that reveals a novel BC-type order that holds amongst users in each constituent BC (or cell) under inter-cell interference, which in turn is not implied by previously known BC-type orders (i.e. degraded, less noisy and more capable orders). The multi-cell TIN regime that we identify for the IBC coincides with a corresponding multi-cell TIN regime previously identified for the IMAC, hence establishing a comprehensive uplink-downlink duality of multi-cell TIN in the GDoF (and approximate capacity) sense.},

  abstract     = {The problem of polar coding for an arbitrary sequence of independent binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels {W i } i=1 N is considered. Such a sequence of channels is referred to as a non-stationary sequence of channels and arises in applications where data symbols experience different and independent channel characteristics. The sequence of channels is assumed to be completely known to both the transmitter and the receiver (a coherent scenario). Also, at each code block transmission, each of the channels is used only once. In other words, a codeword of length N is constructed and then the i-th encoded bit is transmitted over W i . The goal is to operate at a rate R close to the average of the symmetric capacities of W i &#39;s, denoted by I̅ N . To this end, we construct a polar coding scheme using Arikan&#39;s channel polarization transform in combination with certain permutations at each polarization level and certain skipped operations. In particular, given a nonstationary sequence of BMS channels {W i } i=1 N and P e , where 0 e e for transmission over {W i } i=1 N such that N ≤ κ/(I̅ N -R) μ )), where μ is a constant and κ is a constant depending on P e and μ. We further show a numerical upper bound on μ that is: μ ≤ 7.34 for non-stationary binary erasure channels and μ ≤ 8.54 for general non-stationary BMS channels. The encoding and decoding complexities of the constructed polar code preserve O(N log N) complexity of Arıkan&#39;s polar codes. In an asymptotic sense, when coded bits are transmitted over a non-stationary sequence of BMS channels {W i } i=1 L , our proposed scheme achieves the average symmetric capacity I̅({W i } i=1 L ) deg = lim N-L 1/N Σ i=1 N I(W i ), assuming that the limit exists.},

  abstract     = {It is well-known that the decoding of algebraic codes with error locators have been extensively conceived in the literature over a half century. The radical locator, which is an ω th root of error locator, has recently been discovered. This paper focuses on the two classes of radical locators. The first is complete radical locators, where all the locators are assigned to radical locators. The second is partial radical locators in that there are only a few locators being radical locators. In the former case based on complete radical locators, a new square matrix whose determinant is a univariate radical-locator polynomial is proposed. In particular, this matrix is modified to allow a large square matrix. It can be transformed by Gaussian elimination to the matrix in a row-echelon form in which zeros appearing in the diagonal entries of the current matrix are able to determine errors implicitly. Furthermore, this work further extends the previous results from the univariate case to multivariate cases. The matrix methods found herein enable one to decode a large class of cyclic codes efficiently. In the latter case, the cyclotomic cosets are a practical approach to select a small subset of positive integers. They are employed to develop partial radical locators. Finally, in contrast with the complete radical locators, the algebraic decoding methods make a natural use of partial radical locators more widely and flexibly to arbitrary cyclic codes.},

  abstract     = {Let P = ([n], ≤ P ) be a poset on [n] = {1, 2, ⋯ , n}, F q n be the linear space of n-tuples over a finite field Fq and w be a weight on F q . In this paper we consider metrics on F q n which are induced by posets over [n] and weights over F q . Such family of metrics extend both the additive metric induced by the weight w (when the poset is an anti-chain) and the poset metrics (when the weight is the Hamming weight). Furthermore, the pomset metrics is also a particular case of our construction, consequently, we provide a simpler approach to these metrics without using the multiset structure originally proposed. For the general case, we provide a complete description of the groups of linear isometries of these metric spaces in terms of a semi-direct product, which turns out to be similar to the case of poset metric spaces. In particular, we (re)obtain the groups of linear isometries of the poset, pomset and additive metric spaces. When considering a chain order, we develop, for codes on these spaces, several of the invariants and properties found in the classical coding theory. Our construction of metrics based on partial orders and any weight over the base field, highlights the dependence of the poset metric over F q n with the Hamming metric on F q and the additive property of its extension on F q n .},

  abstract     = {Minimal multicast networks are fascinating and efficient combinatorial objects, where the removal of a single link makes it impossible for all receivers to obtain all messages. We study the structure of such networks, and prove some constraints on their possible solutions. We then focus on the combination network, which is one of the simplest and most insightful network in network-coding theory. Of particular interest are minimal combination networks. We study the gap in alphabet size between vector-linear and scalar-linear network-coding solutions for such minimal combination networks and some of their sub-networks. For minimal multicast networks with two source messages we find the maximum possible gap. We define and study sub-networks of the combination network, which we call Kneser networks, and prove that they attain the upper bound on the gap with equality. We also prove that the study of this gap may be limited to the study of sub-networks of minimal combination networks, by using graph homomorphisms connected with the q -analog of Kneser graphs. Additionally, we prove a gap for minimal multicast networks with three or more source messages by studying Kneser networks. Finally, an upper bound on the gap for full minimal combination networks shows nearly no gap, or none in some cases. This is obtained using an MDS-like bound for subspaces over a finite field.},

It is known that self-orthogonal codes are often used to construct quantum error-correcting codes, which can protect quantum information in quantum computations and quantum communications. Let C be an [n, k] cyclic code over F q , where F q is the finite field of order q. The hull of C is defined to be the intersection of the code and its dual. In this paper, we will employ the defining sets of cyclic codes to present two general characterizations of the hulls that have dimension k - 1 or k ⊥ - 1, where k ⊥ is the dimension of the dual code C ⊥ . Several sufficient and necessary conditions for primitive and projective BCH codes to have (k - 1)-dimensional (or (k ⊥ -1)dimensional) hulls are also developed by presenting lower and upper bounds on their designed distances. Furthermore, several classes of self-orthogonal codes are proposed via the hulls of BCH codes and their parameters are also investigated. The dimensions and minimum distances of some self-orthogonal codes are determined explicitly. In addition, several optimal codes are obtained.},

The key advantage of these codes is a significantly lower subpacketization that grows only logarithmically with the code length, while providing optimality in storage and error-correcting capacity. However, existing constructions of ϵ-MSR codes require each remaining code block to be available for the repair of any failed code block. In this paper, we construct ϵ-MSR codes that can repair any failed code block by contacting fewer number of available code blocks. When a code block fails, our repair procedure needs to contact a few compulsory code blocks and is free to choose any subset of available code blocks for the remaining choices. Our construction requires a field size linear in code length and ensures load balancing (in terms of information downloaded) among the contacted code blocks for repairing a failed code block.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we formally define and analyze the class of noisy permutation channels. The noisy permutation channel model constitutes a standard discrete memoryless channel (DMC) followed by an independent random permutation that reorders the output codeword of the DMC. While coding theoretic aspects of this model have been studied extensively, particularly in the context of reliable communication in network settings where packets undergo transpositions, and closely related models of DNA based storage systems have also been analyzed recently, we initiate an information theoretic study of this model by defining an appropriate notion of noisy permutation channel capacity. Specifically, on the achievability front, we prove a lower bound on the noisy permutation channel capacity of any DMC in terms of the rank of the stochastic matrix of the DMC. On the converse front, we establish two upper bounds on the noisy permutation channel capacity of any DMC whose stochastic matrix is strictly positive (entry-wise). Together, these bounds yield coding theorems that characterize the noisy permutation channel capacities of every strictly positive and “full rank” DMC, and our achievability proof yields a conceptually simple, computationally efficient, and capacity achieving coding scheme for such DMCs. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the relation between the well-known output degradation preorder over channels and noisy permutation channel capacity. In fact, the proof of one of our converse bounds exploits a degradation result that constructs a symmetric channel for any DMC such that the DMC is a degraded version of the symmetric channel. Finally, we illustrate some examples such as the special cases of binary symmetric channels and (general) erasure channels. Somewhat surprisingly, our results suggest that noisy permutation channel capacities are generally quite agnostic to the parameters that define the DMCs.},

In each scenario, a random coding technique is developed and used to analyze third-order coding performance. Asymptotic results include a third-order characterization of the Slepian-Wolf rate region with an improved converse that relies on a connection to composite hypothesis testing. For dependent sources, the result implies that the independent encoders used by Slepian-Wolf codes can achieve the same third-order-optimal performance as a single joint encoder. The concept of random access source coding is introduced to generalize multiple access (Slepian-Wolf) source coding to the case where encoders decide independently whether or not to participate and the set of participating encoders is unknown a priori to both the encoders and the decoder. The proposed random access source coding strategy employs rateless coding with scheduled feedback. A random coding argument proves the existence of a single deterministic code of this structure that simultaneously achieves the third-order-optimal Slepian-Wolf performance for each possible active encoder set.},

The replicated database scenario, where $N$ databases store each of the $K$ messages was considered by Sun and Jafar, and the optimal download cost was characterized as $\left ({1+ \frac {1}{N}+ \frac {1}{N^{2}}+ \cdots + \frac {1}{N^{K-1}}}\right)$ . In this work, we consider the problem of PIR from uncoded storage constrained databases. Each database has a storage capacity of $\mu KL$ bits, where $L$ is the size of each message in bits, and $\mu \in [{1/N, 1}]$ is the normalized storage. The novel aspect of this work is to characterize the optimum download cost of PIR from uncoded storage constrained databases for any “normalized storage” value in the range $\mu \in [{1/N, 1}]$ . In particular, for any $(N,K)$ , we show that the optimal trade-off between normalized storage, $\mu $ , and the download cost, $D(\mu)$ , is a piece-wise linear function given by the lower convex hull of the $N$ pairs $\left ({\frac {t}{N}, \left ({1+ \frac {1}{t}+ \frac {1}{t^{2}}+ \cdots + \frac {1}{t^{K-1}}}\right)}\right)$ for $t=1,2,\ldots, N$ . To prove this result, we first present a storage constrained PIR scheme for any $(N,K)$ . Next, we obtain a general lower bound on the download cost for PIR, which is valid for any arbitrary storage architecture. The uncoded storage assumption is then applied which allows us to express the lower bound as a linear program (LP). Finally, we solve the LP to obtain tight lower bounds on the download cost for different regimes of storage, which match the proposed storage constrained PIR scheme.},

On the single-user channel of general noise, the rate it achieves is the sum of the channel&#39;s capacity without a helper and the rate of the bit pipe. For Gaussian noise and under an average-power constraint, it is optimal. Analogous results are derived for the additive noise multiple-access channel and the single-user Exponential channel.

  abstract     = {Low-rank matrix recovery has found many applications in science and engineering such as machine learning, system identification, and Euclidean embedding. However, the lowrank matrix recovery problem is an NP hard problem and thus challenging. A commonly used heuristic approach is the nuclear norm minimization. Recently, some authors established the necessary and sufficient null space conditions for nuclear norm minimization to recover every possible low-rank matrix with rank at most r (the strong null space condition). Oymak et al. established a null space condition for successful recovery of a given low-rank matrix (the weak null space condition) using nuclear norm minimization, and derived the phase transition for the nuclear norm minimization. In this paper, we show that the weak null space condition proposed by Oymak et al. is only a sufficient condition for successful matrix recovery using nuclear norm minimization, and is not a necessary condition as claimed. We further give a weak null space condition for low-rank matrix recovery, which is both necessary and sufficient for the success of nuclear norm minimization. At the core of our derivation are an inequality for characterizing the nuclear norms of block matrices, and the conditions for equality to hold in that inequality.},

This fact triggers research efforts into theoretical analysis of DAC. In our previous work, we proposed two analytical tools, Codebook Cardinality Spectrum (CCS) and Hamming Distance Spectrum, to analyze DAC for independent and identically-distributed (i.i.d.) binary sources with uniform distribution. This article extends our work on CCS from uniform i.i.d. binary sources to biased i.i.d. binary sources. We begin with the final CCS and then deduce each level of CCS backwards by recursion. The main finding of this article is that the final CCS of biased i.i.d. binary sources is not uniformly distributed over [0, 1). This article derives the final CCS of biased i.i.d. binary sources and proposes a numerical algorithm for calculating CCS effectively in practice. All theoretical analyses are well verified by experimental results.},

A perfectly smooth LDC further requires that each coded symbol is uniformly accessed when we decode any one of the messages. The ratio L w /L x is called the symbol rate of an LDC. The highest possible symbol rate for a class of LDCs is called the capacity of that class. It is shown that given K, N, the maximum value of capacity of perfectly smooth LDCs, maximized over all code lengths M, is C* = N(1 + 1/N 1/N 2 + · · · 1/N K-1 ) -1 . Furthermore, given K, N, the minimum code length M for which the capacity of a perfectly smooth LDC is C* is shown to be M = N K . Both of these results generalize to a broader class of LDCs, called universal LDCs. The results are then translated into the context of PIR max , i.e., Private Information Retrieval subject to maximum (rather than average) download cost metric. It is shown that the minimum upload cost of capacity achieving PIRmax schemes is (K - 1) log N.

  abstract     = {Many distributed computing systems have been developed recently for implementing graph based algorithms such as PageRank over large-scale graph-structured datasets such as social networks. Performance of these systems significantly suffers from communication bottleneck as a large number of messages are exchanged among servers at each step of the computation. Motivated by graph based MapReduce, we propose a coded computing framework that leverages computation redundancy to alleviate the communication bottleneck in distributed graph processing. As a key contribution of this work, we develop a novel coding scheme that systematically injects structured redundancy in the computation phase to enable coded multicasting opportunities during message exchange between servers, reducing the communication load substantially in large-scale graph processing. For theoretical analysis, we consider random graph models, and focus on schemes in which subgraph allocation and Reduce allocation are only dependent on vertex ID while the Shuffle design varies with graph connectivity. Specifically, we prove that our proposed scheme enables an (asymptotically) inverse-linear trade-off between computation load and average communication load for two popular random graph models - Erdös-Rényi model, and power law model. Particularly, for a given computation load r, (i.e. when each graph vertex is carefully stored at r servers), the proposed scheme slashes the average communication load by (nearly) a multiplicative factor of r. Furthermore, for the Erdös-Rényi model, we prove that our proposed scheme is optimal asymptotically as the graph size increases by providing an information-theoretic converse. To illustrate the benefits of our scheme in practice, we implement PageRank over Amazon EC2, using artificial as well as real-world datasets, demonstrating gains of up to 50.8\% in comparison to the conventional PageRank implementation. Additionally, we specialize our coded scheme and extend our theoretical results to two other random graph models - random bi-partite model, and stochastic block model. Our specialized schemes asymptotically enable inverse-linear trade-offs between computation and communication loads in distributed graph processing for these popular random graph models as well. We complement the achievability results with converse bounds for both of these models.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel scheme, termed coded compressed sensing, for unsourced multiple-access communication. The proposed divide-and-conquer approach leverages recent advances in compressed sensing and forward error correction to produce a novel uncoordinated access paradigm, along with a computationally efficient decoding algorithm. Within this framework, every active device partitions its data into several sub-blocks and, subsequently, adds redundancy using a systematic linear block code. Compressed sensing techniques are then employed to recover sub-blocks up to a permutation of their order, and the original messages are obtained by stitching fragments together using a tree-based algorithm. The error probability and computational complexity of this access paradigm are characterized. An optimization framework, which exploits the tradeoff between performance and computational complexity, is developed to assign parity-check bits to each sub-block. In addition, two emblematic parity bit allocation strategies are examined and their performances are analyzed in the limit as the number of active users and their corresponding payloads tend to infinity. The number of channel uses needed and the computational complexity associated with these allocation strategies are established for various scaling regimes. Numerical results demonstrate that coded compressed sensing outperforms other existing practical access strategies over a range of operational scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The capacity of a complex and discrete-time memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel under three constraints, namely, input average power, input amplitude and output delivered power is studied. The output delivered power constraint is modelled as the average of linear combination of even moments of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under transmit average power and receiver delivered power constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an average power constraint. However, depending on the two constraints, the capacity can be either achieved by a Gaussian distribution or arbitrarily approached by using time-sharing between a Gaussian distribution and On-Off Keying. As an application, a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) problem is studied, where an experimentally-validated nonlinear model of the harvester is used. It is shown that the delivered power depends on higher order moments of the channel input. Two inner bounds, one based on complex Gaussian inputs and the other based on further restricting the delivered power are obtained for the Rate-Power (RP) region. For Gaussian inputs, the optimal inputs are zero mean and a tradeoff between transmitted information and delivered power is recognized by considering asymmetric power allocations between inphase and quadrature subchannels. Through numerical algorithms, it is observed that input distributions (obtained by restricting the delivered power) attain larger RP region compared to Gaussian input counterparts. The benefits of the newly developed and optimized input distributions are also confirmed and validated through realistic circuit simulations. The results reveal the crucial role played by the energy harvester (EH) nonlinearity on SWIPT and provide new engineering guidelines on how to exploit this nonlinearity in the design of SWIPT modulation, signal and architecture.},

For such a setup, we introduce testing procedures relying on nonparametric kernel-type sampling reconstruction algorithms properly adjusted for noisy data. First, we propose the testing procedures utilizing the L 2 -distance between the kernel estimate and signals from the target parametric class. Then, we make use of the maximum likelihood ratio test extended to the posed nonparametric signal specification problem. Central limit theorems of the test statistics are derived yielding consistent testing methods. Hence, we obtain testing procedures that keep asymptotically the desired level of the probability of false alarm and showing a power tending to one as the number of samples increases.

A finite dimensional characterization of this statistic under the alternative hypothesis has hitherto been an open problem. We answer this problem by deriving cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of this l.g.e. via the powerful orthogonal polynomial approach, exploiting the deformed Jacobi unitary ensemble (JUE). Two special cases and an asymptotic version of the c.d.f. are also derived. With this new c.d.f., we comprehensively analyze the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of the detector. Importantly, when the noise-only covariance matrix is nearly rank deficient (i.e., m = n), we show that (a) when m and p increase such that m/p is fixed, at each fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), there exists an optimal ROC profile. We also establish a tight approximation of it; and (b) asymptotically, reliable signal detection is always possible if SNR scales with m.},

The methodology captures the shape of the data without assuming additivity or a parametric form for the regression function. Furthermore, the degree of smoothing is chosen automatically and no auxiliary tuning is required for the theoretical analysis. Some simulations and two real data illustrations complement the study of the proposed estimator.},

Since n-qubit state is parameterized by 4 n - 1 real numbers, it is interesting to design a measurement setup that detects multipartite entanglement with as little effort as possible, and at a minimum without fully revealing the whole information of the state, the so-called “tomography”. In this paper, we study the relationship between multipartite entanglement certification and tomography, with the constraint that only single-copy measurements are allowed. We show that by using nonadaptive single-copy measurements, universal entanglement detection, among all states, can not be accomplished without full state tomography. Moreover, we show that almost all multipartite correlations, including the genuine entanglement and the entanglement depth, require full state tomography to detect in this measurement setting. We also observe that universal entanglement detection, among pure states, can be accomplished using much fewer measurements than full state tomography even using only local measurements.},

Reducing the portion of quantum-generated secret keys, that is consumed during the authentication procedure, is of significant importance for improving the performance of QKD systems. In the present work, we develop a lightweight authentication protocol for QKD based on a `ping-pong&#39; scheme of authenticity check for QKD. An important feature of this scheme is that the only one authentication tag is generated and transmitted during each of the QKD post-processing rounds. For the tag generation purpose, we design an unconditionally secure procedure based on the concept of key recycling. The procedure is based on the combination of almost universal 2 polynomial hashing, XOR universal 2 Toeplitz hashing, and one-time pad (OTP) encryption. We demonstrate how to minimize both the length of the recycled key and the size of the authentication key, that is required for OTP encryption. As a result, in real case scenarios, the portion of quantum-generated secret keys that is consumed for the authentication purposes is below 1\%. Finally, we provide a security analysis of the full quantum key growing process in the framework of universally composable security.},

A computationally unbounded adversary Eve controls t of these channels, meaning she can acquire and alter any data that is transmitted over these channels. The sender Alice wishes to communicate a secret message to Bob privately and reliably, i.e. in such a way that Eve gains no information about the message while Bob is able to recover it completely. We focus on PSMT protocols that work in two transmission rounds for n = 2t + 1. We break from previous work by following a conceptually simpler blueprint. This has two consequences: first, we obtain improved efficiency, namely, we reduce the previously best-known communication complexity, i.e. the number of transmitted bits necessary to communicate a 1-bit secret, from O(n 3 log n) to O(n 2 log n). Our solution also reaches optimal transmission rate for a secret of size O(n log n), thus answering the hitherto open question of attaining a threshold below O(n 2 log n) bits. Second, our construction can be adapted to more general scenarios relevant to Network Coding, where the adversary is given more power.},

The merits of this coding scheme are illustrated by applying it to an erasure model for Eve&#39;s side information and by deriving an upper bound on Eve&#39;s erasure probabilities for which the SK capacity is zero. This bound strictly improves on the best known single-letter lower bound on the SK capacity. Moreover, the bound is tight when Alice&#39;s or Bob&#39;s source is binary, which extends a previous result for a doubly symmetric binary source.

The resulting exponential concentration inequality becomes meaningful (less than 1) when the divergence ε is larger than (k - 1)/n, whereas the standard method of types bound requires ε &gt; 1/n · log ( k-1 n+k-1 ) ≥ (k - 1)/n · log (1 + n/(k-1)), thus saving a factor of order log (n/k) in the standard regime of parameters where n ≫ k. As a consequence, we also obtain finite-sample bounds on all the moments of the empirical divergence (equivalently, the discrete likelihood-ratio statistic), which are within constant factors (depending on the moment) of their asymptotic values. Our proof proceeds via a simple reduction to the case k = 2 of a binary alphabet (i.e. a binomial distribution), and has the property that improvements in the case of k = 2 directly translate to improvements for general k. In particular, we conjecture a bound on the binomial moment generating function that would almost close the quadratic gap between our finite-sample bound and the asymptotic moment generating function bound from Wilks&#39; theorem (which does not hold for finite samples).},

  abstract     = {The problem of private information retrieval with graph-based replicated storage was recently introduced by Raviv, Tamo and Yaakobi. Its capacity remains open in almost all cases. In this work the asymptotic (large number of messages) capacity of this problem is studied along with its generalizations to include arbitrary T -privacy and X-security constraints, where the privacy of the user must be protected against any set of up to T colluding servers and the security of the stored data must be protected against any set of up to X colluding servers. A general achievable scheme for arbitrary storage patterns is presented that achieves the rate (ρ min -X -T )/N, where N is the total number of servers, and each message is replicated at least ρ min times. Notably, the scheme makes use of a special structure inspired by dual Generalized Reed Solomon (GRS) codes. A general converse is also presented. The two bounds are shown to match for many settings, including symmetric storage patterns. Finally, the asymptotic capacity is fully characterized for the case without security constraints (X = 0) for arbitrary storage patterns provided that each message is replicated no more than T + 2 times. As an example of this result, consider PIR with arbitrary graph based storage (T = 1, X = 0) where every message is replicated at exactly 3 servers. For this 3-replicated storage setting, the asymptotic capacity is equal to 2/ν 2 (G) where ν 2 (G) is the maximum size of a 2-matching in a storage graph G[V, E]. In this undirected graph, the vertices V correspond to the set of servers, and there is an edge uv ∈ E between vertices u, v only if a subset of messages is replicated at both servers u and v.},

  abstract     = {Algebraic network information theory is an emerging facet of network information theory, studying the achievable rates of random code ensembles that have algebraic structure, such as random linear codes. A distinguishing feature is that linear combinations of codewords can sometimes be decoded more efficiently than codewords themselves. The present work further develops this framework by studying the simultaneous decoding of multiple messages. Specifically, consider a receiver in a multi-user network that wishes to decode several messages. Simultaneous joint typicality decoding is one of the most powerful techniques for determining the fundamental limits at which reliable decoding is possible. This technique has historically been used in conjunction with random i.i.d. codebooks to establish achievable rate regions for networks. Recently, it has been shown that, in certain scenarios, nested linear codebooks in conjunction with “single-user” or sequential decoding can yield better achievable rates. For instance, the compute-forward problem examines the scenario of recovering L ≤ K linear combinations of transmitted codewords over a K-user multiple-access channel (MAC), and it is well established that linear codebooks can yield higher rates. This paper develops bounds for simultaneous joint typicality decoding used in conjunction with nested linear codebooks, and applies them to obtain a larger achievable region for compute-forward over a K-user discrete memoryless MAC. The key technical challenge is that competing codeword tuples that are linearly dependent on the true codeword tuple introduce statistical dependencies, which requires careful partitioning of the associated error events.},

  abstract     = {Each memoryless binary-input channel (BIC) can be uniquely described by its Blackwell measure, which is a probability distribution on the unit interval [0, 1] with mean 1/2. Conversely, any such probability distribution defines a BIC. The evolution of the Blackwell measure under Arıkan&#39;s polar transform is derived for general BICs, and is analogous to density evolution as cited in the literature. The present analysis emphasizes functional equations. Consequently, the evolution of a variety of channel functionals is characterized, including the symmetric capacity, Bhattacharyya parameter, moments of information density, Hellinger affinity, Gallager&#39;s reliability function, the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi maximal correlation, and the Bayesian information gain. The evolution of measure is specialized for symmetric BICs according to their decomposition into binary symmetric (sub)-channels (BSCs), which simplifies iterative computations and the construction of polar codes. It is verified that, as a consequence of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem, all channel functionals I f that can be expressed as an expectation of a convex function f with respect to the Blackwell measure of a channel polarize in each iteration due to the polar transformation on the class of symmetric BICs. Moreover, for f either convex or non-convex, a necessary and sufficient condition is established to determine whether the random process associated with each I f is a martingale, submartingale, or supermartingale. Represented via functional inequalities in terms of f, this condition is numerically verifiable for all I f , and can generate analytical proofs. To exhibit one such proof, it is shown that the random process associated with the squared maximal correlation parameter is a supermartingale, and converges almost surely on the unit interval [0, 1].},

  abstract     = {The problem of computing a linear combination of sources over a multiple access channel is studied. Inner and outer bounds on the optimal tradeoff between the communication rates are established when encoding is restricted to random ensembles of homologous codes, namely, structured nested coset codes from the same generator matrix and individual shaping functions, but when decoding is optimized with respect to the realization of the encoders. For the special case in which the desired linear combination is “matched” to the structure of the multiple access channel in a natural sense, these inner and outer bounds coincide. This result indicates that most, if not all, coding schemes for computation in the literature that rely on random construction of nested coset codes cannot be improved by using more powerful decoders such as the maximum likelihood decoder. The proof techniques are adapted to characterize the rate region for broadcast channels achieved by Marton&#39;s (random) coding scheme under maximum likelihood decoding. By generalizing some of the techniques, a single-letter outer bound for the capacity region of the computation problem is presented and compared with the inner bound achieved by homologous codes.},

  abstract     = {The problem of identification is considered, in which it is of interest for the receiver to decide only whether a certain message has been sent or not, and the identification-feedback (IDF) capacity of channels with feedback is studied. The IDF capacity is shown to be discontinuous and super-additive for both deterministic and randomized encoding. For the deterministic IDF capacity the phenomenon of super-activation occurs, which is the strongest form of super-additivity. This is the first time that super-activation is observed for discrete memoryless channels. On the other hand, for the randomized IDF capacity, super-activation is not possible. Finally, the developed theory is studied from an algorithmic point of view by using the framework of Turing computability. The problem of computing the IDF capacity on a Turing machine is connected to problems in pure mathematics and it is shown that if the IDF capacity would be Turing computable, it would provide solutions to other problems in mathematics including Goldbach&#39;s conjecture and the Riemann Hypothesis. However, it is shown that the deterministic and randomized IDF capacities are not Banach-Mazur computable. This is the weakest form of computability implying that the IDF capacity is not computable even for universal Turing machines. On the other hand, the identification capacity without feedback is Turing computable revealing the impact of the feedback: It transforms the identification capacity from being computable to non-computable.},

  abstract     = {Caching is a technique that alleviates networks during peak hours by transmitting partial information before a request for any is made. In a lossy setting of Gaussian databases, we study a single-user model in which good caching strategies minimize the data still needed on average once the user requests a file. The encoder decides on a caching strategy by weighing the benefit from two key parameters: the prior preference for a file and the correlation among the files. Considering uniform prior preference but correlated files, caching becomes an application of Wyner&#39;s common information and Watanabe&#39;s total correlation. We show this case triggers a split: caching Gaussian sources is a non-convex optimization problem unless one spends enough rate to cache all the common information between files. Combining both correlation and user preference we explicitly characterize the full trade-off when the encoder uses Gaussian codebooks in a database of two files: we show that as the size of the cache increases, the encoder should change strategy and increasingly prioritize user preference over correlation. In this specific case we also address the loss in performance incurred if the encoder has no knowledge of the user&#39;s preference and show that this loss is bounded.},

  abstract     = {In the index coding problem a sender holds a message x ∈ {0, 1} n and wishes to broadcast information to n receivers in a way that enables the ith receiver to retrieve the ith bit x i . Every receiver has prior side information comprising a subset of the bits of x, and the goal is to minimize the length of the information sent via the broadcast channel. Porter and Wootters have recently introduced the model of embedded index coding, where the receivers also play the role of the sender and the goal is to minimize the total length of their broadcast information. An embedded index code is said to be task-based if every receiver retrieves its bit based only on the information provided by one of the receivers. This paper studies the effect of the task-based restriction on linear embedded index coding. It is shown that for certain side information maps there exists a linear embedded index code of length quadratically smaller than that of any task-based embedded index code. The result attains, up to a multiplicative constant, the largest possible gap between the two quantities. The proof is by an explicit construction and the analysis involves spectral techniques.},

A maximally recoverable (MR) LRC offers the best possible blend of such local and global fault tolerance, guaranteeing recovery from all erasure patterns which are information-theoretically correctable given the presence of local recovery groups. MR LRCs have received much attention recently, with many explicit constructions covering different regimes of parameters. Unfortunately, all known constructions require a large field size. In this work, we develop an approach based on function fields to construct MR LRCs. Our method recovers, and in most parameter regimes improves, the field size of previous approaches. The improvements are modest, but more importantly are obtained in a unified manner via a promising new idea.},

We show that exponentiating these Z4-valued quantum states obtained using only Clifford unitaries. These states are also the common eigenvectors of commuting Hermitian matrices forming maximal commutative subgroups (MCS) of the Pauli group. We use this quantum description to simplify the derivation of the classical weight distribution of Kerdock codes. Next, we organize the stabilizer states to form N + 1 mutually unbiased bases and prove that automorphisms of the Kerdock code permute their corresponding MCS, thereby forming a subgroup of the Clifford group. When represented as symplectic matrices, this subgroup is isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL(2, N). We show that this automorphism group acts transitively on the Pauli matrices, which implies that the ensemble is Pauli mixing and hence forms a unitary 2-design. The Kerdock design described here was originally discovered by Cleve et al. (2016), but the connection to classical codes is new which simplifies its description and translation to circuits significantly. Sampling from the design is straightforward, the translation to circuits uses only Clifford gates, and the process does not require ancillary qubits. Finally, we also develop algorithms for optimizing the synthesis of unitary 2-designs on encoded qubits, i.e., to construct logical unitary 2-designs. Software implementations are available at https://github.com/nrenga/symplectic-arxiv18a, which we use to provide empirical gate complexities for up to 16 qubits.},

Codes used in current portable DNA-based storage systems with nanopore sequencers are largely based on heuristics, and have no provable robustness or performance guarantees even for an error model with i.i.d. deletions and constant deletion probability. Our work is the first step towards the design of efficient codes with provable guarantees for such systems. We consider a constant rate of i.i.d. deletions, and perform an analysis of marker-based code-constructions. This gives rise to codes with redundancy O(n/log n) (resp. O(n/ log log n)) that can be efficiently reconstructed from exp(O(log 2/3 n)) (resp. exp(O(log log n) 2/3 )) traces, where n is the message length. Then, we give a construction of a code with O(log n) bits of redundancy that can be efficiently reconstructed from poly(n) traces if the deletion probability is small enough. Finally, we show how to combine both approaches, giving rise to an efficient code with O(n/log n) bits of redundancy which can be reconstructed from poly(log n) traces for a small constant deletion probability.},

  abstract     = {The explosion in the volumes of data being stored online has resulted in distributed storage `s transitioning to erasure coding based schemes. Local Reconstruction Codes (LRCs) have emerged as the codes of choice for these applications. These codes can correct a small number of erasures (which is the typical case) by accessing only a small number of remaining coordinates. An (n, r, h, a, q)-LRC is a linear code over F q of length n, whose codeword symbols are partitioned into g = n/r local groups each of size r. Each local group has a local parity checks that allow recovery of up to a erasures within the group by reading the unerased symbols in the group. There are a further h “heavy” parity checks to provide fault tolerance from more global erasure patterns. Such an LRC is Maximally Recoverable (MR), if it corrects all erasure patterns which are information-theoretically correctable under the stipulated structure of local and global parity checks, namely patterns with up to a erasures in each local group and an additional h (or fewer) erasures anywhere in the codeword. The existing constructions require fields of size n Ω(h) while no superlinear lower bounds were known for any setting of parameters. Is it possible to get linear field size similar to the related MDS codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon codes)? In this work, we answer this question by showing superlinear lower bounds on the field size of MR-LRCs. When a,h are constant and the number of local groups g ≥ h, while r may grow with n, our lower bound simplifies to q ≥ Ω a,h (n · r min{a, h-2} ) . MR-LRCs deployed in practice have a small number of global parities, typically h = 2, 3 . We complement our lower bounds by giving constructions with small field size for h ≤ 3. When h = 2, we give a linear field size construction, whereas previous constructions required quadratic field size in some parameter ranges. Note that our lower bound is superlinear only if h ≥ 3. When h = 3, we give a construction with O(n 3 ) field size, whereas previous constructions needed n Θ(a) field size. This makes the choices r = 3, a = 1, h = 3 the next simplest non-trivial setting to investigate regarding the existence of MR-LRCs over fields of near-linear size. We answer this question in the positive via a novel approach based on elliptic curves and arithmetic progression free sets.},

  abstract     = {Counting short cycles in bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem of interest in many fields including the analysis and design of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. There are two computational approaches to count short cycles (with length smaller than 2g, where g is the girth of the graph) in bipartite graphs. The first approach is applicable to a general (irregular) bipartite graph, and uses the spectrum {η i } of the directed edge matrix of the graph to compute the multiplicity N k of k-cycles with k k = Σ i η i k /(2k). This approach has a computational complexity O(|E| 3 ), where |E| is number of edges in the graph. The second approach is only applicable to bi-regular bipartite graphs, and uses the spectrum {λ i } of the adjacency matrix (graph spectrum) and the degree sequences of the graph to compute N k . The complexity of this approach is O(|V| 3 ), where |V| is number of nodes in the graph. This complexity is less than that of the first approach, but the equations involved in the computations of the second approach are complex and tedious, particularly for k ≥ g+6. In fact, the computational complexity of the equations increases exponentially with k. In this paper, we establish an analytical relationship between the two spectra {η i } and {λ i } for bi-regular bipartite graphs. Through this relationship, the former spectrum can be derived from the latter through simple equations with computational complexity constant in k. This allows the computation of N k using N k = Σ i η i k /(2k) but with a complexity of O(|V| 3 ) rather than O(|E| 3 ).},

In this paper, we prove that for given integers α, β, and -y, and degree sequences π and π&#39;, the problem of determining whether there exists a simple bipartite graph with degree sequences (π, π&#39;) that has at most α (β and -y) cycles of length four (six and eight, respectively) is NP-complete. This is proved by a two-step polynomial-time reduction from the 3-Partition Problem. On the other hand, using connections to linear hypergraphs, we prove that given the degree sequence π, a polynomial time algorithm can be devised to determine whether there exists a bipartite graph whose degree sequence on one side of the bipartition is π and has a girth of at least six. In addition to these complexity results, we devise a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that can construct a bipartite graph with given (irregular) degree sequences and a girth that increases logarithmically with the size of the graph. Compared to the well-known progressive-edge-growth (PEG) algorithm, the proposed method, in some cases, results in Tanner graphs with larger girth, particularly for scenarios where the degree sequences of the graph are strictly enforced.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of coding to ensure covert communication, which involves ensuring reliable communication between two legitimate parties while simultaneously guaranteeing a low probability of detection by an eavesdropper. Specifically, we develop an optimal low-complexity coding scheme that achieves the information-theoretic limits of covert communications over binary-input discrete memoryless channels (BI-DMCs). To justify our design, we first consider a regime in which information theory proves the possibility of covert communication without shared secret key and show the impossibility of achieving information-theoretic limits using linear codes without secret key. We then circumvent this impossibility by introducing non-linearity into the coding scheme through the use of pulse position modulation (PPM) and multilevel coding (MLC). This MLC-PPM scheme exhibits several appealing properties; in particular, for an appropriate decoder, the channel at a given level is independent of the total number of levels and the codeword length. We exploit these properties to show how one can use families of channel capacity- and channel resolvability-achieving codes to concretely instantiate a covert communication scheme.},

  abstract     = {Information-theoretic security is considered in the paradigm of network coding in the presence of wiretappers, who can access one arbitrary edge subset up to a certain size, also referred to as the security level. Secure network coding is applied to prevent the leakage of the source information to the wiretappers. In this paper, we consider the problem of secure network coding when the information rate and the security level can change over time. To efficiently solve this problem, we put forward local-encoding-preserving secure network coding, where a family of secure linear network codes (SLNCs) is called local-encoding-preserving if all the SLNCs in this family share a common local encoding kernel at each intermediate node in the network. We first consider the design of a family of local-encoding-preserving SLNCs for a fixed security level and a flexible rate. A simple approach is presented for efficiently constructing upon an SLNC that exists a local-encoding-preserving SLNC with the same security level and the rate reduced by one. By applying this approach repeatedly, we can obtain a family of local-encoding-preserving SLNCs with a fixed security level and multiple rates. We further consider the design of a family of local-encoding-preserving SLNCs for a fixed rate and a flexible security level. We present a novel and efficient approach for constructing upon an SLNC that exists a local-encoding-preserving SLNC with the same rate and the security level increased by one. Next, we consider the design of a family of local-encoding-preserving SLNCs for a fixed dimension (equal to the sum of rate and security level) and a flexible pair of rate and security level. We propose another novel approach for designing an SLNC such that the same SLNC can be applied for all the rate and security-level pairs with the fixed dimension. Also, two polynomial-time algorithms are developed for efficient implementations of the later two proposed approaches, respectively. Furthermore, we prove that all our three approaches do not incur any penalty on the required field size for the existence of SLNCs in terms of the best known lower bound by Guang and Yeung. Finally, we consider the ultimate problem of designing a family of local-encoding-preserving SLNCs that can be applied to all possible pairs of rate and security level. By combining the constructions of the three families of local-encoding-preserving SLNCs in the paper in suitable ways, we can obtain a family of local-encoding-preserving SLNCs that can be applied for all possible pairs of rate and security level. Three possible such constructions are presented.},

A two-stage non-convex implementation is developed based on sparse tensor decomposition and thresholded gradient descent, which ensures exact recovery in the noiseless case and stable recovery in the noisy case with high probability. The non-asymptotic analysis sheds light on an interplay between optimization error and statistical error. The proposed procedure is shown to be rate-optimal under certain conditions. As a technical by-product, novel high-order concentration inequalities are derived for studying high-moment sub-Gaussian tensors. An interesting tensor formulation illustrates the potential application to high-order interaction pursuit in high-dimensional linear regression.},

  abstract     = {Extracting information from nonlinear measurements is a fundamental challenge in data analysis. In this work, we consider separable inverse problems, where the data are modeled as a linear combination of functions that depend nonlinearly on certain parameters of interest. These parameters may represent neuronal activity in a human brain, frequencies of electromagnetic waves, fluorescent probes in a cell, or magnetic relaxation times of biological tissues. Separable nonlinear inverse problems can be reformulated as underdetermined sparse-recovery problems, and solved using convex programming. This approach has had empirical success in a variety of domains, from geophysics to medical imaging, but lacks a theoretical justification. In particular, compressed-sensing theory does not apply, because the measurement operators are deterministic and violate incoherence conditions such as the restricted-isometry property. Our main contribution is a theory for sparse recovery adapted to deterministic settings. We show that convex programming succeeds in recovering the parameters of interest, as long as their values are sufficiently distinct with respect to the correlation structure of the measurement operator. The theoretical results are illustrated through numerical experiments for two applications: heat-source localization and estimation of brain activity from electroencephalography data.},

To be precise, we need to recover X* from y k := |A k &#39;x* k |, k = 1, 2, . . . , q when the measurement matrices Ak are mutually independent. Here y k is an m length vector, A k is an n × m matrix, and denotes matrix transpose. The question is when can we solve LRPR with m 4 log(1/∈), the matrices Ak contain i.i.d. standard Gaussian entries, and the right singular vectors of X* satisfy the incoherence assumption from matrix completion literature. Here C is a numerical constant that only depends on the condition number of X* and on its incoherence parameter. Its time complexity is only Cmqnr log 2 (1/∈). Since even the linear (with phase) version of the above problem is not fully solved, the above result is also the first complete solution and guarantee for the linear case. Finally, we also develop a simple extension of our results for the dynamic LRPR setting.},

  abstract     = {Modern applications significantly enhance user experience by adapting to each user&#39;s individual condition and/or preferences. While this adaptation can greatly improve a user&#39;s experience or be essential for the application to work, the exposure of user data to the application presents a significant privacy threat to the users-even when the traces are anonymized-since the statistical matching of an anonymized trace to prior user behavior can identify a user and their habits. Because of the current and growing algorithmic and computational capabilities of adversaries, provable privacy guarantees as a function of the degree of anonymization and obfuscation of the traces are necessary. Our previous work has established the requirements on anonymization and obfuscation in the case that data traces are independent between users. However, the data traces of different users will be dependent in many applications, and an adversary can potentially exploit such. In this paper, we consider the negative impact of dependency between user traces on their privacy. First, we demonstrate that the adversary can readily identify the association graph of the obfuscated and anonymized version of the data, revealing which user data traces are dependent. Next, we demonstrate that the adversary can use this association graph to break user privacy with significantly shorter traces than in the case of independent users, and that obfuscating data traces independently across users is often insufficient to remedy such leakage. In other words, we have shown that inter-user dependency is disastrous to privacy, and any non-negligible dependency between users significantly reduces the effectiveness of anonymization and obfuscation schemes. Finally, we discuss how users can improve privacy by employing joint obfuscation that removes or reduces the data dependency.},

In particular, the local decoding or update of a single message symbol can be performed by probing or modifying on average a constant number of codeword bits.

The construction produces smaller key and signature sizes than the previous group signature schemes from lattices, as long as the cardinality of the underlying group does not exceed 2 24 , which is roughly comparable to the current population of the Netherlands. We develop the basic scheme further to achieve the strongest anonymity notion, i.e., CCA-anonymity, with a small overhead in terms of efficiency. The feasibility of two proposed schemes is supported by implementation results. Our two schemes are the first in their respective classes of provably secure groups signature schemes.

We characterize the APN-ness of G via the derivatives of F, and deduce an algorithm for searching for APN functions whose values differ from those of F only on a given set U ⊆ F 2n . We introduce a value Π F associated with any F, which is invariant under CCZ-equivalence. We express a lower bound on the distance between a given APN function F and the closest APN function in terms of Π F . We show how Π F can be computed efficiently for F quadratic. We compute Π F for all known APN functions over F 2n . up to n ≤ 8. his is the first new CCZ-invariant for APN functions to be introduced within the last ten years. We derive a mathematical formula for this lower bound for the Gold function F (x) = x 3 , and observe that it tends to infinity with n. Finally, we describe how to efficiently find all sets U such that, taking G(x) = F (x) + v for x ∈ U and G(x) = F (x) for x ∉ U,G(x) is APN.},

  abstract     = {The cryptogenography problem, introduced by Brody, Jakobsen, Scheder, and Winkler (ITCS 2014), is to collaboratively leak a piece of information known to only one member of a group 1) without revealing who was the origin of this information and 2) without any private communication, neither during the process nor before. Despite several deep structural results, even the smallest case of leaking one bit of information present at one of two players is not well understood. Brody et al. gave a 2-round protocol enabling the two players to succeed with probability 1/3 and showed the hardness result that no protocol can give a success probability of more than 3/8. In this work, we show that neither bound is tight. Our new hardness result, obtained by a different application of the concavity method used also in the previous work, states that a success probability of better than 0.3672 is not possible. Using both theoretical and numerical approaches, we improve the lower bound to 0.3384, that is, give a protocol leading to this success probability. Unfortunately, already our smallest protocol beating the previous 1/3 success probability takes up 16 rounds of communication. The protocol leading to the bound of 0.3384 even in a compact representation consists of 18248 game states. These numbers suggest that the task of finding good protocols for the cryptogenography problem as well as understanding their structure is harder than what the simple problem formulation suggests.},

  abstract     = {A source provides status updates to monitors through a network with state defined by a continuous-time finite Markov chain. An age of information (AoI) metric is used to characterize timeliness by the vector of ages tracked by the monitors. Based on a stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) approach, first order linear differential equations are derived for the temporal evolution of both the moments and the moment generating function (MGF) of the age vector components. It is shown that the existence of a non-negative fixed point for the first moment is sufficient to guarantee convergence of all higher order moments as well as a region of convergence for the stationary MGF vector of the age. The stationary MGF vector is then found for the age on a line network of preemptive memoryless servers. From this MGF, it is found that the age at a node is identical in distribution to the sum of independent exponential service times. This observation is then generalized to linear status sampling networks in which each node receives samples of the update process at each preceding node according to a renewal point process. For each node in the line, the age is shown to be identical in distribution to a sum of independent renewal process age random variables.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the network simplification problem for Gaussian full-duplex relay networks with arbitrary topology. Particularly, given an N-relay Gaussian full-duplex network, the network simplification problem seeks to find fundamental guarantees on the capacity of the best subnetwork, among a particular class of subnetworks, as a fraction of the full-network capacity. The focus of this work is the case when the selected subnetwork class is a path from the source to the destination. The main result of the paper shows that for an N-relay Gaussian networks with arbitrary topology, the best route can in the worst case guarantee an approximate fraction 1/(⌊N/2⌋ + 1) of the capacity of the full network, independently of the channel coefficients and/or operating SNR. Furthermore, this guarantee is shown to be fundamental, i.e., it is the highest worst-case guarantee that can be provided for routing in relay networks. A key step in the proof of the main result lies in the derivation of a simplification result for antenna selection in MIMO channels that may also be of independent interest. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that characterizes the performance of routing in comparison to physical layer cooperation techniques that approximately achieve the network capacity for general wireless network topologies. The results in this paper show that routing can, in the worst case, result in an unbounded gap from the network capacity - or reversely, physical layer cooperation can offer unbounded gains over routing.},

A single information packet is traveling towards a given direction using both wireless transmissions and sojourns on node buffers, according to a member of a class of utility-based routing rules. For this model, we compute the long-term averages of the speed with which the packet travels towards its destination and the rate with which the wireless transmission cost accumulates. Because of the complexity of the problem, we employ two intuitive, simplifying approximations; simulations show that the approximation error is typically small. Our results provide intuition on the fundamental trade-off that exists in mobile wireless DTNs between the packet speed and the packet delivery cost. The framework developed here is both general and versatile, and can be used as a starting point for further investigation.},

The focus is on the scenario with more transmit than receive antennas. In this scenario, different input vectors can yield identical distributions at the output, when they result in the same image vector under multiplication by the channel matrix. We first determine the most energy-efficient input vectors that attain each of these image vectors. Based on this, we derive an equivalent capacity expression in terms of the image vector, and establish new lower and upper bounds on the capacity of this channel. The bounds match when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to infinity, establishing the high-SNR asymptotic capacity. We also characterize the low-SNR slope of the capacity of this channel.},

The channel estimates are not only imperfectly acquired but they are also imperfectly shared between the TXs. Our first contribution consists of computing a genie-aided upper bound for the DoF of that setting. Our main contribution is then to develop a new robust transmission scheme that leverages the different qualities of CSI available at the TXs to improve the achieved DoF. We show the surprising result that there is a CSI regime, coined the Weak-CSIT regime, in which the genie-aided upper bound is achieved by the proposed transmission scheme. Interestingly, the optimal DoF in the Weak-CSIT regime only depends on the CSI quality at the best informed TX and not on the CSI quality at all other TXs.},

  abstract     = {We resume the investigation of the problem of independent local compression of correlated quantum sources, the classical case of which is covered by the celebrated Slepian-Wolf theorem. We focus specifically on classical-quantum (cq) sources, for which one edge of the rate region, corresponding to the compression of the classical part, using the quantum part as side information at the decoder, was previously determined by Devetak and Winter [Phys. Rev. A 68, 042301 (2003)]. Whereas the Devetak-Winter protocol attains a rate-sum equal to the von Neumann entropy of the joint source, here we show that the full rate region is much more complex, due to the partially quantum nature of the source. In particular, in the opposite case of compressing the quantum part of the source, using the classical part as side information at the decoder, typically the rate sum is strictly larger than the von Neumann entropy of the total source. We determine the full rate region in the generic case, showing that, apart from the Devetak-Winter point, all other points in the achievable region have a rate sum strictly larger than the joint entropy. We can interpret the difference as the price paid for the quantum encoder being ignorant of the classical side information. In the general case, we give an achievable rate region, via protocols that are built on the decoupling principle, and the protocols of quantum state merging and quantum state redistribution. Our achievable region is matched almost by a single-letter converse, which however still involves asymptotic errors and an unbounded auxiliary system.},

One key feature of the results obtained in this work is that all the bounds are based on error exponents. We obtain our achievability result via the technique of simultaneous pinching. This in turn allows us to show the existence of a simultaneous decoder. Further, to obtain our encoding technique and to prove the security feature of our coding scheme we prove a bivariate classical-quantum channel resolvability lemma and a conditional classical-quantum channel resolvability lemma. As a byproduct of the achievability result obtained in this work, we also obtain an achievable rate for a fully quantum Gel’fand-Pinsker channel in the absence of Eve.

  abstract     = {Proving or disproving an information inequality is a crucial step in establishing the converse results in coding theorems. However, an information inequality involving more than a few random variables is difficult to be proved or disproved manually. In 1997, Yeung developed a framework that uses linear programming for verifying linear information inequalities. Under the framework, this paper considers a few other problems that can be solved by using Lagrange duality and convex approximation. We will demonstrate how linear programming can be used to find an analytic proof of an information inequality or an analytic counterexample to disprove it if the inequality is not true in general. The way to automatically find a shortest proof or a smallest counterexample is explored. When a given information inequality cannot be proved, the sufficient conditions for a counterexample to disprove the information inequality are found by linear programming. Lastly, we propose a scalable algorithmic framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers to accelerate solving a multitude of user-specific problems whose overall computational cost can be amortized with the number of users, and present its publicly-available software implementation for large-scale problems.},

Here, a computational system is assumed to be a directed graph, with “clocked” nodes that send transmissions to each other along the edges of the graph at discrete points in time. We are interested in a definition that captures the dynamic flow of information about a specific message, and which guarantees an unbroken “information path” between appropriately defined inputs and outputs in the directed graph. Prior measures, including those based on Granger Causality and Directed Information, fail to provide clear assumptions and guarantees about when they correctly reflect information flow about a message. We take a systematic approach-iterating through candidate definitions and counterexamples-to arrive at a definition for information flow that is based on conditional mutual information, and which satisfies desirable properties, including the existence of information paths. Finally, we describe how information flow might be detected in a noiseless setting, and provide an algorithm to identify information paths on the time-unrolled graph of a computational system.},

  abstract     = {An [n, k, n - k + 1] linear code is called an MDS code. An [n, k, n - k] linear code is said to be almost maximum distance separable (almost MDS or AMDS for short). A code is said to be near maximum distance separable (near MDS or NMDS for short) if the code and its dual code both are almost maximum distance separable. The first near MDS code was the [11, 6, 5] ternary Golay code discovered in 1949 by Golay. This ternary code holds 4-designs, and its extended code holds a Steiner system S(5, 6, 12) with the largest strength known. In the past 70 years, sporadic near MDS codes holding t-designs were discovered and a lot of infinite families of near MDS codes over finite fields were constructed. However, the question as to whether there is an infinite family of near MDS codes holding an infinite family of t-designs for t ≥ 2 remains open for 70 years. This paper settles this long-standing problem by presenting an infinite family of near MDS codes over GF(3 s ) holding an infinite family of 3-designs and an infinite family of near MDS codes over GF(2 2s ) holding an infinite family of 2-designs. The subfield subcodes of these two families of codes are also studied, and are shown to be dimension-optimal or distance-optimal.},

  abstract     = {Let k, n, m ∈ ℤ + be integers such that k ≤ n ≤ m, let G n,k ∈ F n (q m ) be a Delsarte-Gabidulin code. Recently, Wachter-Zeh proved that codes belonging to this family cannot be efficiently list decoded for any radius τ, providing τ is large enough. This achievement essentially relies on proving a lower bound for the list size of some specific words in F n (q m ). Some years later, Raviv and Wachter-Zeh improved this bound in a special case, i.e. when n|m. As a consequence, they were able to detect infinite families of Delsarte-Gabidulin codes that cannot be efficiently list decoded at all. In this article we determine similar lower bounds for Maximum Rank Distance codes belonging to a wider class of examples, containing Generalized Gabidulin codes, Generalized Twisted Gabidulin codes, and examples recently described by Trombetti and Zhou. By exploiting arguments such as those used by Raviv and Wachter-Zeh, when n|m, we also show infinite families of generalized Gabidulin codes that cannot be list decoded efficiently at any radius greater than or equal to ⌊d-1/2⌋ + 1, where d is its minimum distance. Nonetheless, in all the examples belonging to above mentioned class, we detect infinite families that cannot be list decoded efficiently at any radius greater than or equal to ⌊d-1/2⌋ + 2, where d is its minimum distance. In particular, this leads to show infinite families of Gabidulin codes, with underlying parameters not already covered by the result of Raviv and Wachter-Zeh, having this decodability defect. Finally, relying on the properties of a set of subspace trinomials recently presented by McGuire and Mueller, we are able to prove our main result, that is any rank-metric code of F n (q m ) of order q kn with n dividing m, such that 4n - 3 is a square in ℤ and containing G n,2 , is not efficiently list decodable at some values of the radius τ.},

The encoding of a cyclic code of a prime length is performed on a collection of codewords which are mapped through Galois Fourier transform into a codeword in a low-density parity-check code with a binary parity-check matrix for transmission. Using this matrix, binary iterative soft-decision decoding algorithm is applied to jointly decode a collection of codewords from the cyclic code. The joint-decoding allows for information sharing among the received vectors corresponding to the codewords in the collection during the iterative decoding process. For decoding Reed-Solomon and BCH codes of prime lengths, the proposed decoding scheme not only requires much lower decoding complexity than other soft-decision decoding algorithms for these codes, but also yields superior performance. The proposed decoding scheme can also achieve a joint-decoding gain over the maximum likelihood decoding of individual codewords. The decoding scheme is also applied to quadratic residue codes.},

In fact, we reduce the construction of a maximal size B 1 [4](2 k r) set for k ≥ 3 to the construction of a maximal size B 1 [4](2 k-3 r) set. Finally, we give an explicit formula of a maximal size B 1 [4](4r) set and some lower bounds of a maximal size B 1 [4](2r) set. By computer searching up to q ≤ 106, we conjecture that those lower bounds are tight.},

We present two new constructions of constant dimension subspace codes using subsets of maximum rank-distance (MRD) codes in several blocks. This method is firstly applied to the linkage construction and secondly to arbitrary number of blocks of lifting MRD codes. In these two constructions, subsets of MRD codes with bounded ranks play an essential role. The Delsarte theorem about the rank distribution of MRD codes is an important ingredient to count codewords in our constructed constant dimension subspace codes. We give many new lower bounds for A q (n, d, k). More than 110 new constant dimension subspace codes better than previously best known codes are constructed.},

A minimum condition for the security of the key is the hardness of guessing a value that is similar to the secret, because the fuzzy extractor converts such a guess to the key. We quantify this property in a new notion called fuzzy min-entropy. We ask: is fuzzy min-entropy sufficient to build fuzzy extractors? We provide two answers for different settings. 1) If the construction is provided a description of the probability distribution W that defines the noisy source then fuzzy min-entropy is a sufficient condition for information-theoretic key extraction from W . 2) A more ambitious goal is to design a single extractor that works for all possible sources. This more ambitious goal is impossible: there is a family of sources with high fuzzy min-entropy for which no single fuzzy extractor is secure. This is true in three settings: a) for standard fuzzy extractors, b) for fuzzy extractors that are allowed to sometimes be wrong, c) and for secure sketches, which are the main ingredient of most fuzzy extractor constructions.},

  abstract     = {Shaping codes are used to encode information for use on channels with cost constraints. Applications include data transmission with a power constraint and, more recently, data storage on flash memories with a constraint on memory cell wear. In the latter application, system requirements often impose a rate constraint. In this paper, we study rate-constrained fixed-to-variable length shaping codes for noiseless, memoryless costly channels and general i.i.d. sources. The analysis relies on the theory of word-valued sources. We establish a relationship between the code expansion factor - the ratio of the expected codeword length to the length of the input source word - and the minimum average symbol cost. We then determine the expansion factor that minimizes the average cost per source symbol (total cost), corresponding to a conventional optimal source code with cost. An equivalence is established between codes minimizing average symbol cost and codes minimizing total cost, and a separation theorem is proved, showing that optimal shaping can be achieved by a concatenation of optimal compression and optimal shaping for a uniform i.i.d. source. Shaping codes often incorporate, either explicitly or implicitly, some form of non-equiprobable signaling. We use our results to further explore the connections between shaping codes and codes that map a sequence of i.i.d. source symbols into an output sequence of symbols that are approximately independent and distributed according to a specified target distribution, such as distribution matching (DM) codes. Optimal DM codes are characterized in terms of a new performance measure - generalized expansion factor (GEF) - motivated by the costly channel perspective. The GEF is used to study DM codes that minimize informational divergence and normalized informational divergence.},

  abstract     = {We study the generalized degrees of freedom (gDoF) of the noncoherent diamond (parallel relay) wireless network with asymmetric distributions of link strengths. We use the noncoherent block-fading model introduced by Marzetta and Hochwald, where no channel state information is available at the transmitters or at the receivers and the channels remain constant for a coherence time of T symbol durations. We first derive an upper bound for the capacity of this channel and then derive the optimal structure for the solution of the upper bound optimization problem. Using the optimal structure, we solve the upper bound optimization problem in terms of its gDoF. Using insights from our upper bound signaling solution, we devise an achievability strategy based on a novel scheme that we call train-scale quantize-map-forward (TS-QMF). This scheme uses training in the links from the source to the relays, scaling and quantizing at the relays combined with nontraining-based schemes. We show the optimality of this scheme by comparing it to the upper bound in terms of the gDoF. In noncoherent point-to-point multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels, where the fading realization is unknown to the transmitter and the receiver, an important tradeoff between communication and channel learning was revealed by Zheng and Tse, by demonstrating that not all the available antennas might be used, as it is suboptimal to learn all their channel parameters. Our results in this paper for the diamond network demonstrate that in certain regimes of relative channel strengths, the gDoF-optimal scheme uses a subnetwork, demonstrating a similar tradeoff between channel learning and communication. In some regimes, it is gDoF-optimal to do relay selection, i.e., use a part of the network. In the other regimes, even when it is essential to use the entire network, it is suboptimal to learn the channel states for all the links in the network, i.e., traditional training-based schemes are suboptimal in these regimes.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of secure communication in a wireline noiseless scenario where a source wishes to communicate to a number of destinations in the presence of a passive external adversary. Different from the multicast scenario, where all destinations are interested in receiving the same message, in this setting different destinations are interested in different messages. The main focus of this paper is on characterizing the secure capacity region, when the adversary has unbounded computational capabilities, but limited network presence. Towards this end, an outer bound on the secure capacity region is derived, and secure transmission schemes are designed and analyzed in terms of achieved rate performance. It is first shown that, for the case of two destinations, the designed scheme matches the outer bound, hence characterizing the secure capacity region. Then, a particular class of networks referred to as two-layer networks is considered, where the source communicates with the destinations by hopping information through one layer of relays. It is shown that the designed scheme is indeed capacity achieving for any two-layer network for which one of the following three conditions is satisfied: (i) the number of destinations is three, (ii) the number of edges eavesdropped by the adversary is one, (iii) the min-cut capacities assume specific values. It is also shown that two-layer networks can be used to model and study a more general class of networks, referred to as separable. The key feature of separable networks is that they can be partitioned into edge disjoint networks that satisfy specific min-cut properties. In particular, it is proved that the secure capacity region of any separable network can be characterized from the secure capacity region of the corresponding two-layer network. Finally, for an arbitrary network topology, a two-phase scheme is designed and its rate performance is compared with the capacity-achieving scheme for networks with two destinations.},

There has been recent interest in understanding the performance of local search algorithms that work directly on the non-convex formulation of the problem. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, the success of these local search algorithms depends heavily on their starting points. The most widely used initialization scheme is the spectral method, in which the leading eigenvector of a data-dependent matrix is used as a starting point. Recently, the performance of the spectral initialization was characterized accurately for measurement matrices with independent and identically distributed entries. This paper aims to obtain the same level of knowledge for isotropically random column-orthogonal matrices, which are substantially better models for practical phase retrieval systems. Towards this goal, we consider the asymptotic setting in which the number of measurements m, and the dimension of the signal, n, diverge to infinity with m/n = δ ∈ (1, ∞), and obtain a simple expression for the overlap between the spectral estimator and the true signal vector.},

  abstract     = {Highly nonlinear functions (perfect nonlinear, maximum nonlinear, etc.) between finite fields have been studied in numerous papers. These concepts have been generalized first to finite abelian groups and then to finite nonabelian groups. In 2011, Poinsot and Pott introduced a new class of highly nonlinear functions between finite nonabelian groups, which are closely related to maximum nonlinear functions. They found such a function by a computer search, and proposed to find more such functions by theoretical constructions. Since then there is no progress in this topic. In this paper we continue the research in the direction proposed by Poinsot and Pott. Our purpose is to study the properties and constructions of this new class of highly nonlinear functions, called the absolute maximum nonlinear functions in this paper. In particular, for arbitrary finite (abelian or nonabelian) groups K and N with an absolute maximum nonlinear function f : K → N, we will prove that N has to be abelian, and f cannot be perfect nonlinear if K is not abelian. Then we investigate the numerical constraints on the groups that have absolute maximum nonlinear functions. These constraints will eliminate the existence of absolute maximum nonlinear functions for many finite nonabelian groups. More importantly, using these constraints we will develop a method to construct absolute maximum nonlinear functions for some groups. In particular, we will determine all absolute maximum nonlinear functions on A4 (the alternating group of degree 4). Furthermore, a general method to construct new absolute maximum nonlinear functions from the old ones will be given.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of secure parameter estimation when an estimation algorithm is prone to causative attacks. Causative attacks, in general, target decision-making algorithms (e.g., inference or learning algorithm) to alter their decisions in specific scenarios (e.g., distort parameter estimates for specific ranges of the parameter of interest). Such attacks influence the decisions via tampering with the mechanisms through which an algorithm acquires the statistical model of the population about which it aims to form a decision. Such attacks are viable, for instance, by contaminating the historical or training data, or by compromising an expert who provides the statistical model. In the presence of causative attacks, inference algorithms operate under a distorted statistical model for the data samples. This paper introduces a notion of secure parameter estimation and formalizes a framework under which secure estimation can be formulated and analyzed. The central premise underlying the secure estimation framework is that forming secure estimates introduces a new dimension to the estimation objective, pertaining to detecting attacks and isolating the true model. Since detection and isolation decisions themselves are imperfect, their inclusion induces an inherent coupling between the desired secure estimation objective and the auxiliary detection and isolation decisions that need to be formed in conjunction with the estimates. This paper establishes the fundamental interplay among these decisions, and characterizes the general decision rules in closed-forms for any desired estimation cost function. Furthermore, to circumvent the computational complexity associated with growing parameter dimension or attack complexity, a scalable estimation algorithm is provided, which is shown to enjoy certain optimality guarantees. Finally, the theory developed is applied to secure parameter estimation in sensor networks.},

This type of data corruption renders the linear regression task considerably harder, even in the absence of other corruptions, such as noise, outliers or missing entries. Existing methods are either applicable only to noiseless data or they are very sensitive to initialization or they work only for partially shuffled data. In this paper we address these issues via an algebraic geometric approach, which uses symmetric polynomials to extract permutation-invariant constraints that the parameters ξ* ∈ R n of the linear regression model must satisfy. This naturally leads to a polynomial system of n equations in n unknowns, which contains ξ* in its root locus. Using the machinery of algebraic geometry we prove that as long as the independent samples are generic, this polynomial system is always consistent with at most n! complex roots, regardless of any type of corruption inflicted on the observations. The algorithmic implication of this fact is that one can always solve this polynomial system and use its most suitable root as initialization to the Expectation Maximization algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, the resulting method is the first working solution for small values of n able to handle thousands of fully shuffled noisy observations in milliseconds.},

  abstract     = {Mean testing over ellipses is a decision problem that arises in several applications, including non-parametric goodness-of-fit testing, signal detection in cognitive radio, and regression function testing in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We study the local geometry of such testing problems with compound alternatives. Given samples of a Gaussian random vector, the goal is to distinguish whether the mean is equal to a known vector within an ellipse, or equal to some other unknown vector in the ellipse. While past work on such problems has focused on the difficulty in a global sense, we study difficulty in a way that is localized to each vector within the ellipse. Our main result is to give sharp upper and lower bounds on the localized minimax testing radius in terms of an explicit formula involving the Kolmogorov width of the ellipse intersected with a Euclidean ball. When applied to particular examples, our general theorems yield interesting rates that were not known before: as a particular case, for testing in Sobolev ellipses of smoothness α, we demonstrate rates that vary from (σ 2 ) 4α/4α+1, corresponding to the classical global rate, to the faster rate (σ 2 ) 8α/8α+1, achievable for vectors at favorable locations within the ellipse. We also show that the optimal test for this problem is achieved by a linear projection test that is based on an explicit lower-dimensional projection of the observation vector.},

Instead of assuming that only a fraction of the data points are outliers as considered in the classic robust estimation setup, in this paper, we consider an adversarial setup in which an attacker can observe the whole dataset and can modify all data samples in an adversarial manner so as to maximize the estimation error caused by his attack. We characterize the attacker&#39;s optimal attack strategy, and further introduce adversarial influence function (AIF) to quantify an estimator&#39;s sensitivity to such adversarial attacks. We provide an approach to characterize AIF for any given robust estimator, and then design optimal estimator that minimizes AIF, which implies it is least sensitive to adversarial attacks and hence is most robust against adversarial attacks. From this characterization, we identify a tradeoff between AIF (i.e., robustness against adversarial attack) and influence function, a quantity used in classic robust estimators to measure robustness against outliers, and design estimators that strike a desirable tradeoff between these two quantities.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we put forth a new joint sparse recovery algorithm called signal space matching pursuit (SSMP). The key idea of the proposed SSMP algorithm is to sequentially investigate the support of jointly sparse vectors to minimize the subspace distance to the residual space. Our performance guarantee analysis indicates that SSMP accurately reconstructs any row K-sparse matrix of rank r in the full row rank scenario if the sampling matrix A satisfies krank(A) ≥ K+1, which meets the fundamental minimum requirement on A to ensure exact recovery. We also show that SSMP guarantees exact reconstruction in at most K - r + [r/L] iterations, provided that A satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) of order L(K - r) + r + 1\%/L with δ L(K-r)+r+1 [7.8K] ≤ 0.155. Furthermore, we show that under a suitable RIP condition, the reconstruction error of SSMP is upper bounded by a constant multiple of the noise power, which demonstrates the robustness of SSMP to measurement noise. Finally, from extensive numerical experiments, we show that SSMP outperforms conventional joint sparse recovery algorithms both in noiseless and noisy scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Recall the classical hypothesis testing setting with two sets of probability distributions P and Q. One receives either n i.i.d. samples from a distribution p E P or from a distribution q E Q and wants to decide from which set the points were sampled. It is known that the optimal exponential rate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood ratio test which does not depend on p or q, but only on the sets P and Q. We consider an adaptive generalization of this model where the choice of p E P and q E Q can change in each sample in some way that depends arbitrarily on the previous samples. In other words, in the kth round, an adversary, having observed all the previous samples in rounds 1, . . . , k - 1, chooses pk E P and qk E Q, with the goal of confusing the hypothesis test. We prove that even in this case, the optimal exponential error rate can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood test that depends only on P and Q. We then show that the adversarial model has applications in hypothesis testing for quantum states using restricted measurements. For example, it can be used to study the problem of distinguishing entangled states from the set of all separable states using only measurements that can be implemented with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). The basic idea is that in our setup, the deleterious effects of entanglement can be simulated by an adaptive classical adversary. We prove a quantum Stein&#39;s Lemma in this setting: In many circumstances, the optimal hypothesis testing rate is equal to an appropriate notion of quantum relative entropy between two states. In particular, our arguments yield an alternate proof of Li and Winter&#39;s recent strengthening of strong subadditivity for von Neumann entropy.},

In typical bi- and multi-partite problems, however, some of the sub-systems are often left unchanged and this is not reflected by the standard smoothing of information measures over a ball of close states. We propose to smooth instead only over a ball of close states which also have some of the reduced states on the relevant sub-systems fixed. This partial smoothing of information measures naturally allows to give more refined characterizations of various information-theoretic problems in the one-shot setting. In particular, we immediately get asymptotic second-order characterizations for tasks such as privacy amplification against classical side information or classical state splitting. For quantum problems like state merging the general resource trade-off is tightly characterized by partially smoothed information measures as well.},

  abstract     = {The results of a series of theoretical studies are reported, examining the convergence rate for different approximate representations of α-stable distributions. Although they play a key role in modelling random processes with jumps and discontinuities, the use of α-stable distributions in inference often leads to analytically intractable problems. The LePage series, which is a probabilistic representation employed in this work, is used to transform an intractable, infinite-dimensional inference problem into a finite-dimensional (conditionally Gaussian) parametric problem. A major component of our approach is the approximation of the tail of this series by a Gaussian random variable. Standard statistical techniques, such as ExpectationMaximization (EM), Markov chain Monte Carlo, and Particle Filtering, can then be readily applied. In addition to the asymptotic normality of the tail of this series, we establish explicit, nonasymptotic bounds on the approximation error. Their proofs follow classical Fourier-analytic arguments, using Esséen&#39;s smoothing lemma. Specifically, we consider the distance between the distributions of: (i) the tail of the series and an appropriate Gaussian; (ii) the full series and the truncated series; and (iii) the full series and the truncated series with an added Gaussian term. In all three cases, sharp bounds are established, and the theoretical results are compared with the actual distances (computed numerically) in specific examples of symmetric αstable distributions. This analysis facilitates the selection of appropriate truncations in practice and offers theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of resulting estimates. One of the main conclusions obtained is that, for the purposes of inference, the use of a truncated series together with an approximately Gaussian error term has superior statistical properties and is likely a preferable choice in practice.},

The parameter j can be adjusted, for a fixed LRCC, according to different catastrophic erasure patterns, requiring only to contact n(j + 1) - d j c +1 nodes, plus less than μn other nodes, in the storage system, where μ is the memory of the code. A Singleton-type bound is provided for dcj. If it attains such a bound, an LRCC can correct the same number of catastrophic erasures in a window of length n(j + 1) as an optimal locally repairable block code of the same rate and locality, and with block length n(j + 1). In addition, the LRCC is able to perform the flexible and somehow local sliding-window repair by adjusting j. Furthermore, by adjusting and/or sliding the window, the LRCC can potentially correct more erasures in the original window of n(j + 1) nodes than an optimal locally repairable block code of the same rate and locality, and length n(j+1). Finally, the concept of partial maximum distance profile (partial MDP) codes is introduced. Partial MDP codes can correct all information-theoretically correctable erasure patterns for a given locality, local distance and information rate. An explicit construction of partial MDP codes whose column distances attain the provided Singleton-type bound, up to certain parameter j = L, is obtained based on known maximum sum-rank distance convolutional codes.},

It is shown that the minimum message size (sometimes also referred to as the sub-packetization factor) is significantly, in fact exponentially, lower than previously believed. More precisely, when K &gt; T/ gcd(N, T) where K is the total number of messages in the system and gcd(·, ·) means the greatest common divisor, we establish, by providing both novel code constructions and a matching converse, the minimum message size as lcm(N - T, T), where lcm(·, ·) means the least common multiple. On the other hand, when K is small, we show that it is in fact possible to design codes with a message size even smaller than lcm(N - T, T).},

  abstract     = {Tandem duplication is the process of inserting a copy of a segment of DNA adjacent to the original position. Motivated by applications that store data in living organisms, Jain et al. (2017) proposed the study of codes that correct tandem duplications. All code constructions are based on irreducible words. Such code constructions are almost optimal to combat tandem duplications of length at most k where k ≤ 3. However, the problem of designing efficient encoder/decoder for such codes has not been investigated. In addition, the method cannot be extended to deal with the case of arbitrary k, where k ≥ 4. In this work, we study efficient encoding/decoding methods for irreducible words over general q-ary alphabet. Our methods provide the first known efficient encoder/decoder for q-ary codes correcting tandem duplications of length at most k, where k ≤ 3. In particular, we describe an (1, m)-finite state encoder and show that when m = Θ(1/ε) and ϊ = Θ(1/ε), the encoder achieves rate that is ε away from the optimal rate. We also provide ranking/unranking algorithms for irreducible words and modify the algorithms to reduce the space requirements for the finite state encoder. Over the DNA alphabet (or quaternary alphabet), we also impose weight constraint on the codewords. In particular, a quaternary word is GC-balanced if exactly half of the symbols of are either C or G. Via a modification of Knuth&#39;s balancing technique, we provide an efficient method that translates quaternary messages into GC-balanced codewords and the resulting codebook is able to correct tandem duplications of length at most k, where k ≤ 3. In addition, we provide the first known construction of codes to combat tandem duplications of length at most k, where k ≥ 4. Such codes can correct duplication errors in linear-time and they are almost optimal in terms of rate.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we design erasure-correcting codes for channels with burst and random erasures, when a strict decoding delay constraint is in place. We consider the sliding-window-based packet erasure model proposed by Badr et al., where any time-window of width w contains either up to a random erasures or an erasure burst of length at most b. One needs to recover any erased packet with a strict decoding delay deadline of τ, where erasures are as per the channel model. Presently existing rate-optimal constructions in the literature require, in general, a field-size which grows exponential in τ, as long as a/τ remains a constant. In this work, we present a new rate-optimal code construction covering all channel and delay parameters, which requires an O(τ 2 ) field-size. As a special case, when (b - a) = 1, we have a field-size linear in τ. We also present two other constructions having linear fieldsize, under certain constraints on channel and decoding delay parameters. As a corollary, we obtain low field-size, rate-optimal convolutional codes for any given column distance and column span. Simulations indicate that the newly proposed streaming code constructions offer lower packet-loss probabilities compared to existing schemes, for selected instances of Gilbert-Elliott and Fritchman channels.},

  abstract     = {Because of their capacity-approaching performance and their complexity/latency advantages, spatially-coupled (SC) codes are among the most attractive error-correcting codes for use in modern dense data storage systems. SC codes are constructed by partitioning an underlying block code and coupling the partitioned components. Here, we focus on circulant-based SC codes. Recently, the optimal overlap (OO), circulant power optimizer (CPO) approach was introduced to construct high performance SC codes for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Flash channels. The OO stage operates on the protograph of the SC code to derive the optimal partitioning that minimizes the number of graphical objects that undermine the performance of SC codes under iterative decoding. Then, the CPO optimizes the circulant powers to further reduce this number. Since the nature of detrimental objects in the graph of a code critically depends on the characteristics of the channel of interest, extending the OO-CPO approach to construct SC codes for channels with intrinsic memory is not a straightforward task. In this paper, we tackle one relevant extension; we construct high performance SC codes for practical 1-D magnetic recording channels, i.e., partial-response (PR) channels. Via combinatorial techniques, we carefully build and solve the optimization problem of the OO partitioning, focusing on the objects of interest in the case of PR channels. Then, we customize the CPO to further reduce the number of these objects in the graph of the code. SC codes designed using the proposed OO-CPO approach for PR channels outperform prior state-of-the-art SC codes by up to around 3 orders of magnitude in frame error rate (FER) and 1.1 dB in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). More intriguingly, our SC codes outperform structured block codes of the same length and rate by up to around 1.8 orders of magnitude in FER and 0.4 dB in SNR. The performance advantage of SC codes designed using the devised OO-CPO approach over block codes of the same parameters is not only pronounced in the error floor region, but also in the waterfall region.},

The algorithm relies on new findings in the recursive structure of the parity polytope and iteratively fixes selected components. As shown in our realistic simulation setup, it requires up to 37\% less arithmetical operations compared with state-of-the-art projections. Additionally, it does not involve a sorting operation, which is needed in all exact state-of-the-art projection algorithms.

  abstract     = {In a bus with n wires, each wire has two states, `0&#39; or `1&#39;, representing one bit of information. Whenever the state transitions from `0&#39; to `1&#39;, or `1&#39; to `0&#39;, joule heating causes the temperature to rise, and high temperatures have adverse effects on on-chip bus performance. Recently, the class of low-power cooling (LPC) codes was proposed to control such state transitions during each transmission. As suggested in earlier work, LPC codes may be used to control simultaneously both the peak temperature and the average power consumption of on-chip buses. Specifically, an (n, t, w)-LPC code is a coding scheme over n wires that (i) avoids state transitions on the t hottest wires (thus preventing the peak temperature from rising); and (ii) allows at most w state transitions in each transmission (thus reducing average power consumption). In this paper, for any fixed value of w, several constructions are presented for large LPC codes that can be encoded and decoded in time O(n log 2 (n/w)) along with the corresponding encoding/decoding schemes. In particular, we construct LPC codes of size (n/w) w-1 , which are asymptotically optimal. We then modify these LPC codes to also correct errors in time O(n 3 ). For the case where w is proportional to n, we further present a different construction of large LPC codes, based on a mapping from cooling codes to LPC codes. Using this construction, we obtain two families of LPC codes whose encoding and decoding complexities are O(n 3 ).},

We provide a single-letter formula for the best achievable exponential growth rate of the ρ-th moment of the number of guesses, as a function of n. This formula exhibits a fairly clear insight concerning the penalty due to the noise. We describe two different randomized schemes that achieve the optimal guessing exponent. One of them is fully universal in the sense of being independent of source (that governs the vector to be guessed), the channel (that corrupts the guesses), and the moment power ρ. Interestingly, it turns out that, in general, the optimal guessing exponent function exhibits a phase transition when it is examined either as a function of the channel parameters, or as a function of ρ: as long as the channel is not too distant (in a certain sense to be defined precisely) from the identity channel (i.e., the clean channel), or equivalently, as long ρ is larger than a certain critical value, ρ c , there is no penalty at all in the guessing exponent, compared to the case of noiseless guessing.},

In this paper, we consider the situation in which the SW coding system is asynchronous, i.e., each encoder samples a source sequence with some unknown delay. We assume that delays are unknown but maximum and minimum values of possible delays are known to encoders and the decoder. We also assume that sources are discrete stationary memoryless and the probability mass function (PMF) of the sources is unknown but the system knows that it belongs to a certain set of PMFs. For this asynchronous SW coding system, we clarify the achievable rate region which is the set of rate pairs of encoders such that the decoding error probability vanishes as the blocklength tends to infinity. We show that this region does not always coincide with that of the synchronous SW coding system in which each encoder samples a source sequence without any delay.},

Considering the large number of records in modern datasets, it is assumed that L is much larger than the alphabet size K. The capacity of private search is the maximum number of bits of desired information that can be retrieved per bit of download. The asymptotic (large K) capacity of private search is shown to be 1 - 1/N, even when the scope of private search is further generalized to allow OR search, AND search, NOT search and sequence search.

  abstract     = {We consider a network of two nodes separated by a noisy channel with two-sided state information, in which the input and output signals have to be coordinated with the source and its reconstruction. In the case of non-causal encoding and decoding, we propose a joint source-channel coding scheme and we develop inner and outer bounds for the strong coordination region. While the inner and outer bounds do not match in general, we provide a complete characterization of the strong coordination region in three particular cases: i) when the channel is perfect; ii) when the decoder is lossless; and iii) when the random variables of the channel are independent from the random variables of the source. Through the study of these special cases, we prove that the separation principle does not hold for the joint source-channel strong coordination. Finally, in the absence of state information, we show that polar codes achieve a subset of the best known inner bound for the strong coordination region, therefore offering a constructive alternative to random binning and coding proofs.},

  abstract     = {In index coding, a server broadcasts multiple messages to their respective receivers, each with some side information that can be utilized to reduce the amount of communication from the server. Distributed index coding is an extension of index coding in which the messages are broadcast from multiple servers, each storing different subsets of the messages. In this paper, the optimal tradeoff among the message rates and the server broadcast rates, which is defined formally as the capacity region, is studied for a general distributed index coding problem. Inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are established that have matching sum-rates for all 218 non-isomorphic four-message problems with equal link capacities for all the links from servers to receivers. The proposed inner bound is built on a distributed composite coding scheme that outperforms the existing schemes by incorporating more flexible decoding configurations and enhanced fractional rate allocations into two-stage composite coding, a scheme that was originally introduced for centralized index coding. The proposed outer bound is built on the polymatroidal axioms of entropy, as well as functional dependences such as the fd-separation introduced by the multi-server nature of the problem. This outer bound utilizes general groupings of servers with different levels of granularity, which allows a natural tradeoff between computational complexity and tightness of the bound, and includes and improves upon all existing outer bounds for distributed index coding. Specific features of the proposed inner and outer bounds are demonstrated through concrete examples with four or five messages.},

In this work, we study private quantum states from this point of view. Private quantum states are bipartite quantum states characterised by the property that carrying out simple local measurements yields a secret bit. This feature is shared by the maximally entangled pair of quantum bits, yet private quantum states are more general and can in their most extreme form be almost bound entangled. In this work, we study the entanglement properties of random private quantum states and show that they are hardly distinguishable from separable states and thus have low repeatable key, despite containing one bit of key. The technical tools we develop are centred around the concept of locally restricted measurements and include a new operator ordering, bounds on norms under tensoring with entangled states and a continuity bound for a relative entropy measure.},

  abstract     = {The problem of imaging point objects can be formulated as estimation of an unknown atomic measure from its M+1 consecutive noisy Fourier coefficients. The standard resolution of this inverse problem is 1/M and super-resolution refers to the capability of resolving atoms at a higher resolution. When any two atoms are less than 1/M apart, this recovery problem is highly challenging and many existing algorithms either cannot deal with this situation or require restrictive assumptions on the sign of the measure. ESPRIT is an efficient method which does not depend on the sign of the measure. This paper provides an explicit error bound on the support matching distance of ESPRIT in terms of the minimum singular value of Vandermonde matrices. When the support consists of multiple well-separated clumps and noise is sufficiently small, the support error by ESPRIT scales like SRF 2λ-2 ×Noise, where the Super-Resolution Factor (SRF) governs the difficulty of the problem and λ is the cardinality of the largest clump. Our error bound matches the min-max rate of a special model with one clump of closely spaced atoms up to a factor of M in the small noise regime, and therefore establishes the near-optimality of ESPRIT. Our theory is validated by numerical experiments.},

This paper studies whether spectral factorization can be algorithmically computed on an abstract machine (a Turing machine). It is shown that there exist computable spectral densities with very good analytic properties (i.e. smooth with finite energy) such that the corresponding spectral factor cannot be determined on a Turing machine. Further, it will be proved that it is impossible to decide algorithmically whether or not a given computable density possesses a computable spectral factor. This negative result has consequences for applications of spectral factorization in computer-aided design, because there it is necessary that this problem be decidable. Conversely, this paper will show that if the logarithm of a computable spectral density belongs to certain Sobolev space of sufficiently smooth functions, then the spectral factor is always computable. As an application, the paper discusses the possibility of calculating the optimal causal Wiener filter on an abstract machine.},

We focus on minimizing the average distortion defined as the 1-norm of the difference of the two signals under the scenario that a Poisson counting process is reconstructed in real-time on a remote monitor. We consider the reconstruction under three special sampling policies. For each of the policy, we derive the closed-form expression of the average distortion by dividing the overall distortion area into polygons and analyzing their structures. It turns out that the polygons are built up by sub-polygons that account for distortions caused by sampling and queuing delay. The closed-form expressions of the average distortion help us find the optimal sampling parameters that achieve the minimum distortion. In addition, we propose an interpolation algorithm to further decrease the average distortion and give its lower-bound on distortion for one of the three sampling policies.

Our online scheme combines (i) the classical decentralized coded caching scheme with (ii) joint scheduling and power control for the fading broadcast channel, as well as (iii) congestion control for ensuring the optimal long-term average performance. We prove that our online delivery scheme maximizes the alpha-fair utility among all schemes restricted to decentralized placement. By tuning the value of alpha, the proposed scheme can achieve different operating points on the average delivery rate region and tune performance according to an operator&#39;s choice. We demonstrate via simulations that our scheme outperforms two baseline schemes: (a) standard coded caching with multicast transmission, limited by the worst channel user yet exploiting the global caching gain; (b) opportunistic scheduling with unicast transmissions exploiting the fading diversity but limited to local caching gain.},

  abstract     = {We study the K-user, M-subchannel parallel multiple-input-single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) under arbitrary levels of partial channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). We show that the parallel subchannels constituting this setting are separable from a degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region perspective if and only if the partial CSIT pattern is totally ordered. This total order condition corresponds to users abiding by the same order, with respect to their CSIT quality levels, in each of the parallel subchannels. For instance, let α k [l] and α j [l] be the CSIT quality parameters for users k and j over subchannel l. Under total order, having α k [l] ≥ α j [l] implies that α k [m] ≥ α j [m] holds for every subchannel m. In this case, the entire DoF region is achievable using simple separate coding, where a single-subchannel-type transmission scheme is employed in each subchannel. To show this separability result, we first derive an outer bound for the DoF region by extending the aligned image sets approach of Davoodi and Jafar to the considered setting. We then show that this outer bound coincides with the inner bound achieved through separate coding, given by the Minkowski sum of M single-subchannel DoF regions, under the total order condition, hence settling the if part of the main theorem. To prove the only if part of the theorem, we identify a set of DoF tuples achievable through joint coding across subchannels, yet not achievable through separate coding whenever the total order condition is violated. Moreover, we also highlight the implications of our main result on the design of CSIT feedback schemes for multi-carrier multi-antenna wireless networks.},

  abstract     = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems use antenna arrays with a large number of antenna elements to serve many different users simultaneously. The large number of antennas in the system makes, however, the channel state information (CSI) acquisition strategy design critical and particularly challenging. Interestingly, in the context of massive MIMO systems, channels exhibit a large degree of spatial correlation which results in strongly rank-deficient spatial covariance matrices at the base station (BS). With the final objective of analyzing the benefits of covariance-aided uplink multi-user CSI acquisition in massive MIMO systems, here we compare the channel estimation mean-square error (MSE) for (i) conventional CSI acquisition, which does not assume any knowledge on the user spatial covariance matrices and uses orthogonal pilot sequences; and (ii) covariance-aided CSI acquisition, which exploits the individual covariance matrices for channel estimation and enables the use of non-orthogonal pilot sequences. We apply a large-system analysis to the latter case, for which new asymptotic MSE expressions are established under various assumptions on the distributions of the pilot sequences and on the covariance matrices. We link these expressions to those describing the estimation MSE of conventional CSI acquisition with orthogonal pilot sequences of some equivalent length. This analysis provides insights on how much training overhead can be reduced with respect to the conventional strategy when a covariance-aided approach is adopted.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we investigate the problem of secure broadcasting over block-fading wiretap channels with limited channel knowledge at the transmitter. More particularly, we analyze the effect of having a finite rate feedback on the throughput of multi-user broadcast wiretap channels. We consider that the transmitter is only provided by a b -bits feedback of the main channel state information (CSI) sent by each legitimate receiver, at the beginning of each fading block, over error-free public links with limited capacity. Also, we assume that the transmitter is aware of the statistics of the eavesdropper&#39;s CSI but not of its channel&#39;s realizations. Under these assumptions of CSI uncertainty, we characterize the ergodic secrecy capacity of the system when a common message is broadcasted to all legitimate receivers, the ergodic secrecy sum-capacity when multiple independent messages are transmitted, and the ergodic secrecy capacity region for the broadcast channel with confidential messages (BCCM). In all three scenarios, we show that as long as the transmitter has some knowledge of the main CSI, obtained even through a 1-bit CSI feedback, a non-zero secrecy rate can still be achieved. The impact of having the feedback sent over a binary erasure channel (BEC) is also investigated for the BCCM case. Here again, and even with the possibility of having the feedback bits erased, a positive secrecy rate can still be achieved as long as the erasure event is not a probability-one event. An asymptotic analysis of the obtained results is provided for the high SNR regime, and the scaling law of the system, when the number of legitimate receivers is large, is also presented.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of characterizing the capacity of Half-Duplex (HD) line networks, where a source node communicates to a destination node through a multihop path of N relays. If the relays operate in Full-Duplex (FD), it is well known that the capacity of the line network equals the minimum among the point-to-point link capacities in the path. In contrast, this paper considers a different case where the relays operate in HD. In the first part of the paper, it is shown that the approximate capacity (optimal up to a constant additive gap that only depends on the number of nodes in the network) of an HD N-relay line network equals half the minimum of the harmonic means of the point-to-point link capacities of each two consecutive links in the path. It is then proved that the N +1 listen/transmit states (out of the 2 N possible ones) sufficient to characterize the approximate capacity can be found in linear time. In the second part of the paper, it is shown that the problem of finding the path that has the largest HD approximate capacity in a network that can be represented as a graph is NP-hard. However, if the number of cycles in the network is polynomial in the number of nodes, then a polynomial-time algorithm can indeed be designed.},

We derive the optimal signaling structure for communication for the asymmetric MIMO channel, which is distinct from that for the MIMO channel with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) links. We extend the existing results for the single input multiple output (SIMO) channel with i.i.d. links to the asymmetric case, proving that selecting the statistically best antenna is gDoFoptimal. Using the gDoF result for the SIMO channel, we prove that for T = 1, the gDoF is zero for MIMO channels with arbitrary link strengths. We show that selecting the statistically best antenna is gDoF-optimal for the multiple input single output (MISO) channel. We also derive the gDoF for the 2 x 2 MIMO channel with different exponents in the direct and cross links. In this setting, we show that it is always necessary to use both the antennas to achieve the gDoF, in contrast to the results for the 2 x 2 MIMO channel with i.i.d. links. We show that having weaker crosslinks, gives gDoF gain compared to the case with i.i.d. links. For the noncoherent MIMO channel with i.i.d. links, the traditional method of training each transmit antenna independently is degrees of freedom (DoF) optimal, whereas we observe that for the asymmetric 2 x 2 MIMO channel, the traditional training is not gDoF-optimal. We extend this observation to a larger MxM MIMO channel by demonstrating a strategy that can achieve larger gDoF than a traditional trainingbased method.},

The first goal of this paper is to derive the tight lower bounds in terms of j (j &gt; 1) known symbol probabilities of the source using some properties of Kullback-Leibler distance. Since fix-free codes are special prefix-free codes (for which no codeword is a suffix of the other codewords), it is clear that all lower bounds on the redundancy of optimal prefix-free codes are also valid for fix-free ones. Accordingly, the second question of the paper is on the tightness of the derived lower bounds for optimal fix-free codes. It is proven that these lower bounds are tight for optimal fix-free codes if j ≤ 3, and are not tight for j ≥ 4. Also, it is shown that the tight lower bound in terms of the probability of the most likely symbol is the same for optimal prefix-free and optimal fix-free codes.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies convergence of empirical measures smoothed by a Gaussian kernel. Specifically, consider approximating P * N σ , for N σ = △ N(0, σ 2 I d ), by P̑ n * N σ under different statistical distances, where P̑ n is the empirical measure. We examine the convergence in terms of the Wasserstein distance, total variation (TV), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and χ 2 -divergence. We show that the approximation error under the TV distance and 1-Wasserstein distance (W 1 ) converges at the rate e O(d) n -1/2 in remarkable contrast to a (typical) n -1/d rate for unsmoothed W 1 (and d ≥ 3). Similarly, for the KL divergence, squared 2-Wasserstein distance (W 2 2 ), and χ 2 -divergence, the convergence rate is e O(d) n -1 , but only if P achieves finite input-output χ 2 mutual information across the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. If the latter condition is not met, the rate changes to ω (n -1 ) for the KL divergence and W 2 2 , while the χ 2 -divergence becomes infinite - a curious dichotomy. As an application we consider estimating the differential entropy h(S + Z), where S ~ P and Z ~ N σ are independent d-dimensional random variables. The distribution P is unknown and belongs to some nonparametric class, but n independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples from it are available. Despite the regularizing effect of noise, we first show that any good estimator (within an additive gap) for this problem must have a sample complexity that is exponential in d. We then leverage the above empirical approximation results to show that the absolute-error risk of the plug-in estimator converges as e O(d) n -1/2 , thus attaining the parametric rate in n. This establishes the plug-in estimator as minimax rate-optimal for the considered problem, with sharp dependence of the convergence rate both in n and d. We provide numerical results comparing the performance of the plug-in estimator to that of general-purpose (unstructured) differential entropy estimators (based on kernel density estimation (KDE) or k nearest neighbors (kNN) techniques) applied to samples of S + Z. These results reveal a significant empirical superiority of the plug-in to state-of-the-art KDE and kNN methods. As a motivating utilization of the plug-in approach, we estimate information flows in deep neural networks and discuss Tishby&#39;s Information Bottleneck and the compression conjecture, among others.},

These empirically observed statistics, together with source (test) sequences, are transmitted through different channels to the fusion center. The fusion center decides which distribution the source sequence is sampled from based on these data. For the binary case, we derive the optimal type-II error exponent given that the type-I error decays exponentially fast. The type-II error exponent is maximized over the proportions of channels for both source and training sequences. We conclude that as the ratio of the lengths of training to test sequences α tends to infinity, using only one channel is optimal. By calculating the derived exponents numerically, we conjecture that the same is true when α is finite under certain conditions. We relate our results to the classical distributed detection problem studied by Tsitsiklis, in which the underlying distributions are known. Finally, our results are extended to the case of m-ary distributed detection with a rejection option.},

The transition law of one of the arms, referred to as the odd arm, is different from the common transition law of all other arms. A learner, who has no knowledge of the above transition laws, has to devise a sequential test to identify the index of the odd arm as quickly as possible, subject to an upper bound on the probability of error. For this problem, we derive an asymptotic lower bound on the expected stopping time of any sequential test of the learner, where the asymptotics is as the probability of error vanishes. Furthermore, we propose a sequential test, and show that the asymptotic behaviour of its expected stopping time comes arbitrarily close to that of the lower bound. Prior works deal with independent and identically distributed arms, whereas our work deals with Markov arms. Our analysis of the rested Markov setting is a key first step in understanding the difficult case of restless Markov setting, which is still open.},

Specifically, the paper focuses on properties of the conditional mean estimator as a function of the scaling coefficient, the dark current parameter, the distribution of the input random variable and channel realizations. With respect to the scaling coefficient and the dark current, several identities in terms of derivatives are established. For example, it is shown that the gradient of the conditional mean estimator with respect to the scaling coefficient and dark current parameter is proportional to the conditional variance. Moreover, a score function is proposed and a Tweedie-like formula for the conditional expectation is recovered. With respect to the distribution, several regularity conditions are shown. For instance, it is shown that the conditional mean estimator uniquely determines the input distribution. Moreover, it is shown that if the conditional expectation is close to a linear function in terms of mean squared error, then the input distribution is approximately gamma in the Lévy distance. Furthermore, sufficient and necessary conditions for linearity are found. Interestingly, it is shown that the conditional mean estimator cannot be linear when the dark current parameter of the Poisson noise is non-zero.},

  abstract     = {We consider the estimation of a signal from the knowledge of its noisy linear random Gaussian projections. A few examples where this problem is relevant are compressed sensing, sparse superposition codes, and code division multiple access. There has been a number of works considering the mutual information for this problem using the replica method from statistical physics. Here we put these considerations on a firm rigorous basis. First, we show, using a Guerra-Toninelli type interpolation, that the replica formula yields an upper bound to the exact mutual information. Secondly, for many relevant practical cases, we present a converse lower bound via a method that uses spatial coupling, state evolution analysis and the I-MMSE theorem. This yields a single letter formula for the mutual information and the minimal-mean-square error for random Gaussian linear estimation of all discrete bounded signals. In addition, we prove that the low complexity approximate message-passing algorithm is optimal outside of the so-called hard phase, in the sense that it asymptotically reaches the minimal-mean-square error. In this work spatial coupling is used primarily as a proof technique. However our results also prove two important features of spatially coupled noisy linear random Gaussian estimation. First there is no algorithmically hard phase. This means that for such systems approximate message-passing always reaches the minimal-mean-square error. Secondly, in the limit of infinitely long coupled chain, the mutual information associated to spatially coupled systems is the same as the one of uncoupled linear random Gaussian estimation.},

  abstract     = {The minimum description length (MDL) principle is extended to supervised learning. The MDL principle is a philosophy that the shortest description of given data leads to the best hypothesis about the data source. One of the key theories for the MDL principle is Barron and Cover&#39;s theory (BC theory), which mathematically justifies the MDL principle based on two-stage codes in density estimation (unsupervised learning). Though the codelength of two-stage codes looks similar to the target function of penalized likelihood methods, parameter optimization of penalized likelihood methods is done without quantization of parameter space. Recently, Chatterjee and Barron have provided theoretical tools to extend BC theory to penalized likelihood methods by overcoming this difference. Indeed, applying their tools, they showed that the famous penalized likelihood method `lasso&#39; can be interpreted as an MDL estimator and enjoys performance guarantee by BC theory. An important fact is that their results assume a fixed design setting, which is essentially the same as unsupervised learning. The fixed design is natural if we use lasso for compressed sensing. If we use lasso for supervised learning, however, the fixed design is considerably unsatisfactory. Only random design is acceptable. However, it is inherently difficult to extend BC theory to the random design regardless of whether the parameter space is quantized or not. In this paper, a novel theoretical tool for extending BC theory to supervised learning (the random design setting and no quantization of parameter space) is provided. Applying this tool, when the covariates are subject to a Gaussian distribution, it is proved that lasso in the random design setting can also be interpreted as an MDL estimator, and that lasso enjoys the risk bound of BC theory. The risk/regret bounds obtained have several advantages inherited from BC theory. First, the bounds require remarkably few assumptions. Second, the bounds hold for any finite sample size $n$ and any finite feature number $p$ even if $n\ll p$ . Behavior of the regret bound is investigated by numerical simulations. We believe that this is the first extensions of BC theory to supervised learning (random design).},

For the first problem, we identify a structure in the joint probability distribution of discrete memoryless sources, and define a new common information called “conferencing common information”. We develop a multi-user joint-source channel coding methodology based on structured mappings to encode this common information efficiently and to transmit it over a MAC. We derive a new set of sufficient conditions for this coding strategy using single-letter information quantities for arbitrary sources and channel distributions. Next, we make a fundamental connection between this problem and the problem of communication of independent messages over three-user MAC-FB. In the latter problem, although the messages are independent to begin with, they become progressively correlated given the channel output feedback. Subsequent communication can be modeled as transmission of correlated sources over MAC. Exploiting this connection, we develop a new coding scheme for the problem. We characterize its performance using single-letter information quantities, and derive an inner bound to the capacity region. For both problems, we provide a set of examples where these rate regions are shown to be optimal. Moreover, we analytically prove that this performance is not achievable using random unstructured random mappings/codes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the vector Gaussian Chief Executive Officer (CEO) problem under logarithmic loss distortion measure. Specifically, K ≥ 2 agents observe independently corrupted Gaussian noisy versions of a remote vector Gaussian source, and communicate independently with a decoder or CEO over rate-constrained noise-free links. The CEO also has its own Gaussian noisy observation of the source and wants to reconstruct the remote source to within some prescribed distortion level where the incurred distortion is measured under the logarithmic loss penalty criterion. We find an explicit characterization of the rate-distortion region of this model. The result can be seen as the counterpart to the vector Gaussian setting of that by Courtade-Weissman which provides the rate-distortion region of the model in the discrete memoryless setting. For the proof of this result, we obtain an outer bound by means of a technique that relies on the de Bruijn identity and the properties of Fisher information. The approach is similar to Ekrem-Ulukus outer bounding technique for the vector Gaussian CEO problem under quadratic distortion measure, for which it was there found generally non-tight; but it is shown here to yield a complete characterization of the region for the case of logarithmic loss measure. Also, we show that Gaussian test channels with time-sharing exhaust the Berger-Tung inner bound, which is optimal. Furthermore, application of our results allows us to find the complete solutions of two related problems: a quadratic vector Gaussian CEO problem with determinant constraint and the vector Gaussian distributed Information Bottleneck problem. Finally, we develop Blahut-Arimoto type algorithms that allow to compute numerically the regions provided in this paper, for both discrete and Gaussian models. With the known relevance of the logarithmic loss fidelity measure in the context of learning and prediction, the proposed algorithms may find usefulness in a variety of applications where learning is performed distributively. We illustrate the efficiency of our algorithms through some numerical examples.},

When communication is over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC), our scheme combines Shimokawa-Han-Amari&#39;s hypothesis testing scheme with Borade-Nakiboglu-Zheng&#39;s unequal error protection (UEP) for channel coding where source and channel codewords are simultaneously decoded. The resulting exponent is optimal for the newly introduced class of generalized testing against conditional independence. When communication is over a multi-access channel (MAC), our scheme combines hybrid coding with UEP. The resulting error exponent over the MAC is optimal in the case of generalized testing against conditional independence with independent observations at the two sensors when the MAC decomposes into two individual DMCs. In this case, separate source-channel coding is sufficient and no UEP is required. This same conclusion holds also under arbitrarily correlated sensor observations when testing is against independence.},

In PIR-WTC-II, a user wants to retrieve a single message (file) privately out of M messages, which are stored in N replicated and non-communicating databases. An external eavesdropper observes a fraction μ n (of its choice) of the traffic exchanged between the nth database and the user. In addition to the privacy constraint, the databases should encode the returned answer strings such that the eavesdropper learns absolutely nothing about the contents of the databases. We aim at characterizing the capacity of the PIR-WTC-II under the combined privacy and security constraints. We obtain a general upper bound for the problem in the form of a max-min optimization problem, which extends the converse proof of the PIR problem under asymmetric traffic constraints. We propose an achievability scheme that satisfies the security constraint by encoding a secret key, which is generated securely at each database, into an artificial noise vector using an MDS code. The user and the databases operate at one of the corner points of the achievable scheme for the PIR under asymmetric traffic constraints such that the retrieval rate is maximized under the imposed security constraint. The upper bound and the lower bound match for the case of M = 2 and M = 3 messages, for any N, and any μ = (μ 1 , · · · , μ N ).},

In such devices, the matrix is programmed into the device by setting an array of resistors to have conductances proportional to the respective entries in the matrix. In the coding scheme that is considered in this work, redundancy columns are appended so that each row in the programmed matrix forms a codeword of a prescribed linear code C over the real field; the result of the multiplication of any input real row vector by the matrix is then also a codeword of C. While error values within ±δ in the entries of the result are tolerable (for some prescribed δ &gt; 0), outlying errors, with values outside the range ±Δ (for a prescribed Δ ≥ δ) should be located and corrected. As a design and analysis tool for such a setting, a certain functional is defined for the code C, through which a characterization is obtained for the number of outlying errors that can be handled, as a function of the ratio Δ/δ. Several code constructions are then presented, primarily for the case of single outlying error handling. For this case, the coding problem is shown to be related to certain extremal problems on convex polygons.},

The destination must perfectly recover every source message in the first sequence subject to a decoding delay T v , and every source message in the second sequence subject to a shorter decoding delay T u ≤ T v ,. We assume that the channel loss model introduces a burst erasure of a fixed length B on the discrete timeline. Under this channel loss assumption, the capacity region for the case where T v , ≤ T u +B was previously solved. In this paper, we fully characterize the capacity region for the remaining case T v , ) T u +B. The key step in the achievability proof is achieving the non-trivial corner point of the capacity region through using a multiplexed streaming code constructed by superimposing two single-stream codes. The main idea in the converse proof is obtaining a genie-aided bound when the channel is subject to a periodic erasure pattern where each period consists of a length-B burst erasure followed by a length-T u noiseless duration.},

This class contains the binary erasure channel (BEC) and some other known erasure-like channels as special cases. For MAECs, we provide recursive formulas of Arıkan-like polar transform to simulate channel polarization. In other words, we show that the synthetic channels of MAECs are equivalent to other MAECs. This is a generalization of well-known recursive formulas of the polar transform for BECs. Using our recursive formulas, we also show that a recursive application of the polar transform for MAECs results in multilevel channel polarization, which is an asymptotic phenomenon that is characteristic of non-binary polar codes. Specifically, we establish a method to calculate the limiting proportions of the partially noiseless and noisy channels that are generated as a result of multilevel channel polarization for MAECs. In the particular case of MAECs, this calculation method solves an open problem posed by Nasser (2017) in the study of non-binary polar codes.},

  abstract     = {Regenerating code is a class of distributed storage codes that can optimally trade the bandwidth with the amount of data stored per node to repair a failed node. There are two extreme points in the optimal regenerating trade-off curve, which correspond to minimum-storage regenerating (MSR) and minimum-bandwidth regenerating (MBR). Recently, Reed-Solomon (RS) code based regenerating codes (RS-RC) were constructed under the product-matrix framework. It can also achieve the maximum distance separable (MDS) property in code regeneration and reconstruction. However, in case that the network is hostile and the storage nodes could be compromised or packets be modified, the storage capacity and the bandwidth required to regenerate or reconstruct the original file can be significantly affected. In this paper, we propose Hermitian code based regenerating codes (H-RC) by developing constructions under the product-matrix framework for minimum storage regenerating (H-MSR) and the minimum bandwidth regenerating (H-MBR). We also propose data regeneration and reconstruction algorithms for both H-MSR and H-MBR codes under both error-free and hostile networks. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can also successfully determine the erroneous decodings in hostile networks. Theoretical evaluation shows that our proposed H-RC can detect and correct more errors in hostile networks well beyond the RS-RC with the same code rate. Our analysis shows that the proposed H-RC have lower computational complexity than the RS-RC for both code regeneration and code reconstruction.},

Under the ℤ 2 Synchronization model, Censored Block Model (CBM) and Stochastic Block Model (SBM), we show that SDP achieves an error rate of the form exp [-(1-o(1)) n̅I*] . Here n- is an appropriate multiple of the number of nodes and I* is an information-theoretic measure of the signal-to-noise ratio. We provide matching lower bounds on the Bayes error for each model and therefore demonstrate that the SDP approach is Bayes optimal. As a corollary, our results imply that SDP achieves the optimal exact recovery threshold under each model. Furthermore, we show that SDP is robust: the above bound remains valid under semirandom versions of the models in which the observed graph is modified by a monotone adversary. Our proof is based on a novel primal-dual analysis of SDP under a unified framework for all three models, and the analysis shows that SDP tightly approximates a joint majority voting procedure.},

The non-stationary blind super-resolution problem appears in many applications including radar imaging, 3D single-molecule microscopy, computational photography, etc. There is a growing interest in solving non-stationary blind super-resolution task with convex methods due to their robustness to noise and strong theoretical guarantees. Motivated by the recent work on atomic norm minimization in blind inverse problems, we focus here on the signal denoising problem in non-stationary blind super-resolution. In particular, we use an atomic norm regularized least-squares problem to denoise a sum of complex exponentials with unknown waveform modulations. We quantify how the mean square error depends on the noise variance and the true signal parameters. Numerical experiments are also implemented to illustrate the theoretical result.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore the potential of server waiting before packet transmission in improving the Age of Information (AoI) in status update systems. We consider a non-preemptive queue with Poisson arrivals and independent general service distribution and we incorporate waiting before serving in two packet management schemes: M/GI/1/1 and M/GI/1/2*. In M/GI/1/1 there is no data buffer and a packet is taken to server only when it is idle whereas in M/GI/1/2* there is a single unit buffer that captures the latest arriving status update packet. In both schemes, we introduce “server waiting”: In M/GI/1/1 scheme, the server waits for a deterministic time immediately after a packet enters the server. In M/GI/1/2* scheme, depending on queue state, the server waits for a deterministic time before starting service. In both cases, if a newer arrival is captured, existing packet is discarded with no reset of the waiting period. Different from most existing works, we analyze AoI evolution by indexing the incoming packets, which is enabled by an alternative method of partitioning the area under the evolution of instantaneous AoI to calculate its time average. We obtain expressions for average AoI and average peak AoI for both queueing disciplines with waiting. Our numerical results demonstrate that waiting before service can bring significant improvement in average age, particularly, for heavy-tailed service distributions. This improvement comes at the expense of an increase in average peak AoI. We highlight the trade-off between average and average peak AoI generated by waiting before serving.},

  abstract     = {Consider a stream of status updates generated by a source, where each update is of one of two types: high priority or ordinary (low priority). These updates are to be transmitted through a network to a monitor. However, the transmission policy of each packet depends on the type of stream it belongs to. For the low priority stream, we analyze and compare the performances of two transmission schemes: (i) Ordinary updates are served in a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) fashion, whereas, in (ii), the ordinary updates are transmitted according to an M/G/1/1 with preemption policy. In both schemes, high priority updates are transmitted according to an M/G/1/1 with preemption policy and receive preferential treatment. An arriving priority update discards and replaces any currently-in-service high priority update, and preempts (with eventual resume for scheme (i)) any ordinary update. We model the arrival processes of the two kinds of updates, in both schemes, as independent Poisson processes. For scheme (i), we find the arrival and service rates under which the system is stable and give closed-form expressions for average peak age and a lower bound on the average age of the ordinary stream. For scheme (ii), we derive closed-form expressions for the average age and average peak age of the high priority and low priority streams. We finally show that, if the service time is exponentially distributed, the M/M/1/1 with preemption policy leads to an average age of the low priority stream higher than the one achieved using the FCFS scheme. Therefore, the M/M//1/1 with preemption policy, when applied on the low priority stream of updates and in the presence of a higher priority scheme, is not anymore the optimal transmission policy from an age point of view.},

  abstract     = {Significant progress has been made recently in Generalized Degrees of Freedom (GDoF) characterizations of wireless interference channels (IC) and broadcast channels (BC) under the assumption of finite precision channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT), especially for smaller or highly symmetric network settings. A critical barrier in extending these results to larger and asymmetric networks is the inherent combinatorial complexity of such networks. Motivated by other fields such as extremal combinatorics and extremal graph theory, we explore the possibility of an extremal network theory, i.e., a study of extremal networks within particular regimes of interest. As our test application, we study the GDoF benefits of transmitter cooperation in a K user IC over the simple scheme of power control and treating interference as Gaussian noise (TIN) for three regimes of interest - a TIN regime identified by Geng et al. where TIN was shown to be GDoF optimal for the K user interference channel, a CTIN regime identified by Vi and Caire where the GDoF region achievable by TIN is convex without time-sharing, and an SLS regime identified by Davoodi and Jafar where a simple layered superposition (SLS) scheme is shown to be optimal in the K user MISO BC, albeit only for K ≤ 3. The SLS regime includes the CTIN regime, and the CTIN regime includes the TIN regime. As our first result, we show that under finite precision CSIT, TIN is GDoF optimal for the K user IC throughout the CTIN regime. Furthermore, under finite precision CSIT, appealing to extremal network theory we obtain the following results. In the TIN regime as well as the CTIN regime, we show that the extremal GDoF gain from transmitter cooperation over TIN is bounded regardless of the number of users. In fact, the gain is exactly a factor of 3/2 in the TIN regime, and 2 - 1/K in the CTIN regime, for arbitrary number of users K &gt; 1. However, in the SLS regime, the gain is ⊖(log 2 (K)), i.e., it scales logarithmically with the number of users.},

In this paper, we analyze the convergence rate of the error of KSG estimator for smooth distributions, whose support of density can be both bounded and unbounded.

We study the noisy version of this problem, where the outcome of each standard noiseless group test is subject to independent noise, corresponding to passing the noiseless result through a binary channel. We introduce a class of algorithms that we refer to as Near-Definite Defectives (NDD), and study bounds on the required number of tests for asymptotically vanishing error probability under Bernoulli random test designs. In addition, we study algorithm-independent converse results, giving lower bounds on the required number of tests under Bernoulli test designs. Under reverse Z-channel noise, the achievable rates and converse results match in a broad range of sparsity regimes, and under Z-channel noise, the two match in a narrower range of dense/low-noise regimes. We observe that although these two channels have the same Shannon capacity when viewed as a communication channel, they can behave quite differently when it comes to group testing. Finally, we extend our analysis of these noise models to a general binary noise model (including symmetric noise), and show improvements over known existing bounds in broad scaling regimes.},

To be really useful, noisy channels have to be considered in the scenario where a cheating party has some degree of control over the channel characteristics. Damgård et al. (EUROCRYPT 1999) proposed a more realistic model where such level of control is permitted to an adversary, the so called unfair noisy channels, and proved that they can be used to obtain commitment and oblivious transfer protocols. Given that noisy channels are a precious resource for cryptographic purposes, one important question is determining the optimal rate in which they can be used. The commitment capacity has already been determined for the cases of discrete memoryless channels and Gaussian channels. In this work we address the problem of determining the commitment capacity of unfair noisy channels. We compute a single-letter characterization of the commitment capacity of unfair noisy channels. In the case where an adversary has no control over the channel (the fair case) our capacity reduces to the well-known capacity of a discrete memoryless binary symmetric channel.},

This study proposes the logarithmic pyramid vector quantizer (LPVQ), which is a gain-shape vector quantizer specifically designed for the quantization of Laplace distributed memoryless sources. The objective of the study is a theoretical analysis of the LPVQ: We determine the distortion of the shape quantizer with respect to rate and vector dimension for the quantization of an i.i.d. Laplace source. Furthermore, we derive formulas for the quantization signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the shape quantizer and the quantization SNR of the LPVQ, giving reliable results for an effective bit rate per vector coordinate of 2bits and higher. We study the SNR-behavior of the LPVQ for infinite dimensions and compare it with the maximal achievable SNR according to the rate-distortion bound. After having proposed a strategy for the allocation of the bit rate for the gain quantization and the quantization of the shape vector, respectively, we verify the derived formulas by simulations.},

  abstract     = {A transmitter observing a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables seeks to keep a receiver updated about its latest observations. The receiver need not be apprised about each symbol seen by the transmitter, but needs to output a symbol at each time instant t. If at time t the receiver outputs the symbol seen by the transmitter at time U (t) ≤ t, the age of information at the receiver at time t is t - U(t). We study the design of lossless source codes that enable transmission with minimum average age at the receiver. We show that the asymptotic minimum average age can be attained up to a constant gap by the Shannon codes for a tilted version of the original pmf generating the symbols, which can be computed easily by solving an optimization problem. Furthermore, we exhibit an example with alphabet X where age of a factor O(√(log |X|)) more than that achieved by our Shannon codes for the original pmf incur an asymptotic average codes. Underlying our prescription for optimal codes is a new variational formula for integer moments of random variables, which may be of independent interest. Also, we discuss possible extensions of our formulation to randomized schemes and to the erasure channel, and include a treatment of the related problem of source coding for minimum average queuing delay.},

Yi et al. (2019) introduced 3-plex codes which are 2-erasure codes (2-erasure tolerant array codes) derived from 3-plexes. In this paper, we generalize 3-plex codes to k-plex codes. We introduce the notion of a “strong” k-plex which implies the derived k-plex code is 2-erasure tolerant. Moreover, k-plex codes derived from strong k-plexes have a straightforward algorithm for reconstruction. These general k-plex codes offer greater flexibility when choosing a suitable code for a storage system, enabling the operator to better optimize the unavoidable trade-offs involved. Blackburn asked for the maximum number of entries in an n × n partial Latin square on n symbols in which if distinct cells (i, j) and (i&#39;, j&#39;) contain the same symbol, then the cells (i&#39;, j) and (i, j&#39;) are empty. A “strong” k-plex satisfies the Blackburn property (along with two other properties related to erasure coding). We investigate the necessary conditions for the existence of Blackburn k-plexes (and hence necessary conditions for the existence of strong k-plexes). We show that any Blackburn k-plex has order n ≥ [(√2 + 1)k - 2]. We describe how to construct strong k-plexes of order n when k ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5} for all possible orders n, and we give a simple construction of strong k-plexes of order k 2 for k ≥ 2.},

A standard approach to constructing t-designs is the use of linear codes with certain regularity. The Assmus-Mattson Theorem and the automorphism groups are two ways for proving that a code has sufficient regularity for supporting t-designs. However, some linear codes hold t-designs, although they do not satisfy the conditions in the Assmus-Mattson Theorem and do not admit a t-transitive or t-homogeneous group as a subgroup of their automorphisms. The major objective of this paper is to develop a theory for explaining such codes and obtaining such new codes and hence new t-designs. To this end, a general theory for punctured and shortened codes of linear codes supporting t-designs is established, a generalized Assmus-Mattson theorem is developed, and a link between 2-designs and differentially δ-uniform functions and 2-designs is built. With these general results, binary codes with new parameters and explicit weight distributions are obtained, new 2-designs and Steiner system S(2, 4, 2 n ) are produced in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Gabidulin codes are the first general construction of linear codes that are maximum rank distant (MRD). They have found applications in linear network coding, for example, when the transmitter and receiver are oblivious to the inner workings and topology of the network (the so-called incoherent regime). The reason is that Gabidulin codes can be used to map information to linear subspaces, which in the absence of errors cannot be altered by linear operations, and in the presence of errors can be corrected if the subspace is perturbed by a small rank. Furthermore, in distributed coding and distributed systems, one is led to the design of error correcting codes whose generator matrix must satisfy a given support constraint. In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the support of the generator matrix that guarantees the existence of Gabidulin codes and general MRD codes. When the rate of the code is not very high, this is achieved with the same field size necessary for Gabidulin codes with no support constraint. When these conditions are not satisfied, we characterize the largest possible rank distance under the support constraints and show that they can be achieved by subcodes of Gabidulin codes. The necessary and sufficient conditions are identical to those that appear for MDS codes which were recently proven by Yildiz et al. and Lovett in the context of settling the GM-MDS conjecture.},

  abstract     = {Data shuffling of training data among different computing nodes (workers) has been identified as a core element to improve the statistical performance of modern large-scale machine learning algorithms. Data shuffling is often considered as one of the most significant bottlenecks in such systems due to the heavy communication load. Under a master-worker architecture (where a master has access to the entire dataset and only communication between the master and the workers is allowed) coding has been recently proved to considerably reduce the communication load. This work considers a different communication paradigm referred to as decentralized data shuffling, where workers are allowed to communicate with one another via a shared link. The decentralized data shuffling problem has two phases: workers communicate with each other during the data shuffling phase, and then workers update their stored content during the storage phase. The main challenge is to derive novel converse bounds and achievable schemes for decentralized data shuffling by considering the asymmetry of the workers&#39; storages (i.e., workers are constrained to store different files in their storages based on the problem setting), in order to characterize the fundamental limits of this problem. For the case of uncoded storage (i.e., each worker directly stores a subset of bits of the dataset), this paper proposes converse and achievable bounds (based on distributed interference alignment and distributed clique-covering strategies) that are within a factor of 3/2 of one another. The proposed schemes are also exactly optimal under the constraint of uncoded storage for either large storage size or at most four workers in the system.},

Graph based replication is a simple technique, which is prevalent in both theory and practice, for achieving robustness in storage systems. In this technique each file is replicated on two or more storage servers, giving rise to a (hyper-)graph structure. In this paper we study private information retrieval protocols in graph based replication systems. The main interest of this work is understanding the collusion structures which emerge in the underlying graph. Our main contribution is a 2-replication scheme which guarantees perfect privacy from acyclic sets in the graph, and guarantees partial-privacy in the presence of cycles. Furthermore, by providing an upper bound, it is shown that the PIR rate of this scheme is at most a factor of two from its optimal value for regular graphs. Lastly, we extend our results to larger replication factors and to graph-based coding, a generalization of graph based replication that induces smaller storage overhead and larger PIR rate in many cases.},

  abstract     = {Line codes make it possible to mitigate interference, to prevent short pulses, and to generate streams of bipolar signals with no direct-current (DC) power content through balancing. They find application in magnetic recording (MR) devices, in Flash devices, in optical recording devices, and in some computer standards. This paper introduces a new family of fixed-length, binary constrained codes, named lexicographically-ordered constrained codes (LOCO codes), for bipolar non-return-to-zero signaling. LOCO codes are capacity-achieving, the lexicographic indexing enables simple, practical encoding and decoding, and this simplicity is demonstrated through analysis of circuit complexity. LOCO codes are easy to balance, and their inherent symmetry minimizes the rate loss with respect to unbalanced codes having the same constraints. Furthermore, LOCO codes that forbid certain patterns can be used to alleviate inter-symbol interference in MR systems and inter-cell interference in Flash systems. Numerical results demonstrate a gain of up to 10\% in rate achieved by LOCO codes with respect to other practical constrained codes, including run-length-limited codes, designed for the same purpose. Simulation results suggest that it is possible to achieve a channel density gain of about 20\% in MR systems by using a LOCO code to encode only the parity bits, limiting the rate loss, of a low-density parity-check code before writing.},

  abstract     = {Let m be an arbitrary positive integer and D 8m be the dihedral group of order 8m, i.e., D 8m = (x, y | x 4m = 1, y 2 = 1, yxy = x -1 ). Left ideals of the dihedral group algebra F 2 [D 8m ] are called binary left dihedral codes of length 8m, and abbreviated as binary left D 8m -codes. In this paper, we give an explicit representation and enumeration for all distinct self-dual binary left D 8m -codes. These codes make up an important class of self-dual binary [8m, 4m]-codes such that the dihedral group D 8m is necessarily a subgroup of the automorphism group of each code. In particular, we provide recursive algorithms to solve congruence equations over finite chain rings for constructing all distinct self-dual binary left D 8m -codes and obtain a Mass formula to count the number of all these self-dual codes. As a preliminary application, we obtain the extremal self-dual binary [48, 24, 12]-code and an extremal self-dual binary [56, 28, 12]code from self-dual binary left D 48 -codes and left D 56 -codes respectively.},

For certain values of m, such codes C Ω (D, mT) have better minimum distance compared with true values of 1-point Hermitian codes.

Since correlations cannot be generated locally, we take any real function of a multipartite state which cannot increase under local operations to measure a correlation. Correlation measures that can be expressed as an optimization of a linear combination of entropies are particularly useful, since they can often be interpreted operationally. We systematically study such optimized linear entropic functions, and by enforcing monotonicity under local processing we identify four cones of correlation measures for bipartite quantum states. This yields two new optimized measures of bipartite quantum correlation that are particularly simple, which have the additional property of being additive.},

Holevo&#39;s bound places a hard upper limit on such encodings, while the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland (HSW) theorem addresses the question of how many classical messages can be “packed” into a given quantum system. In this article, we use Sen&#39;s recent quantum joint typicality results to prove a one-shot multiparty quantum packing lemma generalizing the HSW theorem. The lemma is designed to be easily applicable in many network communication scenarios. As an illustration, we use it to straightforwardly obtain quantum generalizations of well-known classical coding schemes for the relay channel: multihop, coherent multihop, decode-forward, and partial decode-forward. We provide both finite blocklength and asymptotic results, the latter matching existing classical formulas. Given the key role of the classical packing lemma in network information theory, our packing lemma should help open the field to direct quantum generalization.},

In this paper, using quantum mass functions, we discuss the realization of measurements in terms of unitary interactions and marginalizations. It follows that classical measurement results strictly belong to local models, i.e., marginals of more detailed models. Classical variables that are created by marginalization do not exist in the unmarginalized model, and different marginalizations may yield incompatible classical variables. These observations are illustrated by the Frauchiger-Renner paradox, which is analyzed (and resolved) in terms of quantum mass functions. Throughout, the paper uses factor graphs to represent quantum systems/models with multiple measurements at different points in time.},

While the original expression, derived from the method of types (the Csiszár-style expression) involves minimization over probability distributions defined on the channel input-output alphabets, the new Lagrange-dual formula involves optimization of five parameters, independently of the alphabet sizes. For both stochastic and deterministic mismatched decoding (including maximum likelihood decoding as a special case), we provide a rather comprehensive discussion on the insight behind the various ingredients of this formula and describe how its behavior varies as the coding rate exhausts the relevant range. Among other things, it is demonstrated that this expression simultaneously generalizes both the expurgated error exponent function (at zero rate) and the classical random coding exponent function at high rates, where it also meets the sphere-packing bound.},

The rate of a computation broadcast scheme is defined as the ratio H(W 1 , W 2 )/H(S), where S is the information broadcast to both users to simultaneously satisfy their demands. The supremum of achievable rates is called the capacity of computation broadcast C CB . It is shown that C CB ≤ H(W 1 , W 2 )/[H(W 1 |W 1 &#39;)+H(W 2 |W 2 &#39;)- min (I(W 1 ; W 2 , W 2 &#39;|W 1 &#39;), I(W 2 ; W 1 , W 1 &#39;|W 2 &#39;))] . For the linear computation broadcast problem, where W 1 , W 1 &#39;, W 2 , W 2 &#39; are comprised of arbitrary linear combinations of a basis set of independent symbols, the bound is shown to be tight. For non-linear computation broadcast, it is shown that this bound is not tight in general. Examples are provided to prove that different instances of computation broadcast that have the same entropic structure, i.e., the same entropy for all subsets of {W 1 , W 1 &#39;, W 2 , W 2 &#39;}, can have different capacities. Thus, extra-entropic structure matters even for two-user computation broadcast. The significance of extra-entropic structure is further explored through a class of non-linear computation broadcast problems where the extremal values of capacity are shown to correspond to minimally and maximally structured problems within that class.},

The class of common information problems involves determining the minimum rate of the common input to two independent processors needed to exactly or approximately generate a target joint distribution. For the exact common information problem, exact generation of the target distribution is required, while for Wyner&#39;s and α-Rényi common informations, the relative entropy and Rényi divergence with order α were respectively used to quantify the discrepancy between the synthesized and target distributions. The exact common information is larger than or equal to Wyner&#39;s common information. However, it was hitherto unknown whether the former is strictly larger than the latter for some joint distributions. In this paper, we first establish the equivalence between the exact and ∞-Rényi common informations, and then provide single-letter upper and lower bounds for these two quantities. For doubly symmetric binary sources, we show that the upper and lower bounds coincide, which implies that for such sources, the exact and ∞-Rényi common informations are completely characterized. Interestingly, we observe that for such sources, these two common informations are strictly larger than Wyner&#39;s. This answers an open problem posed by KLE. Furthermore, we extend Wyner&#39;s, ∞-Rényi, and exact common informations to sources with countably infinite or continuous alphabets, including Gaussian sources.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, capacity bounds for the two-user interference channels with cooperative receivers via conferencing links of finite capacities are investigated. Capacity results known for these communication scenarios are limited to a very few special cases of the one-sided channels. One of the challenges in obtaining capacity limits of such cooperative networks is how to establish efficient capacity outer bounds for them. In this paper, by applying new techniques, novel capacity outer bounds are established for the interference channels with conferencing receivers. Using the outer bounds, several new capacity results are proved for interesting channels with unidirectional cooperation in strong and mixed interference regimes. A conferencing link (between receivers) may be utilized to provide a receiver with “information about its desired signal” or “information about its interfering signal”. It is demonstrated that both strategies can be helpful to achieve capacity. Finally, for the case of Gaussian interference channel with conferencing receivers, it is argued that our outer bound is strictly tighter than the previous one derived by Wang and Tse.},

  abstract     = {In their seminal 1996 paper, Anantharam and Verdú showed that feedback does not increase the capacity of a queue under First-in-First-Out service policy and exponentially distributed service time. Since the channel has memory, this negative result raises the question whether it extends to other non-trivial combinations of service policy and service time. This paper addresses this question by providing two sufficient conditions under which feedback either increases capacity or does not increase capacity. The first is a sufficient condition on the service time distribution for feedback to increase capacity under First-In-First-Out service policy. The second is a sufficient condition for feedback not to increase capacity and is general in that it depends on the output distribution of the queue, but explicitly depends neither on the queue policy nor on the service time distribution. This condition is satisfied, for instance, by queues with Last-Come-First-Serve service policy and bounded service times.},

As in the classical rate-splitting multiple access scheme by Grant, Urbanke, and Whiting, the proposed coding scheme uses superposition of multiple codewords with successive cancellation decoding, which can be implemented using standard point-to-point encoders and decoders. Unlike rate-splitting multiple access, which is not rate-optimal for multiple receivers, the proposed coding scheme transmits codewords over multiple blocks in a staggered manner and recovers them successively over sliding decoding windows, achieving the single-stream optimal rate region as well as the more general Han–Kobayashi inner bound for the two-user interference channel. The feasibility of this scheme in practice is verified by implementing it using commercial channel codes over the two-user Gaussian interference channel.},

Recent studies indicate that TV minimization exhibits a phase transition behavior from failure to success as the number of measurements increases. In fact, in large dimensions, TV minimization succeeds in recovering the gradient-sparse signal with high probability when the number of measurements exceeds a certain threshold; otherwise, it fails almost certainly. Obtaining a closed-form expression that approximates this threshold is a major challenge in this field and has not been appropriately addressed yet. In this work, we derive a tight lower-bound on this threshold in case of any random measurement matrix whose null space is distributed uniformly with respect to the Haar measure. In contrast to the conventional TV phase transition results that depend on the simple gradient-sparsity level, our bound is highly affected by generalized notions of gradient-sparsity. Our proposed bound is very close to the true phase transition of TV minimization confirmed by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {The problem of recovering a pair of signals from their blind phaseless short-time Fourier transform measurements arises in several important phase retrieval applications, including ptychography and ultra-short pulse characterization. In this paper, we prove that in order to determine a pair of generic signals uniquely, up to trivial ambiguities, the number of phaseless measurements one needs to collect is, at most, five times the number of parameters required to describe the signals. This result improves significantly upon previous papers, which required the number of measurements to be quadratic in the number of parameters rather than linear. In addition, we consider the simpler problem of recovering a pair of generic signals from their blind short-time Fourier transform, when the phases are known. In this setting, which can be understood as a special case of the blind deconvolution problem, we show that the number of measurements required to determine the two signals, up to trivial ambiguities, equals exactly the number of parameters to be recovered. As a side result, we study the classical phase retrieval problem-that is, recovering a signal from its Fourier magnitudes-when some entries of the signal are known a priori. We derive a bound on the number of required measurements as a function of the size of the set of known entries. Specifically, we show that if most of the signal&#39;s entries are known, then only a few Fourier magnitudes are necessary to determine a signal uniquely.},

Convex dominance allows us to compare the unconditional mean square error between two optimal Bayesian state estimators over arbitrary time horizons instead of using brute force Monte-Carlo computations. The proof uses two key ideas from microeconomics, namely, integral precision dominance and aggregation of single crossing. The convex dominance result is then used to give sufficient conditions so that the optimal policy of a controlled sensing two-state partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) is lower bounded by a myopic policy. Numerical examples are presented where the Shannon capacity of the observation distribution using one sensor dominates that of another, and convex dominance holds but Blackwell dominance does not hold.

The master node has access to a database of files. In every shuffling iteration, each worker node processes a new subset of files, and has excess storage to partially cache the remaining files, assuming the cached files are uncoded. The caches of the worker nodes are updated every iteration, and they should be designed to satisfy any possible unknown permutation of the files in subsequent iterations. For this problem, we characterize the exact load-memory trade-off for worst-case shuffling by deriving the minimum communication load for a given storage capacity per worker node. As a byproduct, the exact load-memory trade-off for any shuffling is characterized when the number of files is equal to the number of worker nodes. We propose a novel deterministic coded shuffling scheme, which improves the state of the art, by exploiting the cache memories to create coded functions that can be decoded by several worker nodes. Then, we prove the optimality of our proposed scheme by deriving a matching lower bound and showing that the placement phase of the proposed coded shuffling scheme is optimal over all shuffles.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by applications in social and biological network analysis we introduce a new form of agnostic clustering termed motif correlation clustering, which aims to minimize the cost of clustering errors associated with both edges and higher-order network structures. The problem may be succinctly described as follows: Given a complete graph $G$ , partition the vertices of the graph so that certain predetermined “important” subgraphs mostly lie within the same cluster, while “less relevant” subgraphs are allowed to lie across clusters. Our contributions are as follows: We first introduce several variants of motif correlation clustering and then show that these clustering problems are NP-hard. We then proceed to describe polynomial-time clustering algorithms that provide constant approximation guarantees for the problems at hand. Despite following the frequently used LP relaxation and rounding procedure, the algorithms involve a sophisticated and carefully designed neighborhood growing step that combines information about both edges and motifs. We conclude with several examples illustrating the performance of the developed algorithms on synthetic and real networks.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the capacity scaling of multicell massive MIMO systems in the presence of spatially correlated fading. In particular, we focus on the strong spatial correlation regimes where the covariance matrix of each user channel vector has a rank that scales sublinearly with the number of base station antennas, as the latter grows to infinity. We also consider the case where the covariance eigenvectors corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalues span randomly selected subspaces. For this channel model, referred to as the “random sparse angular support” model, we characterize the asymptotic capacity scaling law in the limit of large number of antennas. To achieve the asymptotic capacity results, statistical spatial despreading based on the second-order channel statistics plays a pivotal role in terms of pilot decontamination and interference suppression. A remarkable result is that even when the number of users scales linearly with base station antennas, a linear growth of the capacity with respect to the number of antennas is achievable under the sparse angular support model. We also note that the achievable rate lower bound based on massive MIMO “channel hardening”, widely used in the massive MIMO literature, yields rather loose results in the strong spatial correlation regimes and may significantly underestimate the achievable rate of massive MIMO. This work therefore considers an alternative bounding technique which is better suited to the strong correlation regimes. In fading channels with sparse angular support, it is further shown that spatial despreading (spreading) in uplink (downlink) has a more prominent impact on the performance of massive MIMO than channel hardening.},

This approach is motivated in part by the necessity of using coded modulation in practical systems, and in part by the potential of discrete distributions for interference alignment as well as the importance demonstrated by Dytso et al. of discrete input distributions for transmission over the 2 × 2 interference channel when treating interference as noise. The contribution of this work includes the establishment of achievable rates subject to discrete modulations. In the process, new bounds involving the minimum distance of the sum of discrete modulations have been developed that are useful for facilitating further work in this area. These bounds are then used for finding achievable rates for 3 × 3 interference channels. It is also shown that interference alignment can be efficiently employed with discrete modulations at finite SNR even with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter.},

This work proposes a new network coding scheme with the following features: (i) its achievable rate region is identical to the capacity region for all the scenarios in which the capacity is known; (ii) its achievable rate region is much more tractable and has been used to derive new capacity rate vectors; (iii) it employs sequential encoding that naturally handles dynamic packet arrivals; (iv) it automatically adapts to unknown packet arrival rates R → ; (v) it is based on GF(q) with q ≥ K.

This result has been obtained under a restriction to pure strategies without time-sharing, and it was extended to the case where the rates, but not the transmit powers, may be averaged over several transmit strategies. In this paper, we drop such restrictions and discuss the most general case of coded time-sharing, where both the rates and the powers may be averaged. Since coded time-sharing can in general not be expressed by means of a convex hull of the rate region, we have to account for the possibility of time-sharing already during the optimization of the transmit strategy. By means of a novel channel enhancement argument, we prove a surprising result: proper signals are optimal if coded time-sharing is allowed. In addition to establishing this result, we present an algorithm to compute the corresponding achievable rate region.},

Our technique uses semidefinite programming and a recent improvement of the entropy accumulation theorem. To support the work and facilitate its use, we provide code that can generate lower bounds on the amount of randomness that can be output based on the measured quantities in the protocol. As an application, we give a protocol that robustly generates up to two bits of randomness per entangled qubit pair, which is twice that established in existing analyses of the spot-checking CHSH protocol in the low noise regime.},

  abstract     = {Instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation refers to a process in which spacelike separated parties simulate a nonlocal quantum operation on their joint systems through the consumption of pre-shared entanglement. To prevent a violation of causality, this simulation succeeds up to local errors that can only be corrected after the parties communicate classically with one another. However, this communication is non-interactive, and it involves just the broadcasting of local measurement outcomes. We refer to this operational paradigm as local operations and broadcast communication (LOBC) to distinguish it from the standard local operations and (interactive) classical communication (LOCC). In this paper, we show that an arbitrary two-qubit gate can be implemented by LOBC with ϵ-error using O(log(1/ϵ)) entangled bits (ebits). This offers an exponential improvement over the best known two-qubit protocols, whose ebit costs behave as O(1/ϵ). We also consider the family of binary controlled gates on dimensions d A ⊗ d B . We find that any hermitian gate of this form can be implemented by LOBC using a single shared ebit. In sharp contrast, a lower bound of log dB ebits is shown in the case of generic (i.e. non-hermitian) gates from this family, even when d A = 2. This demonstrates an unbounded gap between the entanglement costs of LOCC and LOBC gate implementation. Whereas previous lower bounds on the entanglement cost for instantaneous nonlocal computation restrict the minimum dimension of the needed entanglement, we bound its entanglement entropy. To our knowledge this is the first such lower bound of its kind.},

One common physical system comprises of quantum harmonic oscillators, and constant-excitation quantum codes can be naturally stabilized within them.

We define the finite-state guessing exponent as the asymptotic normalized logarithm of the minimum achievable moment of the number of randomized guesses, generated by any finite-state machine, until xn is guessed successfully. We show that the finite-state guessing exponent of any sequence is intimately related to its finite-state compressibility (due to Lempel and Ziv), and it is asymptotically achieved by the decoder of (a certain modified version of) the 1978 Lempel-Ziv data compression algorithm (a.k.a. the LZ78 algorithm), fed by purely random bits. The results are also extended to the case where the guessing machine has access to a side information sequence, y n = (y 1 , . .. , y n ), which is also an individual sequence.},

Dodis and Wichs (STOC 2009) showed the existence of (k, ε)-non-malleable extractors with seed length d = log(n - k - 1) + 2 log(1/ε) + 6 that support sources of min-entropy k &gt; log(d) + 2 log(1/ε) + 8. We show that the foregoing bound is essentially tight, by proving that any (k, ε)-non-malleable extractor must satisfy the min-entropy bound k &gt; log(d) + 2 log(1/ε) - log log(1/ε) - C for an absolute constant C. In particular, this implies that non-malleable extractors require min-entropy at least Ω(loglog(n)). This is in stark contrast to the existence of strong seeded extractors that support sources of min-entropy k = O(log(1/ε)). Our techniques strongly rely on coding theory. In particular, we reveal an inherent connection between non-malleable extractors and error correcting codes, by proving a new lemma which shows that any (k, ε)-non-malleable extractor with seed length d induces a code C ⊆ {0,1} 2k with relative distance 1/2 - 2ε and rate d-1/2k .},

  abstract     = {We study the setting of channel coding over a family of channels whose state is controlled by an adversarial jammer by viewing it as a zero-sum game between a finite blocklength encoder-decoder team, and the jammer. The encoder-decoder team choose stochastic encoding and decoding strategies to minimize the average probability of error in transmission, while the jammer chooses a distribution on the state-space to maximize this probability. The min-max value of the game is equivalent to channel coding for a compound channel - we call this the Shannon solution of the problem. The max-min value corresponds to finding a mixed channel with the largest value of the minimum achievable probability of error. When the min-max and max-min values are equal, the problem is said to admit a saddle-point or von Neumann solution. While a Shannon solution always exists, the communicating team&#39;s problem is nonconvex for finite blocklengths, whereby a von Neumann solution may not exist. Despite this, we show that the min-max and max-min values become equal asymptotically in the large blocklength limit, for all but finitely many rates. We explicitly characterize this limiting value as a function of the rate and obtain tight finite blocklength bounds on the min-max and max-min value. As a corollary we get an explicit expression for the ε -capacity of a compound channel under stochastic codes - the first such result, to the best of our knowledge. Our results demonstrate a deeper relation between the compound channel and mixed channel than was previously known. They also show that the conventional information-theoretic viewpoint, articulated via the Shannon solution, coincides asymptotically with the game-theoretic one articulated via the von Neumann solution. Key to our results is the derivation of new finite blocklength upper bounds on the min-max value of the game via a novel achievability scheme, and lower bounds on the max-min value obtained via the linear programming relaxation based approach we introduced in [2].},

For this setting, we identify a regime where the simple scheme of using Gaussian wiretap codebook at each transmitter (without cooperative jamming) and treating interference as noise at each intended receiver (in short, GWC-TIN scheme) achieves the optimal secure sum capacity to within a constant gap. For the symmetric case, this simple scheme is optimal when the interference-to-signal ratio (all link strengths in decibel scale) is no more than 2/3. However, when the ratio is more than 2/3, we show that this simple scheme is not optimal anymore and a scheme with cooperative jamming is proposed to achieve the optimal secure sum generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF). Specifically, for the symmetric case, we complete the optimal secure sum GDoF characterization for all the interference regimes, for almost all channel gains (except for a set of channel gains of measure zero).},

This problem generalizes an existing approximate version, in which the generated joint distribution is required to be close to a target distribution under the total variation (TV) distance measure (instead being exactly equal to the target distribution). We provide single-letter inner and outer bounds on the admissible region of the shared randomness rate and the communication rate for the exact channel synthesis problem. These two bounds coincide for doubly symmetric binary sources. We observe that for such sources, the admissible rate region for exact channel synthesis is strictly included in that for the TV-approximate version. We also extend the exact and TV-approximate channel synthesis problems to sources with countably infinite alphabets and continuous sources; the latter includes Gaussian sources.

The proposed causal measure is a random sequence, a realization of which enables identification of specific patterns that give rise to high levels of causal influence. We show that these patterns cannot be identified by existing measures such as directed information (DI). We demonstrate how sequential prediction theory may be leveraged to estimate the proposed causal measure and introduce a notion of regret for assessing the performance of such estimators. We prove a finite sample bound on this regret that is determined by the worst case regret of the sequential predictors used in the estimator. Justification for the proposed measure is provided through a series of examples, simulations, and application to stock market data. Within the context of estimating DI, we show that, because joint Markovicity of a pair of processes does not imply the marginal Markovicity of individual processes, commonly used plug-in estimators of DI will be biased for a large subset of jointly Markov processes. We introduce a notion of DI with “stale history”, which can be combined with a plug-in estimator to upper and lower bound the DI when marginal Markovicity does not hold.},

  abstract     = {In combinatorial group testing, the primary objective is to fully identify the set of at most d defective items from a pool of n items using as few tests as possible. The celebrated result for the combinatorial group testing problem is that the number of tests, denoted by t, can be made logarithmic in n when d = O(poly(log n)). However, state-of-the-art group testing codes require the items to be tested w = Ω (d log n)/[(q log d+log log n)] times and tests to include p = Ω (n/(d log d n)) items. In many emerging applications, items can only participate in a limited number of tests and tests are constrained to include a limited number of items. In this paper, we study the “sparse” regime for the group testing problem where we restrict the number of tests each item can participate in by w max or the number of items each test can include by p max in both noiseless and noisy settings. These constraints lead to a largely unexplored regime where t is a fractional power of n, rather than logarithmic in n as in the classical setting. Our results characterize the number of tests t needed in this regime as a function of wmax or pmax and show, for example, that t decreases drastically when wmax is increased beyond a bare minimum. In particular, in the noiseless case it can be shown that if w max ≤ d, then we must have t = n, i.e., testing every item individually is optimal. We show that if w max = d+1, the number of tests decreases suddenly from t = n to t = Θ(d√n). The order-optimal construction is obtained via a modification of the classical Kautz-Singleton construction, which is known to be suboptimal for the classical group testing problem. For the more general case, when w max = ld + 1 for integer l &gt; 1, the modified Kautz-Singleton construction requires t = Θ(dn 1/(l+1) ) tests, which we prove to be near order-optimal. We also show that our constructions have a favorable encoding and decoding complexity, i.e. they can be decoded in (poly(d) + O(t))-time and each entry in any codeword can be computed in poly(log n) memory space. We finally discuss an application of our results to the construction of energy-limited random access schemes for Internet of Things networks, which provided the initial motivation for our work.},

The source transmits a sequence of messages (streaming messages) to the destination through the relay between them, where the first-hop channel from the source to the relay and the second-hop channel from the relay to the destination are subject to packet erasures. Every source message generated at a time slot must be recovered perfectly at the destination within the subsequent T time slots. In any sliding window of $ {T}+1$ time slots, we assume no more than $ {N}_{1}$ and ${N}_{2}$ erasures are introduced by the first-hop channel and second-hop channel respectively. We fully characterize the maximum achievable rate in terms of T, $ {N}_{1}$ and $ {N}_{2}$ . The achievability is proved by using a symbol-wise decode-forward strategy where the source symbols within the same message are decoded by the relay with different delays. The converse is proved by analyzing the maximum achievable rate for each channel when the erasures in the other channel are consecutive (bursty). In addition, we show that traditional message-wise decode-forward strategies, which require the source symbols within the same message to be decoded by the relay with the same delay, are sub-optimal in general.},

Two well-known measures of multivariate information-total correlation and dual total correlation-admit a spectrum of measures with varying sensitivity to intermediate orders of dependence. Unfortunately, these intermediate measures have not received much attention due to their opaque representation of information. Here we draw on results from matroid theory to show that these measures are closely related to error-correcting codes. This connection allows us to derive the class of global maximizers for each measure, which coincide with maximum distance separable codes of order k. In addition to deepening the understanding of these measures and multivariate information more generally, we use these results to show that previously proposed bounds on information geometric quantities are met with equality for the global min and max.},

  abstract     = {Write-once memory (WOM) is a storage device consisting of binary cells that can only increase their levels. A t-write WOM code is a coding scheme that makes it possible to write t times to a WOM without decreasing the levels of any of the cells. The sum-rate of a WOM code is the ratio between the total number of bits written to the memory during the t writes and the number of cells. It is known that the maximum possible sum-rate of a t-write WOM code is log(t + 1). This is also an achievable upper bound, both by information-theoretic arguments and through explicit constructions. While existing constructions of WOM codes are targeted at the sum-rate, we consider here two more figures of merit. The first one is the complexity of the encoding and decoding maps. The second figure of merit is the convergence rate, defined as the minimum code length n(δ) required to reach a point that is δ-close to the capacity region. One of our main results in this paper is a capacity-achieving construction of two-write WOM codes which has polynomial encoding/decoding complexity while the block length n(δ) required to be δ-close to capacity is significantly smaller than existing constructions. Using these two-write WOM codes, we then obtain three-write WOM codes that approach a sum-rate of 1.809 at relatively short block lengths. We also provide several explicit constructions of finite length three-write WOM codes; in particular, we achieve a sum-rate of 1.716 by using only 93 cells. Finally, we modify our two-write WOM codes to construct ε-error WOM codes of high rates and small probability of failure.},

  abstract     = {DNA as a data storage medium has several advantages, including far greater data density compared to electronic media. We propose that schemes for data storage in the DNA of living organisms may benefit from studying the reconstruction problem, which is applicable whenever multiple reads of noisy data are available. This strategy is uniquely suited to the medium, which inherently replicates stored data in multiple distinct ways, caused by mutations. We consider noise introduced solely by uniform tandem-duplication, and utilize the relation to constant-weight integer codes in the Manhattan metric. By bounding the intersection of the cross-polytope with hyperplanes, we prove the existence of reconstruction codes with full rate, as well as suggest a construction for a family of reconstruction codes.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the Pliable Index CODing problem (PICOD), which models content-type distribution networks. In the PICOD(t) problem there are m messages, n users and each user has a distinct message side information set, as in the classical Index Coding problem (IC). Differently from IC, where each user has a pre-specified set of messages to decode, in the PICOD(t) a user is “pliable” and is satisfied if it can decode any t messages that are not in its side information set. The goal is to find a code with the shortest length that satisfies all the users. This flexibility in determining the desired message sets makes the PICOD(t) behave quite differently compared to the IC, and its analysis even more challenging. This paper mainly focuses on the complete-S PICOD(t) with m messages, where the set S ⊂ [m] contains the sizes of the side information sets, and the number of users is n = Σ sϵS (m/s), with no two users having the same side information set. Capacity results are shown for: (i) the consecutive complete-S PICOD(t), where S = [s min : s max ] for some 0 ≤ s min ≤ s max ≤ m-t, and (ii) the complement-consecutive complete-S PICOD(t), where S = [0 : m - t]\[s min : s max ], for some 0 min ≤ s max &lt;; m - t. The novel converse proof is inspired by combinatorial design techniques and the key insight is to consider all messages that a user can eventually decode successfully, even those in excess of the t required ones. This allows one to circumvent the need to consider all possible desired message set assignments at the users in order to find the one that leads to the shortest code length. The core of the novel proof is to solve the critical complete-S PICOD(t) with m = 2s + t messages and S = {s}, by showing the existence of a user who can decode s + t messages regardless of the desired message set assignment. All other tight converse results for the complete-S PICOD(t) can be deduced from this critical case. The converse results show the information theoretic optimality of simple linear coding schemes. By similar reasoning, all complete-S PICOD(t) where the number of messages is m ≤ 5 can be fully characterized. In addition, tight converse results are also shown for the PICOD(1) with circulararc network topology hypergraph.},

  abstract     = {In the traditional index coding problem, a server employs coding to send messages to a set of clients within the same broadcast domain. Each client already has some messages as side information and requests a particular unknown message from the server. All clients learn the coding matrix so that they can decode and retrieve their requested data. Our starting observation comes from the work by Karmoose et al., which shows that learning the coding matrix can pose privacy concerns: it may enable a client to infer information about the requests and side information of other clients. In this paper, we mitigate this privacy concern by allowing each client to have limited access to the coding matrix. In particular, we design coding matrices so that each client needs only to learn some of (and not all) the rows to decode her requested message. We start by showing that this approach can indeed help mitigate that privacy concern. We do so by considering two different privacy metrics. The first one shows the attained privacy benefits based on a geometric interpretation of the problem. Differently, the second metric, referred to as maximal information leakage, provides upper bounds on: (i) the guessing power of the adversaries (i.e., curious clients) when our proposed approach is employed, and (ii) the effect of decreasing the number of accessible rows on the attained privacy. Then, we propose the use of k-limited-access schemes: given an index coding scheme that employs T transmissions, we create a k-limited-access scheme with T k ≥ T transmissions, and with the property that each client needs at most k transmissions to decode her message. We derive upper and lower bounds on T k for all values of k, and develop deterministic designs for these schemes, which are universal, i.e., independent of the coding matrix. We show that our schemes are order-optimal for some parameter regimes, and we propose heuristics that complement the universal schemes for the remaining regimes.},

Our main contribution is a general construction of ME-LRCs based on generalized tensor product codes, and an analysis of their erasure-correcting properties. A decoding algorithm tailored for erasure recovery is given, and correctable erasure patterns are identified. We then prove that our construction yields optimal ME-LRCs with a wide range of code parameters, and present some explicit ME-LRCs over small fields. Next, we show that generalized integrated interleaving (GII) codes can be treated as a subclass of generalized tensor product codes, thus defining the exact relation between these codes. Finally, ME-LRCs are investigated in a probabilistic setting. We prove that ME-LRCs based upon a generalized tensor product construction can achieve the capacity of a compound erasure channel consisting of a family of erasure product channels.},

  abstract     = {An m-extracting procedure produces unbiased random bits from a loaded dice with m faces, and its output rate, the average number of output per input is bounded by the Shannon entropy of the source. This information-theoretic upper bound can be achieved only asymptotically as the input size increases, by certain extracting procedures that we call asymptotically optimal. Although a computationally efficient asymptotically optimal 2-extracting procedure has been known for a while, its counterparts for m-ary input, m &gt; 2, was found only recently, and they are still relatively complicated to describe. A binarization takes inputs from an m-faced dice and produce bit sequences to be fed into a binary extracting procedure to obtain random bits. Thus, binary extracting procedures give rise to an m-extracting procedure via a binarization. A binarization is to be called complete, if it preserves the asymptotic optimality, and such a procedure has been proposed by Zhou and Bruck. We show that a complete binarization naturally arises from a binary tree with m leaves. Therefore, there exist complete binarizations in abundance and Zhou-Bruck scheme is an instance of them. We now have a relatively simple way to obtain an asymptotically optimal and computationally efficient m-extracting procedure, from a binary one, because these binarizations are both conceptually and computationally simple. The well-known leaf entropy theorem and a closely related structure lemma play important roles in the arguments.},

  abstract     = {As an increasing amount of data is gathered nowadays and stored in databases, the question arises of how to protect the privacy of individual records in a database even while providing accurate answers to queries on the database. Differential Privacy (DP) has gained acceptance as a framework to quantify vulnerability of algorithms to privacy breaches. We consider the problem of how to sanitize an entire database via a DP mechanism, on which unlimited further querying is performed. While protecting privacy, it is important that the sanitized database still provide accurate responses to queries. The central contribution of this work is to characterize the amount of information preserved in an optimal DP database sanitizing mechanism (DSM). We precisely characterize the utility-privacy trade-off of mechanisms that sanitize databases in the asymptotic regime of large databases. We study this in an information-theoretic framework by modeling a generic distribution on the data, and a measure of fidelity between the histograms of the original and sanitized databases. We consider the popular L 1 -distortion metric, i.e., the total variation norm that leads to the formulation as a linear program (LP). This optimization problem is prohibitive in complexity with the number of constraints growing exponentially in the parameters of the problem. Our focus on the asymptotic regime enables us characterize precisely, the limit of the sequence of solutions to this optimization problem. Leveraging tools from discrete geometry, analytic combinatorics, and duality theorems of optimization, we fully characterize this limit in terms of a power series whose coefficients are the number of integer points on a multidimensional convex crosspolytope studied by Ehrhart in 1967. Employing Ehrhart theory, we determine a simple closed form computable expression for the asymptotic growth of the optimal privacy-fidelity trade-off to infinite precision. At the heart of the findings is a deep connection between the minimum expected distortion and a fundamental construct in Ehrhart theory - Ehrhart series of an integral convex polytope.},

Using novel techniques that allow for the first time direct, non-approximated analysis of SMML solutions, we investigate the Neyman-Scott estimation problem, an oft-cited showcase for the consistency of MML, and show that even with a natural choice of prior neither SMML nor its popular approximations are consistent for it, thereby providing a counterexample to the general claim.

Using results from conic integral geometry, we show that the bounds can be made to depend only on a random projection, or restriction, of the analysis operator to a lower dimensional space, and can still be effective if these operators are ill-conditioned. As an application, we get new bounds for the undersampling phase transition of composite convex regularizers. Key tools in the analysis are Slepian&#39;s inequality and the kinematic formula from integral geometry.},

  abstract     = {In the problem of structured signal recovery from high-dimensional linear observations, it is commonly assumed that full-precision measurements are available. Under this assumption, the recovery performance of the popular Generalized Lasso (G-Lasso) is by now well-established. In this paper, we extend these types of results to the practically relevant settings with quantized measurements. We study two extremes of the quantization schemes, namely, uniform and one-bit quantization; the former imposes no limit on the number of quantization bits, while the second only allows for one bit. In the presence of a uniform dithering signal and when measurement vectors are sub-gaussian, we show that the same algorithm (i.e., the G-Lasso) has favorable recovery guarantees for both uniform and one-bit quantization schemes. Our theoretical results, shed light on the appropriate choice of the range of values of the dithering signal and accurately capture the error dependence on the problem parameters. For example, our error analysis shows that the G-Lasso with one-bit uniformly dithered measurements leads to only a logarithmic rate loss compared to the full-precision measurements.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we perform a complete failure analysis of the interval-passing algorithm (IPA) for compressed sensing. The IPA is an efficient iterative algorithm for reconstructing a k-sparse nonnegative n-dimensional real signal x from a small number of linear measurements y . In particular, we show that the IPA fails to recover x from y if and only if it fails to recover a corresponding binary vector of the same support, and also that only positions of nonzero values in the measurement matrix are of importance to the success of recovery. Based on this observation, we introduce termatiko sets and show that the IPA fails to fully recover x if and only if the support of x contains a nonempty termatiko set, thus giving a complete (graph-theoretic) description of the failing sets of the IPA. Two heuristics to locate small-size termatiko sets are presented. For binary column-regular measurement matrices with no 4-cycles, we provide a lower bound on the termatiko distance, defined as the smallest size of a nonempty termatiko set. For measurement matrices constructed from the parity-check matrices of array low-density parity-check codes, upper bounds on the termatiko distance equal to half the best known upper bound on the minimum distance are provided for column-weight at most 7, while for column-weight 3, the exact termatiko distance and its corresponding multiplicity are provided. Next, we show that adding redundant rows to the measurement matrix does not create new termatiko sets, but rather potentially removes termatiko sets and thus improves performance. An algorithm is provided to efficiently search for such redundant rows. Finally, we present numerical results for different specific measurement matrices and also for protograph-based ensembles of measurement matrices, as well as simulation results of IPA performance, showing the influence of small-size termatiko sets.},

The user&#39;s query is regarded as a dot product of a query vector and the message vector (database) stored at multiple servers. Privacy, in an information theoretic sense, is then achieved by encrypting the query vector using a secure linear code, such as secret sharing. Several PIR schemes in the literature, in addition to novel ones constructed here, fall into this class. One-shot schemes provide an insightful link between PIR and data security against eavesdropping. However, their download rate is not optimal, i.e., they do not achieve the PIR capacity. Our main contribution is two transformations of one-shot schemes, which we call refining and lifting. We show that refining and lifting one-shot schemes gives capacity-achieving schemes for the cases when the PIR capacity is known. In the other cases, when the PIR capacity is still unknown, refining and lifting one-shot schemes gives, for most parameters, the best download rate so far.},

  abstract     = {By inserting interleavers between intermediate stages of the polar encoder, a new class of polar codes, termed interleaved polar (i-polar) codes, is proposed. By the uniform interleaver assumption, we derive the weight enumerating function (WEF) and the input-output weight enumerating function (IOWEF) averaged over the ensemble of i-polar codes. The average WEF can be used to calculate the upper bound on the average block error rate (BLER) of a code selected at random from the ensemble of i-polar codes. Also, we propose a concatenated coding scheme that employs P high rate codes as the outer code and Q i-polar codes as the inner code with an interleaver in between. The average WEF of the concatenated code is derived based on the uniform interleaver assumption. Simulation results show that BLER upper bounds can well predict BLER performance levels of the concatenated codes. The results show that the performance of the proposed concatenated code with P=Q=2 is better than that of the CRC-aided i-polar code with P=Q=1 of the same length and code rate at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Moreover, the proposed concatenated code allows multiple decoders to operate in parallel, which can reduce the decoding latency and hence is suitable for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC).},

In this paper, the star product scheme is adopted, with appropriate modifications, to the case of private (e.g., video) streaming. It is assumed that the files to be streamed are stored on n servers in a coded form, and the streaming is carried out via a convolutional code. The star product scheme is defined for this special case, and various properties are analyzed for two channel models related to straggling and Byzantine servers, both in the baseline case as well as with colluding servers. The achieved PIR rates for the given models are derived and, for the cases where the capacity is known, the first model is shown to be asymptotically optimal, when the number of stripes in a file is large. The second scheme introduced in this work is shown to be the equivalent of block convolutional codes in the PIR setting. For the Byzantine server model, it is shown to outperform the trivial scheme of downloading stripes of the desired file separately without memory.},

A recent breakthrough by Brakensiek et al., alongside novel applications in DNA storage, have reignited the interest in this longstanding open problem. In spite of recent advances, the amount of redundancy in existing codes is still orders of magnitude away from being optimal. In this paper, a novel approach for constructing binary two-deletion correcting codes is proposed. By this approach, parity symbols are computed from indicator vectors (i.e., vectors that indicate the positions of certain patterns) of the encoded message, rather than from the message itself. Most interestingly, the parity symbols and the proof of correctness are a direct generalization of their counterparts in the Varshamov-Tenengolts construction. Our techniques require 7 log (n)+ o(log(n)) redundant bits to encode an n-bit message, which is closer to optimal than previous constructions. Moreover, the encoding and decoding algorithms have O(n) time complexity.},

A basic challenge concerning deletion codes is determining p 0 (adv) , the zero-rate threshold of adversarial deletions, defined to be the supremum of all p for which there exists a code family with rate bounded away from 0 capable of correcting a fraction p of adversarial deletions. A recent construction of deletion-correcting codes shows that p 0 (adv) ≥ √2 - 1, and the trivial upper bound, p 0 (adv) ≤ 1/2, is the best known. Perhaps surprisingly, we do not know whether or not p 0 (adv) = 1/2. In this work, to gain further insight into deletion codes, we explore two related error models: oblivious deletions and online deletions, which are in between random and adversarial deletions in power. In the oblivious model, the channel can inflict an arbitrary pattern of pn deletions, picked without knowledge of the codeword. We prove the existence of binary codes of positive rate that can correct any fraction p 0 (obliv) equals 1. For online 0 deletions, where the channel decides whether to delete bit x i based only on knowledge of bits x 1 x 2 . . . x i , define the deterministic zerorate threshold for online deletions p 0 (on,d) to be the supremum of p for which there exist deterministic codes against an online channel causing pn deletions with low average probability of error. That is, the probability that a randomly chosen codeword is decoded incorrectly is small. We prove p 0 (adv) = 1/2 if and only if p 0 (on,d) = 1/2.},

Then, we propose a general framework for constructing rate-compatible ECCs based on cosets and syndromes of a set of nested linear codes. We evaluate our construction from two points of view. From a combinatorial perspective, we show that we can construct rate-compatible codes with increasing minimum distances, and we discuss decoding algorithms and correctable patterns of errors and erasures. From a probabilistic point of view, we prove that we are able to construct capacity-achieving rate-compatible codes, generalizing a recent construction of capacity-achieving rate-compatible polar codes. Applications of rate-compatible codes to data storage are considered. We design two-level rate-compatible codes based on Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes which are two popular codes widely used in the data storage industry, and then we evaluate the performance of these codes in multi-level cell (MLC) flash memories.

We first construct three-weight linear codes from weakly regular plateaued functions based on the second generic construction and then determine their weight distributions. We also give a punctured version and subcode of each constructed code. We note that they may be (almost) optimal codes and can be directly employed to obtain (democratic) secret sharing schemes, which have diverse applications in the industry. We next observe that the constructed codes are minimal for almost all cases and finally describe the access structures of the secret sharing schemes based on their dual codes.},

  abstract     = {The problem of quickest detection of dynamic events in networks is studied. At some unknown time, an event occurs, and a number of nodes in the network are affected by the event, in that they undergo a change in the statistics of their observations. It is assumed that the event is dynamic, in that it can propagate along the edges in the network, and affect more and more nodes with time. The event propagation dynamics is assumed to be unknown. The goal is to design a sequential algorithm that can detect a “significant” event, i.e., when the event has affected no fewer than η nodes, as quickly as possible, while controlling the false alarm rate. Fully connected networks are studied first, and the results are then extended to arbitrarily connected networks. The designed algorithms are shown to be adaptive to the unknown propagation dynamics, and their first-order asymptotic optimality is demonstrated as the false alarm rate goes to zero. The algorithms can be implemented with linear computational complexity in the network size at each time step, which is critical for online implementation. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The collision channel without feedback (CCw/oFB) introduced by Massey and Mathys, depicts a scenario where multiple users share a communication channel but have arbitrary time offsets, and can never learn these time offsets due to the lack of feedback. This paper considers an extension of the CCw/oFB, which allows the receiver to use successive interference cancellation (SIC) to cancel the interference caused by those collided packets whose contents have been known by the receiver. We derive the zero-packet-loss throughput regions of this model for both the unsynchronized and slot-synchronized cases. Given an arbitrary number of users and a packet alphabet of arbitrary size, it is shown that these two regions coincide, and the outer boundary of this common region is the set of all points with only nonnegative components that add up to one. It is further shown that all points on this outer boundary with only rational components can be achieved without packet loss in the slot-synchronized case. The constructive proofs are based on a joint design of protocol sequences, identification/location algorithm and erasure correcting codes. These findings indicate that the negative impact of the lack of time synchronization on the throughput performance can be removed by the help of SIC.},

  abstract     = {The work explores the fundamental limits of coded caching in the setting where a transmitter with potentially multiple (N 0 ) antennas serves different users that are assisted by a smaller number of caches. Under the assumption of uncoded cache placement, the work derives the exact optimal worst-case delay and DoF, for a broad range of user-to-cache association profiles where each such profile describes how many users are helped by each cache. This is achieved by presenting an information-theoretic converse based on index coding that succinctly captures the impact of the user-to-cache association, as well as by presenting a coded caching scheme that optimally adapts to the association profile by exploiting the benefits of encoding across users that share the same cache. The work reveals a powerful interplay between shared caches and multiple senders/antennas, where we can now draw the striking conclusion that, as long as each cache serves at least N 0 users, adding a single degree of cache-redundancy can yield a DoF increase equal to N 0 , while at the same time - irrespective of the profile - going from 1 to N 0 antennas reduces the delivery time by a factor of N 0 . Finally some conclusions are also drawn for the related problem of coded caching with multiple file requests.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the fundamental limits of content delivery in a cache-aided broadcast network for correlated content generated by a discrete memoryless source with arbitrary joint distribution. Each receiver is equipped with a cache of equal capacity, and the requested files are delivered over a shared error-free broadcast link. A class of achievable correlation-aware schemes based on a two-step source coding approach is proposed. Library files are first compressed, and then cached and delivered using a combination of multiple-request caching schemes that are agnostic to the content correlations. The first step uses Gray-Wyner source coding to represent the library via private descriptions and descriptions that are common to more than one file. The second step then becomes a multiple-request caching problem, where the demand structure is dictated by the configuration of the compressed library, and it is interesting in its own right. The performance of the proposed two-step scheme is evaluated by comparing its achievable rate with a lower bound on the optimal peak and average rate-memory trade-offs in a two-file multiple-receiver network, and in a three-file two-receiver network. Specifically, in a network with two files and two receivers, the achievable rate matches the lower bound for a significant memory regime and it is within half of the conditional entropy of files for all other memory values. In the three-file two-receiver network, the two-step strategy achieves the lower bound for large cache capacities, and it is within half of the joint entropy of two of the sources conditioned on the third one for all other cache sizes.},

Two achievable rate regions that are within a quantifiable gap of the capacity region for the discrete-memoryless semi-deterministic MAC-IC-MAC were obtained in a previous companion work by the authors using inner and outer bounds that are unions of polytopes over admissible random coding distributions. In this paper, we obtain single-distribution-and hence explicit-inner and outer bounds that characterize the capacity region of the MIMO Gaussian MAC-IC-MAC to within a constant gap. We also evaluate and study the generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) region via multidimensional signal-level partitioning for MIMO networks. Through its lens, the achievability of the key vertices of the GDoF region are examined. This analysis as well as the symmetric GDoF curve reveal that, at high SNR, when the ratio of the interference-to-noise to the signal-to-noise ratios, both taken in dB, is within a certain range, non-interfering transmitters in that cell can fully occupy the receivers&#39; signal partitions in one or more dimensions that cannot otherwise be utilized by the interfering transmitter alone. This extends the same finding in the companion paper which established the results of this work for the scalar Gaussian MAC-IC-MAC.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of data transmission for K-user interference channel (IC) with no channel state information (CSI) at transmitters. Each pair of transceivers with the aid of a particular precoder and a switching pattern structure tries to place its desired signal in a subspace which is linearly independent of interference signals. We show that if the channel values are known only to the receivers, the sum degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of the linear interference alignment (IA) with reconfigurable antenna at receivers is Kr/r 2 -r+K, where r = [√1+4K-1/2]. For previous methods when 3 ≤ K ≤ 10 4 , the number of solvable problems to achieve maximum sum DoF is less than 2\% of different cases while in our work there is not any limitation on the number of users. In comparison with the previous related works in our proposed method, there is no limit on the number of users and the reception modes. The result indicates that the maximum sum DoF for the K-user IC with asymptotically large values of K is √K/2. Thus, the sum DoF of such networks using the reconfigurable antenna at receivers grows sublinearly with the number of users, whereas it grows linearly in the case where transmitters have access to CSI.},

We focus on the distillable coherence, i.e. the maximum rate of production of approximate pure bits of coherence starting from independent copies of an input state ρ, and on the coherence cost, i.e. the minimum rate of consumption of pure coherence bits that is needed to generate many copies of ρ with vanishing error. We obtain the first closed-form expression for the distillable coherence under strictly incoherent operations (SIO), proving that it coincides with that obtained via physically incoherent operations (PIO). This shows that SIO and PIO are equally weak at distilling coherence, sheds light on the recently discovered phenomenon of generic bound coherence, and provides us with an explicit optimal distillation protocol that is amenable to practical implementations. We give a single-letter formula for the coherence cost under PIO, showing that it is finite on a set of states with nonzero volume. Since PIO can be realised in a laboratory with incoherent ancillae, unitaries, and measurements, our result puts fundamental limitations on coherence manipulation in an experimentally relevant setting. We find examples of `abyssally bound&#39; states with vanishing PIO distillable coherence yet infinite PIO coherence cost. Our findings complete the picture of asymptotic coherence manipulation under all the main classes of incoherent operations.},

In this work, we investigate the one-shot capabilities of a quantum channel for simultaneously transmitting bits and qubits. This problem was studied in the asymptotic regime for a memoryless channel where a regularized characterization of the capacity region was reported. It is known that the transmission of private classical information is closely related to the problem of quantum information transmission. We resort to this idea and find achievable and converse bounds on the simultaneous transmission of the public and private classical information. Then shifting the classical private rate to the quantum information rate leads to a rate region for simultaneous transmission of classical and quantum information. In the case of asymptotic i.i.d. setting, our one-shot result is evaluated to the known results in the literature. Our main tools used in the achievability proofs are position-based decoding and convex-split lemma.},

The optimal rate-distortion performance of this system was previously known only for the two extreme cases m = ℓ (the centralized case) and m = 1 (the distributed case), and except when ρ = 0, the centralized system can achieve strictly lower compression rates than the distributed system under all non-trivial distortion constraints. Somewhat surprisingly, it is established in the present paper that the optimal rate-distortion performance of the afore-described generalized multiterminal source coding system with m ≥ 2 coincides with that of the centralized system for all distortions when ρ ≤ 0 and for distortions below an explicit positive threshold (depending on m) when ρ &gt; 0. Moreover, when ρ &gt; 0, the minimum achievable rate of generalized multiterminal source coding subject to an arbitrary positive distortion constraint d is shown to be within a finite gap (depending on m and d) from its centralized counterpart in the large I limit except for possibly the critical distortion d = 1 - ρ.},

  abstract     = {A distributed binary hypothesis testing (HT) problem involving two parties, one referred to as the observer and the other as the detector is studied. The observer observes a discrete memoryless source (DMS) and communicates its observations to the detector over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC). The detector observes another DMS correlated with that at the observer, and performs a binary hypothesis test on the joint distribution of the two DMS&#39;s using its own observed data and the information received from the observer. The trade-off between the type I error probability and the type II error-exponent of the HT is explored. Single-letter lower bounds on the optimal type II error-exponent are obtained by using two different coding schemes, a separate HT and channel coding scheme and a joint HT and channel coding scheme based on hybrid coding for the matched bandwidth case. Exact single-letter characterization of the same is established for the special case of testing against conditional independence, and it is shown to be achieved by the separate HT and channel coding scheme. An example is provided where the joint scheme achieves a strictly better performance than the separation based scheme.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) in the presence of prior side information. The problem setup includes a database of K independent messages possibly replicated on several servers, and a user that needs to retrieve one of these messages. In addition, the user has some prior side information in the form of a subset of M messages, not containing the desired message and unknown to the servers. This problem is motivated by practical settings in which the user can obtain side information opportunistically from other users or has previously downloaded some messages using classical PIR schemes. The objective of the user is to retrieve the required message with downloading minimum amount of data from the servers while achieving information-theoretic privacy in one of the following two scenarios: (i) the user wants to protect jointly the identities of the demand and the side information; (ii) the user wants to protect only the identity of the demand, but not necessarily the side information. To highlight the role of side information, we focus first on the case of a single server (single database). In the first scenario, we prove that the minimum download cost is K - M messages, and in the second scenario it is [K/(M + 1)] messages, which should be compared to K messages-the minimum download cost in the case of no side information. Then, we extend some of our results to the case of the database replicated on multiple servers. Our proof techniques relate PIR with side information to the index coding problem. We leverage this connection to prove converse results, as well as to design achievability schemes.},

The identities of these side information messages need to be kept private from the databases, i.e., we consider PIR with private side information (PSI). We characterize the optimal normalized download cost for this PIR-PSI problem under the storage constraint S as D* = 1+ 1/N + 1/N 2 +· · ·+ 1/N K-1-M + 1-r M /N K-M + 1-r M-1 /N K-M+1 + · · · + 1-r 1 /N K-1 , where M is the number of side information messages and ri is the portion of the ith side information message that is cached with Σ i=1 M r i = S. Based on this capacity result, we prove two facts: First, for a fixed memory size S and a fixed number of accessible messages M, uniform caching achieves the lowest normalized download cost, i.e., r i = S/M, for i = 1, . . . , M, is optimum. Second, for a fixed memory size S, among all possible K - ⌈S⌉ + 1 uniform caching schemes, the uniform caching scheme which caches M = K messages achieves the lowest normalized download cost.},

It is well known that, in this case, when n=1 the capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete with finitely many mass points, and when n &gt; 1 the capacity-achieving input distribution is supported on finitely many concentric shells. However, due to the previous proof technique, not even a bound on the exact number of mass points/shells was available. This paper provides an alternative proof of the finiteness of the number mass points/shells of the capacity-achieving input distribution while producing the first firm bounds on the number of mass points and shells, paving an alternative way for approaching many such problems. The first main result of this paper is an order tight implicit bound which shows that the number of mass points in the capacity-achieving input distribution is within a factor of two from the number of zeros of the downward shifted capacity-achieving output probability density function. Next, this implicit bound is utilized to provide a first firm upper on the support size of optimal input distribution, an O(A 2 ) upper bound where A denotes the constraint on the input amplitude. The second main result of this paper generalizes the first one to the case when n &gt; 1, showing that, for each and every dimension n ≥ 1, the number of shells that the optimal input distribution contains is O(A 2 ). Finally, the third main result of this paper reconsiders the case n = 1 with an additional average power constraint, demonstrating a similar O(A 2 ) bound.},

In this paper, we study the discrepancy between the privacy-utility guarantees for the empirical distribution, used to design the privacy mechanism, and those for the true distribution, experienced by the privacy mechanism in practice. We first show that, for any privacy mechanism, these discrepancies vanish at speed O(1/√n) with high probability. These bounds follow from our main technical results regarding the Lipschitz continuity of the considered information leakage measures. Then we prove that the optimal privacy mechanisms for the empirical distribution approach the corresponding mechanisms for the true distribution as the sample size n increases, thereby establishing the statistical consistency of the optimal privacy mechanisms. Finally, we introduce and study uniform privacy mechanisms which, by construction, provide privacy to all the distributions within a neighborhood of the estimated distribution and, thereby, guarantee privacy for the true distribution with high probability.},

While the state-of-the-art implementation uses Montgomery curves, which facilitates efficient elliptic curve arithmetic and isogeny computations, other forms of elliptic curves can be used to produce an efficient result. In this paper, we present the new hybrid method for isogeny-based cryptosystem using Edwards curves. Unlike the previous hybrid methods, we exploit Edwards curves for recovering the curve coefficients and Montgomery curves for other operations. To this end, we first carefully examine and compare the computational cost of Montgomery and Edwards isogenies. Then, we fine-tune and tailor Edwards isogenies in order to blend with Montgomery isogenies efficiently. Additionally, we present the implementation results of Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange using the proposed method. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the previously proposed hybrid method, and is as fast as Montgomery-only implementation. Our results show that proper use of Edwards curves for isogeny-based cryptosystem can be quite practical.},

We target the stragglers&#39; delay performance bottleneck, which is due to the unpredictable latency in waiting for slowest nodes (or stragglers) to finish their tasks. We propose a novel coding strategy, named entangled polynomial code, for designing the intermediate computations at the worker nodes in order to minimize the recovery threshold (i.e., the number of workers that we need to wait for in order to compute the final output). We demonstrate the optimality of entangled polynomial code in several cases, and show that it provides orderwise improvement over the conventional schemes for straggler mitigation. Furthermore, we characterize the optimal recovery threshold among all linear coding strategies within a factor of 2 using bilinear complexity, by developing an improved version of the entangled polynomial code. In particular, while evaluating bilinear complexity is a well-known challenging problem, we show that optimal recovery threshold for linear coding strategies can be approximated within a factor of 2 of this fundamental quantity. On the other hand, the improved version of the entangled polynomial code enables further and orderwise reduction in the recovery threshold, compared to its basic version. Finally, we show that the techniques developed in this paper can also be extended to several other problems such as coded convolution and fault-tolerant computing, leading to tight characterizations.},

An optimization theoretic perspective on the seminal work on the fundamental limits of caching by Maddah-Ali and Niesen is first developed, whereas it is proved that the coded caching scheme presented in that work is the optimal scheme among a large, non-trivial family of possible caching schemes. The optimization framework is then used to develop a coded caching scheme capable of handling simultaneous non-uniform file length, non-uniform file popularity, and non-uniform user cache size. Although the resulting full optimization problem scales exponentially with the problem size, this paper shows that tractable simplifications of the problem that scale as a polynomial function of the problem size can still perform well compared to the original problem. By considering these heterogeneities both individually and in conjunction with one another, evidence of the effect of their interactions and influence on optimal cache content is obtained.},

First, we approach link scheduling with a general system model without restrictions on the shape of the achievable rate region. Then, we give and prove a solution characterization of optimality that is conceptually simple yet powerful. We demonstrate several applications of this characterization for analysis of optimality and problem tractability.

Our results show that depending on exactly how energy is measured, in general energy depends √d -1 or √Vd -1 log d, where d is the delay. This means on that the energy decreases quite slowly with increasing delay. Furthermore, to approach the absolute minimum of -1.59 dB on energy, bandwidth has to increase very rapidly, much more than what is predicted by infinite blocklength theory. We then consider the scenario when data arrive stochastically in packets and can be queued. We devise a scheduling algorithm based on finite blocklength theory and develop bounds for the energy-delay performance.

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider the sum rate performance of joint processing coordinated multi-point transmission network (JP-CoMP, a.k.a Network MIMO) in a so-called distributed channel state information (D-CSI) setting. In the D-CSI setting, the various transmitters (TXs) acquire a local, TX-dependent, estimate of the global multi-user channel state matrix obtained via terminal feedback and limited backhauling. The CSI noise across TXs can be independent or correlated, so as to reflect the degree to which TXs can exchange information over the backhaul, hence allowing to model a range of situations bridging fully distributed and fully centralized CSI settings. In this context we aim to study the price of CSI distributiveness in terms of sum rate at finite SNR when compared with conventional centralized scenarios. We consider the family of JP-CoMP precoders known as regularized zero-forcing (RZF). We conduct our study in the large scale antenna regime, as it is currently envisioned to be used in real 5G deployments. It is then possible to obtain accurate approximations on so-called deterministic equivalents of the signal to interference and noise ratios. Guided by the obtained deterministic equivalents, we propose an approach to derive a RZF scheme that is robust to the distributed aspect of the CSI, whereby the key idea lies in the optimization of a TX-dependent power level and regularization factor. Our analysis confirms the improved robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to CSI inconsistency at different TXs, even with moderate number of antennas and receivers (RXs).},

  abstract     = {By exploiting large antenna arrays, massive MIMO (multiple input multiple output) systems can greatly increase spectral and energy efficiency over traditional MIMO systems. However, increasing the number of antennas at the base station (BS) makes the uplink joint channel estimation and data detection (JED) challenging in massive MIMO systems. In this paper, we consider the JED problem for massive SIMO (single input multiple output) wireless systems, which is a special case of wireless systems with large antenna arrays. We propose exact Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) optimal JED algorithms with low expected complexity, for both constant-modulus and nonconstant-modulus constellations. We show that, despite the large number of unknown channel coefficients, the expected computational complexity of these algorithms is polynomial in channel coherence time (T) and the number of receive antennas (N), even when the number of receive antennas grows polynomially in the channel coherence time (N=O(T 11 ) suffices to guarantee an expected computational complexity cubic in T and linear in N). Simulation results show that the GLRT-optimal JED algorithms achieve significant performance gains (up to 5 dB improvement in energy efficiency) with low computational complexity.},

This model is motivated by applications such as channel estimation, optics, and underwater acoustic communication, where the signal of interest is acted on by a given channel/filter, and phase information is difficult or impossible to acquire. We show that when a is random and the number of observations m is sufficiently large, with high probability x can be efficiently recovered up to a global phase shift using a combination of spectral initialization and generalized gradient descent. The main challenge is coping with dependencies in the measurement operator.

  abstract     = {We consider the setup of nonparametric blind regression for estimating the entries of a large m × n matrix, when provided with a small, random fraction of noisy measurements. We assume that all rows u ∈ [m] and columns i ∈ [n] of the matrix are associated to latent features xrow(u) and xcol(i) respectively, and the (u, i)-th entry of the matrix, A(u, i) is equal to f(x row (u), x col (i)) for a latent functionf. Given noisy observations of a small, random subset of the matrix entries, our goal is to estimate the unobserved entries of the matrix as well as to “denoise” the observed entries. As the main result of this work, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-based estimation algorithm, and establish its consistency when the underlying latent function f is Lipschitz, the underlying latent space is a bounded diameter Polish space, and the random fraction of observed entries in the matrix is at least max (m -1+δ , n -1/2+δ ), for any δ &gt; 0. As an important byproduct, our analysis sheds light into the performance of the classical collaborative filtering algorithm for matrix completion, which has been widely utilized in practice. Experiments with the MovieLens and Netflix datasets suggest that our algorithm provides a principled improvement over basic collaborative filtering and is competitive with matrix factorization methods. Our algorithm has a natural extension to the setting of tensor completion via flattening the tensor to matrix. When applied to the setting of image in-painting, which is a 3-order tensor, we find that our approach is competitive with respect to state-of-art tensor completion algorithms across benchmark images.},

  abstract     = {The low-tubal-rank tensor model has been recently proposed for real-world multidimensional data. In this paper, we study the low-tubal-rank tensor completion problem, i.e., to recover a third-order tensor by observing a subset of its elements selected uniformly at random. We propose a fast iterative algorithm, called Tubal-AltMin, that is inspired by a similar approach for low-rank matrix completion. The unknown low-tubal-rank tensor is represented as the product of two much smaller tensors with the low-tubal-rank property being automatically incorporated, and Tubal-AltMin alternates between estimating those two tensors using tensor least squares minimization. First, we note that tensor least squares minimization is different from its matrix counterpart and nontrivial as the circular convolution operator of the low-tubal-rank tensor model is intertwined with the sub-sampling operator. Secondly, the theoretical performance guarantee is challenging since Tubal-AltMin is iterative and nonconvex. We prove that 1) Tubal-AltMin generates a best rank-r approximate up to any predefined accuracy ε at an exponential rate, and 2) for an n × n × k tensor M with tubal-rank r ≪ n, the required sampling complexity is O((nr 2 kIIMII F2 log 3 n)/σ 2 rk), where σ̅rk is the rk-th singular value of the block diagonal matrix representation of M in the frequency domain, and the computational complexity is O(n 2 r 2 k 3 logn log(n/ε)). Finally, on both synthetic data and real-world video data, evaluation results show that compared with tensor-nuclear norm minimization using alternating direction method of multipliers (TNN-ADMM), Tubal-AltMin-Simple (a simplified implementation of Tubal-AltMin) improves the recovery error by several orders of magnitude. In experiments, Tubal-AltMin-Simple is faster than TNN-ADMM by a factor of 5 for a 200 × 200 × 20 tensor.},

We show that for binary classification, the divergence associated with smooth, proper, and convex loss functions is upper bounded by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, to within a normalization constant. This implies that by minimizing the logarithmic loss associated with the KL divergence, we minimize an upper bound to any choice of loss from this set. As such the logarithmic loss is universal in the sense of providing performance guarantees with respect to a broad class of accuracy measures. Importantly, this notion of universality is not problem-specific, enabling its use in diverse applications, including predictive modeling, data clustering and sample complexity analysis. Generalizations to arbitary finite alphabets are also developed. The derived inequalities extend several well-known $f$ -divergence results.},

A closed-form expression for L (X→Y) is given for discrete X and Y, and it is subsequently generalized to handle a large class of random variables. The resulting properties are shown to be consistent with an axiomatic view of a leakage measure, and the definition is shown to be robust to variations in the setup. Moreover, a variant of the Shannon cipher system is studied, in which performance of an encryption scheme is measured using maximal leakage. A single-letter characterization of the optimal limit of (normalized) maximal leakage is derived and asymptotically-optimal encryption schemes are demonstrated. Furthermore, the sample complexity of estimating maximal leakage from data is characterized up to subpolynomial factors.

  abstract     = {We consider compound multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wiretap channels where minimal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is assumed. Code construction is given for the special case of isotropic mutual information, which serves as a conservative strategy for general cases. Using the flatness factor for MIMO channels, we propose lattice codes universally achieving the secrecy capacity of compound MIMO wiretap channels up to a constant gap (measured in nats) that is equal to the number of transmit antennas. The proposed approach improves upon existing works on secrecy coding for MIMO wiretap channels from an error probability perspective, and establishes information theoretic security (in fact semantic security). We also give an algebraic construction to reduce the code design complexity, as well as the decoding complexity of the legitimate receiver. Thanks to the algebraic structures of number fields and division algebras, our code construction for compound MIMO wiretap channels can be reduced to that for Gaussian wiretap channels, up to some additional gap to secrecy capacity.},

  abstract     = {Building on recent development by Padakandla and Pradhan, and by Lim, Feng, Pastore, Nazer, and Gastpar, this paper studies the potential of structured coset coding as a complete replacement for random coding in network information theory. The roles of two techniques used in coset coding to generate nonuniform codewords, namely, shaping and channel transformation, are clarified and illustrated via the simple example of the two-sender multiple access channel. While individually deficient, the optimal combination of shaping via nested coset codes of the same generator matrix (which we refer to as homologous codes) and channel transformation is shown to achieve the same performance as traditional random codes for the general two-sender multiple access channel. The achievability proof of the capacity region is extended to multiple access channels with more than two senders, and with one or more receivers. A quantization argument adapted to the proposed combination of two techniques is presented to establish the achievability proof for their Gaussian counterparts. It is illustrated by an example that combining shaping and channel transformation is useful even when the goal of transmission for a subset of the receivers is to recover a linear combination of messages. These results open up new possibilities of utilizing homologous codes for a broader class of applications.},

  abstract     = {We consider sequential detection based on quantized data in the presence of eavesdropper. Stochastic encryption is employed as a counter measure that flips the quantization bits at each sensor according to certain probabilities, and the flipping probabilities are only known to the legitimate fusion center (LFC) but not the eavesdropping fusion center (EFC). As a result, the LFC employs the optimal sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for sequential detection whereas the EFC employs a mismatched SPRT (MSPRT). We characterize the asymptotic performance of the MSPRT in terms of the expected sample size as a function of the vanishing error probabilities. We show that when the detection error probabilities are set to be the same at the LFC and EFC, every symmetric stochastic encryption is ineffective in the sense that it leads to the same expected sample size at the LFC and EFC. Next, in the asymptotic regime of small detection error probabilities, we show that every stochastic encryption degrades the performance of the quantized sequential detection at the LFC by increasing the expected sample size, and the expected sample size required at the EFC is no fewer than that is required at the LFC. Then the optimal stochastic encryption is investigated in the sense of maximizing the difference between the expected sample sizes required at the EFC and LFC. Although this optimization problem is nonconvex, we show that if the acceptable tolerance of the increase in the expected sample size at the LFC induced by the stochastic encryption is small enough, then the globally optimal stochastic encryption can be analytically obtained; and moreover, the optimal scheme only flips one type of quantized bits (i.e., 1 or 0) and keeps the other type unchanged.},

For side information graphs with this structure, the capacity region is characterized in terms of the subproblem capacity regions combined in the same product structure. The proof is based on dual uses of random coding-one for a new multiletter characterization of the capacity region of a general index coding problem via joint typicality decoding and the other for a construction of a new multiletter code of matching rates from a single-letter code via joint typicality encoding. Several special cases are discussed that recover and strengthen known structural properties of the index coding capacity region.},

A lower bound on the secrecy-capacity, that improves upon the previously best known result published by Prabhakaran et al., is derived based on a novel superposition coding scheme. Our achievability gives rise to the exact secrecy-capacity characterization of a class of SD-WTCs that decompose into a product of two WTCs, one independent of the state and the other depends only on the state.

  abstract     = {Integer-forcing source coding has been proposed as a low-complexity method for compression of distributed correlated Gaussian sources. In this scheme, each encoder quantizes its observation using the same fine lattice and reduces the result modulo a coarse lattice. Rather than directly recovering the individual quantized signals, the decoder first recovers a full-rank set of judiciously chosen integer linear combinations of the quantized signals, and then inverts it. It has been observed that the method works very well for “most” but not all source covariance matrices. The present work quantifies the measure of bad covariance matrices by studying the probability that integer-forcing source coding fails as a function of the allocated rate, where the probability is with respect to a random orthonormal transformation that is applied to the sources prior to quantization. For the important case where the signals to be compressed correspond to the antenna inputs of relays in an i.i.d. Rayleigh fading environment, this orthonormal transformation can be viewed as being performed by nature. The scheme is also studied in the context of a non-distributed system. Here, the goal is to arrive at a universal, yet practical, compression method using equal-rate quantizers with provable performance guarantees. The scheme is universal in the sense that the covariance matrix need only be learned at the decoder but not at the encoder. The goal is accomplished by replacing the random orthonormal transformation by transformations corresponding to number-theoretic space-time codes.},

Despite years of research good quantum LDPC codes are not known to exist, but at the very least it is known they cannot be defined on very regular topologies, like low-dimensional grids. In this work we establish a complementary result, showing that good quantum CSS codes which are sparsely generated require “structure” in the local terms that constrain the code space so as not to be “too-random” in a well-defined sense. To show this, we prove a weak converse to a theorem of Krasikov and Litsyn on weight distributions of classical codes due to which may be of independent interest: subspaces for which the distribution of weights in the dual space is approximately binomial have very few codewords of low weight, tantamount to having a non-negligible “approximate” minimal distance. While they may not have a large minimal non-zero weight, they still have very few words of low Hamming weight.},

Our goal is to provide optimal repair access for binary MDS array codes, meaning that the bandwidth triggered to repair any single failed information or parity column is minimized. In this paper, we propose a generic transformation framework for binary MDS array codes, using EVENODD codes as a motivating example, to support optimal repair access for k + 1 ≤ d ≤ k + r - 1, where d denotes the number of nonfailed columns that are connected for repair; note that when d &lt;; k + r - 1, some of the chosen d columns in repairing a failed column are specific. In addition, we show how our transformation framework applies to an example of binary MDS array codes with asymptotically optimal repair access of any single information column and enables asymptotically or exactly optimal repair access for any column. Furthermore, we present a new transformation for EVENODD codes with two parity columns such that the existing efficient repair property of any information column is preserved and the repair access of parity column is optimal.},

More specifically, suppose that we have encoded k data symbols using an (n, k) code with code length n and dimension k. During storage, some of the codeword coordinates might be corrupted by errors. We aim to recover the original data by reading the corrupted codeword with a limit on the transmission bandwidth, namely, we can only download an α proportion of the corrupted codeword. For a given α, our objective is to design a code and a decoding scheme such that we can recover the original data from the largest possible number of errors. A naive scheme is to read αn coordinates of the codeword. This method used in conjunction with MDS codes guarantees recovery from any ⌊(αn - k)/2⌋ errors. In this paper we show that we can instead download an α proportion from each of the codeword&#39;s coordinates. For a well-designed MDS code, this method can guarantee recovery from ⌊(n - k/α)/2⌋ errors, which is 1/α times more than the naive method, and is also the maximum number of errors that an (n, k) code can correct by downloading only an α proportion of the codeword. We present two families of such optimal constructions and decoding schemes of which one is based on Interleaved Reed-Solomon codes and the other on Folded Reed-Solomon codes. We further show that both code constructions attain asymptotically optimal list decoding radius when downloading only a part of the corrupted codeword. We also construct an ensemble of random codes that with high probability approaches the upper bound on the number of correctable errors when the decoder downloads an α proportion of the corrupted codeword.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a concatenated coding scheme with polynomial computational complexity for covert communication over Binary Symmetric Channels (BSCs) and binary-input Discrete Memoryless Channels (DMCs). Our setting is as follows - a transmitter Alice wishes to potentially reliably transmit a message to a receiver Bob, while ensuring that the transmission taking place is covert with respect to a warden Willie (who hears Alice&#39;s transmission over another independent channel). Prior works showed that Alice can reliably and covertly transmit O(√n) message bits over n channel uses, but one drawback is that the computational complexity of the codes designed scales as 2 Θ (√n). In this work we provide a capacity-achiveing coding scheme with provable guarantees on both reliability and covertness, and its computational complexity grows polynomially in the blocklength n.},

  abstract     = {A promising research area that has recently emerged, is on how to use index coding to improve the communication efficiency in distributed computing systems, especially for data shuffling in iterative computations. In this paper, we posit that pliable index coding can offer a more efficient framework for data shuffling, as it can better leverage the many possible shuffling choices to reduce the number of transmissions. We theoretically analyze pliable index coding under data shuffling constraints, and design a hierarchical data-shuffling scheme that uses pliable coding as a component. We find benefits up to O(ns/m) over index coding, where ns/m is the average number of workers caching a message, and m, n, and s are the numbers of messages, workers, and cache size, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Caching is an efficient way to reduce network traffic congestion during peak hours, by storing some content at the user&#39;s local cache memory, even without knowledge of user&#39;s later demands. Maddah-Ali and Niesen proposed a two-phase (placement phase and delivery phase) coded caching strategy for broadcast channels with cache-aided users. This paper investigates the same model under the constraint that content is placed uncoded within the caches, that is, when bits of the files are simply copied within the caches. When the cache contents are uncoded and the users&#39; demands are revealed, the caching problem can be connected to an index coding problem. This paper focuses on deriving fundamental performance limits for the caching problem by using tools for the index coding problem that were either known or are newly developed in this work. First, a converse bound for the caching problem under the constraint of uncoded cache placement is proposed based on the “acyclic index coding converse bound.” This converse bound is proved to be achievable by the Maddah-Ali and Niesen&#39;s scheme when the number of files is not less than the number of users, and by a newly derived index coding achievable scheme otherwise. The proposed index coding achievable scheme is based on distributed source coding and strictly improves on the widely used “composite (index) coding” achievable bound and its improvements, and is of independent interest. An important consequence of the findings of this paper is that advancements on the coded caching problem posed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen are thus only possible by considering strategies with coded placement phase. A recent work by Yu et al has however shown that coded cache placement can at most half the network load compared to the results presented in this paper.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider adaptive linear programming (ALP) decoding of linear codes over prime fields, i.e., the finite fields Fp of size p where p is a prime, when used over a p-ary input memoryless channel. In particular, we provide a general construction of valid inequalities (using no auxiliary variables) for the codeword polytope (or the convex hull) of the so-called constant-weight embedding of a single parity-check (SPC) code over any prime field. The construction is based on sets of vectors, called building block classes, that are assembled to form the left-hand side of an inequality according to several rules. In the case of almost doubly-symmetric valid classes we prove that the resulting inequalities are all facetdefining, while we conjecture this to be true if and only if the class is valid and symmetric. Valid symmetric classes impose certain symmetry conditions on the elements of the vectors from the class, while valid doubly-symmetric classes impose further technical symmetry conditions. For p = 3, there is only a single valid symmetric class and we prove that the resulting inequalities together with the so-called simplex constraints give a complete and irredundant description of the codeword polytope of the embedded SPC code. For p &gt; 5, we show that there are additional facets beyond those from the proposed construction. As an example, for p =7, we provide additional inequalities that all define facets of the embedded codeword polytope. The resulting overall set of linear (in)equalities is conjectured to be irredundant and complete. Such sets of linear (in)equalities have not appeared in the literature before, have a strong theoretical interest, and we use them to develop an efficient (relaxed) ALP decoder for general (non-SPC) linear codes over prime fields. The key ingredient is an efficient separation algorithm based on the principle of dynamic programming. Furthermore, we construct a decoder for linear codes over arbitrary fields E q with q = p m and m &gt; 1 by a factor graph representation that reduces to several instances of the case m =1, which results, in general, in a relaxation of the original decoding polytope. Finally, we present an efficient cut-generating algorithm to search for redundant parity-checks to further improve the performance towards maximum-likelihood decoding for short-to-medium block lengths. Numerical experiments confirm that our new decoder is very efficient compared to a static LP decoder for various field sizes, check-node degrees, and block lengths.},

The complexity of solving each game class is defined as the minimum number of iterations required to find a Nash equilibrium (NE) of any game in that class with ∈ accuracy. First, we consider the class G of all N-player non-cooperative games with a continuous action space that admit at least one NE. Using information-theoretic inequalities, a lower bound on the complexity of solving G is derived which depends on the Kolmogorov 2∈-capacity of the constraint set and the total capacity of the communication channels. Our results indicate that the game class G can be solved at most exponentially fast. We next consider the class of all N-player non-cooperative games with at least one NE such that the players&#39; utility functions satisfy a certain (differential) constraint. We derive lower bounds on the complexity of solving this game class under both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise models. Finally, we derive upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of a class of quadratic games. It is shown that the complexity of solving this game class scales according to Θ (1/∈ 2 ) where € is the accuracy parameter.},

Our running time is optimal with respect to the input size, up to logarithmic factors, and improves on the O(n 3 ) running time of the previous proposed greedy algorithm with an approximation ratio (1 - 1/e) in the exponent. Notably, the independence of our running time of k is novel, compared to conventional top-k selections on graphs that usually run in Ω(mk) time. 2) We show the exponential inapproximability of this problem by proving that there exists a constant c &gt; 0 such that it is NP-hard to approximate the optimum number of spanning trees in the exponent within (1 - c).},

  abstract     = {Boolean functions are usually studied under the assumption that each input bit is considered independent and identically distributed. However, in the case of some stream ciphers, a keystream bit is generated by using a nonlinear Boolean function with inputs from a restricted domain. At Eurocrypt 2016, one such stream cipher (FLIP) has been proposed, where a Boolean function on n variables was exploited with inputs of weight n/2 only. Recently, Carlet et al. studied several properties of such functions and obtained certain bounds on linear approximations of direct sum in the restricted domain. In this paper, we observe that for a direct sum like f = f 1 + f 2 , the inputs to each sub-function f 1 , f 2 do not follow a uniform distribution in the restricted domain. In this regard, we study the properties of the Boolean functions by considering a general probability distribution on the inputs. We further obtain several bounds related to the biases of direct sums. Finally, we obtain a lower bound on the bias of the nonlinear filter function of FLIP. Our results provide a general framework to study security parameters of ciphers over restricted domain.},

  abstract     = {Given a q-ary frequency hopping sequence set of length n and size M with Hamming correlation H, one can obtain a q-ary (nonlinear) cyclic code of length n and size nM with Hamming distance n-H. Thus, every upper bound on the size of a code from coding theory gives an upper bound on the size of a frequency hopping sequence set. Indeed, all upper bounds from coding theory have been converted to upper bounds on frequency hopping sequence sets [1]. On the other hand, a lower bound from coding theory does not automatically produce a lower bound for frequency hopping sequence sets. In particular, the most important lower bound, the Gilbert-Varshamov bound in coding theory, has not been transformed to a valid lower bound on frequency hopping sequence sets. The purpose of this paper is to transform the Gilbert-Varshamov bound from coding theory to frequency hopping sequence sets by establishing a connection between a special family of cyclic codes (which are called hopping cyclic codes in this paper) and frequency hopping sequence sets. We provide two proofs of the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. One is based on a probabilistic method that requires advanced tool- martingale. This proof covers the whole rate region. Another proof is purely elementary but only covers part of the rate region.},

The slow fading model used is one where communication takes place over blocks of time slots and each link in the network is subject independently to block erasure with probability p. It is assumed that each receiver in the network is interested in one unique message, which is made available at M transmitters. For the case where M = 1, the cell association problem is considered, and for M &gt; 1, the problem of setting up the backhaul links for Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmission is investigated. In both cases, optimal schemes from a Degrees of Freedom (DoF) viewpoint are analyzed for the setting of no erasures, and new schemes are proposed with better average DoF performance at higher probabilities of erasure. Assuming separate coding over different deep fading erasure blocks, the average per user DoF for M = 1 is characterized for every value of p, and optimal message assignments are identified. For M &gt; 1, it is first established that there is no strategy for assigning messages to transmitters in networks that is optimal for all values of p. The optimal cooperative zero-forcing scheme for M = 2 is then identified, and shown to be information-theoretically optimal when the size of the largest subnetwork that contains no erased links is at most five.},

  abstract     = {Point processes are often described with functionals, such as the probability generating functional, the Laplace functional, and the factorial cumulant generating functional. These are used to facilitate modelling of different processes and to determine important statistics via functional differentiation. In information theory, generating functions have also been defined for probability densities to determine information quantities such as the Shannon information and Kullback-Leibler divergence, though as yet there are no such analogues for point processes. The purpose of this article is to exploit the advantages of both types of generating function to facilitate the derivation of information statistics for point processes. In particular, a generating functional for point processes is introduced for determining statistics related to entropy and relative entropy based on Golomb&#39;s information function and Moyal&#39;s probability generating functional. It is shown that the information generating functional permits the derivation of a suite of statistics, including localised Shannon entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence calculations.},

In this paper, we study the representation of different stochastic process as a memoryless innovation process triggering a dynamic system. We show that such a representation is always feasible for innovation processes taking values over a continuous set. However, the problem becomes more challenging when the alphabet size of the innovation is finite. In this case, we introduce both lossless and lossy frameworks, and provide closed-form solutions and practical algorithmic methods. In addition, we discuss the properties and uniqueness of our suggested approach. Finally, we show that the innovation representation problem has many applications.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a problem of sampling a Wiener process, with samples forwarded to a remote estimator over a channel that is modeled as a queue. The estimator reconstructs an estimate of the real-time signal value from causally received samples. We study the optimal online sampling strategy that minimizes the mean square estimation error subject to a sampling rate constraint. We prove that the optimal sampling strategy is a threshold policy, and find the optimal threshold. This threshold is determined by how much the Wiener process varies during the random service time and the maximum allowed sampling rate. Further, if the sampling times are independent of the observed Wiener process, the above sampling problem for minimizing the estimation error is equivalent to a sampling problem for minimizing the age of information. This reveals an interesting connection between the age of information and remote estimation error. Our comparisons show that the estimation error achieved by the optimal sampling policy can be much smaller than those of age-optimal sampling, zero-wait sampling, and periodic sampling.},

We obtain several types of tail inequalities, including Bennett-type and Bernstein-type inequalities. This allows us to further bound the expectation of the spectral norm of a matrix i.d. series. Moreover, by developing a new lower-bound function for Q(s) = (s + 1) log(s + 1) - s that appears in the Bennett-type inequality, we derive a tighter tail inequality of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix i.d. series than the Bernstein-type inequality when the matrix dimension is high. The resulting lower-bound function is of independent interest and can improve any Bennett-type concentration inequality that involves the function Q(s). The class of i.d. probability distributions is large and includes Gaussian and Poisson distributions, among many others. Therefore, our results encompass the existing work on matrix Gaussian series as a special case. Lastly, we show that the tail inequalities of a matrix i.d. series have applications in several optimization problems including the chance constrained optimization problem and the quadratic optimization problem with orthogonality constraints. In addition, we also use the resulting tail bounds to show that random matrices constructed from i.d. random variables satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) when it acts as a measurement matrix in compressed sensing.},

We show that without prior knowledge of the correlation structure, each of our architectures (under different sets of assumptions) can acquire the ensemble at a sub-Nyquist rate. Prior to sampling, the analog signals are diversified using simple, implementable components. The diversification is achieved by injecting types of “structured randomness” into the ensemble, the result of which is subsampled. For reconstruction, the ensemble is modeled as a low-rank matrix that we have observed through an (undetermined) set of linear equations. Our main results show that this matrix can be recovered using a convex program when the total number of samples is on the order of the intrinsic degree of freedom of the ensemble - the more heavily correlated the ensemble, the fewer samples are needed. To motivate this study, we discuss how such ensembles arise in the context of array processing.},

However, the characterization of the coding rate region therein involves uncountably many linear inequalities and the constant term (i.e., the lower bound) in each inequality is given in terms of the solution of a linear optimization problem. Thus this implicit characterization of the coding rate region does not enable the determination of the achievability of a given rate tuple. In principle, the achievability of a given rate tuple can be determined by direct computation, but the complexity is prohibitive even for L = 5. In this paper, for any fixed L, we obtain in closed form a finite set of linear inequalities for characterizing the coding rate region. We further show by the symmetry of the problem that only a much smaller subset of this finite set of inequalities needs to be verified in determining the achievability of a given rate tuple. Yet, the cardinality of this smaller set grows at least exponentially fast with L. We also present a subset entropy inequality, which together with our explicit characterization of the coding rate region, is sufficient for proving the optimality of superposition coding.},

While several approaches have been proposed for the handling of multiple erasures, in the approach considered here, the t erased symbols are recovered in succession, each time contacting at most r other symbols for assistance. Under the local-recovery constraint, this sequential approach is the most general and hence offers the maximum possible code rate. We characterize the rate of an LRC with sequential recovery for any r ≥ 3 and any t, by first deriving an upper bound on the code rate and then constructing a binary code achieving this optimal rate. The upper bound derived here proves an earlier conjecture. Our approach permits us to deduce the structure of the parity-check matrix of a rate-optimal LRC with sequential recovery. The derived structure of parity-check matrix leads to a graphical description of the code used in code construction. A subclass of binary codes that are both rate and block-length optimal, are shown to correspond to certain regular graphs known as Moore graphs, that have the smallest number of vertices for a given girth. A connection with Tornado codes is also made.},

In particular, an MSCR (minimum storage cooperative regenerating) code retains the same storage overhead as an (n, k) MDS code. Suppose each node stores α symbols which indicates the sub-packetization level of the code. A scalar MSCR code attains the minimum sub-packetization, i.e., α = d - k + t. By now, all existing constructions of scalar MSCR codes restrict to very special parameters, eg. d = k or k = 2, etc. In a recent work, Ye and Barg construct MSCR codes for all n, k, d, t, however, their construction needs α ≈ exp(n t ) which is almost infeasible in practice. In this paper, we give an explicit construction of scalar MSCR codes for all d ≥ max{2k-1-t, k}, which covers all possible parameters except the case of k ≤ d ≤ 2k - 2 - t when k &lt;; 2k - 1 - t. Moreover, as a complementary result, for k &lt;; d &lt;; 2k - 2 - t we prove the nonexistence of linear scalar MSCR codes that have invariant repair spaces. Our construction and most of the previous scalar MSCR codes all have invariant repair spaces and this property is appealing in practice because of convenient repair. In this sense, this work presents an almost full description of usual scalar MSCR codes.},

Improvements over previous constructions of LRC codes, in particular, for binary codes, are given, as well as cases meeting an upper bound on the minimum distance. Properties of the codes are presented as well, in particular, an iterative decoding algorithm on rows and columns generalizing the iterative decoding algorithm of product codes.

In the context of network coding, the edgere-moval problem has been solved for certain families of networks (such as instances with co-located sources). However, the problem is open for general instances. This work ties the edge-removal problem to two additional problems in the context of network communication: (a) the “zero-error” network coding problem, which asks whether the zero-error network coding capacity differs from the capacity when error probability is allowed to tend to zero as the blocklength grows; and (b) the “δ-dependence” problem, which measures the advantage of message dependence in network coding capacity.},

We consider a model of storage that assumes that nodes are organized into equally sized groups, called racks, that within each group the nodes can communicate freely without taxing the system bandwidth, and that the only information transmission that counts is the one between the racks. This assumption implies that the nodes within each of the racks can collaborate before providing information to the failed node. The main emphasis of the paper is on code construction for this storage model. We present an explicit family of maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes that support recovery of a single failed node from any number of helper racks using the minimum possible amount of inter-rack communication(such codes are said to provide optimal repair). The codes are constructed over finite fields of size comparable to the code length. We also derive a bound on the number of symbols accessed at helper nodes for the purposes of repair, and construct a code family that approaches this bound, while still maintaining the optimal repair property. Finally, we present a construction of scalar Reed-Solomon codes that support optimal repair for the rack-oriented storage model.},

The induced information stability allows a more direct way to develop information theoretic necessary conditions from operational requirements beyond using Fano&#39;s inequality. That is, while Fano&#39;s inequality uses the probability of error to establish an upper bound on the entropy of a random variable given its estimator, the proposed new methodology can be applied to arbitrary operational requirements to obtain corresponding conditions on information theoretic quantities. To demonstrate its power, this new methodology is employed, to derive new necessary conditions for keyed authentication over a discrete memoryless channels and to establish the capacity region subject to finite leakage and finite error of the wiretap channel under two different secrecy metrics. These examples establish the usefulness of the proposed methodology.},

Specifically we consider a four-node network in which two nodes wish to compute a modulo-sum of two independent Bernoulli sources generated from the other two, and a similar task is done in the other direction. The main contribution of this work lies in the characterization of the computation capacity region for a deterministic model of the network via a novel transmission scheme. One consequence of this result is that, not only we can get an interaction gain over the one-way non-feedback computation capacities, but also we can get all the way to perfect-feedback 1 computation capacities simultaneously in both directions for some channel regimes. This result draws a parallel with the recent result developed in the context of two-way interference channels.This is an idealistic case where feedback links are perfect with infinite capacities and are given for free.

  abstract     = {We study the following generalization of the wellknown model of broadcasting on trees. Consider an infinite directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a unique source vertex X. Let the collection of vertices at distance k from X be called the kth layer, and suppose every non-source vertex has indegree d ≥ 2. At layer 0, the source vertex is given a random bit. At layer k ≥ 1, each vertex receives d bits from its parents in the (k-1)th layer, which are transmitted along edges that are independent binary symmetric channels (BSCs) with crossover probability δ ∈ (0, 1/2). Each vertex combines its d noisy inputs using a 2 deterministic d-ary Boolean processing function that generates the value at the vertex. The goal is to be able to reconstruct the original bit X with probability of error bounded away from 1/2 using the values of all vertices at an arbitrarily deep layer k. This question is closely related to models of reliable computation and storage, and information flow in biological networks. In this paper, we treat the case of randomly constructed DAGs, for which we show that broadcasting is only possible if the BSC noise level δ is below a certain (degree and function dependent) critical threshold. For d ≥ 3, and random DAGs with layers of size Ω(log(k)) and majority processing functions, we identify the critical threshold. For d = 2, we establish a similar result for the NAND processing function. We also prove a partial converse result for odd d ≥ 3 illustrating that the identified thresholds are impossible to improve by selecting different processing functions if the decoder is restricted to using a single vertex&#39;s value. Finally, for any BSC noise level δ, we construct explicit DAGs (using regular bipartite lossless expander graphs) with bounded degree and layers of size Θ(log(k)) admitting reconstruction. In particular, we show that the first r layers of such DAGs can be generated in either deterministic quasipolynomial time or randomized polylogarithmic time in r. These results portray a doubly-exponential advantage for storing a bit in bounded degree DAGs compared to trees, where d = 1 but layer sizes need to grow exponentially with depth in order for broadcasting to be possible.},

  abstract     = {A general time-varying feedback coding scheme is proposed for M-user fully connected symmetric Gaussian interference channels. Based on the analysis of the general coding scheme, we prove a theorem which gives a criterion for designing good time-varying feedback codes for Gaussian interference channels. The proposed scheme improves the Suh-Tse and Kramer inner bounds of the channel capacity for the cases of weak and not very strong interference when M = 2. This capacity improvement is more significant when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is not very high. In addition, our coding scheme can be proved mathematically and numerically to outperform the Kramer code for M ≥ 2 when the SNR is equal to the interference-to-noise ratio (INR). Besides, the generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF) of our proposed coding scheme can be proved to be optimal in the all network situations (very weak, weak, strong, very strong) for any M. The numerical results show that our coding scheme can attain better performance than the Suh-Tse coding scheme for M = 2 or the MohajerTandon-Poor lattice coding scheme for M &gt; 2. Furthermore, the simplicity of the encoding/decoding algorithms is another strong point of our proposed coding scheme compared with the Suh-Tse coding scheme when M = 2 and the Mohajer-TandonPoor lattice coding scheme when M &gt; 2. More importantly, our results show that an optimal coding scheme for the symmetric Gaussian interference channels with feedback can be achieved by only using marginal posterior distributions under a better cooperation strategy between transmitters.},

An information spectrum upper bound on the smooth BL divergence is proved, using properties of the subgradient of a certain convex functional. In particular, in the i.i.d. setting, such an infimum converges to the best constant in a certain mutual information inequality. We then derive new single-shot converse bounds for the omniscient helper common randomness generation problem and the Gray-Wyner source coding problem in terms of the smooth BL divergence, where the proof relies on the functional formulation of the Brascamp-Lieb inequality. Exact second-order rates are thus obtained in the stationary memoryless and nonvanishing error setting. These offer rare instances of strong converses/second-order converses for continuous sources when the rate region involves auxiliary random variables.},

Heuristically, our proof of strong converse mimics the standard steps for proving a weak converse, except that we apply those steps to a modified distribution obtained by conditioning the original distribution on the event that no error occurs. A key component of our recipe is the replacement of the hard Markov constraints implied by the distributed nature of the problem with a soft information cost using a variational formula introduced by Oohama. We illustrate our method by providing a short proof of the strong converse for the Wyner-Ziv problem and strong converse theorems for interactive function computation, common randomness and secret key agreement, and the wiretap channel; the latter three strong converse problems were open prior to this work.},

  abstract     = {A pair of sequences is called a Z-complementary pair (ZCP) if it has zero aperiodic autocorrelation sums (AACSs) for time-shifts within a certain region, called zero correlation zone (ZCZ). Optimal odd-length binary ZCPs (OB-ZCPs) display closest correlation properties to Golay complementary pairs (GCPs) in that each OB-ZCP achieves maximum ZCZ of width (N + 1)/2 (where N is the sequence length) and every out-of-zone AACSs reaches the minimum magnitude value, i.e. 2. Till date, systematic constructions of optimal OB-ZCPs exist only for lengths 2 α ± 1, where α is a positive integer. In this paper, we construct optimal OB-ZCPs of generic lengths 2 α 10 β 26 γ + 1 (where α, β, γ are non-negative integers and α ≥ 1) from inserted versions of binary GCPs. The key leading to the proposed constructions is several newly identified structure properties of binary GCPs obtained from Turyn&#39;s method. This key also allows us to construct OB-ZCPs with possible ZCZ widths of 4 × 10 β-1 + 1, 12 × 26 γ-1 + 1 and 12 × 10 β 26 γ-1 + 1 through proper insertions of GCPs of lengths 10 β , 26 γ , and 10 β 26 γ , respectively. Our proposed OB-ZCPs have applications in communications and radar (as an alternative to GCPs).},

  abstract     = {Motivated from the fact that universal source coding on countably infinite alphabets (∞-alphabets) is not feasible, this work introduces the notion of “almost lossless source coding”. Analog to the weak variable-length source coding problem studied by Han (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 46, no. 4, pp. 1217-1226, Jul. 2000), almost lossless source coding aims at relaxing the lossless block-wise assumption to allow an average per-letter distortion that vanishes asymptotically as the block-length tends to infinity. In this setup, we show on one hand that Shannon entropy characterizes the minimum achievable rate (similarly to the case of finite alphabet sources) while on the other that almost lossless universal source coding becomes feasible for the family of finite-entropy stationary memoryless sources with ∞-alphabets. Furthermore, we study a stronger notion of almost lossless universality that demands uniform convergence of the average per-letter distortion to zero, where we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the so-called family of “envelope distributions” to achieve it. Remarkably, this condition is the same necessary and sufficient condition needed for the existence of a strongly minimax (lossless) universal source code for the family of envelope distributions. Finally, we show that an almost lossless coding scheme offers faster rate of convergence for the (minimax) redundancy compared to the well-known information radius developed for the lossless case at the expense of tolerating a non-zero distortion that vanishes to zero as the block-length grows. This shows that even when lossless universality is feasible, an almost lossless scheme can offer different regimes on the rates of convergence of the (worst case) redundancy versus the (worst case) distortion.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the problem of coded caching for nonuniform demands when the structured clique cover algorithm proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen for decentralized caching is used for delivery. We apply this algorithm to all user demands regardless of their request probabilities. This allows for coding among the files that have different request probabilities but makes the allocation of memory to different files challenging during the content placement phase. As our main contribution, we analytically characterize the optimal placement strategy that minimizes the expected delivery rate under a storage capacity constraint. It is shown that the optimal placement follows either a two or a three group strategy, where a set of less popular files are not cached at all and the files within each of the other sets are allocated identical amounts of storage as if they had the same request probabilities. We show that for a finite set of storage capacities, that we call the base-cases of the problem, the two group strategy is always optimal. For other storage capacities, optimal placement is achieved by memory sharing between certain base-cases and the resulting placement either follows a two or a three group strategy depending on the corresponding base-cases used. We derive a polynomial time algorithm that determines the base-cases of the problem given the number of caches and popularity distribution of files. Given the base-cases of the problem, the optimal memory allocation parameters for any storage capacity are derived analytically.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have suggested that the stability of peer-to-peer networks may rely on persistent peers, who dwell on the network after they obtain the entire file. In the absence of such peers, one piece becomes extremely rare in the network, which leads to instability. Technological developments, however, are poised to reduce the incidence of persistent peers, giving rise to a need for a protocol that guarantees stability with non-persistent peers. We propose a novel peer-to-peer protocol, the group suppression protocol, to ensure the stability of peer-to-peer networks under the scenario that all the peers adopt non-persistent behavior. Using a suitable Lyapunov potential function, the group suppression protocol is proven to be stable when the file is broken into two pieces, and detailed experiments demonstrate the stability of the protocol for arbitrary number of pieces. We define and simulate a decentralized version of this protocol for practical applications. Straightforward incorporation of the group suppression protocol into BitTorrent while retaining most of BitTorrent&#39;s core mechanisms is also presented. Subsequent simulations show that under certain assumptions, BitTorrent with the official protocol cannot escape from the missing piece syndrome, but BitTorrent with group suppression does.},

The goal is to infer the underlying subnetwork of interactions and we refer to this problem as local tomography. In order to study the large-scale setting, we adopt a proper stochastic formulation where the unobserved part of the network is modeled as an Erdös-Rényi random graph, while the observable subnetwork is left arbitrary. The main result of this work is to establish that, under this setting, local tomography is actually possible with high probability, provided that certain conditions on the network model are met (such as stability and symmetry of the network combination matrix). Remarkably, such conclusion is established under the low-observability regime, where the cardinality of the observable subnetwork is fixed, while the size of the overall network scales to infinity.},

We propose an information-theoretic formulation of these anonymity constraints as well as an authentication coding scheme for which the asymptotic probability of successful attack is shown to optimally scale with the length of the secret keys shared between each transmitter and the legitimate receiver.

  abstract     = {In the classical model for (information theoretically secure) Private Information Retrieval (PIR) due to Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz and Sudan, a user wishes to retrieve one bit of a database that is stored on a set of n servers, in such a way that no individual server gains information about which bit the user is interested in. The aim is to design schemes that minimise the total communication between the user and the servers. More recently, there have been moves to consider more realistic models where the total storage of the set of servers, or the per server storage, should be minimised (possibly using techniques from distributed storage), and where the database is divided into R-bit records with R 1, and the user wishes to retrieve one record rather than one bit. When R is large, downloads from the servers to the user dominate the communication complexity and so the aim is to minimise the total number of downloaded bits. Work of Shah, Rashmi and Ramchandran shows that at least R + 1 bits must be downloaded from servers in the worst case, and provides PIR schemes meeting this bound. Sun and Jafar have considered the download cost of a scheme, defined as the ratio of the message length R and the total number of bits downloaded. They determine the best asymptotic download cost of a PIR scheme (as R → ∞) when a database of k messages is stored by n servers. This paper provides various bounds on the download complexity of a PIR scheme, generalising those of Shah et al. to the case when the number n of servers is bounded, and providing links with classical techniques due to Chor et al. The paper also provides a range of constructions for PIR schemes that are either simpler or perform better than previously known schemes. These constructions include explicit schemes that achieve the best asymptotic download complexity of Sun and Jafar with significantly lower upload complexity, and general techniques for constructing a scheme with good worst case download complexity from a scheme with good download complexity on average.},

  abstract     = {An energy-harvesting sensor node that is sending status updates to a destination is considered. The sensor is equipped with a battery of finite size to save its incoming energy, and consumes one unit of energy per status update transmission, which is delivered to the destination instantly over an error-free channel. The setting is online in which the harvested energy is revealed to the sensor causally over time after it arrives, and the goal is to design status update transmission times (policy) such that the long term average age of information (AoI) is minimized. The AoI is defined as the time elapsed since the latest update has reached at the destination. Two energy arrival models are considered: a random battery recharge (RBR) model, and an incremental battery recharge (IBR) model. In both models, energy arrives according to a Poisson process with unit rate, with values that completely fill up the battery in the RBR model, and with values that fill up the battery incrementally in a unit-by-unit fashion in the IBR model. The key approach to characterizing the optimal status update policy for both models is showing the optimality of renewal policies, in which the inter-update times follow a renewal process in a certain manner that depends on the energy arrival model and the battery size. It is then shown that the optimal renewal policy has an energy-dependent threshold structure, in which the sensor sends a status update only if the AoI grows above a certain threshold that depends on the energy available in its battery. For both the random and the incremental battery recharge models, the optimal energy-dependent thresholds are characterized explicitly, i.e., in closed-form, in terms of the optimal long term average AoI. It is also shown that the optimal thresholds are monotonically decreasing in the energy available in the battery, and that the smallest threshold, which comes in effect when the battery is full, is equal to the optimal long term average AoI.},

More specifically, we consider a model setup where M distributed nodes take individual measurements of an unknown structured source vector x 0 ∈ ℝ n , communicating their readings simultaneously to a central receiver. Since this procedure involves collisions and is usually imperfect, the receiver measures a superposition of non-linearly distorted signals. In a first step, we will show that an s-sparse vector x can be successfully recovered from O(s · log(2n/s)) of such superimposed measurements, using a traditional Lasso estimator that does not rely on any knowledge about the non-linear corruptions. This direct method however fails to work for several “uncalibrated” system configurations. These blind reconstruction tasks can be easily handled with the ℓ 1,2 -Group-Lasso, but coming along with an increased sampling rate of O(s · max{M, log(2n/s)}) observations - in fact, the purpose of this lifting strategy is to extend a certain class of bilinear inverse problems to non-linear acquisition. Our two algorithmic approaches are a special instance of a more abstract framework which includes sub-Gaussian measurement designs as well as general (convex) structural constraints. These results are of independent interest for various recovery and learning tasks, as they apply to arbitrary non-linear observation models. Finally, to illustrate the practical scope of our theoretical findings, an application to wireless sensor networks is discussed, which actually serves as the prototypical example of our methodology.},

  abstract     = {Blind deconvolution is a ubiquitous problem aiming to recover a convolution kernel a 0 ∈ R k and an activation signal x 0 ∈ R m from their convolution y ∈ R m . Unfortunately, this is an ill-posed problem in general. This paper focuses on the short and sparse blind deconvolution problem, where the convolution kernel is short (k ≪ m) and the activation signal is sparsely and randomly supported (llx 0 ll 0 ≪ m). This variant captures the structure of the convolutional signals in several important application scenarios. In this paper, we normalize the convolution kernel to have unit Frobenius norm and then cast the blind deconvolution problem as a nonconvex optimization problem over the kernel sphere. We demonstrate that (i) in a certain region of the sphere, every local optimum is close to some shift truncation of the ground truth, and (ii) for a generic unit kernel a 0 , when the sparsity of activation signal satisfies θ≲k -2/3 and number of measurements m poly (k), the proposed initialization method together with a descent algorithm which escapes strict saddle points recovers some shift truncation of the ground truth kernel.},

  abstract     = {We examine the theoretical properties of enforcing priors provided by generative deep neural networks via empirical risk minimization. In particular we consider two models, one in which the task is to invert a generative neural network given access to its last layer and another in which the task is to invert a generative neural network given only compressive linear observations of its last layer. We establish that in both cases, in suitable regimes of network layer sizes and a randomness assumption on the network weights, that the non-convex objective function given by empirical risk minimization does not have any spurious stationary points. That is, we establish that with high probability, at any point away from small neighborhoods around two scalar multiples of the desired solution, there is a descent direction. Hence, there are no local minima, saddle points, or other stationary points outside these neighborhoods. These results constitute the first theoretical guarantees which establish the favorable global geometry of these non-convex optimization problems, and they bridge the gap between the empirical success of enforcing deep generative priors and a rigorous understanding of non-linear inverse problems.},

  abstract     = {Noiseless compressed sensing refers to the problem of recovering a (high-dimensional) signal from its under-determined linear measurements. For compressed sensing to be feasible, the signal needs to be structured. While the main focus of the field has been on simple structures such as sparsity, there has been a growing interest in moving beyond sparsity and having a comprehensive compressed sensing framework that covers general structures. Two recent approaches that aim at developing such a framework from different perspectives are i) Quantized maximum a posteriori (Q-MAP), a Bayesian method that assumes full knowledge of the source distribution, and ii) Lagrangian minimum entropy pursuit (L-MEP), a universal recovery method that requires no prior knowledge about the distribution of the source. In this paper, by establishing theoretical connections between L-MEP and Q-MAP, it is shown how the two methods are complementary to each other and lead to a theoretically-founded learning-based recovery method that applies to sources with general structures. Unlike a Bayesian or a universal method, a learning-based method is able to extract the source structure from training data. The effect of error in estimating the source structure on the performance of the learning-based compressed sensing recovery method is characterized.},

A rigorous analysis is presented for the dynamics of the algorithm in the large system limit, where both input and output dimensions tend to infinity while the compression rate is kept constant. The main result is the justification of state evolution (SE) equations conjectured by Ma and Ping. This result implies that the EP-based algorithm achieves the Bayes-optimal performance that was originally derived via a non-rigorous tool in statistical physics and proved partially in a recent paper, when the compression rate is larger than a threshold. The proof is based on an extension of a conventional conditioning technique for the standard Gaussian matrix to the case of the Haar matrix.},

  abstract     = {This work considers the cooperative sequential hypothesis testing problem in a distributed network with quantized communication channels. The sensors observe independent sequences of samples and in the meantime, exchange their local information in the form of quantized statistics at every sampling interval. The communication links are represented as an undirected graph. In this distributed setup, every sensor performs its own sequential test based on the local samples and the messages from the neighbour sensors. Our goal is to devise the distributed sequential test that comprises the quantization scheme, the message-exchange protocol and the test procedure such that every sensor in the network fully exploits the network diversity and achieves the (asymptotically) optimal performance in terms of the stopping time. In particular, two distributed sequential tests are proposed based on different quantization schemes and a quantized message-exchange protocol that satisfies certain conditions. The first quantization scheme uniformly quantizes the local statistic at each sensor and at every sampling interval; the second one hinges on a modified level-triggered quantization technique, and resembles the Lebesgue sampling of the running local statistic. Our analyses show that the uniform quantization based distributed sequential test yields sub-optimal performance, while the one based on level-triggered quantization achieves the order-2 asymptotically optimal performance at every sensor for any fixed quantization step-size. Furthermore, we generalize the proposed sequential tests to the cluster-based network. Numerical results are provided to corroborate our analyses and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sequential tests.},

This signature, and thus the underlying hypothetical latent structure, can be tested in a computationally efficient manner via semidefinite programming. This stands in stark contrast with the algebraic geometric tools required if the full observable probability distribution is taken into account.

  abstract     = {Modern data is messy and high-dimensional, and it is often not clear a priori what are the right questions to ask. Instead, the analyst typically needs to use the data to search for interesting analyses to perform and hypotheses to test. This is an adaptive process, where the choice of analysis to be performed next depends on the results of the previous analyses on the same data. Ultimately, which results are reported can be heavily influenced by the data. It is widely recognized that this process, even if well-intentioned, can lead to biases and false discoveries, contributing to the crisis of reproducibility in science. But while any data-exploration renders standard statistical theory invalid, experience suggests that different types of exploratory analysis can lead to disparate levels of bias, and the degree of bias also depends on the particulars of the data set. In this paper, we propose a general information usage framework to quantify and provably bound the bias and other error metrics of an arbitrary exploratory analysis. We prove that our mutual information based bound is tight in natural settings, and then use it to give rigorous insights into when commonly used procedures do or do not lead to substantially biased estimation. Through the lens of information usage, we analyze the bias of specific exploration procedures such as filtering, rank selection and clustering. Our general framework also naturally motivates randomization techniques that provably reduce exploration bias while preserving the utility of the data analysis. We discuss the connections between our approach and related ideas from differential privacy and blinded data analysis, and supplement our results with illustrative simulations.},

However, MatDot codes have higher computation cost per worker and higher communication cost from each worker to the fusion node. We also provide a systematic construction of MatDot codes. Furthermore, we propose “PolyDot” coding that interpolates between Polynomial codes and MatDot codes to trade off computation/communication costs and recovery thresholds.

  abstract     = {Reed-Muller codes are among the most important classes of locally correctable codes. Currently local decoding of Reed-Muller codes is based on decoding on lines or quadratic curves to recover one single coordinate. To recover multiple coordinates simultaneously, the naive way is to repeat the local decoding for recovery of a single coordinate. This decoding algorithm might be more expensive, i.e., require higher query complexity. In this paper, we focus on Reed-Muller codes with usual parameter regime, namely, the total degree of evaluation polynomials is d = Θ(q), where q is the code alphabet size (in fact, d can be as big as q/4 in our setting). By introducing a novel variation of codex, i.e., interleaved codex (the concept of codex has been used for arithmetic secret sharing), we are able to locally recover arbitrarily large number k of coordinates of a Reed-Muller code simultaneously with error probability exp(-Ω(k)) at the cost of querying merely O(q 2 k) coordinates. It turns out that our local decoding of Reed-Muller codes shows (perhaps surprisingly) that accessing k locations is in fact cheaper than repeating the procedure for accessing a single location for k times. Precisely speaking, to get the same success probability by repeating the local decoding algorithm of a single coordinate, one has to query Ω(qk 2 ) coordinates. Thus, the query complexity of our local decoding is smaller for k = Ω(q). If we impose the same query complexity constraint on both algorithm, our local decoding algorithm yields smaller error probability when k = Ω(q q ). In addition, our local decoding is efficient, i.e., the decoding complexity is Poly(k, q). Construction of an interleaved codex is based on concatenation of a codex with a multiplication friendly pair, while the main tool to realize codex is based on algebraic function fields (or more precisely, algebraic geometry codes).},

In this paper, we first consider LRC aiming at joint sequential-parallel repairing multiple failed nodes, and study the (n,k,r,t,u) -ELRCs (Exact locally repairable codes) which are [n,k] linear codes with the property that any set of failed nodes of size at most t can be simultaneously repaired in parallel mode, and each element of a set E of failed nodes of size at most u can be sequentially repaired by r (r&lt;; k) other coordinates. We present a method by which with a given parity-check matrix of an (n,k,r,t,u) -ELRC with minimum Hamming distance d, a new ELRC with minimum Hamming distance 2d and availability t+1 is constructed that can repair each set of failed nodes E of size at most 2u+1 in sequential mode and this repair is done in at most u-t+2 steps.

  abstract     = {Locally repairable codes, or locally recoverable codes (LRC for short), are designed for applications in distributed and cloud storage systems. Similar to classical block codes, there is an important bound called the Singleton-type bound for locally repairable codes. In this paper, an optimal locally repairable code refers to a block code achieving this Singleton-type bound. Like classical MDS codes, optimal locally repairable codes carry some very nice combinatorial structures. Since the introduction of the Singleton-type bound for locally repairable codes, people have put tremendous effort into construction of optimal locally repairable codes. There are a few constructions of optimal locally repairable codes in the literature. Most of these constructions are realized via either combinatorial or algebraic structures. In this paper, we apply automorphism group of the rational function field to construct optimal locally repairable codes by considering the group action on projective lines over finite fields. Due to various subgroups of the projective general linear group, we are able to construct optimal locally repairable codes with flexible locality as well as smaller alphabet size comparable to the code length. In particular, we produce new families of q-ary locally repairable codes, including codes of length q+1 via cyclic groups.},

The eavesdropping model we consider is that the eavesdropper has the capability to observe the data involved in the repair of a subset of I nodes. An (n, k, d, I) secure exact-repair regenerating code is an (n, k, d) exact-repair regenerating code that is secure under this eavesdropping model. It has been shown that for some parameters (n, k, d, I), the associated optimal storage-bandwidth tradeoff curve, which has one corner point, can be determined.

  abstract     = {We study the exact, non-deterministic conversion of multipartite pure quantum states into one-another via local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and asymptotic entanglement transformation under such channels. In particular, we consider the maximal number of copies of any given target state that can be extracted exactly from many copies of any given initial state as a function of the exponential decay in the success probability, known as the converse error exponent. We give a formula for the optimal rate presented as an infimum over the asymptotic spectrum of LOCC conversion. A full understanding of exact asymptotic extraction rates between pure states in the converse regime thus depends on a full understanding of this spectrum. We present a characterization of spectral points and use it to describe the spectrum in the bipartite case. This leads to a full description of the spectrum and thus an explicit formula for the asymptotic extraction rate between pure bipartite states, given a converse error exponent. This extends the result on entanglement concentration in [1], where the target state is fixed as the Bell state. In the limit of vanishing converse error exponent, the rate formula provides an upper bound on the exact asymptotic extraction rate between two states, when the probability of success goes to 1. In the bipartite case, we prove that this bound holds with equality.},

This is to say that after 2(d-1) 2 iterations, such a map sends every positive semidefinite matrix to a positive definite one. This finding does not depend on the number of Kraus operators as the map may not admit any Kraus decomposition.

It enables us to formulate the description of the recently-introduced `coherent parity check&#39; quantum error correction codes entirely within the language of classical information theory. This makes our construction accessible without requiring background in quantum error correction or even quantum mechanics in general. More importantly, this allows for a collaborative interplay where one can design new quantum error correction codes derived from classical codes.},

  abstract     = {Consider the problem of guessing the realization of a random vector X by repeatedly submitting queries (guesses) of the form “Is X equal to x?” until an affirmative answer is obtained. In this setup, a key figure of merit is the number of queries required until the right vector is identified, a number that is termed the guesswork. Typically, one wishes to devise a guessing strategy which minimizes a certain guesswork moment. In this work, we study a universal, decentralized scenario where the guesser does not know the distribution of X, and is not allowed to use a strategy which prepares a list of words to be guessed in advance, or even remember which words were already used. Such a scenario is useful, for example, if bots within a Botnet carry out a brute-force attack in order to guess a password or decrypt a message, yet cannot coordinate the guesses between them or even know how many bots actually participate in the attack. We devise universal decentralized guessing strategies, first, for memoryless sources, and then generalize them for finite-state sources. In each case, we derive the guessing exponent, and then prove its asymptotic optimality by deriving a compatible converse bound. The strategies are based on randomized guessing using a universal distribution. We also extend the results to guessing with side information. Finally, for all above scenarios, we design efficient algorithms in order to sample from the universal distributions, resulting in strategies which do not depend on the source distribution, are efficient to implement, and can be used asynchronously by multiple agents.},

  abstract     = {We study a two-stage identification problem with pre-processing to enable efficient data retrieval and reconstruction. In the enrollment phase, users&#39; data are stored into the database in two layers. In the identification phase an observer obtains an observation, which originates from an unknown user in the enrolled database through a memoryless channel. The observation is sent for processing in two stages. In the first stage, the observation is pre-processed, and the result is then used in combination with the stored first layer information in the database to output a list of compatible users to the second stage. Then the second step uses the information of users contained in the list from both layers and the original observation sequence to return the exact user identity and a corresponding reconstruction sequence. The rate-distortion regions are characterized for both discrete and Gaussian scenarios. Specifically, for a fixed list size and distortion level, the compression-identification trade-off in the Gaussian scenario results in three different operating cases characterized by three auxiliary functions. While the choice of the auxiliary random variable for the first layer information is essentially unchanged when the identification rate is varied, the second one is selected based on the dominant function within those three. Due to the presence of a mixture of discrete and continuous random variables, the proof for the Gaussian case is highly non-trivial, which makes a careful measure theoretic analysis necessary. In addition, we study a connection of the previous setting to a two observer identification and a related problem with a lower bound for the list size, where the latter is motivated from privacy concerns.},

  abstract     = {The K-user discrete memoryless (DM) broadcast channel (BC) with two nested multicast messages is studied in which one common message is to be multicast to all receivers and the second private message to a subset of receivers. The receivers that must decode both messages are referred to as private receivers and the others that must decode only the common message as common receivers. For two nested multicast messages, we establish the capacity region for several classes of partially ordered DM BCs characterized by the respective associated sets of pair-wise relationships between and among the common and private receivers, each described by the well-known pair-wise more capable or less noisy condition. For three classes of partially ordered DM BCs, the capacity region is shown to be simply achieved by two-level superposition coding and the proofs of the converses rely on a recently found information inequality. The rate region achievable by two-level superposition coding is then enhanced through a multi-level superposition coding scheme after splitting the private message into as many parts as there are common receivers and indirect decoding. A closed-form two-dimensional polyhedral (polygonal) description is obtained for it for a given coding distribution in spite of the indeterminate number of split rates via a structured form of Fourier-Motzkin elimination. Through a converse result that relies on the Csiszar sum lemma and that information inequality, a specialization of this region that corresponds to splitting the private message into just two sub-messages is proved to be the capacity region for several classes of partially ordered DM BCs beyond those for which two-level superposition coding is capacity optimal, thereby underscoring the benefit of rate-splitting. All previously known capacity results for partially ordered DM BCs with two nested multicast messages for the two and three-receiver DM BCs as well as DM BCs with one private or one common receiver are subsumed in the general results obtained in this work.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates the general two-user compound Broadcast Channel (BC) in which an encoder wishes to transmit two private messages W1 and W2 to two receivers while being oblivious to the actual channel realizations controlling the communication. The focus is on the characterization of the largest achievable rate region by resorting to more involved encoding and decoding techniques than the usual coding schemes of the standard BC. Involved decoding schemes are first explored, and an achievable rate region is derived based on the principle of Interference Decoding (ID), in which each receiver decodes its intended message and chooses to (non-uniquely) decode, or not, the interfering non-itended message. This decoding scheme is shown to be capacity achieving for a class of non-trivial compound BEC/BSC broadcast channels while the worst-case of Marton&#39;s inner bound-based on No Interference Decoding (NID)-fails to achieve the capacity region. Involved encoding schemes are later investigated, and an achievable rate region is derived based on Multiple Description (MD) coding wherin the encoder transmits a common description as well as multiple dedicated private descriptions to the many possible channel realizations of the users. It turns out that MD coding yields larger inner bounds than the single description scheme-Common Description (CD) coding-for a class of compound Multiple Input Single Output Broadcast Channels (MISO BC).},
