The steady-state target is calculated through a steady-state target calculation (SSTC) module, which is combined with the controller in the lower layer designing based on the linear time invariant model. The presence of SSTC makes the recursive feasibility as well as the stability difficult to guarantee. This article presents a promising approach by specifying the solution of SSTC as a function of estimated artificial disturbance, designing the robust invariant set offline and including the invariance condition in SSTC. Hence, the proposed approach in this article guarantees that if SSTC optimization problem is feasible, then the dynamic controller steers the system to the time-varying steady-state target. Furthermore, in order to reduce the conservativeness of the proposed approach, a heuristic online approach with N free control moves is proposed where the invariant set specified offline is acting as a terminal region for the dynamic controller. A numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Fuzzy transfer learning, which is based on fuzzy systems and particularly fuzzy rule-based models, was developed due to its capacity to deal with uncertainty. However, one issue with fuzzy transfer learning, even in the area of general transfer learning, has not been resolved: how to combine and then use knowledge when multiple-source domains are available. This study presents new methods for merging fuzzy rules from multiple domains for regression tasks. Two different settings are separately explored: homogeneous and heterogeneous space. In homogeneous situations, knowledge from the source domains is merged in the form of fuzzy rules. In heterogeneous situations, knowledge is merged in the form of both data and fuzzy rules. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets provide insights into the scope of applications suitable for the proposed methods and validate their effectiveness through comparisons with other state-of-the-art transfer learning methods. An analysis of parameter sensitivity is also included.},

With respect to the master-slave interactions, a decentralized leaderless communication topology has been considered for the control design with time delays in signal transmission. The corresponding forward and backward delays among the master and slaves were assumed to be asymmetric and varying with time. Moreover, to improve the tracking performance of the master and slaves, the decentralized controller is implemented with force feedback strategy to form the closed-loop teleoperation system. For the stability analysis, the fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals with some membership function dependent matrices were employed to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the proposed T-S fuzzy SMMS teleoperation system.

Currently, fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) cannot describe fuzzy nondeterministic knowledge based on the variable fuzzy criterion clearly. To solve this problem, we present an extended FPN model based on the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation. First, the mechanism and the principles of the variable fuzzy criterion under qualitative mapping are introduced. The important theoretical basis of qualitative mapping is detection and integration of perceptual attribute features. Under transition degree function and the qualitative criterion transformation, the qualitative mapping better reflects the cases in which the fuzzy membership criterion is variable. Second, we use the characteristics of the qualitative mapping to propose a structure of attribute fuzzy information granule. Based on the logic operation of fuzzy information granule, we redescribe the four fuzzy production rules which are commonly used, and obtain four kinds of fuzzy qualitative judgment rules. They can explicitly express the occurrence process of transition nodes of FPNs, which strengthens the uncertain knowledge representation ability of FPNs. The new method makes it easy to construct a learning mechanism based on cognition in FPNs.},

However, there is no research on the limit theory and differential calculus of intuitionistic fuzzy functions with several variables based on the four basic operational laws of IFNs. Hence, the aim of this article is to systematically investigate them. In this article, we first introduce the concepts of limits and iterated limits, and then discuss their properties, based on which, we reveal their relationships among the limits, the iterated limits, and continuities. Finally, we offer the notions of the differentials by the intuitionistic fuzzy infinitesimals, and especially, we obtain the concrete values of partial derivatives.

This article fills this gap by providing an analytical nonparametric deep modeling solution based on the mathematical analysis of membership functions assigned to model variables. The nonparametric approach is based on the concept of representing the unknown mappings (between input and output variables) through a fuzzy set with Student-t type membership function, such that the dimension of membership function increases with an increasing data size. This concept of function representation is referred to as Student-t fuzzy-mapping in this article. The most significant feature of this article is to analytically derive the mathematical expressions for membership functions (which quantify uncertainties regarding the values of variables) using variational optimization such that the degree-of-belongingness of given data to the considered datamodel is maximized. This article focuses on the modeling of image features, where a layer of the deep-model first projects the feature vector onto a lower dimensional subspace, and then construct the output feature vector through Student-t fuzzy-mappings. Numerous image classification experiments are provided to support the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) is of particular significance for reasoning in the presence of insufficient knowledge or sparse rule bases. As one of the most popular FRI methods, transformation-based fuzzy rule interpolation (TFRI) works by constructing an intermediate fuzzy rule, followed by running scale and move transformations. The process of intermediate rule construction selects a user-defined number of rules closest to an observation that does not match any existing rule, using a distance metric. It relies upon heuristically computed weights to assess the contribution of individual selected rules. This process requires a move operation in an effort to force the intermediate rule to overlap with an unmatched observation, regardless of what rules are selected and how much contribution they may each make. It is, therefore, desirable to avoid this problem and also to improve the automation of rule interpolation without resorting to the user&#39;s intervention for fixing the number of closest rules. This article proposes such a novel approach to selecting a subset of rules from the sparse rule base with an embedded rule weighting scheme for the automatic assembling of the intermediate rule. Systematic comparative experimental results are provided on a range of benchmark datasets to demonstrate statistically significant improvement in the performance achieved by the proposed approach over that obtainable using conventional TFRI.},

In addition, the knowledge parameters in existing FPNs are usually given by a small number of experts. To address these issues, a grey reasoning Petri net (GRPN) model is proposed in this article for knowledge representation and reasoning under large group environment. In this model, grey production rules in an expert system are modeled by the GRPNs, where grey numbers are used to represent the truth degrees of places, certainty values, and the thresholds on output arcs of transitions. The grey weighted Bonferroni mean operator is adopted as a substitute of the classical min and max operators in the developed grey reasoning algorithm to capture the interrelationships of input places and the interrelationships between transitions. Furthermore, a large group decision-making method is introduced for obtaining the knowledge parameters of GRPNs based on the grey correlation analysis. Finally, the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed GRPN model is demonstrated by a real-world risk evaluation example.},

Consequently, less communication resources are occupied under the desired H ∞ performance. Second, augmented fuzzy lineintegral Lyapunov function is introduced in the H ∞ performance analysis of filter error systems, such that the information of time derivative of membership functions are fully considered to reduce the conservativeness of networked fuzzy filter design. Different from the existing results, the upper bounds of time derivative of membership functions need not to be known prior. Third, the resulting filter error system is modeled as time-delay system under ETC mechanism and asynchronous premise in a unified framework. As a result, applying Lyapunov theory and inequality technique, new sufficient condition is obtained to meet the H ∞ performance for the filter error systems.

  abstract     = {This article presents two adaptive fuzzy output-feedback dynamic surface control schemes for single-input-single-output (SISO) strict-feedback fractional-order uncertain nonlinear systems under the complete smooth nonlinearity and partial piecewise-smooth nonlinearity, respectively. For the former, complete smooth nonlinear functions are approximated by employing fuzzy logic systems, based on which a novel fractional-order reduced-order observer is constructed to estimate the unmeasurable states. For the latter, a new switched approximation and estimate strategy is proposed to deal with the problem of piecewise-smooth nonlinearity. Meanwhile, fuzzy basis function property is utilized to eliminate the assumption requirement that the nonlinear functions must satisfy the Lipschitz condition inherent in the output-feedback control, which is suitable for two cases. Under certain assumptions, the stability of two closed-loop systems are proved via fractional-order Lyapunov function stability criterion. Specifically, the stability proof of the second case is built on the foundation of the common Lyapunov function method. Finally, two diverse Chua&#39;s circuit simulation examples are provided to, respectively, validate the effectiveness of the proposed two control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the model reduction problem of discrete-time time-delay interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy systems. Compared with the type-1 T–S fuzzy system, the interval type-2 T–S fuzzy system has more advantages in expressing nonlinearity and capturing uncertainties. In addition, in order to simplify the analysis process, complex high-order systems can be approximated as low-order systems, which is called model reduction. In previous studies, there are few researches on model reduction of the interval type-2 T–S fuzzy system with time delay. Hankel norm is adopted to limit the error after model reduction. Based on Jensen&#39;s inequality, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition for the Hankel norm performance of the error system is obtained. A membership-function-dependent method based on piecewise linear membership functions is utilized to deal with mismatched membership functions where information of membership functions will be used for relaxing analysis results. Next, by a convex linearization design, the model reduction problem is formulated as a convex LMI feasibility/optimization condition. Numerical examples are given to verify the validity of the analysis.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of fuzzy sets makes job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP) become better aligned with the reality. This article addresses the JSSP with fuzzy execution time and fuzzy completion time (FJSSP). We choose the classic differential evolution (DE) algorithm as the basic optimization framework. The advantage of the DE algorithm is that it uses a special evolutionary strategy of difference vector sets to carry out mutation operation. However, DE is not very effective in solving some instances of FJSSP. Therefore, we propose a novel selection mechanism augmenting the generic DE algorithm (NSODE) to achieve better optimization results. The proposed selection operator adopted in this article aims at a temporary retention of all children generated by the parent generation, and then selecting N better solutions as the new individuals from N parents and N children. Various examples of fuzzy shop scheduling problems are experimented with to test the performance of the improved DE algorithm. The NSODE algorithm is compared with a variety of existing algorithms such as ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and cuckoo search. Experimental results show that the NSODE can obtain superior feasible solutions compared with solutions produced by several algorithms reported in the literature.},

This article presents a Type-2 fuzzy LSTM (T2F-LSTM) neural network model for long-term traffic volume prediction. T2F Sets (T2FSs) provide more freedom to describe membership information and process data with higher uncertainty better than the traditional fuzzy system does. In this article, an interval T2FSs is introduced to extract the probability distribution and spatial-temporal characteristics of traffic volume. Using parameters of the closure of support obtained in interval T2FSs, weights of input gate in LSTM neural network are updated and converged to the region with a larger slope of the sigmoid function fast. The network interpretability is also increased by better control of the information flow using motivational factors constructed from the parameters.

  abstract     = {Image-based visual servoing (IBVS) allows precise control of positioning and motion for relatively stationary targets using visual feedback. For IBVS, a mixture parameter $\beta$ allows better approximation of the image Jacobian matrix, which has a significant effect on the performance of IBVS. However, the setting for the mixture parameter depends on the camera&#39;s real-time posture; there is no clear way to define the change rules for most IBVS applications. Using simple model-free reinforcement learning, Q-learning, this article proposes a method to adaptively adjust the image Jacobian matrix for IBVS. If the state-space is discretized, traditional Q-learning encounters problems with the resolution that can cause sudden changes in the action, so the visual servoing system performs poorly. Besides, a robot in a real-world environment also cannot learn on as large a scale as virtual agents, so the efficiency with which agents learn must be increased. This article proposes a method that uses fuzzy state coding to accelerate learning during the training phase and to produce a smooth output in the application phase of the learning experience. A method that compensates for delay also allows more accurate extraction of features in a real environment. The results for simulation and experiment demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than other methods, in terms of learning speed, movement trajectory, and convergence time.},

This article proposes a fuzzy adaptive method for decoupled IBVS that allows the efficient control of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR). To address the under-actuated dynamics of the WMR, a decoupled controller is used and translation and rotation are decoupled by using two independent servoing gains, instead of the single servoing gain that is used for traditional IBVS. To reduce the effect of image noise, this article develops an improved bagging method for the decoupled controller that calculates the inverse kinematics and does not use the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse method. To improve convergence, improved Q-learning is used to adaptively adjust the mixture parameter for the image Jacobian matrix (IQ-IBVS). This allows the mixture parameter can be adjusted while the robot moves under the influence of servo control. A fuzzy method is used to tune the learning rate for the IQ-IBVS method, which ensures effective learning. The results of simulation and experiments show that the proposed method performs better than other methods, in terms of convergence.},

Although deep learning (DL) offers an emerging and powerful paradigm of feature learning for these two tasks, it is hampered from popularizing in practical application due to the lack of interpretability, generalization ability, and large labeled training sets. In this article, we propose a hierarchical fused model based on DL and fuzzy learning to overcome the drawbacks for pixelwise segmentation and disease grading of mammography breast images. The proposed system consists of a segmentation model (ResU-segNet) and a hierarchical fuzzy classifier (HFC) that is a fusion of interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy c-means and fuzzy neural network. The ResU-segNet segments the masks of mass regions from the images through convolutional neural networks, while the HFC encodes the features from mass images and masks to obtain the disease grading through fuzzy representation and rule-based learning. Through the integration of feature extraction aided by domain knowledge and fuzzy learning, the system achieves favorable performance in a few-shot learning manner, and the deterioration of cross-dataset generalization ability is alleviated. In addition, the interpretability is further enhanced. The effectiveness of the proposed system is analyzed on the publicly available mammogram database of INbreast and a private database through cross-validation. Thorough comparative experiments are also conducted and demonstrated.},

In recent years, deep learning techniques have achieved significant progress in semantic segmentation, especially in the 2-D image setting. However, due to the irregularity of point clouds, most of them cannot be applied to this special data representation directly. While recent works are able to handle the irregularity problem and maintain the permutation invariance, most of them fail to capture the valuable high-dimensional local feature in fine granularity. Inspired by fuzzy mathematical methods and the analysis on the drawbacks of current state-of-the-art works, in this article, we propose a novel deep neural model, Fuzzy3DSeg, that is able to directly feed in the point clouds while maintaining invariant to the permutation of the data feeding order. We deeply integrate the learning of the fuzzy neighborhood feature of each point into our network architecture, so as to perform operations on high-dimensional features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this network architecture level integration, compared with methods of the fuzzy data preprocessing cascading neural network. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed Fuzzy3DSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Granular structure is a mathematical expression of knowledge in granular computing and a direct determinant of the data processing efficiency. To improve the efficiency of data processing, many scholars have studied the reduction of granular structure. The attribute reduction and the granular reduction are two types of reduction on different layers of a granular structure, with the latter being both an essential step for granular structure reduction and the foundation of the attribute reduction. Yet compared with the attribute reduction, the granular reduction has received less attention from scholars. Therefore, a fuzzy granular reduction theory and a granular matrix based on the fuzzy β-coverings is proposed in this article. The insufficiency of the existing granular reduction theory for fuzzy β-coverings is pointed out, and proper sufficient and necessary conditions for two fuzzy β-coverings generating the same upper and lower approximations are also given in this article. In addition, to reduce and evaluate a fuzzy β-covering, a novel reduction algorithm based on a granular matrix is proposed for the first time. Also, since fuzzy covering reduction is NP-hard, a heuristic greedy algorithm is designed to obtain a reduct. Numerical experiments show that the redundancy rates of neighborhood granule sets induced by some big-scale data sets exceed 99\%, which indicates that the existing neighborhood granulation methods need to be urgently improved. Based on this, concise granular structures and much more efficient feature selection algorithms can be proposed in the future.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) play an important role in high-level reasoning but are limited in their ability to model complex systems with singularities. We are interested in systems that exhibit discontinuous behaviors as one or more of their internal node states approach a threshold. In a new approach to FCM dynamics, we define general classes of aggregation functions which “jump” to a boundary value when any input crosses a threshold, or when all inputs do. The threshold value is a context-dependent parameter which can be readily understood by subject matter experts. Aggregation functions are applied separately to positively and negatively causal antecedents to each node then combined to form the nodal state. This modeling is applied in Computing with Words (CWW) settings, in which link strengths and activation levels are elicited using vocabulary words represented by interval type-2 fuzzy membership functions. We illustrate the behaviors of these novel FCM systems in comparison with their nonsingularity versions.},

  abstract     = {The problem of time series prediction based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) is unresolved. Although many methods have been proposed to cope with this issue, the performance of these methods is far from satisfactory. Traditional FCM-based predictors have three limitations. First, current feature extraction operators are incapable of learning good representations of original time series. Second, current methods use just the output of FCMs to predict the next value; they do not directly utilize the important information of the latent features. Third, current FCM-based predictors optimize each component individually, thereby leading to low prediction accuracy. For example, these methods first optimize the feature extraction operator and then learn the FCMs from the latent features; they do not simultaneously optimize the whole prediction model. In this article, we develop a framework based on a sparse autoencoder (SAE) and a high-order FCM (HFCM) to address the time series prediction problem; we refer this framework as SAE-FCM. To overcome the first limitation of current methods, an SAE is employed to extract features from original time series. Unlike current FCM-based predictors, our method combines the output of both the SAE and the HFCM to calculate the predicted value, thereby overcoming the second limitation of traditional FCM-based predictors. In an application of the idea of “fine tuning” in deep learning, the weights of SAE-FCM can be updated by the batch gradient descent method if the prediction errors are great. Thus, we can optimize SAE-FCM as a whole and overcome the third limitation. We validate the performance of SAE-FCM on ten datasets. Compared with the experimental results obtained by using state-of-the-art methods, the experimental results obtained by using SAE-FCM demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments also show that SAE-FCM can effectively overcome the above limitations.},

However, most existing soft multiview clustering methods only consider the pairwise correlations and ignore high-order correlations among multiple views. To integrate more comprehensive information from different views, this article innovates a fuzzy clustering model using the low-rank tensor to address the multiview data clustering problem. Our method first conducts a standard fuzzy clustering on different views of the data separately. Then, the obtained soft partition results are aggregated as the new data to be handled by a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based fuzzy model with low-rank tensor constraints. The KL divergence function, which replaces the traditional minimized Euclidean distance, can enhance the robustness of the model. More importantly, we formulate fuzzy partition matrices of different views as a third-order tensor. So, a low-rank tensor is introduced as a norm constraint in the KL divergence-based fuzzy clustering to obtain dexterously high-order correlations of different views. The minimization of the final model is convex and we present an efficient augmented Lagrangian alternating direction method to handle this problem. Specially, the global membership is derived by using tensor factorization. The efficiency and superiority of the proposed approach are demonstrated by the comparison with state-of-the-art multiview clustering algorithms on many multiple-view data sets.},

Alongside, graph-based pattern recognition has shown to be of great importance due to its flexibility in partitioning the feature space using the background from graph theory. Some years ago, a new framework for supervised, semisupervised, and unsupervised learning, named optimum-path forest (OPF), was proposed with competitive results in several applications, besides comprising a low computational burden. In this article, we propose the fuzzy OPF, an improved version of the standard OPF classifier, that learns the samples&#39; membership in an unsupervised fashion, which are further incorporated during supervised training. Such information is used to identify the most relevant training samples, thus improving the classification step. Experiments conducted over 12 public datasets highlight the robustness of the proposed approach, which behaves similarly to standard OPF in worst case scenarios.},

This article proposes a minibatch gradient descent (MBGD) based algorithm to efficiently and effectively train TSK fuzzy classifiers. It integrates two novel techniques: First, uniform regularization (UR), which forces the rules to have similar average contributions to the output, and hence to increase the generalization performance of the TSK classifier; and, second, batch normalization (BN), which extends BN from deep neural networks to TSK fuzzy classifiers to expedite the convergence and improve the generalization performance. Experiments on 12 UCI datasets from various application domains, with varying size and dimensionality, demonstrated that UR and BN are effective individually, and integrating them can further improve the classification performance.},

The disjoint subsets turned out to be beneficial to the improvement of the quality of the clusters formed by the clustering algorithms.

However, its rule redundancy and dimension disaster remain an open and unsolved issue. In this article, a novel fuzzy modeling method is proposed to reduce the fuzzy rule number without a loss in modeling accuracy. It includes two novel mechanisms: the rule fusion mechanism and the space projection mechanism. The rule fusion mechanism is developed to merge several rules into one according to similarity. In this way, the number of rules will greatly decrease. After the rules are merged, the relationship of data is strongly nonlinear, which renders the local linear model ineffective. In order to alleviate this difficulty, the space projection mechanism is then proposed to project the low-dimensional feature space to a high-dimension space. In this high-dimension space, the relation of data is linear and easily represented by a linear model. In this way, the traditional fuzzy inference is still applicative. With the help of these two mechanisms, a fuzzy model with few rules is constructed, which enables reconstruction of the nonlinear system. A solving method is then developed to determine the optimal parameters of the fuzzy model. Additional analysis and proof show that the proposed method exhibits the uniform approximation ability for strongly nonlinear systems. Case studies not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, but also demonstrate its superior modeling performance in comparison to several conventional fuzzy modeling methods, even with the use of fewer rules.},

To calculate a pair of decision-making thresholds, an analytic method was proposed by solving a minimization problem of the uncertainty arising from the three areas. However, some uncertainty will be lost in the process of constructing the shadowed set model using Pedrycz&#39;s method. Moreover, few references on how to measure the uncertainty of shadow sets exist. In this article, a comprehensible method for measuring the fuzzy entropy of a shadowed set, i.e., interval fuzzy entropy, is defined. Based on the interval fuzzy entropy, a new shadowed set model, namely, interval shadowed sets, is proposed. Compared with Pedrycz&#39;s model, the main difference is that the range of the shadow area in this model is [β, α] (0 ≤ β &lt;; α ≤ 1) while not [0, 1]. By solving a fuzzy entropy loss-minimization problem, a pair of optimal thresholds, α and β, can be obtained. Finally, the results of the instance analysis of different types of representative membership functions and many experiments show that the fuzzy entropy loss of the interval shadowed set is lower than that of the traditional shadowed set of a fuzzy set. These results enrich shadowed set theory from a new perspective.},

This article offers a fresh insight into rough set theory from the perspective of $N$ -soft sets. We reveal a close connection between $N$ -soft sets and rough structures of various types. First, we show how the corresponding structures of Pawlak&#39;s rough sets, tolerance rough sets, and multigranulation rough sets can be derived from a given $N$ -soft set. Conversely, we investigate the representation of these distinct rough structures using the corresponding notions derived from suitable $N$ -soft sets. The applicability of these theoretical results is highlighted with a case study using real data regarding hotel rating. The established two-way correspondences between $N$ -soft sets and diverse rough structures are constructive, which can bridge the gap between seemingly disconnected disciplines and hopefully nourish the development of both rough sets and soft sets.},

  abstract     = {It is widely accepted that distributivity properties play a key role in fuzzy research, especially in fuzzy control. Making use of the solution of the autodistributivity functional equations, we give a characterization of all the four types of distributivity of fuzzy implication. The necessary and sufficient condition for all the four distributive equation is that the operator belongs to the pliant operator class. This theorem leads to a new implication called preference implication. It is well known that there is no implication in (continuous-valued) fuzzy logic that satisfies all the properties that are valid in (classical) two-valued logic. We show that preference implication fulfills: 1) the law of contraposition, 2) the T-conditionality, 3) the ordering property, 4) the exchange principle, 5) the law of importation, 6) the identity principle, and 7) the general hypothetical reasoning. Preference implication has a ν parameter, i.e., the fixed point of the negation. This ν value serves as a threshold and with this value we can go back by projection to the two-valued logic case. At the end of the article, we indicate that the preference implication is closely related to the preference relation used in multicriteria decision making. We point out that if the preference implication is multiplicative, transitive, and reciprocal, then the pliant system is reduced to some particular generator function of Dombi.},

  abstract     = {The learning of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) is a timely issue pursued by numerous researchers. Many learning methods, such as population-based algorithms and some hybrid algorithms, have been developed and applied to many fields resulting in better performance. However, those learning algorithms also exhibit obvious limitations: some of them either are difficult to handle the learning problem of large-scale FCM or extremely time-consuming with high computational overload. Furthermore, the learning problem of FCM with noisy data is rarely considered in existing algorithms. In this article, a fast and efficient method for learning FCM is proposed. It first transforms the learning problem of the FCM into a convex optimization problem with constraints, and then, the classic interior-point methods are invoked to solve the optimization problem to obtain the optimized weight matrix of the FCM. A series of experiments involving synthetic data, noisy synthetic data, real data, and publicly available data with noise are considered to demonstrate that the proposed method can rapidly and efficiently learn small-scale and large-scale FCMs and deal with the problem of learning FCM from noisy historical data.},

  abstract     = {Establishing fuzzy models from time-series data with predictive capabilities for numerical targets typically requires dimension reduction techniques to overcome the severe curse of dimensionality effects. Linear projection methods are promising candidates in this context as they-unlike nonlinear dimension reduction techniques-preserve interpretability of the resulting models. However, linear projections do not reveal the inherent (nonlinear, local) cluster structure of the data and are thus not ideally suited for the identification of fuzzy rule bases. To overcome this limitation, in this article, we present a new fuzzy modeling approach that combines generalized fuzzy systems modeling with a local structure preserving variant of partial least squares (PLS). In contrast to ordinary PLS, our approach maps a weighted (adjacency) graph on the directions associated with high covariance with the response in order to emphasize local data structures when constructing the latent variable (LV) space. This operates into the direction from which the (training of the) fuzzy model benefits, as therein local regions are represented by submodels in form of generalized Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy rules. The local structure preserving LV space is obtained by solving a new penalized objective function, which assures global optimality of the solutions by virtue of the specific properties of the Laplacian matrix. Local regions are characterized in two ways: through nearest neighbor points (assuming fixed local region sizes) and through density regions identified by clustering (achieving variable local region sizes). To establish a robust time-series-based forecast model, the training of a generalized TS fuzzy model is conducted in the LV space with reduced dimensionality. It is realized by an iterative robust version of Gen-Smart-EFS, allowing multiple passes over the complete datasets until convergence of the antecedent space. Consequent parameters are estimated by a fuzzily weighted elastic net approach, embedding a convex combination of ridge regression and Lasso to achieve robust solutions also in case of ill-posed problems and meeting the (more stable and interpretable) local learning spirit. The new approach is termed as LS-PLS-Fuzzy, short for local structure preserving PLS fuzzy regression. It was successfully evaluated on three real-world application scenarios including a total of 11 time-series-based prediction modeling problems with different proportions between the number of training samples and original input dimensionality. Our results show significantly improved model accuracy compared to related State-of-the-Art (SoA) modeling approaches, an alternative dimension reduction technique, and when using conventional PLS and/or nongeneralized fuzzy rules.},

  abstract     = {With a growing number of areas leveraging interval-valued data-including in the context of modeling human uncertainty (e.g., in cybersecurity), the capacity to accurately and systematically compare intervals for reasoning and computation is increasingly important. In practice, well established set-theoretic similarity measures, such as the Jaccard and Sørensen-Dice measures, are commonly used, whereas axiomatically, a wide breadth of possible measures have been theoretically explored. This article identifies, articulates, and addresses an inherent and so far not discussed limitation of popular measures-their tendency to be subject to aliasing-where they return the same similarity value for very different sets of intervals. The latter risks counter-intuitive results and poor-automated reasoning in real-world applications dependent on systematically comparing interval-valued system variables or states. Given this, we introduce new axioms establishing desirable properties for robust similarity measures, followed by putting forward a novel set-theoretic similarity measure based on the concept of bidirectional subsethood, which satisfies both traditional and new axioms. The proposed measure is designed to be sensitive to the variation in the size of intervals, thus avoiding aliasing. This article provides a detailed theoretical exploration of the new proposed measure, and systematically demonstrates its behavior using an extensive set of synthetic and real-world data. Specifically, the measure is shown to return robust outputs that follow intuition-essential for real-world applications. For example, we show that it is bounded above and below by the Jaccard and Sørensen-Dice similarity measures (when the minimum t-norm is used). Finally, we show that a dissimilarity or distance measure, which satisfies the properties of a metric, can easily be derived from the proposed similarity measure.},

  abstract     = {With the increase of technological and societal demands, more and more decision makers are involved in the process of group decision making, which is called large-scale group decision making (LGDM). For an LGDM problem with linguistic information, it is common that different decision makers tend to provide linguistic assessments defined on multigranular linguistic term sets due to the difference in knowledge and culture background, and that hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) are used by decision makers to model the hesitancy of their assessments. This article proposes first an algorithm to represent a linguistic distribution assessment (LDA) using a hesitant linguistic distribution (HLD). Two other algorithms are then proposed to transform an unbalanced HFLTS into a balanced LDA and to transform a balanced LDA into an unbalanced LDA, respectively. An approach is then proposed to deal with multiattribute LGDM problems with multigranular unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic information based on these algorithms. In the proposed approach, all unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic information is transformed into LDAs defined on a balanced linguistic term set, and then an LDA-based clustering algorithm is devised to cluster decision makers. Based on the clustering result, decision makers&#39; linguistic distribution decision matrices are further fused to obtain collective assessments of alternatives. In order to provide easy-to-understand linguistic results for decision makers, all LDAs of alternatives are represented by HLDs defined on each decision maker&#39;s initial linguistic term set. Finally, an example for the selection of subway lines is used to demonstrate the proposed approach.},

Among various clustering techniques, the fuzzy clustering has been widely adopted in overlapping community detection, since the soft assignment provided by it naturally meets the overlapping between multiple communities. The crucial step of fuzzy-clustering-based overlapping community detection is to find the optimal community centers, so that the overlapping communities can be obtained according to the membership degrees between nodes and community centers. In this article, we propose an evolutionary multiobjective optimization-based fuzzy method for overlapping community detection. In contrast to traditional fuzzy clustering methods, the proposed method optimizes the community centers by using a specially tailored multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Moreover, it can also find an appropriate fuzzy threshold for each node, so that diverse overlapping community structures can be uncovered. In the experiments, we compare the proposed method with six state-of-the-art overlapping community detection approaches on synthetic and real-world networks with different scales and characteristics. The statistical results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain the best results on most test instances.},

AFS theory provides a unified and coherent way to deal with uncertainty of randomness and imprecision of fuzziness in data mining and knowledge discovery, which support many investigations in classification area. However, the existing AFS-based classifiers are weak in obtaining the optimal semantic description. To address this drawback, a new measure, named semantic entropy extended in Shannon&#39;s entropy, is developed to evaluate the discriminatory capabilities of semantic descriptions for each category. Moreover, the semantic entropy is utilized to design a classifier in the framework of AFS theory, called axiomatic fuzzy set and semantic entropy (AFSSE), which is capable of achieving sound classification performance and interpretability. Meanwhile, it provides a new framework of classifier design that can adapt more human-oriented recognition mechanisms. Furthermore, an evaluation index is used to prune descriptions to deliver a promising performance. Compared to the previous AFS-based classifiers, the proposed approach offers a semantic entropy to measure the information that is derived from semantic descriptions of data, so that the optimal semantic descriptions of each class can be obtained. For the purpose of illustrating the effectiveness of the classifier, several datasets are utilized to facilitate a comparative analysis of the proposed approach and other state-of-the-art classifiers. The experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve the semantic descriptions of each class and the performance of AFSSE is comparable with the performance of other approaches.},

  abstract     = {Neural network based clustering methods usually have better performance compared to the conventional approaches due to more efficient feature extraction. Most of existing deep clustering techniques either exploit graph information as prior to extract pivotal deep structure from the raw data and simply utilizes stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, they often suffer from separating the learning steps regarding dimensionality reduction and clustering. To address these issues, a novel deep model named as deep fuzzy k-means (DFKM) with adaptive loss function and entropy regularization is proposed. DFKM performs deep feature extraction and fuzzy clustering simultaneously to generate a more appropriate nonlinear feature map. Additionally, DFKM incorporates FKM so that fuzzy information is utilized to represent a clear structure of deep clusters. To further promote the robustness of the model, a robust loss function is applied to the objective with adaptive weights. Moreover, an entropy regularization is employed for affinity to provide confidence of each assignment and the corresponding membership and centroid matrices are updated by close-form solutions rather than SGD. Extensive experiments show that DFKM has better performance compared to the state-of-the-art fuzzy clustering techniques under three clustering metrics.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a new classifier design method that is based on a modification of the traditional fuzzy clustering. First, a new fuzzy ordered c-means clustering is proposed. This method can be considered as a generalization of the concept of the conditional fuzzy clustering by introducing ordering and weighting distances from data to cluster prototypes. As a result, a more local impact of data on created groups and increased repulsive force between group prototypes are obtained. The proposed method provides a better representation of the data classes, in particular for classes with small cardinality in the training set (imbalanced data). A special initialization of the prototypes is also introduced. Next, the proposed clustering method is used to construct the premises of if-then rules of a fuzzy classifier. The conclusions of the rules are obtained by the least angle regression algorithm, which selects only those rules, that maximize the generalization ability of a classifier. Each if-then rule is represented in easily interpretable Mamdani-Assilian form. Finally, an extensive experimental analysis on 89 benchmark balanced and imbalanced datasets is performed to demonstrate the validity of the introduced classifier. Its competitiveness to state-of-the-art classifiers, with respect to both performance and interpretability, is shown as well.},

It aims at determining the optimal sequence of processing jobs on available machines within a given customer order. In this article, a novel biobjective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for FSS with an outsourcing option and just-in-time delivery in order to simultaneously minimize the total cost of the production system and total energy consumption. Each job is considered to be either scheduled in-house or to be outsourced to one of the possible subcontractors. To efficiently solve the problem, a hybrid technique is proposed based on an interactive fuzzy solution technique and a self-adaptive artificial fish swarm algorithm (SAAFSA). The proposed model is treated as a single objective MILP using a multiobjective fuzzy mathematical programming technique based on the ε-constraint, and SAAFSA is then applied to provide Pareto optimal solutions. The obtained results demonstrate the usefulness of the suggested methodology and high efficiency of the algorithm in comparison with CPLEX solver in different problem instances. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is implemented on the main parameters to study the behavior of the objectives according to the real-world conditions.},

A fuzzy multicriteria modeling is of importance for the problem of fuzzy scheduling in SOM. In this article, four comprehensive models are proposed, which are different in the uncertain degree of considered performance criteria and/or defuzzification timepoints of fuzzy values. For each model, all weighted criteria are aggregated by using an exponential benefit function. For solving the models, three scheduling algorithms, namely one-level fuzzy ant colony optimization (OFACO), two-level single optimization fuzzy ACO (TSFACO), and two-level double optimization fuzzy ACO (TDFACO), are proposed. OFACO takes the view of the whole set of tasks on the SOM platform only whereas TSFACO and TDFACO consider both the view of the whole set of tasks and the view of individual task. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy models and scheduling schemes are compared, respectively, using test datasets with varying sizes. The test results show that the first model with fuzzy objective is better for type-1 fuzzy uncertainty whereas the second model with defuzzified objective is better for type-2 fuzzy uncertainty and TDFACO outperforms the other two scheduling schemes in terms of the proposed integrated fuzzy multicriteria performance both from the individual task perspective and the whole task perspective.},

However, the enormous amount of data generated by sensors, occupational, and meteorological data involve the use of new management systems and data processing.

They have attracted substantial attention from enterprise operators and researchers in recent years. In this article, a membership function is used to connect the function values of many-objective optimization problems with a fuzzy membership degree. An approach for mapping function values to fuzzy sets is presented. Thus, the fuzzy relative entropy (FRE) can be employed in many-objective PFSPs. A many-objective PFSP model with four objectives, namely, the makespan, total tardiness, inventory holding cost, and energy consumption cost, is established. The optimal foraging algorithm (OFA) with FRE (OFA/FRE) is proposed for solving many-objective PFSPs. FRE is used as the fitness strategy of OFA. OFA/FRE is evaluated in three classification experiments and compared with five algorithms on the Walking-Fish-Group test suite, PFSP benchmark instances, and a practical PFSP for machine tool components. The results demonstrate that OFA/FRE is a promising tool for many-objective PFSP. The FRE can be used in scheduling problems and in many-objective optimization problems.},

The significant criteria considered for portfolio selection are risk (variance or conditional value at risk), return, liquidity, and entropy. Here, the return of the portfolio is considered to be satisfied by a minimum return threshold constraint. Also, to introduce some degree of diversification in the model, a lower and upper bound constraint on investment in an asset is used along with the capital budget and no short selling constraints. Trapezoidal fuzzy returns are considered to incorporate the inherent uncertainty of the stock market, which is handled by using the credibility theory. The weighted sum approach is used to aggregate the objectives and characterize different investor attitudes. Random sample portfolios with progressively increasing sample sizes are generated that obey the constraints of the portfolio models. These random sample portfolios with multiple inputs (risk and entropy) and multiple outputs (return and liquidity) are evaluated in terms of their performance by using data envelopment analysis. Furthermore, a frontier improvement technique existing in the literature is used to rebalance the inefficient random sample portfolios to make them efficient, so that an investor may have more avenues to select efficient portfolios. A detailed numerical illustration with a simulation study using different sample sizes is presented to substantiate the proposed study.},

Having this goal and mentioned highly important contributions in the field, this article introduces an unprecedented integrated mathematical model for a green solid transportation system with dwell time to execute the carbon tax, cap, and offset regulation. Due to market fluctuations, the supply and demand parameters are not always of crisp nature. Hence, a twofold (type-2 intuitionistic) uncertainty is incorporated in this article to provide a realistic transportation system. A new ranking defuzzification technique is presented for conversion into a deterministic form. After that, a fuzzy technique and a nonfuzzy technique are used to get the Pareto-optimal solution of the proposed problem. The performances of our findings are discussed with industrial-based application examples. Moreover, a comparative study is explored among the other relevant existing techniques.

For the HMS simulated in this article, costs, loss of power supply probability, pollutant emissions, and power balance are considered as objective functions. For the proposed algorithm, we employ two archives with different diversity selection strategies to balance convergence and diversity in the high-dimensional objective space. In addition, a fuzzy decision making method is proposed to further help decision makers obtain a solution from the Pareto front that optimally balances the objectives. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the HMS sizing optimization problem is investigated for the case of Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The experimental results show that, compared with the two-archive evolutionary algorithm for constrained many-objective optimization (C-TAEA), the clustering-based adaptive many-objective evolutionary algorithm (CA-MOEA), and the improved decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm (I-DBEA), the proposed algorithm can reduce the system costs by 7\%, 13\%, and 21\%, respectively.},

As a man-machine system, the proposed system can accurately identify the human driver from natural operating signals and provides driver-identified globally optimal control policies as opposed to mere control actions. To help improve the identifiability and efficiency of this control system, the method of spectrum-guided fuzzy feature extraction (SFFE) is developed. First, the configuration of the HEV model and its control system are analyzed. Second, design procedures of the SFFE algorithm are set out to extract 15 groups of features from primitive operating signals. Third, long-term and short-term memory networks are developed as a driver recognizer and tested by the features. The driver identity maps to corresponding control policies optimized by dynamic programming. Finally, the comparative study includes involved extraction methods and their identification system performance as well as their application to HEV systems. The results demonstrate that with help of the SFFE, the driver recognizer improves identifiability by at least 10\% compared to that obtained using other involved extraction methods. The improved HEV system is a significant advance over the 5.53\% reduction on fuel consumption obtained by the fuzzy-logic-based system.},

  abstract     = {Forecasting time series is an emerging topic in operational research. Existing time-series models have limited prediction accuracy when faced with the characteristics of nonlinearity and nonstationarity in complex situations related to energy and finance. To enhance overall prediction capabilities and improve forecasting accuracy, in this article we propose a fuzzy interval time-series forecasting model on the basis of network-based multiple time-frequency spaces and the induced-ordered weighted averaging aggregation (IOWA) operation. Specifically, a time-series signal is decomposed into ensemble empirical modes and then reconstructed as various time-frequency spaces, which are transformed into visibility graphs. Then, forecasting intervals in different spaces can be collected after the local random walker link prediction model is adopted. Furthermore, a rule-based representation value function inspired by Yager&#39;s golden rule approach is defined, and an appropriate representation value is calculated. Finally, after IOWA is used to aggregate the forecasting outcomes in different time-frequency spaces, the final forecast value can be obtained from the fuzzy forecasting interval. Considering that energy issues are of widespread interest in nature and the social economy, two cases, based on a hydrological time series from the Biliuhe River in China and two well-known sets of financial time-series data, Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index and Hang Seng Index, are studied to test the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with existing models. Our results show that the proposed approach can achieve better performance than well-developed models.},

  abstract     = {The papers in this special section focus on smart fuzzy optimization in operational research and renewable energy. Over the last five decades, fuzzy optimization has found numerous successful applications in diverse fields, including operational research (OR), manufacturing, information technology, energy optimization, data science, smart cities, and big data analytics. Fuzzy optimization has strongly influenced research and development into other areas of intelligent computing leading to many hybrid and deep learning systems. It has opened new horizons in thinking, research and development and it will guide us into another half century of progress. In actually, fuzzy optimization is an approximation of nonlinear optimization, which has formed a systematic but not yet unified theory of fuzzy systems and other fuzzy-set based methodologies. Fuzzy optimization along with decision making is an interdisciplinary area, which focuses on extracting useful knowledge with data technology and employing it. Specific topics include fuzzy sets, rough sets, statistical methods, parallel/distributed data mining, hybrid fuzzy optimization, hybrid evolutionary and swarm intelligence methods, big data optimization, IoTs, flexibility, reliability and robustness, smart systems, high-dimensional and big-data analytics, energy optimization, and software engineering.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new nonlinear system identification technique, leveraging the benefits of the Type-2 Evolutionary Takagi-Sugeno (T2-ETS) fuzzy system. The major advantage of our proposed system identification technique is mainly due to its ability to learn-from-scratch while accommodating the footprint-of-uncertainties (FoUs). To support its mission to achieve a reasonably high prediction accuracy for uncertain nonlinear dynamic systems, we also introduce a new type reduction method to convert Type-2 fuzzy systems into their Type-1 counterparts. As a part of its efficient pruning strategy, the proposed system incorporates the concept of information entropy to avoid over fitting, which is a highly undesirable issue in modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system identification technique in achieving a delicate balance between minimizing the complexity of the acquired fuzzy model and maximizing the prediction accuracy. To highlight the efficacy of our algorithm, we employ a set of challenging pH neutralization data, known for its substantial nonlinearity, in addition to the dynamics of a nonlinear mechanical system. We conclude our research by conducting a rigorous comparative study to quantify the relative merits of our proposed technique with respect to the previous ETS algorithm (as its predecessor), the well-known KM-type reduction technique, and the higher-order discrete transfer functions, widely implemented in most conventional mathematical modeling techniques.},

A sufficient condition of asymptotic stability and extended dissipativity of the systems under consideration is established by using line-integral Lyapunov function. This condition obtained is more general than the one which is based on quadratic Lyapunov function. Calculating the control gains in light of the obtained condition is more complicated and challenging, since the matrix inequalities in the condition are of nonlinear form with respect to some matrix variables. Also, change of variable as well as the existing matrix decoupling approach cannot be used directly to handle the nonlinear problem. By utilizing cone complementarity linearization algorithm and a new matrix decoupling method, the state feedback controller can be developed by converting the nonlinear matrix inequalities into a quadratic optimization problem with linear inequality constraints.

The possibly time-varying and discontinuous changes bring out a challenge for fuzzy approximation. To conquer this obstacle, a novel adaptive fuzzy FTC strategy is proposed in this article. First, a constraint-handling scheme is designed to ensure zero overshoot for certain signals. In this way, the resulting unknown term, composed of the signs of sliding surfaces, the bounds of faults, and model uncertainties, is both continuous and within a fixed form. Subsequently, adaptive fuzzy systems are adopted to approximate this unknown term for compensation. It is proved that the tracking performance and the boundedness of signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed by the developed method. The simulation results further illustrate the established theoretical findings.},

Via exploring the ability of the dynamic surface control for conquering such a difficulty, the direct-compensation approach ensured the semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded stability for nonstrict-feedback systems with unity control coefficients so far. This article aims to integrate these two methods to tackle a more challenging task of controlling multiinput-multioutput nonstrict-feedback systems with unknown control-affine functions and time-varying delays. Comparing with the existing schemes in the literature, the proposed design exhibits the following distinct features: 1) the control-affine functions and the delayed functions can depend on the whole state vector; 2) the time delays can be incoherent among different states; and 3) the globally uniformly ultimately bounded stability is achieved without incurring the control singularity, explosion of complexity, and the algebraic-loop problems simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs) have been exposed to be an appropriate and effective preference representation framework in an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with vagueness and hesitancy. This article focuses mainly on obtaining an intuitionistic fuzzy extension of Tanino&#39;s multiplicative consistency and deriving an analytic solution of normalized intuitionistic fuzzy weights (NIFWs) from IFPRs as well as checking acceptability of IFPRs. This article first introduces two indices to, respectively, measure hesitancy of intuitionistic fuzzy judgments and hesitancy of IFPRs, and illustrates that any existing multiplicative consistency model of IFPRs is not an actual intuitionistic fuzzy extension of Tanino&#39;s multiplicative consistency. A conjunctive-representable cross-ratio uninorm-based functional equation is then developed to define multiplicative consistency of IFPRs and a consistency index is devised to measure the inconsistency degree of an IFPR. This article establishes a representable uninorm-based transformation method for consistent IFPRs and intuitionistic fuzzy weights, and proposes a new framework of NIFWs. Based on the transformation method and the row hesitancy distribution of an IFPR, a logarithmic least square model is constructed and its analytic solution is found by applying the Lagrange multiplier method to its equivalent least square model. This article puts forward a novel acceptability checking method by taking both acceptable consistency and acceptable hesitancy into consideration. A representable uninorm-based fusion method is presented to aggregate local NIFWs into global intuitionistic fuzzy weights and a representable uninorm-based likelihood formula is given and used to compare and rank intuitionistic fuzzy weights in the proposed intuitionistic fuzzy AHP.

Managing these is of paramount importance for safe and smooth performance of teleoperation systems. Among the countless solutions developed by researchers, type-2 fuzzy (T2F) algorithms have shown an outstanding performance in modeling complex systems and tackling uncertainties. Moreover, artificial neural networks (NNs) are well known for their adaptive learning potentials. This article proposes an adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy neural-network control scheme for teleoperation systems with time-varying delays and uncertainties. The T2F models are developed based on the experimental data collected from a teleoperation setup over a local computer network. However, the resulted controller is evaluated on an intercontinental communication network through the Internet between Australia and Scotland. Moreover, the slave robot and the remote workspace are completely different and unforeseen. Stability and performance of the proposed control is analyzed by Lyapunov-Krasovskii method. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate that the proposed controller outperforms traditional techniques in experimental evaluations.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the problems of observer-based fault estimation and dynamic output feedback fault tolerant control (FTC) for a class of nonlinear fuzzy systems with faults. A novel lower triangle factor-based estimation observer (LTFEO) is proposed for the first time. The designed LTFEO can reduce to the traditional robust estimation observer (REO) and is superior to the adaptive estimation observer (AEO) in the relevant literature, furthermore, the designed LTFEO does not contain the output derivatives. The initial estimation accuracy is improved under the designed estimation observer. An iterative estimation algorithm based on the iterative LTFEOs is given, by which, the obtained mean sequence of state and fault estimation errors can converge to zeros (vector) and the proof is given in theoretical. Then, a new dynamic output feedback FTC is designed to stabilize the faulty system, where the output feedback gains can be determined by state feedback gains and the computational difficulty is decreased. Less conservative stability conditions for the estimation error dynamics and the closed-loop system are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A tunnel diode circuit system is applied to test the effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods.},

By constructing a fuzzy membership function (FMF)-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and utilizing the time-derivative information of the FMF, the sufficient conditions are carried out in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) such that the resultant T-S fuzzy systems can achieve the globally asymptotically stable under the designed control. Then, the desired control gain is determined by solving the obtained LMIs.

  abstract     = {Many real-world decision making (DM) problems present changing contexts in which uncertainty or vagueness appear. Such uncertainty has been often modeled based on the linguistic information by using single linguistic terms. Dealing with linguistic information in DM demands processes of computing with words whose main characteristic is to emulate human beings reasoning processes to obtain linguistic outputs from linguistic inputs. However, often single linguistic terms are limited or do not express properly the expert&#39;s knowledge, being necessary to elaborate richer linguistic expressions easy to understand and able to express greater amount of knowledge, as it is the case of the comparative linguistic expressions based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic terms sets. Nevertheless, current computational models for comparative linguistic expressions present limitations both from understandability and precision points of view. The 2-tuple linguistic representation model stands out in these aspects because of its accuracy and interpretability dealing with linguistic terms, both related to the use of the symbolic translation, although 2-tuple linguistic values are still limited by the use of single linguistic terms. Therefore, the aim of this article is to present a new fuzzy linguistic representation model for comparative linguistic expressions that takes advantage of the goodness of the 2-tuple linguistic representation model and improve the interpretability and accuracy of the results in computing with words processes, resulting the so-called extended comparative linguistic expressions with symbolic translation. Taking into account the proposed model, a new computing with words approach is presented and then applied to a DM case study to show its performance and advantages in a real case by comparing with other linguistic decision approaches.},

The features extracted by F3RBM with unsupervised learning are imported into support vector machine (SVM) to establish F3RBM-SVM model, which achieves fast and high-precision automatic classification of different samples. To expand the feature extraction capability of restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), the deterministic parameters of control model are replaced by fuzzy numbers in view of the superiority of fuzzy idea and the redundancy removal mechanism is introduced. Comparing the feature similarity of hidden units with the threshold value, if the similarity is greater than the threshold value, they are considered to be redundant units with the same features. The redundant units are removed to achieve further dimension reduction. Finally, the learning speed, feature extraction ability, and classification accuracy of different models are compared in MINIST handwritten dataset, Fashion MNIST dataset, and Olivetti Face dataset. The experimental results show that the feature extraction capability of FRBM and F3RBM is better than that of RBM. When there are a large number of hidden units, the learning speed of F3RBM is obviously faster than that of FRBM. The features extracted from F3RBM are imported into the SVM to build F3RBM-SVM model, which improves the classification accuracy and learning speed than general classifier. When adding other noises, F3RBM-SVM has better robustness than other models.},

  abstract     = {The fuzzy min-max (FMM) neural network stands as a useful model for solving pattern classification problems. FMM has many important features, such as online learning and one-pass learning. It, however, has certain limitations, especially in its learning algorithm, which consists of the expansion, overlap test, and contraction procedures. This article proposes a refined fuzzy min-max (RFMM) neural network with new procedures for tackling the key limitations of FMM. RFMM has a number of contributions. First, a new expansion procedure for overcoming the problems of overlap leniency and irregularity of hyperbox expansion is introduced. It avoids the overlap cases between hyperboxes from different classes, reducing the number of overlap cases to one (containment case). Second, a new formula that simplifies the original rules in the overlap test is proposed. It has two important features: (i) identifying the overlap leniency problem during the expansion procedure; (ii) activating the contraction procedure to eliminate the containment case. Third, a new contraction procedure for overcoming the data distortion problem and providing more accurate decision boundaries for the contracted hyperboxes is proposed. Fourth, a new prediction strategy that combines both membership function and distance measure to prevent any possible random decision-making during the test stage is proposed. The performance of RFMM is evaluated with the UCI benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modifications in making RFMM a useful model for solving pattern classification problems, as compared with other existing FMM and non-FMM classifiers.},

Then, the fuzzy Lyapunov functional with an additional separation parameter and the augmented fuzzy matrix technique (the interactions of fuzzy observer subsystems) are proposed such that the delay-dependent stability condition of the closed-loop system in the form of linear matrix inequality is obtained with less conservatism. It is worth noting that due to introducing an additional parameter in the fuzzy Lyapunov functional, the fuzzy controller and fuzzy observer can be separately designed, which largely enhances the flexibility of design with low computational complexity.

  abstract     = {Missing values are common in real-world data stream applications. This article proposes a modified evolving granular fuzzy-rule-based model for function approximation and time-series prediction in an online context, where values may be missing. The fuzzy model is equipped with an incremental learning algorithm that simultaneously imputes missing data and adapts model parameters and structure over time. The evolving fuzzy granular predictor (eFGP) handles single and multiple missing values on data samples by developing reduced-term consequent polynomials and utilizing time-varying granules. Missing at random (MAR) and missing completely at random (MCAR) values in nonstationary data streams are approached. Experiments to predict monthly weather conditions, the number of bikes hired on a daily basis, and the sound pressure on an airfoil from incomplete data streams show the usefulness of eFGP models. Results were compared with those of state-of-the-art fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy evolving modeling methods. A statistical hypothesis test shows that eFGP outperforms other evolving intelligent methods in online MAR and MCAR settings, regardless of the application.},

The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is adopted to approximate the nonlinearity of the plant with a set of local linear models. The persistent dwell-time (DT) switching law, which is more general than DT or average DT switching, is introduced to govern the switching among subsystems. In order to alleviate the effects of actuator failures on system stability and performance, a synthesized fault-tolerant output feedback controller ensuring various performance requirements is designed. Intensive attention is focused on establishing sufficient conditions, which can guarantee the exponential mean-square stability as well as the prescribed extended dissipativity property of the closed-loop system. By virtue of the Lyapunov stability theory and appropriate matrix transformation methods, the desired controller gains can be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. The developed method is finally applied to address the control issue of a tunnel diode circuit system model to illustrate its efficiency and applicability.},

  abstract     = {It is commonly believed that uncertainties are obstacles to the tracking performances of flexible air-breathing hypersonic vehicles (FAHVs). In addition, the estimation of unmeasured states in an FAHV makes this issue much more complicated. To deal with these difficulties, this article explores a novel adaptive fuzzy nonsmooth backstepping output-feedback control scheme for the FAHV with closed-loop finite-time convergence. First, to approximate the unknown dynamics of the FAHV, some function approximators are constructed by utilizing an interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy logic system. On this basis, a fixed-time convergent adaptive IT2 fuzzy observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured flight path angle and the unmeasured angle of attack of the FAHV accurately and rapidly. Consequently, the estimation errors of the designed observer are convergent in a fixed time independent of their initial estimation errors. Furthermore, based on the estimated states, velocity and altitude tracking controllers are designed by using a finite-time adaptive IT2 fuzzy nonsmooth backstepping control technique, which avoids the problem of “explosion of complexity” in traditional backstepping methods. Subsequently, rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis is conducted to show the finite-time convergence of the closed-loop signals of the FAHV control system. Finally, the robustness and superiority of the proposed control scheme is validated by several simulations in representative scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Nonsingleton fuzzy logic systems (NSFLSs) have the potential to capture and handle input noise within the design of input fuzzy sets (FSs). In this article, we propose an online learning method that utilizes a sequence of observations to continuously update the input FSs of an NSFLS, thus providing an improved capacity to deal with variations in the level of input-affecting noise, common in real-world applications. The method removes the requirement for both a priori knowledge of noise levels and relying on offline training procedures to define input FS parameters. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed ADaptive, ONline Nonsingleton (ADONiS) fuzzy logic system (FLS) framework represents the first end-to-end framework to adaptively configure nonsingleton input FSs. The latter is achieved through online uncertainty detection applied to a sliding window of observations. Since real-world environments are influenced by a broad range of noise sources, which can vary greatly in magnitude over time, the proposed technique for combining online determination of noise levels with associated adaptation of input FSs provides an efficient and effective solution which elegantly models input uncertainty in the FLS&#39;s input FSs, without requiring changes in any other part (e.g., antecedents, rules or consequents) of the FLS. In this article, two common chaotic time series (Mackey-Glass, Lorenz) are used to perform prediction experiments to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed framework. Results indicate that the proposed adaptive NSFLS framework provides significant advantages, particularly in environments that include high variation in noise levels, which are common in real-world applications.},

However, their fixed structures are not flexible enough to address the structural variations triggered by the changing operating conditions or system states in complex industrial environments. A novel generalized heterogeneous interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy classifier, named as GHIT2Class, is proposed in this paper, which is built upon a multivariable IT2 fuzzy neural network. To fully reflect the industrial data characteristics of uncertainty, this paper proposes an approach of constructing the uncertainty footprint with ellipsoidal rotation. A rule pruning method based on error and incentive intensity dynamic adjustment mechanism is reported in the process of modeling, and a corresponding rule recall mechanism is designed to avoid rules of catastrophic forgetting. In addition, the simultaneous update of the upper and lower bounds of IT2 fuzzy consequent parameters is designed to relieve the computing overhead of the fuzzy systems. The performance of the proposed GHIT2Class is experimentally validated by a number of synthetic datasets and industry study cases by using state-of-the-art comparative classifiers, where the proposed approach outperforms the others in achieving the best tradeoff between accuracy and simplicity.},

The proposed system has the capability of reorganizing the structure and adapting itself in a dynamically changing environment with non-Gaussian noises. The system generates a new rule based on the correntropy criterion which represents a robust nonlinear similarity measure between two random variables and avoids recruiting the noises as the rules. Maximizing the cross-correntropy between the system output and the desired response leads to the maximum correntropy criterion for system self-adaptation. In our article, a recursive solution of the maximum correntropy criterion is derived to update the parameters of the evolving rules. This avoids the convergence problem produced by the learning size in the gradient-based learning. Also, the steady-state convergence performance of the proposed RMCEFS is studied, where the analytical solutions of the steady-state excess mean square error for the Gaussian noise and non-Gaussian noises are derived. The simulation studies show that the proposed RMCEFS using the recursive maximum correntropy converges much faster and is more accurate than the existing evolving fuzzy systems in the case of noise-free and noisy conditions.},

Thus, negation provides a new perspective for D-S theory to measure fuzziness. In this paper, a new definition of negation of BBA is presented. In the proposed negation, BBAs are represented as vectors, and negation is realized by matrix operators. This method has a good interpretation of the matrix operators and has the merit of simplifying the problem.

Consequently, several weight generation techniques have evolved in the literature.

The proposed inverse hypergeometric OWA (InHyp-OWA) operator generates a unique weight vector for every choice of its parameter. Also, using the proposed weight function, OWA weight vectors can be generated without solving any complicated optimization problem. An important property of InHyp-OWA operator is that for a given parameter value, its orness value remains constant, regardless of the number of objectives aggregated. Hence, InHyp-OWA operator is a new member of the family of OWA operators with constant orness. This class of OWA operators can utilize a prejudiced preference to determine the corresponding weight vector. The proposed approach provides a number of advantages over existing weight generating methods for OWA operators. One of the remarkable advantages of the InHyp-OWA operator is the fact that it generates weight vectors with strictly monotonic components. It also generalizes the well-known Borda-Kendall OWA operator.},

However, such work was carried out within the specific transformation-based FRI mechanism. This short paper reports the results of generalizing it through enhancing two alternative representative FRI methods. The resultant weighted FRI algorithms facilitate the individual attribute weights to be integrated throughout the corresponding procedures of the conventional unweighted methods.

At first, the serial-based search is used until the decision variable exceeds a preset threshold; the FL-based search is then performed for a second search and the final decision is made. In the second search stage, Doppler search step size is adaptively adjusted by an FL controller. To design a robust FL controller, the characteristics of the spectrum distribution and several possible abnormal conditions are analyzed, input and output fuzzy membership functions are derived, and a set of fuzzy rules is formulated. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations. The obtained results show that a smaller estimation error is achieved when the proposed algorithm is used; further, reasonable mean acquisition times are attained compared with other existing search techniques.

  abstract     = {In this article, a new dynamic merging approach for incrementally evolving clustering is presented. This means that the cluster partitions are incrementally learned on-line from streams of data. The criterion of merging is based on the comparison between the sum of volumes of two clusters that fulfill the criteria of a minimal number of samples in the cluster and the expected volume of the newly generated merged cluster. The newly generated merged cluster is conducted by using the weighted averaging of cluster centers and the calculation of the joint covariance matrix from the covariance matrices of the clusters. It has been shown that the proposed new evolving algorithm eGAUSS+ together with the new merging concept is very easy to implement, can work on higher-dimensional data sets, can perform all necessary computation on-line, and can produce reliable clusters.},

  abstract     = {Many nonlinear dynamical systems are usually lack of abundant datasets since the data acquiring process is time consuming. It is difficult to utilize the incomplete datasets to build an effective data-driven model to improve the industry productivity. To overcome this problem, a data-knowledge-based fuzzy neural network (DK-FNN) was developed in this article. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed DK-FNN consists of the following obvious advantages. First, through the multilayered connectionist structure, this proposed DK-FNN could not only make full use of the data from the current scene, but also use the existing knowledge from the source scene to improve the learning performance. Second, an integrated-form transfer learning (ITL) method was developed to improve the learning performance of DK-FNN. This first reported ITL method was able to integrate the internal information from the datasets in the source scene and the knowledge from the current scene to offset the data shortage in the learning process. Third, a mutual attraction strategy (MAS) was designed to balance the difference of data distributions to reduce the identification errors of DK-FNN. Then, the proposed DK-FNN was able to satisfy the nonlinear dynamical systems. Finally, the effectiveness and the merit of DK-FNN were validated by applying it to several practical systems.},

  abstract     = {To maximize the influence across multiple heterogeneous networks, we propose an innovative cross-network learning model to study the influence maximization problem from two perspectives, namely, seed selection and graph sparsification. On one hand, we consider seed selection as a cross-network node prediction task, by leveraging the greedy seed selection knowledge prelearned in a smaller source network, to heuristically select the nodes most likely to act as seed for the target networks. On the other hand, we consider graph sparsification as a cross-network edge prediction problem, by adapting the influence propagation knowledge previously acquired in the source network to remove the edges least likely to contribute to influence propagation in the target networks. To address domain discrepancy, a fuzzy self-learning algorithm is proposed to iteratively train the prediction model by leveraging not only the fully labeled data in the source network, but also the most confident predicted instances with their predicted fuzzy labels in the target network. With such fuzzy labels, we can differentiate the confident levels of predictions generated by different self-training iterations, thus lowering the negative effects caused by less confident predictions. The performance of the proposed model is benchmarked with the popular influence maximization algorithms for seed selection; and also competed with several graph sparsification algorithms for inactive edge prediction. Experimental results on the real-world datasets show that the proposed cross-network learning model can achieve a good tradeoff between the efficiency and effectiveness of the influence maximization task in the target networks.},

At present, the theory lacks a self-learning component, an important topic that has hardly been touched in the literature. In this article, we use stochastic gradient descent to develop online learning algorithms for the fuzzy automata. We uncover an inherent obstacle in the initial derived algorithms that fundamentally restricts their learning capability owing to dependences of the model parameters to be learned. We develop a novel mechanism to not only overcome the obstacle but also make the learning adaptive. Our final algorithms can learn an event transition matrix based on automaton&#39;s states before and after the occurrence of a fuzzy event, and learn the transition matrix and multidimensional Gaussian fuzzy sets yielding initial automaton states from relevant input variables and target states.

To handle those uncertainties, we propose an automatic multiclass image segmentation method based on an interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS). In the proposed method in this article, the accurate multiclass segmentation is achieved by minimizing an energy function. This energy function is based on IT2FS and weak continuity constraints present in the membership values. The theory of weak continuity constraints helps to localize the segmentation boundaries between the classes accurately with the minimization of the energy. The proper localization of segmentation boundaries helps to minimize the uncertainties in the segmentation process. We also theoretically show that the minimization of the energy function reduces the uncertainties present in the segmentation process. Furthermore, the method automatically determines the number of clusters without a priori knowledge. The proposed method is found to be superior to the existing conventional, fuzzy type-1 and fuzzy type-2 based segmentation techniques. The superiority is verified using synthetic and benchmark datasets. The noise immunity of the proposed method is found to be better than that of the state-of-the-art methods when benchmark against the modified Cramer-Rao bound.},

A prominent advantage is that this method can distinguish the efficient and inefficient alternatives and further improve the inefficient ones by modifying their membership and nonmembership degrees. Consequently, we can optimize the inefficient alternatives in the future, which cannot be achieved by other similar methods. To do this, we construct two intuitionistic fuzzy envelopment analysis (IFEA) models based on the membership and nonmembership degrees, respectively, which are different from the data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the fuzzy DEA. Their dual forms are derived so that these models can be transformed into the linear programming forms.

Although density peak clustering is able to find the number of clusters, it suffers from memory overflow when it is used for image segmentation because a moderate-size image usually includes a large number of pixels leading to a huge similarity matrix. To address this issue, here we proposed an automatic fuzzy clustering framework (AFCF) for image segmentation. The proposed framework has threefold contributions. First, the idea of superpixel is used for the density peak (DP) algorithm, which efficiently reduces the size of the similarity matrix and thus improves the computational efficiency of the DP algorithm. Second, we employ a density balance algorithm to obtain a robust decision-graph that helps the DP algorithm achieve fully automatic clustering. Finally, a fuzzy c-means clustering based on prior entropy is used in the framework to improve image segmentation results. Because the spatial neighboring information of both the pixels and membership are considered, the final segmentation result is improved effectively. Experiments show that the proposed framework not only achieves automatic image segmentation, but also provides better segmentation results than state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Aiming to alleviate the problem of insufficient and imprecise data collected from the complicated environment, the expert judgment in linguistic expressions is employed to describe the risk levels for all risk factors, which are represented by IVFSs using Gaussian membership function to fully consider such fuzziness and uncertainty. In regard to interval fusion and highly conflicting data, an improved combination rule based on the D-S evidence theory is developed. Then, fuzzy prior probability for each risk factor can be generated from fused intervals and fed into a fuzzy BN model for fuzzy-based Bayesian inference, including predictive, sensitivity, and diagnosis analysis. Furthermore, a case study is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed risk analysis. A comparison of risk analysis based upon the hybrid improved D-S, classical D-S, and arithmetic average method is illustrated to show the outstanding performance of the developed approach in fusing multisource information with ubiquitous uncertainty and conflicts in an efficient manner, leading to more reliable risk evaluation. It is concluded that the proposed risk analysis provides a deep insight on risk control, especially for complex project environment, which enables to not only reduce the likelihood of failure ahead of time but also mitigate risk magnitudes to some degree after the occurrence of a failure.},

  abstract     = {Linear switching function and integral-type switching function are two typical switching functions in the sliding mode control field. Based on these, this paper investigates the design problem of fuzzy descriptor sliding mode observers. Two canonical forms, which are the T-S fuzzy descriptor systems&#39; counterparts of the canonical form in normal systems, are first proposed. In terms of the proposed canonical forms, a linear switching function-based fuzzy descriptor sliding mode observer and an integral-type switching function-based fuzzy descriptor sliding mode observer are designed, respectively. It is shown that although the linear switching function-based fuzzy descriptor sliding mode observer has a much simpler design structure than the integral-type switching function-based fuzzy descriptor sliding mode observer, the integral-type switching function-based design method can deal with a much larger range of T-S fuzzy descriptor systems than the linear switching function-based design method. Finally, three simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and merits of the proposed method.},

The unmodeled dynamics and drift/diffusion terms are allowed to depend on the whole unmeasurable states, whose effect is difficult to counteract. By virtue of the fuzzy approximation capability and variable partition technique, an adaptive backstepping procedure is proposed to compensate these uncertainties. Based on the constructed switched observer, which shows its strong robustness to the unknown control coefficients and output functions, an output feedback controller is designed to render all the signals of the closed-loop system bounded in probability under an appropriately chosen average dwell time.},

  abstract     = {Histogram equalization is a famous method for enhancing the contrast and image features. However, in few cases, it causes the overenhancement, and hence demolishes the natural display of the image. Therefore, in this article, a new fuzzy clustering based subhistogram scheme using discrete cosine transform (DCT) for contrast enhancement has been proposed. For preserving the distinctive appearance of the image, histogram division and separate histogram equalization is done on each subhistogram. The way of dividing histogram and calculating the numbers of parts for histogram division are the major problems which directly affects the quality of the output image. The proposed fuzzy-DCT scheme includes automatic calculation of a number of parts in which histogram is divided. Histogram division has done on the basis of density function and histogram separation is computed in such a way that each main peak can be divided in a different segment. The proposed scheme consists of four stages. The first stage includes the automatic calculation of number of clusters for image brightness levels. The second stage includes clustering of brightness levels by the fuzzy c-means clustering method and utilizing the given transfer function of histogram equalization. In the third stage, contrast enhancement is computed on each individual cluster separately. In the final stage, DCT is employed on the resulting image of the third step for better contrast and brightness preservation. The simulation results of the proposed scheme reveal not only clearer features along with a contrast enhancement, but also remarkably more natural look in the images.},

  abstract     = {There have been different strategies to improve the performance of a machine learning model, e.g., increasing the depth, width, and/or nonlinearity of the model, and using ensemble learning to aggregate multiple base/weak learners in parallel or in series. This article proposes a novel strategy called patch learning (PL) for this problem. It consists of three steps: first, train an initial global model using all training data; second, identify from the initial global model the patches that contribute the most to the learning error, and train a (local) patch model for each such patch; and, third, update the global model using training data that do not fall into any patch. To use a PL model, we first determine if the input falls into any patch. If yes, then the corresponding patch model is used to compute the output. Otherwise, the global model is used. We explain in detail how PL can be implemented using fuzzy systems. Five regression problems on one-dimensional (1-D)/2-D/3-D curve fitting, nonlinear system identification, and chaotic time-series prediction, verified its effectiveness. To our knowledge, the PL idea has not appeared in the literature before, and it opens up a promising new line of research in machine learning.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, unmanned vehicles (UVs) have been largely employed in many applications. They, enhanced with computer vision and artificial intelligence, can autonomously recognize targets in an environment and detect events occurring in a real-world scenario. The employment of cooperative UVs can provide multiple interpretations supporting a multiperspective view of the scene. However, UV multiple interpretations often diverge, therefore, UVs need to find an agreed interpretation of the scenario. To this purpose, this paper proposes a novel consensus-based approach to lead multi-UV systems to find agreement on what they observe and build a group situation-based description of the scenario. UVs are modeled as experts in a group decision making problem that must decide on which situations best describe the scenario. First, the approach allows each UV to build high-level situations from the detected events through a fuzzy-based event aggregation. The event aggregation is modeled with a fuzzy ontology which allows each UV to express preferences on the situations. Then, a collective interpretation of situations is achieved by consensing each UV interpretation. Finally, consensus and proximity measures support the evaluation of the final group decision reliability. The assessed consensus reflects how much the collective scenario interpretation fits each UV perspective. The proximity measures support the detection of reliable and unreliable UVs to serve many tasks (i.e., mission replanning, damaged UV detection, etc.).},

Recently, NMF has been extended to analyze multiple matrices simultaneously. However, a general framework and its systematic algorithmic exploration are still lacking.

Next, we present four update algorithms to solve this framework in a very comprehensive manner. The merits and demerits of these algorithms are systematically explored.

By utilizing the fuzzy sliding surface, the assumption that all local input matrices are identical in most existing results about sliding mode control (SMC) for T-S fuzzy systems, can be removed. Then, a new sufficient condition is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which guarantees the admissibility of the sliding mode dynamics. Moreover, adaptive SMC strategy is used such that the reachability condition can be guaranteed. Finally, three examples are given to verify the effectiveness of our results.},

However, most available RKM algorithms fail to pay attention to the influence of imbalanced clusters, together with imbalanced spatial distributions (i.e., the cluster density) and differing cluster sizes (i.e., the number of object ratios). This paper seeks to address this deficiency and examines in detail some adverse effects caused by imbalanced clusters. To mitigate adverse effects of imbalanced clusters and decrease the computational cost, an interval type-2 fuzzy local measure for the RKM clustering is proposed, on the basis of which, a novel RKM clustering algorithm has been developed that specifically gives due consideration to imbalanced clusters.

However, the obtained accuracy is not up to the mark. Therefore, in this paper, a new improved FMM (IFMM) network is proposed to increase the accuracy rate. In the proposed IFMM network, a modified constraint is employed to check the expandability of a hyperbox. It also uses semiperimeter of the hyperbox along with k-nearest mechanism to select the expandable hyperbox. In the proposed IFMM, the contraction rules of conventional FMM and enhanced FMM (EFMM) are also modified using semiperimeter of a hyperbox in order to balance the size of both overlapped hyperboxes. Experimental results show that the proposed IFMM network outperforms the FMM, k-nearest FMM, and EFMM by yielding more accuracy rate with less number of hyperboxes.

The proposed model is based on computational intelligence approaches and can be used in industrial plant operating processes. The proposed tuning model is called PID-neuro-fuzzy model, a formulation based on a structured artificial neural network and fuzzy rules. The neural network is used to perform an optimal adjustment of PID controller gains to ensure the operating point of the system required to reduce the time of accommodation and the steady-state error. A fuzzy system is incorporated into a real-time gain-scheduling scheme to compensate for the possible variations in plant parameters. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated based on its ability to deal with uncertainties and disturbances in the process. The efficiency of the model is investigated through computational simulations in five plants of two industrial processes in the mining sector: 1) solid bulk unloading processes by car dumper and 2) solid bulk resumption process by bucket wheel reclaimers. In conclusion, the main advantage of the proposed model is its adaptability in relation to variations in plant parameters during the operational process.},

Thus, decision information is often not completely reliable. As a tool that can effectively represent information reliability, Z-number has been studied by many scholars in recent years. Current research on Z-number assumes that differences in various parts of a Z-number can complement one another. However, in many cases, the preference of DMs for each part is difficult to determine, or DMs believe that the differences in various parts cannot be complementary. Therefore, to solve such decision problems, this paper attempts to extend the traditional MABAC method to the Z-information environment by introducing the directed distance and regret theory. The proposed method simultaneously considers the randomness and fuzziness of Z-number. An example about regional circular economy development program selection is provided to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method can solve complex decision problems rationally and effectively, and it has broad application prospects.},

  abstract     = {Data reduction is an important step that helps ease the computational intractability for learning techniques when data are large. This is particularly true for the huge datasets that have become commonplace in recent times. The main problem facing both data preprocessors and learning techniques is that data are expanding both in terms of dimensionality and also in terms of the number of data instances. Approaches based on fuzzy-rough sets offer many advantages for both feature selection and classification, particularly for real-valued and noisy data; however, the majority of recent approaches tend to address the task of data reduction in terms of either dimensionality or training data size in isolation. This paper demonstrates how the notion of fuzzy-rough bireducts can be used for the simultaneous reduction of data size and dimensionality. It also shows how bireducts and, therefore, reduced subtables of data can be used not only as a preprocessing tool but also for the learning of compact and robust classifiers. Furthermore, the ideas can also be extended to the unsupervised domain when dealing with unlabeled data. Experimental evaluation of various techniques demonstrate that high levels of simultaneous reduction of both dimensionality and data size can be achieved whilst maintaining robust performance.},

This paper aims at constructing an adaptive fuzzy output-feedback control scheme for a class of switched nonlinear systems interconnected with unmodeled dynamics. In the investigated model, the x-system is interconnected with the unmodeled z-dynamics. Two types of unmodeled dynamics (i.e., all modes are stable and some modes are unstable) are considered in this paper. Separate switched state observer and adaptive fuzzy controller are designed for each mode of the x-system. In our control scheme, only two adaptive parameters are required to update online. With the help of multiple Lyapunov function, two lemmas are proposed to guide us how to determine the input-to-output gains of the x-system and the unmodeled dynamics when the influence of switching is considered. By using the small-gain approach, the closed-loop switched nonlinear system is guaranteed to be of input-to-state practically stability (ISpS). With the concept of ISpS, we prove that the closed-loop system&#39;s output is convergent to a small neighborhood of zero, and all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, three simulations are also given to illustrate the effectiveness of our main result.},

In the sequel, a consistency and consensus improvement model that aims at retaining original opinions of the DMs is introduced to make consistency and consensus of IVIMPRs acceptable. Moreover, the DMs&#39; comprehensive weights are obtained by combining their subjective weights and objective weights. Afterward, to derive priority weights of alternatives, a programming model is established and solved by three approaches considering DMs&#39; different risk attitudes.

  abstract     = {Comparing fuzzy sets by computing their similarity is common, with a large set of measures of similarity available. However, while commonplace in the computational intelligence community, the application and results of similarity measures are less common in the wider scientific context, where statistical approaches are the standard for comparing distributions. This is challenging, as it means that developments around similarity measures arising from the fuzzy community are inaccessible to the wider scientific community and that the fuzzy community fails to take advantage of a strong statistical understanding, which may be applicable to comparing (fuzzy membership) functions. In this paper, we commence a body of work on systematically relating the outputs of similarity measures to the notion of statistically significant difference; that is, how (dis)similar do two fuzzy sets need to be for them to be statistically different? We explain that in this context, it is useful to initially focus on dis-similarity, rather than similarity, as the former aligns directly with the widely used concept of statistical difference. We propose two methods of applying statistical tests to the outputs of fuzzy dissimilarity measures to determine significant difference. We show how the proposed work provides deeper insight into the behavior and possible interpretation of degrees of dis-similarity and, consequently, similarity, and how the interpretation differs with respect to context (e.g., the complexity of the fuzzy sets).},

  abstract     = {Several mathematical formalisms can be exploited to model complex systems, in order to capture different features of their dynamic behavior and leverage any available quantitative or qualitative data. Correspondingly, either quantitative models or qualitative models can be defined; bridging the gap between these two worlds would allow us to simultaneously exploit the peculiar advantages provided by each modeling approach. However, to date, the attempts in this direction have been limited to specific fields of research. In this paper, we propose a novel, general-purpose computational framework, named Fuzzy-mechanistic modeling of compleX systems (FuzzX), for the analysis of hybrid models consisting of a quantitative (or mechanistic) module and a qualitative module that can reciprocally control each other&#39;s dynamic behavior through a common interface. FuzzX takes advantage of precise quantitative information about the system through the definition and simulation of the mechanistic module. At the same time, it describes the behavior of components and their interactions that are not known in full details, by exploiting fuzzy logic for the definition of the qualitative module. We applied FuzzX for the analysis of a hybrid model of a complex biochemical system, characterized by the presence of positive and negative feedback regulations. We show that FuzzX is able to correctly reproduce known emergent behaviors of this system in normal and perturbed conditions. We envision that FuzzX could be employed to analyze any kind of complex system when quantitative information is limited, as well as to extend existing mechanistic models with fuzzy modules to describe those components and interactions of the system that are not fully characterized.},

By utilizing the information of tan-type barrier Lyapunov function, the requirement of full state constraints is successfully achieved. In addition, to handle the problem of “explosion of complexity” resulted from backstepping itself, a DSC approach using the sliding mode differentiator is introduced. Then, based on backstepping control, we develop a new adaptive fuzzy DSC strategy, which ensures that all state constrains are not violated via designing parameters appropriately. Meanwhile, other signals existing in the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, comparative results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the reliable extended passive control problem for semi-Markov jump Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems based on an event-triggered mechanism (ETM). An asynchronous approach is utilized to cope with the fuzzy-basis-dependent membership functions in networked fuzzy systems. For fear of the waste of communication resources, an ETM to screen the transmitted data is adopted for T-S fuzzy semiMarkov jump systems under consideration. Owing to the use of Lyapunov stability theory and some novel integral inequalities based on auxiliary functions, some sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee that the resulting closed-loop system not only meets a prescribed mixed H ∞ and passive performance but also is stochastically stable. Then, by using a skillful matrix decoupling approach, the gains of the fuzzy controller may be expressed specifically. Lastly, the superiority and availability of the developed design method are extensively described and validated via its application to a truck control model.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) as a kind of knowledge-based tools are widely applied to model complex dynamical systems using causal relations. Besides the representation and reasoning of systems behaviors, how to control the given systems into a desirable target by causal objects established by FCMs is also an open problem. Although, so far, there are some existing works about the applications of FCMs on the control-related problems, it is still a lack of the theoretical analysis in this domain. In this paper, the controllability of k-valued FCMs is studied. To improve the universality of models, a temporal extension of generalized FCMs is implemented. By means of semitensor product, the algebraic representation of k-valued FCMs with controls is established and a generalized formula of control-depending network transition matrices is achieved. A necessary and sufficient condition is proved to determine the control-depending fixed points of k-valued FCMs with temporalization. By utilizing three kinds of controls, the controllability of the discrete FCMs is discussed, respectively. The reachability condition of a specific target state from a given initial state at time s is studied, and the reachable set along with the corresponding reachable probability are also provided by analytic formula. Results provide a way to make FCMs evolving into the designed states by controls, which can further conduct the behaviors of the modeled systems in reality. Examples are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme.},

Local nonlinear models and external disturbances are also considered. Inspired by the information from the (k-1)th induction FE, a novel observer is addressed to establish the kth error dynamics. The k-step induction FE observer can weaken the effect from input disturbances caused by the derivatives of actuator faults and can perform better FE subject to sensor and actuator faults and multiple time delays simultaneously. Compared with the existing results, the proposed observer can realistically better show the sizes and shapes of the actuator and sensor faults. In addition, according to online information from the k-step FE, an active dynamic output feedback fault-tolerant controller is proposed to make the closed-loop fuzzy system asymptotically stable. Moreover, the fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is developed by introducing some free-weighting matrices such that the delay dependent sufficient conditions are given in the form of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with less conservatism for the existence of observer and fault-tolerant controller. At last, two simulation examples are given to prove the advantages and effectiveness of the approach given in this paper.},

High-order barrier Lyapunov functions are employed to prevent the transgression of full-state constraints. The auxiliary subsystem and the Nussbaum gain technique are utilized to analyze the effect of input saturation. Appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are constructed to compensate the adverse effect caused by the unknown time-delay. Novel feasibility conditions are formulated as sufficient conditions for the existence of proposed control. It is rigorously proved that all the closed-loop signals are bounded in the semi-global sense, error signals converge to small bounded compact sets, full-state constraints, and input saturation are not violated, and the arguments of unknown nonlinearities are constrained within a compact set, on which fuzzy approximation is valid. Eventually, the theoretical result is confirmed by two simulation examples.},

A constrained supereigenvalue represents the ratio of the data-download quality to the data-sending quality under a constant constraint.

These distributions have been derived from a consistent probability-possibility transformation over the family of so-called elliptical probability distributions. The second contribution proposed by this paper is the definition of two divergence measures between possibilistic distributions. We prove that a symmetric version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence guarantees all divergence properties when related to the space of possibility distributions. We further derive analytical expressions of the latter divergence and of the Hellinger divergence for certain possibility distributions pertaining to the elliptical family proposed, especially the normal multivariate possibility divergence in two dimensions. Finally, this paper provides an illustration of the developed possibilistic tools in an application of bi-band change detection between optical satellite images.},

State constraints and time delays are normally found in various real-life plants, which are two important factors for degrading system performance significantly. In the framework of adaptive control, the effects of state constraints and time-varying delays are removed simultaneously. The integral Barrier Lyapunov functionals (IBLFs) are applied to achieve full-state-constraint satisfactions and remove the need of the transformed error constraints in previous BLFs. The unknown time-varying delays are completely compensated by introducing the separation technique and Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKFs). The unknown functions existing in systems are approximated by employing fuzzy logic systems (FLSs). With the help of less-adjustable parameters, only one parameter is needed to be adjusted online in each step of control design. The novel strategy can guarantee that a satisfactory tracking performance is achieved and the signals existing in the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, by presenting simulation results, the efficiency of the proposed approach is revealed.},

The spatial information, along with intensity, is used to exert different effects on different classes. Second, an intuitionistic fuzzy clustering way is incorporated into the process of ship segmentation, which combines the intensity distribution information of the local region. The intuitionistic fuzzy distance and local intensity distribution information would help in solving the problem of intensity inhomogeneity and blurring edges.

It is developed by incorporating the sliding mode control (SMC) theory with an advanced incremental learning machine, namely generic evolving neuro-fuzzy inference system. The controller starts operating from scratch with an empty set of fuzzy rule, and therefore, no offline training is required. To cope with the changing dynamic characteristics of the plant, the controller can add or prune the rules on demand. Control law and adaptation laws for the consequent parameters are derived from the SMC algorithm to establish a stable closed-loop system, where the stability of the G-controller is guaranteed by using the Lyapunov function. The uniform asymptotic convergence of tracking error to zero is witnessed through the implication of an auxiliary robustifying control term. In addition, the implementation of the multivariate Gaussian function helps the controller to handle the nonaxis parallel data from the plant and consequently, enhances the robustness against uncertainties and environmental perturbations. Finally, the controller&#39;s performance has been evaluated by observing the tracking performance in controlling simulated plants of unmanned aerial vehicle, namely bio-inspired flapping wing micro air vehicle and hexacopter for a variety of trajectories.},

New Lyapunov functions are constructed for switched systems with asynchronous switching between subsystems and candidate filters. These improved Lyapunov functions are dependent on the mode of filters instead of subsystems, which are more consistent with the switching mechanism of switched systems with asynchronous switching. Meanwhile, they are quasi-time-dependent, which are effective in achieving more general results than traditional time-independent Lyapunov functions. Based on the new Lyapunov functions, a stability and ℓ 2 -gain criterion is deduced for switched T-S fuzzy systems. Then, switched fuzzy filters are designed to guarantee that the filtering error system is globally uniformly asymptotically stable and has a prescribed H ∞ performance. At last, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the potentials and advantages of the proposed filtering scheme.},

First, the T-S fuzzy model is built by a number of linear submodels and nonlinear membership functions. Then, by introducing the output tracking error to this fuzzy model, the novel augmented state space model is presented to independently regulate the process state variables and output tracking error. The control law of the proposed RFPC is further designed based on this extended model, which can guarantee the process state to be fast convergent and make the process output track the set-point well. Moreover, it increases the ability of adjustment for the proposed controller. Utilizing Lyapunov-Krasovskii method, optimized control theory, and control method, the stable sufficient conditions are given for the designed control law to make sure the asymptotical stability of the nonlinear uncertain system with the time-varying delay and unknown disturbances. The gains of the controller can be obtained by solving these stabilized conditions in form of linear matrix inequality constraints. At last, a case study of continuous stirred tank reactor manifests that the proposed RFPC method can bear a larger range of time delay, overcome the uncertainties and unknown disturbances well, and have better tracking performance.},

Given the ability of deep learning to generalize knowledge from training samples, the proposed method requires minimum amount of information about the system to be controlled. However, in robotics, particularly in aerial robotics where the operating conditions may vary, online learning is required. In this article, fuzzy logic is preferred to provide supervising feedback to the deep model for adapting to variations in the system dynamics as well as new operational conditions. The learning method is divided into two phases: offline pretraining and online posttraining. In the former, the system is controlled by a conventional controller and a deep fuzzy neural network (DFNN) is pretrained based on the recorded input-output dataset, in order to approximate the inverse dynamical model of the system. In the latter, only the pretrained DFNN is used to control the system. In this phase, the fuzzy logic, which encodes the expert knowledge, is utilized to observe the behavior of the system and to correct the action of DFNN instantaneously. The experimental results show that the proposed online learning-based approach improves the trajectory tracking performance of the unmanned aerial vehicle.},

However, uncertainty is inevitably involved in the process of MCDM due to the subjectivity of humans. To address this issue, a novel evidential fuzzy MCDM method, called EFMCDM, is proposed by integrating Dempster-Shafer theory with belief entropy. In particular, each criterion can be modeled as evidence, and all the alternatives compose the frame of discernment in the framework of Dempster-Shafer theory. To generate more appropriate basic probability assignments (BPAs) of the criteria, the EFMCDM method considers both the subjective and objective weighting of the criteria that are leveraged in MCDM problems. Thereafter, the classic Dempster&#39;s rule of combination is leveraged to fuse the multiple pieces of evidence into composite evidence. On this basis, the alternatives are ranked to determine the optimal alternative. In addition, the EFMCDM method can quantitatively model uncertainty and help to decrease the uncertainty caused by subjective human cognition to improve decision making. Finally, the rationality, effectiveness, and robustness of the EFMCDM method are demonstrated through experimental evaluations.},

To compensate enormous uncertainties, a fuzzy fixed-time learning control (FFTLC) by learning two unknown coefficients for the upper bound of uncertainties in each subsystem is designed. As compared with radial basis function neural network, the computational complexity for the compensated uncertainties is much simple. It can be said that an FFTLC is based on a class of online active and distributive uncertain models. Due to the fixed-time control design, the transients often occur, particularly for the larger uncertainties or initial tracking error.

For improving the unacceptable consistent HFPR, a mathematical program is constructed to derive an acceptable consistent HFPR. Thus, an algorithm for checking and improving consistency of HFPR is proposed. A consensus index for the group is defined to measure the agreement among decision makers (DMs). To improve the consistency and consensus simultaneously, a new goal program is established to obtain a group of HFPRs with acceptable consistency and consensus. Subsequently, an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy group decision matrix (IVHFGDM) is elicited from the individual HFPRs. A positive ideal matrix, a left negative ideal matrix, and a right negative matrix are derived from the IVHFGDM. According to the relative closeness degrees, DMs&#39; weights are determined objectively. Afterward, the individual HFPRs are integrated into a normalized collective HFPR. It is proven that the normalized collective HFPR is acceptable consistent if all individual HFPRs are acceptable consistent. The final ranking is generated by the collective overall values of alternatives. Some examples of fuzzy decision-making applications are provided to validate effectiveness of the method.},

Although its enhancements have been intensively explored, fuzzy clustering still suffers from the difficulties in handling real high-dimensional data with complex latent distribution. To solve the problem, this article proposes a deep fuzzy clustering method by representing the data in a feature space produced by the deep neural network. From the perspective of representation learning, three constraints or objectives are imposed to the neural network to enhance the clustering-friendly representation. At first, as a good representation of data, the mapped data in the new feature space should support the reconstruction of original data. So, the autoencoder architecture is applied to ensure that the original data can be recovered by decoding the encoded representation with another neural network. Second, to solve the clustering problem efficiently, the intracluster compactness and the intercluster separability are to be minimized and maximized, respectively, in the new feature space. At last, considering that the data in the same class should be close to each other, the affinities between new representations are tuned in accordance with the discriminative information. Altogether, we design a graph-regularized deep normalized fuzzy compactness and separation clustering model to conduct representation learning and soft clustering simultaneously. The learning algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent is proposed to the model, and the comparative studies with baseline clustering algorithms on real-world data illustrate the superiority of the proposal.},

This is a critical impediment to the widespread deployment of deep learning technology, as decades of research have found that users simply will not trust (i.e., make decisions based on) a model whose solutions cannot be explained. Fuzzy systems, on the other hand, are by design much more easily understood. In this article, we propose to create more comprehensible deep networks by hybridizing them with fuzzy logic. Our proposed architecture first employs a convolutional neural network as an automated feature extractor and then performs a fuzzy clustering in the derived feature space. After hardening the clusters, we employ Rocchio&#39;s algorithm to classify the data points. Experiments on three datasets show that the automated feature extraction substantially improves the accuracy of the fuzzy classifier, and while the substitution of a fuzzy classifier slightly decreases the network&#39;s performance, we are able to introduce an effective interpretation mechanism.},

A key issue of hierarchical classification is to construct a good label structure, which is very significant for classification performance. Several works have been proposed to address the issue, but they have some limitations and are almost designed heuristically. In this article, inspired by fuzzy rough set theory, we propose a deep fuzzy tree model which learns a better tree structure and classifiers for hierarchical classification with theory guarantee.

Each data point of a time series is related to each concept, and we evaluate the strength of relationships with a membership function.

  abstract     = {Different from our previous stacked-structure-based deep fuzzy classifier, in this paper, we explore the distinctive role of adversarial outputs of training samples in enhancing the classification performance of a stacked-structure-based deep fuzzy classifier. In order to achieve such goals, an adversarial Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy classifier, which is denoted as TSKa, is proposed. With the TSKa, interpretable IF parts of first-order fuzzy rules can be generated by the random selection of fixed linguistic terms along each feature. According to our theoretical analysis, adversarial outputs of training samples enhance TSKa&#39;s generalization capability, thereby, resulting in the potential feasibility of leveraging their smooth gradient information with respect to the inputs in the training input space to construct a stacked-structure-based deep fuzzy classifier. In this paper, a novel deep fuzzy classifier is devised by stacking a series of TSKa sub-classifiers and training them by a deep learning strategy. An advantage of the proposed deep fuzzy classifier is its easy yet fast training. The training of each layer consists of two basic steps: computation of the smooth gradient information of adversarial outputs with respect to the inputs, and fast training of each corresponding TSKa by the least learning machine method. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmark datasets and an industrial case demonstrate the promising performance and advantages of the proposed deep fuzzy classifier.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised person reidentification has received more attention due to its wide real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method named fuzzy multilayer clustering (FMC) for unsupervised person reidentification. The proposed FMC learns a new feature space using a multilayer perceptron for clustering in order to overcome the influence of complex pedestrian images. Meanwhile, the proposed FMC generates fuzzy labels for unlabeled pedestrian images, which simultaneously considers the membership degree and the similarity between the sample and each cluster. We further propose the fuzzy label regularization (FLR) to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) using pedestrian images with fuzzy labels in a supervised manner. The proposed FLR could regularize the CNN training process and reduce the risk of overfitting. The effectiveness of our method is validated on three large-scale person reidentification databases, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and CUHK03.},

  abstract     = {We establish a fuzzy deep model called the fuzzy deep belief net (FDBN) based on fuzzy restricted Boltzmann machines (FRBMs) due to their excellent generative and discriminative properties. The learning procedure of an FDBN is divided into a pretraining phase and a subsequent fine-tuning phase. In the pretraining phase, a group of FRBMs is trained in a greedy layerwise way: the first FRBM is trained by original samples, and the average values of the left and right probabilities produced by its hidden units are treated as the training data for subsequent FRBMs. The resulting FDBN is either a generative or a discriminative model depending on the choice of training a generative or a discriminative type of FRBM on top. Then, a hybrid learning approach is proposed to fine-tune this novel fuzzy deep model: the well pretrained fuzzy parameters are first defuzzified, and the FDBN with defuzzified parameters is fine-tuned by the wake-sleep or stochastic gradient descent algorithm. This hybrid strategy not only avoids learning an intractable fuzzy neural network, but also greatly improves the classification capability of the FDBN. The experimental results on MNIST, NORB, and 15 Scene databases indicate that the FDBN with the hybrid learning approach can handle high-dimensional raw images directly. It inherits the fine nature of the FRBM and outperforms some state-of-the-art discriminative models in classification accuracy. Moreover, it shows better capability of robustness than a deep belief net when encountering noisy data.},

  abstract     = {Software vulnerability has long been an important but critical research issue in cybersecurity. Recently, the machine learning (ML)-based approach has attracted increasing interest in the research of software vulnerability detection. However, the detection performance of existing ML-based methods require further improvement. There are two challenges: one is code representation for ML and the other is class imbalance between vulnerable code and nonvulnerable code. To overcome these challenges, this article develops a DeepBalance system, which combines the new ideas of deep code representation learning and fuzzy-based class rebalancing. We design a deep neural network with bidirectional long short-term memory to learn invariant and discriminative code representations from labeled vulnerable and nonvulnerable code. Then, a new fuzzy oversampling method is employed to rebalance the training data by generating synthetic samples for the class of vulnerable code. To evaluate the performance of the new system, we carry out a series of experiments in a real-world ground-truth dataset that consists of the code from the projects of LibTIFF, LibPNG, and FFmpeg. The results show that the proposed new system can significantly improve the vulnerability detection performance. For example, the improvement is 15\% in terms of F-measure.},

  abstract     = {Existing fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) are mostly developed under a shallow network configuration having lower generalization power than those of deep structures. This article proposes a novel self-organizing deep FNN, namely deep evolving fuzzy neural network (DEVFNN). Fuzzy rules can be automatically extracted from data streams or removed if they play limited role during their lifespan. The structure of the network can be deepened on demand by stacking additional layers using a drift detection method, which not only detects the covariate drift, variations of input space, but also accurately identifies the real drift, dynamic changes of both feature space and target space. The DEVFNN is developed under the stacked generalization principle via the feature augmentation concept, where a recently developed algorithm, namely generic classifier, drives the hidden layer. It is equipped by an automatic feature selection method, which controls activation and deactivation of input attributes to induce varying subsets of input features. A deep network simplification procedure is put forward using the concept of hidden layer merging to prevent the uncontrollable growth of dimensionality of input space due to the nature of the feature augmentation approach in building a deep network structure. The DEVFNN works in the samplewise fashion and is compatible for data stream applications. The efficacy of the DEVFNN has been thoroughly evaluated using seven datasets with nonstationary properties under the prequential test-then-train protocol. It has been compared with four popular continual learning algorithms and its shallow counterpart, where the DEVFNN demonstrates improvement of classification accuracy. Moreover, it is also shown that the concept of the drift detection method is an effective tool to control the depth of the network structure, while the hidden layer merging scenario is capable of simplifying the network complexity of a deep network with negligible compromise of generalization performance.},

To design the DCFS based on an input-output data pairs, we propose a bottom-up layer-by-layer scheme. Specifically, by viewing each of the first-layer fuzzy systems as a weak estimator of the output based only on a very small portion of the input variables, we design these fuzzy systems using the Wang-Mendel method. After the first-layer fuzzy systems are designed, we pass the data through the first layer to form a new dataset and design the second-layer fuzzy systems based on this new dataset in the same way as designing the first-layer fuzzy systems. Repeating this process layer-by-layer, we design the whole DCFS. We also propose a DCFS with parameter sharing to save memory and computation. We apply the DCFS models to predict a synthetic chaotic plus random time-series and the real Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong stock market.},

  abstract     = {Information fusion is an essential part of numerous engineering systems and biological functions, e.g., human cognition. Fusion occurs at many levels, ranging from the low-level combination of signals to the high-level aggregation of heterogeneous decision-making processes. While the last decade has witnessed an explosion of research in deep learning, fusion in neural networks has not observed the same revolution. Specifically, most neural fusion approaches are ad hoc, are not understood, are distributed versus localized, and/or explainability is low (if present at all). Herein, we prove that the fuzzy Choquet integral (ChI), a powerful nonlinear aggregation function, can be represented as a multilayer network, referred to hereafter as ChIMP. We also put forth an improved ChIMP (iChIMP) that leads to a stochastic-gradient-descent-based optimization in light of the exponential number of ChI inequality constraints. An additional benefit of ChIMP/iChIMP is that it enables explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Synthetic validation experiments are provided, and iChIMP is applied to the fusion of a set of heterogeneous architecture deep models in remote sensing. We show an improvement in model accuracy, and our previously established XAI indices shed light on the quality of our data, model, and its decisions.},

Analogous to the “dropout” concept in deep learning, the concept of fuzzy-knowledge-out in TSK fuzzy classifiers is motivated by the firing pattern of knowledge in biological neural networks. Our theoretical analysis reveals that a fuzzy classifier built after fuzzy-knowledge-out from a complete set of highly interpretable fuzzy rules is distinctive in generalization and coadaption avoidance. As such, an ensemble called wide learning based TSK (WL-TSK), of highly interpretable zero-order TSK fuzzy subclassifiers constructed quickly by means of fuzzy-knowledge-out operations in a wide learning manner is proposed to achieve enhanced classification performance and high interpretability. With the use of the proposed halving or averaging operations, WL-TSK essentially behaves like only one zero-order TSK fuzzy classifier. Thus, the proposed method can be considered as a new design methodology of TSK fuzzy classifiers. Our experimental results on 15 datasets indicate the effectiveness of WL-TSK in terms of both enhanced classification performance and high interpretability.},

To address this problem, this article proposes a new fuzzy deep neural network having an architecture that integrates fuzzy units and traditional convolutional units. The convolutional units are used to extract discriminative features at different scales to provide comprehensive information for pixel-level lip segmentation. The fuzzy logic modules are employed to handle various kinds of uncertainties and to provide a more robust segmentation result. An end-to-end training scheme is then used to learn the optimal parameters for both the fuzzy and the convolutional units. A dataset containing more than 48 000 images of various speakers, under different lighting conditions, was used to evaluate lip segmentation performance.

More incisively, a dwell time constraint for all subsystems is produced, which reduces the switching frequency and avoids the occurrence of chattering phenomenon or Zeno behavior. Then, sufficient conditions for the existence of the sampled-data-dependent switching strategy and controllers are formulated, under which the switched T-S fuzzy systems is strictly passive without requiring the strict passivity of any subsystem. In addition, the storage function is only decreasing with respect to its value at the sampling times, which in turn implies that the storage function can be nonmonotonous.

  abstract     = {An echo state network (ESN) is a recurrent neural network with low computational complexity. However, a single ESN cannot extract effective features from complex inputs, especially for dealing with low-cost condition signals in machinery fault diagnosis. A novel deep learning model, referred to as the deep fuzzy ESN (DFESN), was proposed to improve the feature extraction capability with less computational burden. In the present method, the output data of the previous ESN reservoir were regarded as abstract feature vectors for the next ESN input. The features were reinforced in each hidden layer by using fuzzy clustering as a tuning step for classification enhancement. In this way, layerwise fuzzy tuning was developed to replace traditional overall feedback fine tuning in deep models. This improved learning efficiency and robustness while overcoming the vanishing gradient problem for deep learning. The superiority of the proposed approach was evaluated by both theoretical analysis and experimental tests. The results showed that the present DFESN features improved classification accuracy and reduced the computational burden. In addition to machinery fault diagnosis, the proposed DFESN also has potential for other deep learning applications.},

This paper, we propose a preprocessing technique that enriches the original image data using local intensity information; this technique is motivated by human perception. To encode this information into an image, we introduce a new image structure named image represented by a fuzzy function. When using this structure, a crisp intensity value of each pixel is replaced by a fuzzy set given by a membership function constructed with the usage of extremal values from the particular neighborhood of that pixel. We describe this structure and its properties and propose a way in which it can be used as an input into existing NNs without any modifications. Based on our benchmark consisting of three well-known datasets and five NN architectures, we show that the proposed preprocessing can, in most cases, decrease classification error compared with a baseline and two other preprocessing methods. To support our claim, we have also selected several publicly available projects and tested the impact of the preprocessing with a positive result.},

They are usually well suited for performing multiple functional compositions at either crisp or linguistic level. Deep learning has gained significant attention within the computational intelligence community in recent years. Its success has been mainly due to the increased power of modern computational platforms in terms of their ability to collect, store, and process large volumes of data. This has led to a substantial increase in the effectiveness and efficiency of data management. As a result, it has become possible to achieve high accuracy for some benchmark learning tasks, such as object classification and image recognition within a short time frame. The most common implementation of deep learning has been through neural networks due to the ability of their layers of neurons to perform multiple functional compositions as part of a multistage learning process.},

Even though the rule set (RS) and membership function (MF) framed intuitively in our previous fuzzy logic (FL) approach performs the trusted routing satisfactorily, it consumes computational memory and reduces the energy efficiency of the node. To address this issue, in this article, we proposed a novel trust evaluation framework that employs water cycle algorithm (WCA) for automatic tuning of the rule set and membership function for the decision variable to route the packet in an adaptable manner. Variables like distance, link stability, and node honesty are considered for evaluation using WCA in three iterative processes, namely, exploitation, evaporation, and raining to find the near optimal if-then rules and points for the membership functions. An experimental setup is created using Network Simulator-2 (NS2) to evaluate the performance of the proposed trusted routing algorithm in SGCN. Extensive experiments are conducted for three cases, namely, 1) evaluating RS with fixed MF; 2) evaluating MF with fixed RS; and 3) combined evaluation of MF and RS to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. From the simulation results, it is clear that the RS and MF generated by the proposed model is small and compact enough to provide reliable routing in SGCN.},

Due consideration of this fact has motivated the development of the approach illustrated hereafter. In this article, a vehicle routing problem (VRP) with generalized fuzzy travel times, multiple depots, split delivery (including inter depot split), and heterogenous, capacitated, alternative fuel driven vehicles, is studied. A hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) is designed to produce efficient solutions. Since traditional methods are incapable of computing the expected values of such fuzzy variables, the technique of fuzzy simulation is incorporated in the GA. Five alternative fuel vehicles-electric, hybrid, diesel, biodiesel, and CNG, are evaluated vis-a-vis multiple criteria using fuzzy hierarchical technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and their respective scores are input in the hybrid GA for sustainable, apt, and low-cost assignment of vehicles to routes. The algorithm is run for multiple combinations of crossover and mutation probabilities, vehicle capacities, location instances, and number of generations. The experimental results substantiate the robustness of the proposed approach and suffice to project the strength of the computationally challenging model.},

  abstract     = {The solutions proposed in this article are based on our experience with fuzzy systems (FSs), their interpretability, and population-based algorithms (PBAs). They provide a consistent approach to the design of interpretable FSs. First, PBAs can make a useful tool for selecting both parameters and the FS structure. In practice, such structure is usually chosen by trial and error. Second, in this article, we propose a new multipopulation PBA, which uses a variety of search formulas. This helps to eliminate the problem of incorrect PBA selection. Third, we propose interesting solutions for the interpretability of FSs with trapezoidal membership functions. These functions are well suited for modeling ranges of linguistic variables. We are particularly interested in providing them with original interpretability criteria, which are used by a PBA to design FSs. Furthermore, we offer an original way of setting up trapezoidal functions, which prevents them from overlapping with each other. Fourth, we believe that interpretability can be achieved through a capable extension of fuzzy rules. That is the reason why we used weights and dedicated operators for their processing. In this article, a different extension of the rules base is proposed. It involves adding relation operators (ROs) (e.g., “&gt;” and “&gt;=”), which can be used to model linguistic phrases, e.g. “electrical voltage less than or equal to high.” An additional task of the PBA is the automatic selection of an RO, which facilitates the extraction of knowledge from the data.

Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is an adaptive network that uses supervised learning on learning algorithm. To achieve effective results with ANFIS, selecting the optimization method in training is very important. Heuristics and metaheuristics algorithms attempt to find the best solution out of all possible solutions to an optimization problem. ANFIS training can be based on nonderivative algorithms. Heuristics and metaheuristics are nonderivative algorithms that can lead to better performance in ANFIS training. Most heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms are taken from the behavior of biological systems or physical systems in nature. The newly released emperor penguins colony (EPC) algorithm is a population-based and nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm. This algorithm has much potential for solving various problems. In this article, an optimized ANFIS based on the new EPC algorithm is proposed. The optimized ANFIS is compared with other nonderivative algorithms on benchmark data sets. Eventually, the proposed algorithm is used to solve the classical inverted pendulum problem.

  abstract     = {Machine learning has been increasingly used in decoding brain states from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). One important application is to classify the levels of pain perception from patients’ fMRI for clinical pain assessment. However, the huge number of fMRI features and the complex relationships between fMRI and pain levels affect the performance of pain classification models heavily. In this article, we introduce a new fuzzy-rule-based hybrid optimization approach for dimension reduction and multiclassification problems using chaotic map, crow search optimization (CSO), and self-organizing fuzzy logic prototype (SOFLP). The approach is named as CCSO–SOFLP. In the proposed approach, chaotic map-based CSO is employed to find the optimal features from ultra-high-dimensional fMRI, and the fuzzy-rule-based SOFLP is employed for multiclassification of pain levels. In this sense, CSO is provided to avoid being stuck in local minima and to increase the computational performance. On the other hand, multilayer SOFLP classifier can continuously learn from new data and identify prototypes from the observed data and use them to build fuzzy rules, to define a suitable local area for each prototype, and to avoid overlapping. The proposed approach is applied on a pain-evoked fMRI data set to classify the levels of pain. Results indicate that the proposed approach can decode levels of pain and identify predictive fMRI patterns with higher accuracy and convergence speed and shorter execution time. Therefore, the new type of fuzzy-rule-based system with chaotic swarm intelligence holds great potential to predict pain perception in clinical uses.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence methods are used in many fields of applications. One of them is biometrics. It deals with a broadly understood analysis of physical and behavioral biometric characteristics. Behavioral characteristics are particularly important from a practical point of view. They describe, among others, learned behaviors of human beings. They include the ways of signing, lip movement, gait, etc. Such features are difficult to forge, so their use in biometric systems increases security. The dynamics of signing is particularly important because it is considered socially acceptable worldwide. However, the problem associated with its processing results from its possible instability over time, as the signature is likely to evolve. In a situation where the method of signing is only partially altered (and not completely changed), the trend in possible changes can be predicted. In this article, we propose a new approach to predicting such changes. For this purpose, we use the possibilities offered by fuzzy systems (FSs) and population-based algorithms (PBAs). The purpose of applying the PBA is to select parameters and the structure of the FSs and to select reference signatures for each user separately so as to maximize prediction accuracy. Prediction results are included in the final verification of signatures. An important feature of the prediction mechanism is also its ability to interpret the changes occurring in signature handwriting because they are represented by the fuzzy rules base. This type of a flexible and nature-inspired prediction mechanism would be very difficult to implement with the use of other methods. The developed mechanisms can be used in various fields of applications-also in those not related to biometrics.},

  abstract     = {During general anesthesia, anesthesiologists who provide anesthetic dosage traditionally play a fundamental role to regulate bispectral index (BIS). However, in this article, an optimized type-2 self-organizing fuzzy logic controller (SOFLC) is designed for a target controlled infusion pump related to propofol dosing guided by BIS, to realize automatic control of general anesthesia. The type-2 SOFLC combines a type-2 fuzzy logic controller with a self-organizing mechanism to facilitate online training while able to contend with operational uncertainties. A novel data-driven surrogate model and genetic programming-based strategy is introduced for optimizing the type-2 SOFLC parameters offline to handle interpatient variability. A pharmacological model is built for simulation in which different optimization strategies are tested and compared. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the applicability of our approach and show that the proposed optimization strategy can achieve better control performance in terms of steady-state error and robustness.},

Multitask optimization applies multitask learning an optimization to study how effectively and efficiently tackle the multiple optimization problems, simultaneously. Evolutionary multitasking, or multifactorial optimization, is an emerging subfield of multitask optimization, which integrates evolutionary computation and multitask learning. This article proposes a novel and easy-to-implement multitasking genetic algorithm (MTGA), which copes well with significantly different optimization tasks by estimating and using the bias among them. Comparative studies with eight state-of-the-art single-task and multitask approaches in the literature on nine benchmarks demonstrated that, on average, the MTGA outperformed all of them and had lower computational cost than six of them. Based on the MTGA, a simultaneous optimization strategy for fuzzy system design is also proposed. Experiments on simultaneous optimization of type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy logic controllers for couple-tank water level control demonstrated that the MTGA can find better fuzzy logic controllers than other approaches.},

  abstract     = {Learning large-scale fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) with the sparse attribute automatically from time series without prior knowledge remains a challenging problem. Most existing automated learning methods were applied to learn small-scale FCMs, and the learned FCMs are much denser than the maps constructed by human experts. Learning FCMs is the procedure of judging whether there are connecting edges and determining the weights of connecting edges. Thus, we transform the problem of learning FCMs into a biobjective optimization problem with two objects of minimizing the measure error and the number of nonzero entries, respectively. To solve this optimization problem, a preference-based iterative thresholding evolutionary biobjective optimization algorithm for learning FCMs is proposed. The strategy focuses on the knee area of the Pareto front (PF) with preference on the solutions near the true sparsity. Moreover, an initialization operator based on random forest is proposed to increase the speed of convergence toward the PF. The experiments on large-scale synthetic data with varying sizes and densities and the application to the gene regulatory network reconstruction problem have been conducted to demonstrate that our proposal matches or exceeds the existing state-of-the-art FCM learning approaches in most cases in terms of four measures, namely, Data_Error, Out_of_Sample_Error, Model Error, and SS_Mean. The Data_Error obtained by the proposed method can achieve 3.07E-06 even when the number of nodes reaches 200. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed initialization operator and the preference-based strategy, which can result in a fast convergence speed and higher accuracy.},

Inspired by the connections between TSK fuzzy systems and neural networks, we extend three powerful neural network optimization techniques, i.e., minibatch gradient descent (MBGD), regularization, and AdaBound, to TSK fuzzy systems, and also propose three novel techniques (DropRule, DropMF, and DropMembership) specifically for training TSK fuzzy systems. Our final algorithm, MBGD with regularization, DropRule, and AdaBound, can achieve fast convergence in training TSK fuzzy systems, and also superior generalization performance in testing. It can be used for training TSK fuzzy systems on datasets of any size; however, it is particularly useful for big datasets, on which currently no other efficient training algorithms exist.},

In this article, we propose to build a fuzzy semantic representation (FSR) method for rare words through a hierarchical clustering method to group rare words together, and integrate it into the encoder–decoder framework. This hierarchical structure can compensate for the semantic information in both source and target sides, and providing fuzzy context information to capture the semantic of rare words. The introduced FSR can also alleviate the data sparseness, which is the bottleneck in dealing with rare words in neural machine translation. In particular, our method is easily extended to the transformer-based neural machine translation model and learns the FSRs of all in-vocabulary words to enhance the sentence representations in addition to rare words. Our experiments on Chinese-to-English translation tasks confirm a significant improvement in the translation quality brought by the proposed method.},

However, the existing neighborhood-based classification methods rigidly assign a certain class label to each data instance and lack the strategies to handle the uncertain instances. The far-fetched certain classification of uncertain instances may suffer serious risks. To tackle this problem, in this article, we propose a novel shadowed set to construct shadowed neighborhoods for uncertain data classification. For the fuzzy-rough transformation in the proposed shadowed set, a step function is utilized to map fuzzy neighborhood memberships to the set of triple typical values {0, 1, 0.5} and thereby partition a neighborhood into certain regions and uncertain boundary (neighborhood shadow). The threshold parameter in the step function for constructing shadowed neighborhoods is optimized through minimizing the membership loss in the mapping of shadowed sets. Based on the constructed shadowed neighborhoods, we implement a three-way classification algorithm to distinguish data instances into certain classes and uncertain case. Experiments validate the proposed three-way classification method with shadowed neighborhoods is effective in handling uncertain data and reducing the classification risk.},

  abstract     = {Image segmentation is an important prerequisite step for any automatic clinical analysis technique. It assists in visualization of human tissues, as accurate delineation of medical images requires involvement of expert practitioners, which is also time consuming. In this background, the rough-fuzzy clustering algorithm provides an effective approach for image segmentation. It handles uncertainties arising due to overlapping classes and incompleteness in class definition by partitioning the fuzzy approximation spaces. However, the existing rough-fuzzy clustering algorithms do not consider the spatial distribution of the image. They depend only on the distribution of pixels to determine their class labels. In this regard, this article introduces a new algorithm, termed as spatially constrained rough-fuzzy c-means (sRFCM) for medical image segmentation. The proposed sRFCM algorithm combines wisely the merits of rough-fuzzy clustering and local neighborhood information. In the proposed algorithm, the labels of local neighbors influence in the determination of the label of center pixel. The effect of local neighbors acts as a regularizer. Moreover, the proposed sRFCM algorithm partitions each cluster in possibilistic lower approximation or core region and probabilistic boundary region. The cluster centroid depends on the core and boundary regions, weight parameter, and neighborhood regularizer. A novel segmentation validity index, termed as neighborhood Silhouette, is proposed to find out the optimum values of regularizer and weight parameter, controlling the performance of the sRFCM. The efficacy of the proposed sRFCM algorithm, as well as several existing segmentation algorithms, is demonstrated on four brain MR volume databases and one HEp-2 cell image data.},

We propose a novel fuzzy min-max neural network (FMNN)-FRS reduct computation approach utilizing the FMNN to enhance the scalability of FRS approaches. The FMNN provides a single pass epoch learning of arriving at granules of objects in the form of fuzzy hyperboxes for multiple decision classes. In the proposed approach, the FMNN model is used to reconstruct the object-based decision system into a fuzzy hyperbox-based interval-valued decision system. Then, a novel way of constructing the fuzzy discernibility matrix (FDM) from the interval-valued decision system is introduced. A fuzzy rough approximate reduct computation algorithm is developed with the induced FDM. The FMNN-FRS approach reduces the space complexity of FRS reduct computation significantly and results in enhanced scalability. Comparative experimental analysis has been done with the existing FRS reduct approaches on benchmark hybrid decision systems and established the relevance of the FMNN-FRS approach. The FMNN-FRS approach obtained the exact reduct in most of the datasets in much lesser computational time than existing FRS approaches while preserving similar classification accuracy.

We first introduce rough neurons and enhance the consequence nodes, and further integrate the interval type-2 fuzzy set into the existing fuzzy rough neural network model.

While simultaneously considering the objectives of prediction precision and network simplicity, each model is transformed into a multiobjective optimization problem by encoding the structure, membership functions, and the parameters of the network. To solve these optimization problems, distributed parallel multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are proposed. We enhance the optimization processes with several measures including optimizer replacement and parameter adaption. In the distributed parallel environment, the tedious and time-consuming neural network optimization can be alleviated by numerous computational resources, significantly reducing the computational time.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rough nearest neighbor classification with ordered weighted averaging operators (FRNN-OWA) is an algorithm that classifies unseen instances according to their membership in the fuzzy upper and lower approximations of the decision classes. Previous research has shown that the use of OWA operators increases the robustness of this model. However, calculating membership in an approximation requires a nearest neighbor search. In practice, the query time complexity of exact nearest neighbor search algorithms in more than a handful of dimensions is near linear, which limits the scalability of FRNN-OWA. Therefore, we propose approximate FRNN-OWA, a modified model that calculates upper and lower approximations of decision classes using the approximate nearest neighbors returned by hierarchical navigable small worlds (HNSW), a recent approximative nearest neighbor search algorithm with logarithmic query time complexity at constant near-100\% accuracy. We demonstrate that approximate FRNN-OWA is sufficiently robust to match the classification accuracy of exact FRNN-OWA while scaling much more efficiently. We test four parameter configurations of HNSW and evaluate their performance by measuring classification accuracy and construction and query times for samples of various sizes from three large datasets. We find that with two of the parameter configurations, approximate FRNN-OWA achieves near-identical accuracy to exact FRNN-OWA for most sample sizes within query times that are up to several orders of magnitude faster.},

IoT devices may constantly produce enormous amounts of data as data streams that can be analyzed in real time and also collected for further exploration in data lakes in huge data centers. Due to their scaling capabilities, these data centers are frequently located in the Cloud. However, recent rapid growth in the number of IoT devices and their applications in manufacturing, transport, and health care motivates moving the burden of data processing and analysis to the Edge. One of the phases of data processing is combining data streams from two (or more) IoT devices that monitor the same object and work asynchronously. Since they generate sensor readings at various moments of time, their data streams must be properly combined in order to obtain a complete image of the monitored object or process. In this article, we present the idea of a hopping umbrella which fuzzifies timestamps from sensor readings while joining data streams from asynchronous IoT devices in a flexible way. In contrast to processing data at rest, the hopping umbrella implements the fuzzy join operation in time windows for data streams (data in motion). By using fuzzy sets, the hopping umbrella not only allows combining asynchronous events from multiple sensors, but also facilitates evaluation of the degree of matching of the combined sensor readings, and consequently allows for reduction of the output stream size. Our experiments performed in Cloud and on Edge devices proved that with the use of this idea, we are able to properly join the best matching sensor readings and in some scenarios, reduce the number of data transferred to the Cloud data center without significant overhead in resource utilization of stream processing units.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is a popular technique of preprocessing data. In order to deal with dynamic or large data, incremental feature selection has been developed, in which the features selected from existing data are integrated with those mined from both existing and dynamic data in the manner of incremental computation. Fuzzy rough set theory is powerful in handling uncertainty in real-valued data or even mixed data, and one of its most important applications is feature selection. Nevertheless, not much work has been found on fuzzy-rough-set-based incremental feature selection. Therefore, in this article, we investigate the incremental feature selection using a fuzzy-rough-set-based information entropy with incoming instances. Specifically, the representative instances from the incoming ones are first selected according to the information coverage of fuzzy granules generated by fuzzy rough sets. Then, the incremental mechanism of the fuzzy-rough-set-based information entropy is formulated by adding newcome instances. Finally, an incremental feature selection procedure, which we call active incremental feature selection, is proposed. Furthermore, some numerical experiments are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed feature selection algorithm, and the results show that our algorithm is of a prominent advantage in terms of computational time, especially for a dataset with large number of instances.},

In this article, we aim to develop a method of fusing ordinal decision trees with fuzzy rough-set-based attribute reduction. Most of the existing attribute reduction methods for ordinal decision tables are based on the dominance rough set theory or significance measures. However, the crisp dominance relation is difficult in making full use of the information of attribute values; and the reducts based on significance measures are poor in interpretability and may contain unnecessary attributes. In this article, we first define a discernibility matrix with fuzzy dominance rough set. With this discernibility matrix, multiple reducts can be found, which provide multiple complementary feature subspaces with original information. Then, diverse ordinal trees can be established from these feature subspaces, and finally, the trees are fused by majority voting. The experimental results show that the proposed fusion method performs significantly better than other fusion methods using dominance rough set or significance measures.},

Several approaches have been proposed to improve its accuracy, where fuzzy approaches prove to be among the most successful, highlighting the classical fuzzy k-nearest neighbors (FkNN). However, these traditional algorithms fail to tackle the large amounts of data that are available today. There are multiple alternatives to enable kNN classification in big datasets, spotlighting the approximate version of kNN called hybrid spill tree. Nevertheless, the existing proposals of FkNN for big data problems are not fully scalable, because a high computational load is required to obtain the same behavior as the original FkNN algorithm. This article proposes global approximate hybrid spill tree FkNN and local hybrid spill tree FkNN, two approximate approaches that speed up runtime without losing quality in the classification process. The experimentation compares various FkNN approaches for big data with datasets of up to 11 million instances. The results show an improvement in runtime and accuracy over literature algorithms.},

However, the classic fuzzy rough set algorithm takes all the data correlations into account, which leads to the centralized computing mode, requiring high computing and memory space resources. With the increasing amount of data in the big data era, the centralized server cannot afford the computation of fuzzy rough set. To enable the fuzzy rough set for big data analysis, in this article, we propose the novel distributed fuzzy rough set (DFRS)-based feature selection, which separates and assigns the tasks to multiple nodes for parallel computing. The key challenge is to maintain the global information on each distributed node without conserving the entire fuzzy relation matrix. We tackle this challenge by a dynamic data decomposition algorithm and a data summarization process on each distributed node. Extensive experiments based on multiple real datasets demonstrate that DFRS significantly improves the runtime, and its feature selection accuracy is nearly the same as the traditional centralized computing.},

The major deficiency of this model is that the classical rough set model is sensitive to noise in classification learning due to the stringent condition of equivalence relation. Thus, a class of fuzzy similarity relations was introduced to describe the similarity between samples with categorical attributes. However, these kinds of similarity relations also have deficiencies when they are used in fuzzy rough computation. In this article, we propose a new fuzzy-rough-set model for categorical data by introducing a variable parameter to control the similarity of samples. This model employs the iterative computation strategy to define fuzzy rough approximations and dependence functions. It is proved that the proposed rough dependence function is monotonic. Finally, the proposed model is applied to the attribute reduction of categorical data. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model is more effective for categorical data than some existing algorithms.},

This article comprehensively investigates the reliability and applicability of proposing a coevolutionary model to formulate the interaction pattern among the crimes and locations and develops a fuzzy-rough-set-based feature selection method to discover the distinctiveness and permanence properties of the crimes and locations with different latent features. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm achieves the mean absolute error of 1.529 (hour) in the crime time inference and the accuracy of 0.653 and 0.633 in the crime type and location inference, which surpass the state of the arts more than 6.5, 1.9, and 1.8 times, respectively.

This means that the clusters and the local models share the same parameters; therefore, the number of parameters of the evolving system is much lower in comparison to similar systems of comparable complexity, and the problems of parameter identifiability are not a particular issue. The algorithm adds the local models in an incremental fashion and recursively adapts the local model parameters. The proposed algorithm is tested on three examples to demonstrate the main features. The first example is a simple simulated example with intersecting clusters; the second is a very well-known benchmark that treats the Mackey-Glass time series; the third is an example that shows the classification of the data from a laser rangefinder. These examples show the great potential of the proposed approach in certain applications.},

The peculiarity of this extended class is that the control gain functions are not bounded a priori but simply taken to be continuous and with a known sign. In contrast with existing strategies, controllability must be guaranteed by constructing appropriate compact sets ensuring that all trajectories in the closed-loop system never leave these sets. We manage to do this by means of invariant set theory in combination with the Lyapunov theory. In other words, boundedness is achieved a posteriori as a result of stability analysis. The approximator composed of fuzzy logic systems and Fourier series expansion is constructed to deal with the unknown periodic disturbance terms.},

  abstract     = {Over the years, financial engineering ranging from the study of financial signals to the modeling of financial prediction is one of the most exciting topics for both academia and financial community. With the flourishing AI technology in the past 20 years, various hybrid intelligent financial prediction systems with the integration of neural networks, chaos theory, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms have been proposed. An interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) with its remarkable capability for the modeling of highly uncertain events and attributes provides a perfect tool to interpret various financial phenomena and patterns. In this paper, the author proposes a chaotic type-2 transient-fuzzy deep neuro-oscillatory network with retrograde signaling (CT2TFDNN) for worldwide financial prediction. With the extension of author&#39;s original work on Lee oscillator-a chaotic discrete-time neural oscillator with profound transient-chaotic property-CT2TFDNN provides: effective modeling of an IT2FLS with a chaotic transient-fuzzy membership function; and effective time-series network training and prediction using a chaotic deep neuro-oscillatory network with retrograde signaling. CT2TFDNN not only provides a fast chaotic fuzzy-neuro deep learning and forecast solution, but also successfully resolves the massive data overtraining and deadlock problems, which are usually imposed by traditional recurrent neural networks using classical sigmoid-based activation functions. From the implementation perspective, CT2TFDNN is integrated with 2048 trading-day time-series financial data and top-10 major financial signals as fuzzy financial signals for the real-time prediction of 129 worldwide financial products that consists of: nine major cryptocurrencies, 84 worldwide forex, 19 major commodities, and 17 worldwide financial indices.},

With rapid advances in technology, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) has become an effective algorithm for epistasis detection. Classification of high-risk (H) and low-risk (L) groups in MDR operations is a key topic, but it has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we propose an improved fuzzy c-means-based entropy (FCME) approach to address the limitations of binary classification. For this approach, the degree of membership in MDR, referred to as FCMEMDR, was used. The FCME approach and MDR measure were integrated to enable more precise differentiation between similar frequencies of multifactor genotypes in the cases of possible epistasis. We used the MDR measures of correct classification rate and likelihood ratio. Numerous simulated datasets were applied, and the experimental results revealed two measures of FCMEMDR with higher detection rates than those of other MDR-based algorithms. Our analysis of binary and fuzzy classifications in MDR operations may offer insights into the problem of uncertainty in H/L classification. Two measures of FCMEMDR detected significant instances of epistasis associated with coronary artery disease in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium dataset.

  abstract     = {Different rough approximation spaces could be induced for an information system by its different attribute subsets, thus the multigranularity rough approximations of a fuzzy concept could be developed. Research on the uncertainty in multi-granulation spaces becomes a basic issue of uncertainty measure. If the uncertainty measure is not accurate enough, two different rough approximation spaces of a fuzzy concept may have the same uncertainty, and the difference between them for describing a fuzzy concept cannot be reflected. In this case, attribute reduction, granularity selection, and multigranularity measure cannot be conducted effectively. Therefore, establishing an uncertainty measure model with strong distinguishing ability in multi-granulation spaces is a key issue in uncertainty knowledge processing. In this paper, this problem will be solved in the view of knowledge distance. First, a fuzzy knowledge distance measure (FKD) based on the Earth Mover&#39;s distance is introduced. Even if two rough approximation spaces possess the same uncertainty when describing a fuzzy concept, they can be discriminated by FKD. Then, by studying the change rules of the FKD in a hierarchical quotient space structure, it is found that the FKD between any two rough approximation spaces in an HQSS is equal to the difference between their granularity measure or information measure. Furthermore, in order to show the applicability of the FKD, the FKD is used in granularity selection, attribute reduct, and multigranularity measure. The experimental results show that the FKD-based attribute significance function has a more powerful ability to obtain shorter reduct and it is more robustness, which show the effectiveness of the FKD.},

Second, by suitable operations on parameter-dependent polynomial multiplied by state rate, a couple of novel intermediary-polynomial-based functions (IPFs) are developed in delay-product types. Benefitting from slack matrices of IPFs, a certain degree of flexibility is furnished. More importantly than that, by feat of adjustment of the variable parameter, the resulting conditions will be further endowed with additive freedom, which relaxes the feasible space in a distinctive manner. Third, by utilizing IPFs along with triple integrals, the stability criteria and the controller design approach are derived by some advanced integral inequalities. Resorting to elaborate construction of IPFs, the strengths of bounding techniques are sufficiently exploited, and the information on delay derivative is adequately reflected. Consequently, more desirable performances are achieved, while without excessive computational complexity. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Evidence theory, also called belief function theory, provides an efficient tool to represent and combine uncertain information for pattern classification. Evidence combination can be interpreted, in some applications, as classifier fusion. The sources of evidence corresponding to multiple classifiers usually exhibit different classification qualities, and they are often discounted using different weights before combination. In order to achieve the best possible fusion performance, a new credal belief redistribution (CBR) method is proposed to revise such evidence. The rationale of CBR consists of transferring belief from one class not just to other classes, but also to the associated disjunctions of classes (i.e., meta-classes). As classification accuracy for different objects in a given classifier can also vary, the evidence is revised according to prior knowledge mined from its training neighbors. If the selected neighbors are relatively close to the evidence, a large amount of belief will be discounted for redistribution. Otherwise, only a small fraction of belief will enter the redistribution procedure. An imprecision matrix estimated based on these neighbors is employed to specifically redistribute the discounted beliefs. This matrix expresses the likelihood of misclassification (i.e., the probability of a test pattern belonging to a class different from the one assigned to it by the classifier). In CBR, the discounted beliefs are divided into two parts. One part is transferred between singleton classes, whereas the other is cautiously committed to the associated meta-classes. By doing this, one can efficiently reduce the chance of misclassification by modeling partial imprecision. The multiple revised pieces of evidence are finally combined by the Dempster-Shafer rule to reduce uncertainty and further improve classification accuracy. The effectiveness of CBR is extensively validated on several real datasets from the UCI repository and critically compared with that of other related fusion methods.},

The aim of this paper is to develop a new method to calculate the centroid of an IT2 FS when the problems of centroid computation of an IT2 FS are continuous. For the continuous centroid computation problems, the structures of optimal solutions are strictly proven from mathematics for the first time in this paper. Furthermore, we also prove that the structures of the optimal solutions are unique in the sense of almost everywhere equal, i.e., if there are two optimal solutions f 1 (x) and f 2 (x), the Lebesgue measure of {x|f 1 (x) ≠ f 2 (x)} is equal to 0. Subsequently, a combinatorial iterative (CI) method is proposed to solve the roots of the sufficiently differentiable objective functions. It is proven that the convergence of the proposed iterative method is at least sixth order. Based on the proposed iterative method, two algorithms, called CI algorithms, are devised to compute the centroid of anIT2 FS. The efficiencies of CI algorithms are demonstrated by comparing the continuous Karnik-Mendel algorithms and the Hallye&#39;s methods with the CI algorithms through three numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In the field of information fusion, the problem of data aggregation has been formalized as an order-preserving process that builds upon the property of monotonicity. However, fields such as computational statistics, data analysis, and geometry usually emphasize the role of equivariances to various geometrical transformations in aggregation processes. Admittedly, if we consider a unidimensional data fusion task, both requirements are often compatible with each other. Nevertheless, in this paper, we show that, in the multidimensional setting, the only idempotent functions that are monotone and orthogonal equivariant are the over-simplistic weighted centroids. Even more, this result still holds after replacing monotonicity and orthogonal equivariance by the weaker property of orthomonotonicity. This implies that the aforementioned approaches to the aggregation of multidimensional data are irreconcilable, and that, if a weighted centroid is to be avoided, we must choose between monotonicity and a desirable behavior with regard to orthogonal transformations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose reinforced fuzzy clustering-based ensemble neural networks (FCENNs) classifier. The objective of this paper is focused on the development of the design methodologies of ensemble neural networks classifier for constructing the network structure and enhancing the learning methods of fuzzy clustering-based neural networks through the combination of the probabilistic model and its learning mechanism. The proposed FCENNs classifier takes into consideration a cross-entropy error function to improve learning while L 2 norm regularization is used to reduce overfitting as well as enhance generalization abilities. The essential points of the proposed reinforced FCENNs classifier can be enumerated as follows: First, in the proposed classifier, the cross-entropy error function is used as a cost function; to do this, a softmax function is applied to represent a categorical distribution located at the nodes of the output layer. Second, the learning mechanism is composed of two parts. First, fuzzy C-means clustering forms the connections (weights) of the hidden layer while the connections of the output layer are adjusted with the aid of the nonlinear least squares method using Newton&#39;s method-based learning. Third, L 2 norm-regularization is considered to avoid the degradation of generalization ability caused by overfitting. The learning mechanism similar to ridge regression is realized by adding L 2 penalty term to the cross-entropy error function. From the viewpoint of performance improvement achieved through the proposed novel learning method, the design methodology for the ensemble neural networks classifier is discussed and analyzed with the aid of a diversity of two-dimensional synthetic data and machine learning datasets.},

  abstract     = {Present-day handheld battery-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablets attract rich user experience but are often criticized for their short battery lives. Battery life is a subjective term and depends on a user&#39;s perceptions. A novel work to achieve power optimization for these devices, according to users&#39; perceptions, was the design of user-satisfaction-aware power management approach, perceptual computer power management approach (Per-C PMA). But we have found that the design of Per-C PMA requires collection of data intervals from a group of subjects. This limits the practical viability of Per-C PMA for highly personal handheld battery-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablets. So, here we propose a user-satisfaction-aware PMA called Per-C for Personalized Power Management Approach or “Per-C PPMA,” one that achieves significant reductions in power consumption compared to existing PMAs and noticeable improvements in the overall user satisfaction. Per-C PPMA uses the mathematical technique of person footprint of uncertainty (FOU) to process users&#39; linguistic opinions. Person FOU can either use an interval approach (IA) or Hao-Mendel approach (HMA) for data processing. The recommendations generated using IA and HMA are the same. However, IA takes a much higher computational time than HMA, even though both have the same asymptotic complexity of O(w * n). We strongly believe that Per-C PPMA is a novel technique and our work is the first such application of Person FOU on any hardware platform. An important outcome of this study is a ready-to-use mobile app “Per-C PPMA” (currently freely available on the website http://www.sau.int/~cilab/).},

  abstract     = {Current models and algorithms have been increasingly required to learn in a nonstationary environment because the phenomenon of concept drift (or pattern shift) may occur, that is, the assumption that data are identically distributed may be invalid in data streams. Once the data pattern changes, a well-trained model built on the previous, now obsolete data cannot provide an accurate prediction for future data. To obtain reliable prediction, it is important to understand the existing patterns in the data stream and to know which pattern the current examples belong to during the modeling process. However, it is ambiguous to classify an example to a certain pattern in many real-world cases. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive regression approach, called FUZZ-CARE, to dynamically recognize, train, and store patterns, and assign the membership degree of the upcoming examples belonging to these patterns. Membership degrees are presented by the membership matrix obtained from a kernel fuzzy c-means clustering, which is synchronously trained and adapted with regression parameters. Rather than designing a complicated procedure to continuously chase the newest pattern, which is a common approach in the literature, FUZZ-CARE abstracts useful past information to help predict newly arrived examples. It thus effectively avoids the risk of insufficient training due to the lack of new data and improves prediction accuracy. Experiments on six synthetic datasets and 21 real-world datasets validate the high accuracy and robustness of our approach.},

The closed-loop stability is guaranteed during the adaptation process. The fuzzy controller is assumed to be a nonlinearity in a bounded sector and is defined by highly interpretable fuzzy rules. The absolute stability criterion for the system, containing PID-like fuzzy controller, is delivered.

The global consensus conditions are also derived for the first-order and second-order unknown MASs, which overcomes the drawback of the semiglobal consensus in existing literature. It is worth mentioning that the proposed approach can greatly alleviate the computation burden because it only needs to update a few parameters. An efficient framework is also given to achieve the global formation control of the second-order unknown nonlinear MAS with an undirected connected graph.

The proposed framework facilitates the manipulation of the structure of the system matrix, the parameter vector - including state elements - and the vertex systems. The motivation behind this capability is that all of these structural components strongly influence the control design and the resulting control performance. An important feature of the framework is that it is agnostic towards the formulation of the state-space model, i.e., whether it is given using soft-computing-based techniques or closed formulae. The proposed approach is an extension of the TP model-based control design framework and inherits all of its advantageous properties, e.g., it can be easily used to find minimal representations, including the higher order singular value-based canonical form, and it supports the clear formulation of complexity/accuracy tradeoffs and allows for conversions to various types of convex representations, making for a flexible way to manipulate the weighting and antecedent functions. This paper gives examples to show how the framework can be used in a routine-like fashion and to highlight how it can be applied to the problem of finding useful T-S fuzzy model variations of a given model.},

Subsequently, based on the T-S fuzzy model, a stabilization scheme containing the fuzzy controllers and the guidance of mobile actuator/sensor pairs is proposed, where the spatial domain is decomposed into multiple subdomains according to the number of actuator/sensor pairs and each actuator/sensor pair is capable of moving within the respective subdomain. Then, by a Lyapunov direct technique, an integrated design of fuzzy controllers plus mobile actuator/sensor guidance laws is developed in the form of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs), such that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable and the mobile actuator/sensor guidance can enhance the transient performance of the closed-loop system. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm based on linear matrix inequalities is proposed to solve the BMIs. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Then, the limit and continuity concepts of a Z-number-valued function are given, under a definition of a metric on the space of Z + -numbers. Moreover, the concepts of Z-differentiability, Z-integral, and Z-Laplace transform of a Z-number-valued function are introduced. In addition, by giving some theories proved in this paper, a basis for calculus-Z-calculus-is established. We further give theories based on which existence and uniqueness of Zdifferential equations are investigated. A conceptual unity between Z-differential equations and Z + -numbers is also shown. The conceptual unity demonstrates that a Z-differential equation may be expressed as a bimodal differential equation combining a fuzzy differential equation (FDE) and a random differential equation. Moreover, the concept of a bimodal cut called (s, μ)-cut is introduced and its relation to other new concepts such as acceptable time and acceptable information area is explained. Using an example, the application of Z-differential equations in medicine is clarified. It is demonstrated that Z-differential equations outperform FDEs in making a decision under uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new reinforcement neural fuzzy surrogate (RNFS)-assisted multiobjective evolutionary optimization (RNFS-MEO) algorithm to boost the learning efficiency of data-driven fuzzy controllers (FCs). The RNFS-MEO is applied to evolve a population of FCs in a multiobjective robot wall-following control problem in order to reduce the number of time-consuming control trials and the implementation time of learning. In the RNFS-MEO, the RNFS is incorporated into a typical multiobjective continuous ant colony optimization algorithm to improve its learning efficiency. The RNFS estimates the accumulated multiobjective function values of the FCs in a colony without applying them to control a process, which helps reduce the number of control trials. The RNFS is trained online through structure and parameter learning based on the reinforcement signals from controlling a process. Considering the influence of the current control signals on the future states of a controlled process, the temporal difference technique is used in the RNFS training so that it estimates not only the current but also the future objective function values. The colony of FCs in the RNFS-MEO is repeatedly evolved based on the RNFS estimated values or the objective function values from real evaluations until a colony of successful FCs is found. The RNFS-MEO-based FC learning approach is applied to a robot wall-following control problem. Simulations and experiments on the robot control application are performed to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the RNFS-MEO.},

It is shown that either the most popular score function and its latterly improved versions or other related methods may lead to the undesirable results. Apart from these seemly heuristic methods, we propose a generalized p-norm knowledge-based score function for the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set, which is a generalization of the score function for intuitionistic fuzzy sets as well. The proposed score function is defined as the average amount of knowledge of information depicted in terms of the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, that regards their quantitative level of information referred to a reference level, fuzziness and qualitative significance of information. It is proved that the proposed score function has good algebraic properties, such as monotonicity under multiplication or aggregation operator, which are not preserved in the case of existing score functions. We show that the proposed score function is a simple, easily interpreted approach, which provides intuitive results in ranking the IvIFSs as well as IFSs, particularly. Several illustrative examples are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in measuring and discriminating the IvIFSs. A comparative analysis with the preceding methods in solving decision-making problems is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-life applications.},

Then, a new stability criterion is presented such that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.

  abstract     = {Managing comparative linguistic expressions (CLEs) information is a key issue in group decision-making (GDM). A transformation approach has been previously defined to convert CLEs into hesitant fuzzy linguistic terms sets (HFLTSs). However, it is noted that the occurring possibilities of the linguistic terms in the HFLTSs are assumed equal. This assumption might sometimes not capture the real opinions of the decision makers. Linguistic distribution assessments (LDAs) are an effective way to deal with this issue. This paper develops a linguistic distribution-based optimization approach for converting CLEs into LDAs, in which we assume that decision makers provide their opinions using preference relations with CLEs. Particularly, the proposed optimization approach is based on the use of a consistency-driven methodology, which seeks to minimize the inconsistency level of LDA preference relations obtained by transforming the original CLE preference relations elicited from decision makers. The linguistic distribution-based optimization approach is further developed to transform CLEs into interval LDAs to increase their flexibility. Moreover, society and technology trends make it possible to involve and manage large groups of decision makers in GDM environment. Therefore, a large-scale GDM framework with CLE information is designed based on the linguistic distribution-based optimization approach. To justify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology, it is applied to solve a real large-scale GDM problem, pertaining the selection of the best sustainable disinfection technique for wastewater reuse projects. A comparison against a baseline method is likewise provided to highlight the advantages and innovations of our proposal.},

  abstract     = {Many practical scenarios have demanded that we should classify unlabeled data more accurately based on both physical features (e.g., color, distance, or similarity) and implicit style features of data. As most extant classification algorithms classify unlabeled data based only on their physical features, they become weak in achieving expected classification results for many scenarios. To work around this drawback in this paper, a novel classification method (FuCM) from the perspective of fuzzy social network based on both physical and implicit style features of data is proposed. Based on the proposed fuzzy social network and its dynamics about fuzzy influences of nodes, FuCM comprises two stages. In its training stage, after the fuzzy social network has been built, it learns the topological structure, reflecting physical features and implicit style features of data by carrying out fuzzy influence dynamics in the built network. In its prediction stage, both physical and implicit style features of data are effectively integrated to yield the double structure efficiency characterized by fuzzy influences of nodes. FuCM classifies unlabeled data according to the strongest connection measure based on the proposed double structure efficiency. FuCM does not assume that both data distribution and the classification by physical features or by both physical and implicit style features of data must be known in advance. Thus, it is a novel unified classification framework in this sense. In contrast to all the nine comparative methods, FuCM experimentally demonstrates its comparable classification performance on most synthetic, UCI and KEEL datasets, which can be well classified based only on physical features of data. Furthermore, it displays distinctive superiority on five case studies where satisfactory classification certainly depends on both physical and implicit style features.},

In this framework, a fuzzy adaptive controller is designed within a given compact set to compensate the unknown mismatching interconnections. Specially, to achieve the global tracking performance, a robust controller is activated outside the compact set to pull back the system states.

Moreover, within the new hybrid preference structure, four extension forms of unknown preference are defined for different fuzzy stability definitions. These stability definitions under the new hybrid preference can be employed to thoroughly investigate complex conflicts existing in practical applications, and can offer enhanced strategic insights regarding the conflicts.

This procedure can be regarded as an encoding process and the obtained vectors of memberships are the new representations of original data. Naturally, the affinities between new representations or the vectors of memberships should be consistent with the ones between original data points. For example, the data points close to each other should also take similar membership vectors. Such constraints on the affinities of memberships are valuable prior knowledge that should be imposed to the objective function of fuzzy clustering for better performance. To this end, we introduce the membership affinity lasso for fuzzy clustering in this paper. Utilizing alternating direction method of multipliers, an efficient approach is derived to optimize the general membership affinity lasso regularized fuzzy clustering model in offline manner. As illustrative examples, three new fuzzy clustering algorithms with the membership affinity lasso are proposed.

The calculation of Choquet integral on real line is difficult for many cases such as nonmonotone functions. In this paper, by the geometric interpretation of Choquet integral, we introduce a new Choquet-like integral with a different algebraic interpretation of Choquet integral on real line. The calculation of this integral is simpler than Choquet integral on real line. Based on this integral, we introduce a general class of normal distribution on monotone measures. Finally, as an application, the real dataset obtained from the daily price of Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in period of June 2, 2008 to June 2, 2018 is analyzed.},

  abstract     = {A structural evolving approach (SEA) based on incremental partitioning learning is proposed in this paper. SEA starts with a simple fuzzy system with one fuzzy rule containing no fuzzy term for the antecedent part. After that, it keeps evolving by adding new fuzzy terms to the selected attribute in the selected partition. A new partitioning technique that locates sufficient splitting points is proposed. Furthermore, a dynamic partition-selection technique that leads to the best tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability is presented. In addition, a rule reduction mechanism that is able to locate rules with low and high impact on the system is developed. Finally, a local linear optimization is used to find the consequent parameters, which means that SEA uses only linear systems to find the antecedents and consequents parameters. Therefore, a simple and high interpretability system is offered. Six data sets are used to validate the performance of SEA with similar works. Despite the low complexity of SEA, the results show that SEA outperforms the existing methods with fewer fuzzy rules and fewer antecedent conditions too.},

  abstract     = {Historical financial data are frequently used in technical analysis to identify patterns that can be exploited to achieve trading profits. Although technical analysis using a variety of technical indicators has proven to be useful for the prediction of price trends, it is difficult to use them to formulate trading rules that could be used in an automatic trading system due to the vague nature of the rules. Moreover, it is challenging to determine a specified combination of technical indicators that can be used to detect good trading points and trading rules since different stock may be affected by different set of factors. In this paper, we propose a novel trading point forecasting framework that incorporates a bicluster mining technique to discover significant trading patterns, a method to establish the fuzzy rule base, and a fuzzy inference system optimized for trading point prediction. The proposed method (called BM-FM) was tested on several historical stock datasets and the average performance was compared with the conventional buy-and-hold strategy and five previously reported intelligent trading systems. Experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed trading system.},

In order to reduce the amount of triggering events, an exponential gain method is proposed. The main novelty of this new method lies in the introduction of an exponential term, which makes control gains alterable in the interval of two consecutive event times. Then, by designing controllers with exponential gains, some sufficient conditions are derived which guarantee the fixed-time stabilization of the concerned system. Since sign functions are no longer contained in the newly designed controller, the chattering phenomena are also avoided. Additionally, the existence of a positive lower bound for the inter-execution is verified, which implies that the concerned system does not exhibit Zeno behaviors. Finally, several illustrative examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the main results.},

For this purpose, at first, the motivation of this paper is explained; then, types of hesitant fuzzy linear programming models are introduced. Since it is not easy to examine all of the hesitant fuzzy models for the linear programming problems in one paper, we have restricted ourselves to symmetric and right-hand-side hesitant fuzzy linear programming problems with the flexible approach and then proposed two new approaches to solve them.

More specifically, the proposed choice models are based on fuzzy subjective utilities that are easier to elicit.

A key issue is how to design a state observer under the constraint that only the bounds of membership functions are known. To this end, this paper introduces two weighting factors to construct a new membership function. Besides, the concept of input-to-state stability (ISS) is utilized to deal with the residual term resulting from the cyberattacks and external disturbances. The sufficient condition is established such that the sliding mode dynamics and the estimated error dynamics are input-to-state stable. Furthermore, by online estimating the unknown parameters in upper bounds of cyberattacks and external disturbances, an adaptive sliding mode controller is synthesized such that the reachability of the prescribed sliding surface can be guaranteed and the effect of cyberattacks on the system performance can be effectively attenuated. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is illustrated by a mass-spring-damper system.},

  abstract     = {Interpretability has always been a major concern for fuzzy rule-based classifiers. The usage of human-readable models allows them to explain the reasoning behind their predictions and decisions. However, when it comes to Big Data classification problems, fuzzy rule based classifiers have not been able to maintain the good tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability that has characterized these techniques in non-Big-Data environments. The most accurate methods build models composed of a large number of rules and fuzzy sets that are too complex, while those approaches focusing on interpretability do not provide state-of-the-art discrimination capabilities. In this paper, we propose a new distributed learning algorithm named CFM-BD to construct accurate and compact fuzzy rule-based classification systems for Big Data. This method has been specifically designed from scratch for Big Data problems and does not adapt or extend any existing algorithm. The proposed learning process consists of three stages: Preprocessing based on the probability integral transform theorem; rule induction inspired by CHI-BD and Apriori algorithms; and rule selection by means of a global evolutionary optimization. We conducted a complete empirical study to test the performance of our approach in terms of accuracy, complexity, and runtime. The results obtained were compared and contrasted with four state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers for Big Data (FBDT, FMDT, Chi-Spark-RS, and CHI-BD). According to this study, CFM-BD is able to provide competitive discrimination capabilities using significantly simpler models composed of a few rules of less than three antecedents, employing five linguistic labels for all variables.},

The output feedback MPC approach includes an offline design of the state observer to estimate true states and predict bounds of future estimation error sets, and an online problem that optimizes the controller gains to stabilize the closed-loop observer system. The dynamics of the estimation error system is determined by the offline designed observer gain, and bounds of which are online refreshed by scaling a minimal robust positively invariant (RPI) set via a scalar. The optimized controller gains steer the current estimated state from an RPI set into another one such that future estimated states are invariant in the subsequent RPI set. Convergence of the estimation error system and stability condition on the closed-loop observer system in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived using the technique of S-procedure. The estimation error and estimated state converge within the corresponding time-varying RPI sets, and therefore, recursive feasibility of the optimization problem and input-to-state stability of the closed-loop observer system with respect to the estimation error and bounded disturbance are ensured. For reducing the online computational burden, a lookup table that stores the offline calculated controller gains with corresponding regions of attraction is offline constructed for online searching real-time controller gains. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel adaptive fuzzy backstepping dynamic surface control (DSC) scheme for a class of single-input single-output strict-feedback fractional-order uncertain nonlinear systems. The controlled systems contain unknown nonlinear functions and unknown external disturbances. Fuzzy logic systems are employed for approximating the unknown nonlinear functions. Further, an auxiliary function is introduced into the control function to simultaneously compensate the unknown external disturbance and the approximation error caused by fuzzy approximation, which erases the possible chattering phenomenon in the existing results. Meanwhile, a new DSC method based on the fractional-order filter is proposed to avoid the issue of explosion of complexity inherent in the backstepping procedure, which releases the limitation that the fractional-order derivative of the intermediate control function needs to be completly known in the existing references. Under certain assumptions, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved by using the fractional-order Lyapunov function stability criterion. Finally, contrastive simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed control strategy.},

The case when the filters cannot directly utilize the mode information of the plant is taken into account. A hidden Markov model is introduced to address such a problem. Furthermore, a mature scheduling method, namely round-robin protocol, is employed to optimize the data transmission in genetic regulatory networks. On the basis of the fuzzy model approach and the stochastic analysis technique, some novel conditions ensuring the H ∞ performance and stochastic stability of the error system are established. The parameters of the filter can be presented via addressing the convex optimization problem.

  abstract     = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a key neuroimaging technique. The classic fMRI analysis pipeline is based on the assumption that the hemodynamic response (HR) is the same across brain regions, time, and subjects. Although convenient, there is ample evidence that this assumption does not hold, and that these differences result in inaccuracies in brain activity detection. This article presents a new fMRI processing pipeline that captures the intrinsic intra- and intersubject variability of the HR. At the core of this new pipeline is the definition of a fuzzy hemodynamic response function (HRF). The proposed pipeline includes a new fuzzy general linear model (GLM) able to handle the fuzzy HRF, including a practical realization based on the LR representation of fuzzy numbers. This article also describes how to obtain activation maps from the fuzzy GLM, and a methodology to compute the statistical power of the analysis. The method is evaluated in synthetic and real fMRI data and compared with other state-of-the-art techniques. The experiments based on synthetic data show that the fuzzy GLM approach is more robust under uncertainty regarding the true specific shape of the HR. The experiments based on the real data show an increased volume of the activated brain areas, suggesting that the proposed method is able to prevent false negative errors in the boundaries of target brain regions in which HR should be negligible.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural network and capsule network have attained good results in iris recognition. However, due to the influence of eyelashes, skin, and background noises, the model often needs many iterations to retrieve informative iris patterns. Also because of some nonideal situations, such as reflection of glasses and facula on the eyeball, it is hard to detect the boundary of pupil and iris perfectly. Under such a circumstance, discarding the rest parts beyond the boundary may cause losing useful information. Hence, we use Gaussian, triangular fuzzy average, and triangular fuzzy median smoothing filters to preprocess the image by fuzzifying the region beyond the boundary to improve the signal-to-noise ratios. We applied the enhanced images through fuzzy operations to train deep learning methods, which speeds up the process of convergence and also increases the recognition accuracy rate. The saliency maps show that fuzzified image filters make the images more informative for deep learning. The proposed fuzzy operation of images may be a robust technique in many other deep-learning applications of image processing, analysis, and prediction.},

Ensemble learning has been used for many kinds of BCI classification applications including MI and P300 event related potential, which has been proven to be robust. The purpose of this paper is to generate an algorithm that uses ensemble pruning method for EEG classification evoked by an MI task. In order to achieve this, we extracted the features of an EEG dataset and trained a range of support vector machines to make a diverse ensemble of classifiers. This ensemble is then pruned by using a novel optimization model by a difference of convex algorithm, which has not been used on EEG data before.},

To perform CPT in a turbulent environment, the adaptive selection of the behavior plays an important role. Therefore, we performed simultaneous measurement experiments involving CPT behavior of the brain and analyzed the links between the brain&#39;s neural activity and behavioral patterns. We measured the brain&#39;s neural response in the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), which generates motion commands. We employed fuzzy inference to analyze the relationship between CPT behavior and LAL neural activity. As a result of analyzing the relationship between CPT behavior and LAL, we found that the moth modulates the behavior of the state transition probability depending on the odor frequency. We modeled the obtained phenomenon and verified its effectiveness through a constructive method. As a result, the search performance was improved compared to the conventional moth algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Accurate identification of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) with electroencephalograph (EEG) is crucial in the clinical diagnosis of neurological disorders. However, the effectiveness and accuracy of manually labeling EEG signals are barely satisfactory, due to lacking effective biomarkers. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning method network-based Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (N-TSK) for AD identification which employs the complex network theory and TSK fuzzy system. With the construction of functional network of AD subjects, the topological features of weighted and unweighted networks are extracted. Taken the network parameters as independent inputs, a fuzzy-system-based TSK model is established and further trained to identify AD EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in AD identification and ability of N-TSK fuzzy classifiers. The highest accuracy can achieve 97.3\% for patients with closed eyes and 94.78\% with open eyes. In addition, the performance of weighted N-TSK largely exceeds unweighted N-TSK. By further optimizing the network features utilized in the N-TSK fuzzy classifiers, it is found that local efficiency and clustering coefficient are the most effective factors in AD identification. This work provides a potential tool for identifying neurological disorders from the perspective of functional networks with EEG signal, especially contributing to the diagnosis and identification of AD.},

Time delay, which is inevitable in biological neural systems, has significant effect on the dynamics of neuronal networks. This paper provides an analysis of how time delay affects stochastic resonance and firing rate oscillation of cortical neuronal networks. A cortical network is established and mean-field theory is applied to analytically compute the dynamical response of networks. When the frequency of external stimulation is close to intrinsic frequency of neuronal networks, firing rate exhibits coherent oscillation and the phenomenon of stochastic resonance occurs in inhibitory neurons. Time delay can induce multiple stochastic resonances, which appear intermittently at integer multiples of the period of input signal, due to the transition of network dynamics induced by time delays. The fluctuation of membrane potential and instantaneous firing rate of cortical networks achieve maximal periodically with the variation of time delay. Furthermore, time delay and electrical coupling play complementary roles in determining network responses. Network oscillation can transit from unstable to stable when coupling strength exceeds a critical value. Transition threshold is lower for time delays close to integer multiples of input period where resonant response of cortical network enhances the formation of stable oscillation.},

Our approach is unsupervised and makes use of a fuzzy clustering algorithm based on the possibilistic framework and includes a data-driven noise and artifact rejection phase. Our contribution provides a general analysis tool, applicable to any ERP dataset, which can uncover the dataset&#39;s internal structure. The fuzzy clustering algorithm is the core of our method, since its fine-grained membership grades how much a sample belongs to a given cluster, making the method applicable even when groups have a certain overlap. Prior to the clustering step, we apply weights to the feature vectors, optimizing them in order to enhance the variance within the dataset, and we extract time-window-interval-based features inspired by interval arithmetic. We apply the data processing workflow to the analysis of a set of ERPs recorded during an emotional Go/NoGo task. We evaluate the performance of the unsupervised analysis by computing a measure based on the clusterization rate of trials in different experimental conditions. The results of the studied dataset show that the proposed method obtains a difference of clusterization rate of 69\% in Go versus NoGo trials, when weights and interval features are applied to the data, improving previous work not including weights and interval features, which had a rate of 31\%. Furthermore, when compared with the standard fuzzy c-means, our proposed possibilistic clustering algorithm outperforms it in terms of the clusterization rate. We also examine the effect of preprocessing the data with independent component analysis and removing noise-related components and observe that this does not improve significantly the obtained results. These findings demonstrate that our proposed method provides a valuable data processing workflow robust to EEG artifacts and able to produce a clustering that is coherent with the experimental conditions represented in the ERP dataset.},

In this study, we present a novel application of multiscale relative inherent fuzzy entropy using repetitive steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to investigate EEG complexity change between two migraine phases, i.e., interictal (baseline) and preictal (before migraine attacks) phases. We used a wearable headband EEG device with O1, Oz, O2, and Fpz electrodes to collect EEG signals from 80 participants [40 migraine patients and 40 healthy controls (HCs)] under the following two conditions: During resting state and SSVEPs with five 15-Hz photic stimuli. We found a significant enhancement in occipital EEG entropy with increasing stimulus times in both HCs and patients in the interictal phase, but a reverse trend in patients in the preictal phase. In the 1st SSVEP, occipital EEG entropy of the HCs was significantly lower than that of patents in the preictal phase (FDRadjustedp &lt;; 0.05). Regarding the transitional variance of EEG entropy between the 1st and 5th SSVEPs, patients in the preictal phase exhibited significantly lower values than patients in the interictal phase (FDR-adjustedp &lt;; 0.05). Furthermore, in the classification model, the AdaBoost ensemble learning showed an accuracy of 81 ± 6\% and area under the curve of 0.87 for classifying interictal and preictal phases. In contrast, there were no differences in EEG entropy among groups or sessions by using other competing entropy models, including approximate entropy, sample entropy, and fuzzy entropy on the same dataset. In conclusion, inherent fuzzy entropy offers novel applications in visual stimulus environments and may have the potential to provide a preictal alert to migraine patients.},

Time delay in the neural coupling process can induce multiple stochastic resonances, which appear intermittently at the integer multiples of the oscillation period of the input signal. It is found that the time delay can induce the periodic oscillation of neural firing rate, which may account for the occurrence of multiple stochastic resonances. In addition, the effect of synapses on firing rate oscillation and network resonance is investigated. As the strength of gap-junction and inhibitory-inhibitory chemical coupling is increased, the maximal resonant value increases, while the resonant frequency is unchanged. However, the resonant frequency and peak value increase with the coupling strength of excitatory-inhibitory chemical synapses. This difference may result from the interaction of excitation and inhibition within the cortical network. We further apply mean-field theory to time-delayed network model to validate the obtained numerical results. Both time delay and electrical-chemical synapses play an important role in firing rate oscillation and stochastic resonance within the cortical network, determining the ability to enhance the transmission of information in neural systems.},
