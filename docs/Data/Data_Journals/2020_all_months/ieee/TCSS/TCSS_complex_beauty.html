From hijacking private disks, the cybercriminals moved to disabling hospital networks, while the cyberwarriors launched destructive cyberwar exercises masquerading as ransomware. To match the variety of attacks, there is also a variety of promising proposals for the mitigation of the ransomware problem by disrupting the attack cycle at various points. None of them seems to be eliminating the vulnerability of static nodes in dynamic networks. We put forward the idea that ransomware is a symptom of a broader problem of architectural imbalance in social computation, while the processes are dynamic and nonlocal, the storage is static and local. We study and discuss some paths toward dynamic, nonlocal, and secure storage. Furthermore, we provide a toy method for locally encrypting the data that can provide a balance of high security and encryption speed.},

Because of the particularity of signed networks, the existing methods to measure their degree assortativity only rely on dividing the original network by link signs ignoring the signs of node degrees, which cannot measure the complicated degree mixing patterns. In this study, considering the complex types of link signs and node degree signs, we propose four new mixing patterns that have not been measured before for signed social networks and define a set of six signed assortativity measures based on traditional assortativity coefficients, to form a complete family of assortativity coefficients. The statistical significance of the family of assortativity coefficients is confirmed by comparing with null models, showing the assortativity significance profile (ASP) of different empirical signed networks. Besides, the relationship and distinction between the family of assortativity coefficients and classical network indexes, such as excess average degree and network embeddedness, are analyzed, revealing the endogenous complexity of signed social networks and the diversity of their assortativities. The proposed method enriches the assortativity diversity of social networks, which is beneficial to measure and analyze complex structure, function, and evolution of real-world social networks.},

  abstract     = {Complex systems have been successfully modeled as networks exhibiting the varying extent of randomness and nonrandomness. Network scientists contemplate randomness as one of the most desirable characteristics for real complex systems’ efficient performance. However, the current methodologies for randomness (or nonrandomness) quantification are nontrivial. In this article, we empirically showcase severe limitations associated with the state-of-the-art graph spectral-based quantification approaches. Addressing these limitations led to the proposal of a novel spectrum-based methodology that leverages configuration models as a reference network to quantify the nonrandomness in a given candidate network. Besides, we derive mathematical formulations for demonstrating the dependence of nonrandomness on three structural properties: modularity, clustering, and the highest degree node’s growth rate. We also introduce a novel graph signature (termed “cumulative spectral difference”) to visualize the nonrandomness in the network. Later, this article also discusses the relationship between the proposed nonrandomness measure and the diffusion affinity of networks. Toward the end, this article extensively discusses observations emerging from these signatures for both real-world and simulated networks.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the batch processing of truss maintenance in large graphs. Trussness is a widely used index in graph analytics for cohesive subgraph mining. It is defined on edges to reflect the closeness of vertices connected by the edges. The trussness maintenance problem, i.e., updating trussness after edge insertions/deletions and avoiding recomputation, was proposed by Cohen (2008) with the assumption that real graphs are continuously evolving in nature and their dynamicity usually only affects few edges. Different from the existing work that mainly focuses on simple single edge/vertex insertion/deletion, we propose batch processing algorithms for truss maintenance with multiedge insertions/deletions. By presenting an edge structure called triangle disjoint set, whose insertion/deletion can make each edge change its trussness by at most 1, we tackle the difficulty in quantifying the trussness changes of the edges in batch processing. More specifically, we propose two indices, namely sustain support and pivotal support, to help measure whether the edges have the potential to change their trussness, such that the search range of the potential edges is greatly reduced. The extensive experiments on real-world graphs illustrate that compared with the single-edge processing approach, our batch processing algorithms can significantly improve the processing efficiency, and the improvement becomes more obvious when more edges are inserted/deleted.},

We investigate how the strength of these relationships changes in the short term (less than two years), medium term (two to four years), and long term (five to ten years). Surprisingly, we show that AQ/ISIS triangles that are not in balance (according to the balance theory) are unlikely to move toward balance as suggested by the balance theory, but those that are in balance will likely stay balanced (as suggested by the balance theory). These findings provide better insight into the inner workings and complex dynamics that shape the AQ/ISIS competition worldwide. They are also relevant to future developments in global jihadism, as new factions may emerge that seek to gain affiliative market share in the jihadist world at the expense of more established organizations.},

A hybrid scheme coordinating both the permissioned (Hyperledger) and public (Ethereum) blockchains is proposed to exploit their respective capabilities in terms of high transaction throughput and built-in cryptocurrency. A working prototype platform is implemented with a basic premium calculation model. The prototype system is deployed across Amazon Web Services (AWSs) cloud in a real-world Internet environment. A comprehensive performance study from the aspects of throughput, latency, and resource usage under different configurations is presented to show the solution’s feasibility. The design practice and research findings are concluded in consort with the experience gained for further enhancing the proposed solution and extending the functional features such as a more realistic insurance policy to be applied in generic vehicle insurance applications.},

Now, the challenging task is to differentiate the game maker from any match where the performance of any individual player is not directly involved with the cumulative effect of the scoring mechanism. Different temporal graph centrality metrics, such as degree, closeness, betweenness, and clustering coefficient, have differentiated the game maker in the ball-passing network. We have analyzed some random games of FIFA men&#39;s world cup 2018, to distinguish the game makers from the matches as a case study. Another challenging problem is to locate the tactical position of the influential passes. We have investigated the games and identified those areas in different time frames. The accuracy of our method is tested over the real-life benchmark data set. The analytical results exhibit notable improvement over the existing methods. Our study opens up a new framework for the strategic analysis not only for soccer but also for similar ball-passing multiplayer team games, such as basketball and hockey.},

In order to achieve timely detection of fake news in social media, a novel framework of two-path deep semisupervised learning (SSL) is proposed where one path is for supervised learning and the other is for unsupervised learning. The supervised learning path learns on the limited amount of labeled data, while the unsupervised learning path is able to learn on a huge amount of unlabeled data. Furthermore, these two paths implemented with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are jointly optimized to complete SSL. In addition, we build a shared CNN to extract the low-level features on both labeled data and unlabeled data to feed them into these two paths. To verify this framework, we implement a Word CNN-based SSL model and test it on two data sets: LIAR and PHEME. Experimental results demonstrate that the model built on the proposed framework can recognize fake news effectively with very few labeled data.},

Such platforms can be named nonexplicit-relationship platforms. In this article, we propose three new criteria, explicit conversion rate (ER), frequency of promotion (FP), and average participation density (APD), and design a novel algorithm to effectively calculate and evaluate users&#39; influence on these platforms. The stability and sustainability of user influence are evaluated to distinguish the real influentials from the disguised ones, while the latter usually appears for temporary commercial advertisement purposes.

We perform a mathematical analysis of conditions for the mood to stabilize to euthymia and discuss its psychotherapeutic implications. Furthermore, a computational analysis applied to pharmacotherapy depicts a mechanism that results in a switch from depression to mania when the bipolar disorder was misdiagnosed as major depressive disorder, and an antidepressant is administered without a mood stabilizer. This work innovates by offering a concise representation of most features of mood disorders in existing mathematical models, providing a framework for studying dynamics in the bipolar spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Many empirical studies have discussed market liquidity, which is regarded as a measure of a booming financial market. Further, various indicators for objectively evaluating market liquidity have also been proposed and their merits have been discussed. In recent years, the impact of high-frequency traders (HFTs) on financial markets has been a focal concern, but no studies have systematically discussed their relationship with major market liquidity indicators, including volume, tightness, resiliency, and depth. In this study, we used agent-based simulations to compare the major liquidity indicators in an artificial market where an HFT participated was compared to one where no HFT participated. The results showed that all liquidity indicators in the market where an HFT participated improved more than those in the market where no HFT participated. Furthermore, as a result of investigating the correlations between the major liquidity indicators in our simulations and the extant empirical literature, we found that market liquidity can be measured not only by the major liquidity indicators but also by execution rate. Therefore, it is suggested that it could be appropriate to employ execution rate as a novel liquidity indicator in future studies.},

  abstract     = {AdaBoost is a boosting-based machine learning method under the assumption that the data in training and testing sets have the same distribution and input feature space. It increases the weights of those instances that are wrongly classified in a training process. However, the assumption does not hold in many real-world data sets. Therefore, AdaBoost is extended to transfer AdaBoost (TrAdaBoost) that can effectively transfer knowledge from one domain to another. TrAdaBoost decreases the weights of those instances that belong to the source domain but are wrongly classified in a training process. It is more suitable for the case that data are of different distribution. Can it be improved for some special transfer scenarios, e.g., the data distribution changes slightly over time? We find that the distribution of credit card transaction data can change with the changes in the transaction behaviors of users, but the changes are slow most of the time. These changes are yet important for detecting transaction fraud since they result in a so-called concept drift problem. In order to make TrAdaBoost more suitable for the abovementioned case, we, thus, propose an improved TrAdaBoost (ITrAdaBoost) in this article. It updates (i.e., increases or decreases) the weight of a wrongly classified instance in a source domain according to the distribution distance from the instance to a target domain, and the calculation of distance is based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We do a series of experiments over five data sets, and the results illustrate the advantage of ITrAdaBoost.},

  abstract     = {Bug triaging is the process of prioritizing bugs based on their severity, frequency, and risk in order to be assigned to appropriate developers for validation and resolution. This article introduces a graph-based feature augmentation approach for enhancing bug triaging systems using machine learning. A new feature augmentation approach that utilizes graph partitioning based on neighborhood overlap is proposed. Neighborhood overlap is a quite effective approach for discovering relationships in social graphs. Terms of bug summaries are represented as nodes in a graph, which is then partitioned into clusters of terms. Terms in strong clusters are augmented to the original feature vectors of bug summaries based on the similarity between the terms in each cluster and a bug summary. We employed other techniques such as term frequency, term correlation, and topic modeling to identify latent terms and augment them to the original feature vectors of bug summaries. Consequently, we utilized frequency, correlation, and neighborhood overlap techniques to create another feature augmentation approach that enriches the feature vectors of bug summaries to use them for bug triaging. The new modified vectors are used to classify bug reports into different priorities. Bug Triage in this context is to correctly recognize the priority of new bugs. Several classification algorithms are tested using the proposed methods. Experimental results on a data set with Eclipse bug reports extracted from the Bugzilla tracking system have shown that our approach outperformed the existing bug triaging systems including modern techniques that utilize deep learning.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, group recommendation has become a research hotspot and focus in online social network community. Currently, several deep-learning-based approaches are leveraged to learn preferences of groups for items and predict the next items in which groups may be interested. Yet, their recommendation performance is still unsatisfactory due to the sparse group-item interactions. In order to address this problem, in this article, we introduce an effective model, namely Social Group Recommendation model with TrAdaBoost (SGRTAB), to raise the performance of group recommendation in online social networks. The SGRTAB model includes two stages: data preprocessing (DP) and model optimization (MO). In DP, SGRTAB produces inputs for MO and implements three related tasks: extracting individual features, handling group data via GloVe, and utilizing user contribute ratings to their own groups, whereas in MO, SGRTAB implements group preference learning with the assistance of user preference learning based on the TrAdaBoost algorithm. Specifically, SGRTAB can effectively absorb the knowledge of user preferences into the process of group preference learning through the idea of transferring-ensemble learning. Moreover, extensive experiments on four real-world data sets indicate that the proposed SGRTAB model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines for social group recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Detection of online subversive activities, such as fake news, concerted campaigns, and bots, is getting increasingly urgent. However, without specific knowledge of underlying facts and disparate valid perspectives of a given issue, it is hard to detect subversive intent in a generic sense. To address this, we approach the problem from a “macro” perspective. Rather than asking whether a specific social media account is acting subversively, we look at the entire discourse around a trending topic, and ask whether the discourse looks “healthy” or is it showing signs of getting hijacked or dominated by one particular perspective. To do this, we break down a social discourse into its constituent narratives. Narratives are in turn modeled as latent stories or worldviews, whose visible characterizations are in the form of specific distributions over different opinions expressed in the discourse. Once the discourse is broken down into narratives, the “health” of the discourse can be addressed using various measures, such as the relative sizes of its constituent narratives, sentiment polarity of internarrative interactions, and presence or absence of dominant players within each narrative. We conduct experiments on several well-known trending topics on Twitter to identify its constituent narratives and provide a report card on the overall discourse quality. We also show how this top-down approach offers the means to delineate roles played by users as drivers of the discourse, the constituent narratives, or their component opinions, determined on the basis of dominance centrality measures and narrative affinities.},

However, due to a large number of fog nodes, there are still many security problems in the fog computing process. For example, when fog servers make resource allocation between users’ tasks and fog nodes, some fog nodes can falsely claim that they have more resources than their actual ability, so as to get more task processing qualifications. Thus, it will greatly damage the interests of users and affect the quality of service. In this article, we propose a resource allocation scheme for community-based fog computing based on a reputation mechanism. When fog network provides computing services for users, we use a reputation mechanism to enable users to obtain reliable resources in fog computing. In our proposed scheme, a user first submits his/her task request to the community-based fog network, and then, the fog server makes a reliable resource allocation process based on multiple-layer communities and reputation calculation. Based on our experiments, our scheme enables users to obtain reliable resources and improves the service quality of computing resources in fog computing.},

Such groups of nodes are densely connected or have a high probability of being connected internally than their connections to other clusters in the network. Existing local community detection methods focus on finding either one local community that all seeds are most likely to be in or finding a single community for each of the seeds. However, a seed member usually belongs to multiple local overlapping communities. In this work, we present a novel method of detecting multiple local communities to which a single-seed member belongs. The proposed method consists of three key steps: 1) local sampling with Personalized PageRank (PPR); 2) using the sparseness generated by a sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to estimate the number of communities in the sampled subgraph; and 3) using SNMF soft community membership vectors to assign nodes to communities. The proposed method shows favorable accuracy performance and a good conductance compared with state-of-the-art community detection methods by experiments using a combination of artificial and real-world networks.},

There has always been a need to know which features fall short or are doing well according to the customer’s perception. It keeps both the manufacturer and the customer well-informed in the decisions to make in improving the product and buying, respectively. Different customers are interested in different features. Thus, feature-level ratings can make buying decisions personalized. We analyze the customer reviews collected on an online shopping site (Amazon) about various mobile products and the review votes. Explicitly, we carry out a feature-focused sentiment analysis for this purpose. Eventually, our analysis yields ratings to 108 features for 4000+ mobiles sold online. It helps in decision-making on how to improve the product (from the manufacturer’s perspective) and in making the personalized buying decisions (from the buyer’s perspective) a possibility.

The effector detection problem aims to find a way to generate an activation state as close to an observed one as possible. In this article, based on the influence spread, the unconstrained and constrained effector detection problems are proposed. To tackle them, we design two approximation algorithms since the problem is NP-hard, and the objective function is nonsubmodular. For the unconstrained case, our objective function can be best provided with the difference of two submodular functions. Thus, we address this problem through the modular-modular algorithm. For the constrained case, we devise the solutions for the original function, submodular upper bound, and lower bound according to an idea of reverse influence sampling. Then, there is a data-dependent approximate solution using the sandwich approximation algorithm. Finally, we show the correctness and superiority of our methods through massive experiments in three real-world networks.},

  abstract     = {Existing shilling attack detection approaches focus mainly on identifying individual attackers in online recommender systems and rarely address the detection of group shilling attacks in which a group of attackers colludes to bias the output of an online recommender system by injecting fake profiles. In this article, we propose a group shilling attack detection method based on the bisecting K-means clustering algorithm. First, we extract the rating track of each item and divide the rating tracks to generate candidate groups according to a fixed time interval. Second, we propose item attention degree and user activity to calculate the suspicious degrees of candidate groups. Finally, we employ the bisecting K-means algorithm to cluster the candidate groups according to their suspicious degrees and obtain the attack groups. The results of experiments on the Netflix and Amazon data sets indicate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods.},

This article presents a novel tweet act classifier (speech act for Twitter) for assessing the content and intent of tweets, thereby exploring the valuable communication among the tweeters. With the recent success of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a newly introduced language representation model that provides pretrained deep bidirectional representations of vast unlabeled data, we introduce BERT-Caps that is built on top of BERT. The proposed model tends to learn traits and attributes by leveraging from the joint optimization of features from the BERT and capsule layer to develop a robust classifier for the task. Some Twitter-specific symbols are also included in the model to observe its influence and importance. The proposed model attained a benchmark accuracy of 77.52% and outperformed several strong baselines and state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Online social networks (OSNs) have become an integral mode of communication among people and even nonhuman scenarios can also be integrated into OSNs. The evergrowing rise in the popularity of OSNs can be attributed to the rapid growth of Internet technology. OSN becomes the easiest way to broadcast media (news/content) over the Internet. In the wake of emerging technologies, there is dire need to develop methodologies, which can minimize the spread of fake messages or rumors that can harm society in any manner. In this article, a model is proposed to investigate the propagation of such messages currently coined as fake news. The proposed model describes how misinformation gets disseminated among groups with the influence of different misinformation refuting measures. With the onset of the novel coronavirus-19 pandemic, dubbed COVID-19, the propagation of fake news related to the pandemic is higher than ever. In this article, we aim to develop a model that will be able to detect and eliminate fake news from OSNs and help ease some OSN users stress regarding the pandemic. A system of differential equations is used to formulate the model. Its stability and equilibrium are also thoroughly analyzed. The basic reproduction number (R0) is obtained which is a significant parameter for the analysis of message spreading in the OSNs. If the value of R0 is less than one (R0 &lt;; 1), then fake message spreading in the online network will not be prominent, otherwise if R0 &gt; 1 the rumor will persist in the OSN. Realworld trends of misinformation spreading in OSNs are discussed. In addition, the model discusses the controlling mechanism for untrusted message propagation. The proposed model has also been validated through extensive simulation and experimentation.},

  abstract     = {Evidence-driven agent-based modeling plays a useful part in understanding social phenomena. By integrating social-cognitive theories in our agent models, we bear evidence from social and psychological studies on our models for human decision-making. Social practice theory (SPT) provides a socio-cognitive theory that emphasizes three empirically and theoretically grounded aspects of behavior: habituality, sociality, and interconnectivity. Previous work has emphasized the importance of SPT for agents, has made abstract models of SPT, or used SPT to study energy systems. This article provides a set of requirements for integrating SPT in agent models and an evaluation of 11 current agent models with respect to these requirements. We find that current agent models do not fully capture habituality, sociality, or interconnectivity, nor is there a model that aims to integrate all three aspects. For example, current models do not support context-dependent habits, use a comprehensive set of collective concepts, and support hierarchies of activities. Our evaluation allows researchers to pick one of the current agent models depending on their needs regarding habituality, sociality, and interconnectivity. Furthermore, this article shows the usefulness of an agent model that integrates SPT and provides requirements that help modelers to achieve this model.},

The first phase is feature selection, where the most relevant features (variables) are selected based on an artificial bee colony using a neighborhood rough set as the fitness function. The second phase employs the training support vector regression (SVR) using a part of the solar activity data set based on the selected features. Sequential minimal optimization is carried out to determine the optimal parameters of SVR. The third phase tests the regression model based on the second part of the data set. The fourth phase is the process of predicting solar activity. According to the prediction system, the maximum amplitude of cycle 25 is 80 ± 12, and it will occur in 2026. The solution quality is assessed by using three indices called average absolute percent relative error (AAPRE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination. These indices prove the high quality of the forecast sunspot number value and the actual ones. In addition, it can be concluded that the proposed system is significantly improved the predicting solar activity performance at acceptable assessment indices.},

  abstract     = {Package promotion (or product bundling and bundle promotion) is widely adopted as an effective marketing strategy to increase sales, but the social tightness of the users significantly influences their willingness to purchase certain products. However, addressing these two factors simultaneously is not a trivial task because it is critical to properly choose a set of socially tight target users to encourage them to buy the products together (social tightness factor), and the selected users should have high preference for the package of products (preference factor). To address the aforementioned challenges, in this article, we study the research problem of promoting a package of products to a set of closely related friends. We formulate a new research problem, named package-oriented group identification (PGI), which can obtain a set of t socially tight users (i.e., inducing more than k edges) who have the maximum preference for a package of items. We prove that the proposed PGI problem is NP-hard, and we develop a polynomial-time algorithm named incremental solution construction with redundancy and infeasibility avoidance for PGI (ISCP) that can effectively and efficiently obtain a good solution to the PGI problem. We compare the performance of ISCP with four other baselines on a large-scale product copurchasing data set with more than 500 k products and 1.7 M copurchasing relationships. The results show that our proposed ISCP algorithm outperforms the other baselines in terms of solution quality and efficiency.},

As one of the important functions of the ITS, supply-demand difference prediction for autonomous vehicles provides a decision basis for its control. In this article, a new learning process is proposed with Multiple feature Extraction and Fusion utilizing the combination of deep and shallow Features (MEFF) (the spatial deep features, (short and long) temporal deep features, and fuzzy shallow (semantic) features). The spatial deep features are captured with residual network and dimension reduction in spatial deep block. The fuzzy shallow (semantic) features are captured with multiattention fuzzy mechanism in the fuzzy shallow block. With the fused spatial deep features and fuzzy shallow features, the temporal deep features are captured with long short-term memory (LSTM) and attention mechanism in the temporal and prediction block to get the final prediction results. Based on two different distributions of membership attention (mean distribution and Gaussian distribution) in the fuzzy shallow block, our process MEFF has two methods, i.e., MEFF-mean method and MEFF-Gaussian method. Extensive experiments show that our methods provide more accurate and stable prediction results than the existing state-of-art-methods.},

To explore this security problem, we define the link prediction adversarial attack problem and put forward a novel iterative gradient attack (IGA) strategy using the gradient information in the trained graph autoencoder (GAE) model. Not surprisingly, GAE can be fooled by an adversarial graph with a few links perturbed on the clean one. The results on comprehensive experiments of different real-world graphs indicate that most deep models and even the state-of-the-art link prediction algorithms cannot escape the adversarial attack, such as GAE. We can benefit the attack as an efficient privacy protection tool from the link prediction of unknown violations. On the other hand, the adversarial attack is a robust evaluation metric for current link prediction algorithms of their defensibility.},

  abstract     = {Traditional clustering algorithms model the clustering problem as an optimization task, in which the objective is defined based on minimizing specific metrics. These algorithms are limited to find clusters with convex polytopes. In contrast, density-based clustering algorithms aim at overcoming this limitation and try to partition data objects into meaningful groups that have relatively high density separated by low-density regions. This work describes and evaluates a new density-based clustering algorithm, called neighborhood distance entropy consistency (NDEC), which is able to not only detect clusters of arbitrary size, shape, and density, but also identify outliers. To this end, both local and global densities are considered simultaneously to accurately discover the intrinsic clustering structure. In addition, the consistency of neighborhood distance entropy is used as an important criterion to merge potential subclusters. Experiments on synthetic and real benchmark clustering data sets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the NDEC method. Comparisons with k-means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, and density peaks clustering algorithms further show that NDEC can successfully discover natural clusters. Additionally, the utility of NDEC is demonstrated with its application on two real-world problems including brain white matter tracts segmentation using diffusion tensor imaging and characterizing motor unit potential trains extracted from electromyographic signals.},

  abstract     = {In online social networks (OSNs), interpersonal communication and information sharing are happening all the time, and it is real time. If a user initiates an activity (game) in OSNs, she will cause a certain impact on her friendship circle naturally, namely, some users in this initiator&#39;s friendship circle will be attracted to participate in this activity. Based on such a fact, we design a k-hop collaborated game model, which means that an activity initiated by a user can only influence those users whose distance is within k-hop from this initiator. We introduce the problem of revenue maximization under k-hop collaborate game (RMKCG), which identifies a limited number of initiators in order to obtain revenue as much as possible. The collaborated game model describes in detail how to quantify revenue and the logic behind it. We do not know how many followers would be attracted by activity in advance, and thus, we need to adopt an adaptive strategy, where the decision who is the next potential initiator depends on the results of past decisions. The adaptive RMKCG problem can be considered as a new stochastic optimization problem, and we prove it is NP-hard, adaptive monotone, but not adaptive submodular. But in some special cases, it is adaptive submodular, and thus, we design an adaptive greedy algorithm. Due to the complexity of our model, it is hard to compute the marginal gain for each candidate user, and then we propose an efficient computational method to estimate it. The effectiveness and correctness of our algorithms are validated by heavy simulation on real-world graphs finally.},

  abstract     = {In computer vision, when labeled images of the target domain are highly insufficient, it is challenging to build an accurate classifier. Domain adaptation stands for an effective solution to address it by utilizing available and related source domain which has sufficient labeled images, even when there is a substantial difference in properties and distributions of these two domains. Yet, most prior approaches merely reduce subspace conditional or marginal distribution differences between domains but entirely ignoring label dependence (LD) information of source data in subspace. This article proposes a novel approach of domain adaptation, called enhanced subspace distribution matching (ESDM), which makes good use of label information to enhance the distribution matching between the source and target domains in a shared subspace. It reduces both conditional and marginal distributions in a shared subspace during a procedure of kernel principal dimensionality reduction and also preserves source data LD information to the maximum extent, thereby significantly improving cross domain subspace distribution matching. We also provide a learning algorithm with highly affordable computation, which solves the ESDM optimization problem without using time-consuming iterations. Results confirm that it can well outperform several recent domain adaptation methods on image classification tasks in terms of classification accuracy and running time. The results can be used in social cognition, person reidentification, and human–machine interactions.},

However, how to inspire crowd workers to participate in crowd tasks and provide truthful sensed data still has many challenges. In this article, based on the Markov model and collaborative filtering model, the similarities, trajectory prediction, dwell time, and trust degree are considered to propose the Markov and Collaborative filtering-based Task Recommendation (MCTR) model.

Finally, the comparison experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed multiobjective optimization and the Markov-based task allocation with other methods.

  abstract     = {Being a leading online service providing both local search and social networking functions, Foursquare has attracted tens of millions of users all over the world. Understanding the user behavior of Foursquare is helpful to gain insights for location-based social networks (LBSNs). Most of the existing studies focus on a biased subset of users, which cannot give a representative view of the global user base. Meanwhile, although the user-generated content (UGC) is very important to reflect user behavior, most of the existing UGC studies of Foursquare are based on the check-ins. There is a lack of a thorough study on tips, the primary type of UGC on Foursquare. In this article, by crawling and analyzing the global social graph and all published tips, we conduct the first comprehensive user behavior study of all 60+ million Foursquare users around the world. We have made the following three main contributions. First, we have found several unique and undiscovered features of the Foursquare social graph on a global scale, including a moderate level of reciprocity, a small average clustering coefficient, a giant strongly connected component, and a significant community structure. Besides the singletons, most of the Foursquare users are weakly connected with each other. Second, we undertake a thorough investigation according to all published tips on Foursquare. We start from counting the numbers of tips published by different users and then look into the tip contents from the perspectives of tip venues, temporal patterns, and sentiment. Our results provide an informative picture of the tip publishing patterns of Foursquare users. Last but not least, as a practical scenario to help third-party application providers, we propose a supervised machine learning-based approach to predict whether a user is an influential by referring to the profile and UGC, instead of relying on the social connectivity information. Our data-driven evaluation demonstrates that our approach can reach a good prediction performance with an F1-score of 0.87 and an AUC value of 0.88. Our findings provide a systematic view of the behavior of Foursquare users and are constructive for different relevant entities, including LBSN service providers, Internet service providers, and third-party application providers.},

  abstract     = {Malicious social bots generate fake tweets and automate their social relationships either by pretending like a follower or by creating multiple fake accounts with malicious activities. Moreover, malicious social bots post shortened malicious URLs in the tweet in order to redirect the requests of online social networking participants to some malicious servers. Hence, distinguishing malicious social bots from legitimate users is one of the most important tasks in the Twitter network. To detect malicious social bots, extracting URL-based features (such as URL redirection, frequency of shared URLs, and spam content in URL) consumes less amount of time in comparison with social graph-based features (which rely on the social interactions of users). Furthermore, malicious social bots cannot easily manipulate URL redirection chains. In this article, a learning automata-based malicious social bot detection (LA-MSBD) algorithm is proposed by integrating a trust computation model with URL-based features for identifying trustworthy participants (users) in the Twitter network. The proposed trust computation model contains two parameters, namely, direct trust and indirect trust. Moreover, the direct trust is derived from Bayes&#39; theorem, and the indirect trust is derived from the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) to determine the trustworthiness of each participant accurately. Experimentation has been performed on two Twitter data sets, and the results illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves improvement in precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy compared with existing approaches for MSBD.},

In this article, a novel structure of a hybrid neural network model is proposed to deal with the polysemy phenomena of words and topic confusion with Sina Weibo. First, the embeddings from language models (ELMo) and some statistical methods based on the corpus and sentiment lexicon are employed to extract the features. This method uses latent semantic relationships in different linguistic contexts and cooccurrence statistical features between words in Weibo. Second, for the classification model, unlike traditional C-LSTM which feeds CNN&#39;s output into LSTM, we employ several filters with variable window sizes to extract a sequence of high-level word representation in different granularity distributions of text data in multichannel CNN. At the same time, obtain the sentence representation in Bi-LSTM. Then, concatenate the outputs of multichannel CNN and Bi-LSTM. In conclusion, the results indicate that the proposed model performs better on the precision, recall, and F1-score for Weibo sentiment analysis.},

Motivated by the well-studied research area of community detection algorithms that aggregate strongly connected users with similar interests and behaviors, in this article, we propose a community-based hashtag recommendation framework, which studies hashtag recommendation through tweet similarity task and applies it on communities detected using the Clique percolation method, Louvain algorithm, and label propagation method. The detected communities are extracted from four social network constructions based on following, mention, hashtag, and topic. Compared to the three state-of-the-art hashtag recommendation methods, our extensive experiments show that our community-based method outperforms these methods, thus giving a higher hit rate. Our in-depth analysis demonstrates that the performance of hashtag recommendation is the best when the communities are generated using the Clique percolation method (CPM) from the network of users who share similar usage of hashtags.},

  abstract     = {Influence maximization is the task of finding k seed nodes in a social network such that the expected number of activated nodes in the network (under certain influence propagation model), referred to as the influence spread, is maximized. Lattice influence maximization (LIM) generalizes influence maximization such that, instead of selecting k seed nodes, one selects a vector x = (x 1 , ⋯ x d ) from a discrete space X called a lattice, where xj corresponds to the jth marketing strategy and x represents a marketing strategy mix. Each strategy mix x has probability h u (x) to activate a node u as a seed. LIM is the task of finding a strategy mix under the constraint Σ j x j ≤ k such that its influence spread is maximized. We adopt the reverse influence sampling (RIS) approach and design scalable algorithms for LIM. We explore two complementary design choices: one algorithm IMM-PRR is based on partial coverage on reverse-reachable sets, and the other IMM-VSN is based on incorporating virtual strategy nodes. IMM-PRR can be applied as a general solution to LIM, and we further improve its efficiency for a large family of models where each strategy independently activates seed nodes. IMM-VSN is explicitly designed for the case of independent strategy activation, and it uses virtual nodes to represent strategies to reduce LIM back to the original influence maximization problem. We prove that both IMM-PRR and IMM-VSN guarantee 1 - 1/e - ε approximation for small ε &gt; 0. We further extend LIM to the partitioned budget case where strategies are partitioned into groups, each of which has a separate budget, and show that a minor variation of our algorithms would achieve 1/2 - ε approximation ratio with the same time complexity. Empirically, through extensive tests, we demonstrate that IMM-VSN runs faster than IMM-PRR and much faster than other baseline algorithms while providing the same level of influence spread. We conclude that IMM-VSN is the best one for models with independent strategy activations, while IMM-PRR works for general modes without this assumption.},

  abstract     = {Peer grading is a natural crowdsourcing application, where dispersed students/peers resources are collected to evaluate others&#39; assignments. Peer grading also offers a promising solution for scaling evaluation and learning to large-scale educational systems. A key challenge in peer grading is motivating peers to grade diligently and provide a high-quality evaluation. Spot-checking (SC) mechanisms, allowing instructors to check evaluations, can prevent peer collusion where peers grade arbitrarily and coordinate to report the uninformative grade. However, existing SC mechanisms unrealistically assume that peers have the same grading reliability and cost. This is limiting in practice, where we would expect peers to differ in reliability and cost. This article proposes the general Optimal SC (OptSC) model of determining the probability that each assignment needs to be checked to maximize assignments&#39; evaluation accuracy aggregated from peers and takes into consideration: 1) peers&#39; heterogeneous characteristics and 2) peers&#39; strategic grading behaviors to maximize their own utility. We prove that the bilevel OptSC is NP-hard to solve. By exploiting peers&#39; grading behaviors, we first formulate a single-level relaxation to approximate OptSC. By further exploiting structural properties of the relaxed problem, we propose an efficient algorithm to that relaxation, which also gives a good approximation of the original OptSC. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing approaches.},

Information propagates rapidly in social network and may reach a very large population within a very short period of time. An excessive amount of information shared in social networks not only costs computational and communicational resources but also causes the information overload problem, which results in the delay and difficulty of making decisions and may lead to physical and psychological strain. We used computer technologies to attack this information overload problem. First, we developed automatic decision-making mechanisms to help each individual effectively share information. Second, we built a simulation test bed and proposed an evaluation matrix and then conducted an experimental evaluation of six different information-sharing strategies in terms of interest degrees, reachability, appreciation degrees, and communication cost. We also implemented two intelligent response mechanisms. The first one allows users to order information pieces according to the learned ratings of the information sources. The second mechanism dynamically adjusts the network structure based on machine-learning results. The simulation results show that such mechanisms would be very useful to motivate social-network users to adopt more selective information-sharing strategies.},

  abstract     = {Network embeddings aim to learn representations of nodes in a network with both the first- and the high-order proximities preserved. The first-order proximity corresponds to network reconstruction, while the high-order proximity is in tune with network inference. Since the tradeoff between the two proximities varies on scenarios, we propose an adjustable network embedding (ANE) algorithm for adjusting the weight between the first- and the high-order proximities. ANE is based on two hypotheses: 1) nodes in closed triplets are more important than nodes in open triplets and 2) closed triplets with higher degrees are more important. In addition, we change the bidirectional sampling of Word2vec into directional sampling to preserve the frequency of node pairs in the training set. Three common tasks, network reconstruction, link prediction, and classification are conducted on various publicly available data sets to validate the abovementioned statements.},

The authenticity of information content is weakened, and all kinds of misinformation rely on social media to spread rapidly. Network space governance and providing a trusted network environment are of critical significance. In this article, we study a novel problem called activity minimization of misinformation influence (AMMI) problem that blocks a node set from the network such that the total amount of misinformation interaction between nodes (TAMIN) is minimized. That is to say, the AMMI problem is to select K nodes from a given social network G to block so that the TAMIN is the smallest. We prove that the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular and propose a heuristic greedy algorithm (HGA) to select top K nodes for removal. Furthermore, in order to evaluate our proposed method, extensive experiments have been carried out on three real-world networks. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms comparison approaches.},

However, the development of SBAs is at its early stage with a number of unsolved issues, such as the availability of effective methods for services selection and composition, semantic representation of specifications, and security assurances. This article aims to address two main issues in SBAs: 1) the standardization of formulation and 2) the security assurance.

However, the curse of dimensionality seriously restricts their widespread exploitation, especially under edge/fog computing environments. To alleviate the dilemma, we attempt to present a set of tensor-train (TT)-based tensor operations with their scalable computations and then propose a novel TT-based big data processing framework under edge/fog computing environments. Specifically, in this article, we first summarize and present a set of TT-based tensor operations by converting the original high-order tensor operation to a series of low-order (second- or third-order) TTcore-based operations. Then, we propose a two-layer scalable TT-based computation architecture, including inter-TTcore and intra-TTcore scalable models. Afterward, according to various scalable models, a series of scalable TT-based tensor computations (STT-TCs) with their complexity analysis are proposed in detail. Finally, we propose a novel TT-based big data processing framework to adapt to edge/fog computing environments. We conduct extensive experiments based on both random data sets and real-world ubiquitous bus traffic data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed STT-TCs can significantly improve computation efficiency and are suitable for edge/fog computing environments.},

  abstract     = {People in geographically close areas tend to show similarities in their interests such as sports, food, and festivals, which is often reflected in their discussion. Lifestyle and the way of communication among people living nearby play an essential role in this similarity. However, with the popularity of online social media platforms, communication with distant persons has become much easier and frequent. In one sense, social media platforms help in breaking the barrier of distance and bring people across geography closer. With this, a comprehensive study is required to understand whether geographical distance still has a significant impact on discussion or it has already faded and made us a global citizen. Moreover, if there is an impact of geographical distance on discussion, then it would be interesting to investigate whether this impact is uniform across different topics of discussion or not. This understanding will help in targeted marketing, advertisement, and policy-making. In this article, we analyze the geotagged tweet data collected for a period of around five months for three countries, USA, U.K., and India, each with diverse cultures and unique identities. We measure the impact of geographical distance at a finer granularity (within a country) in online discussions in terms of content similarity and other geographical parameters of topical tweets. This article reflects that there is a significant homogenization in online discussions with respect to geographical distance; however, this homogenization is not similar across all the topics of discussion and location. The impact varies depending on the topic of discussion and location.},

  abstract     = {According to Robert Putnam, trust can be a proxy for social capital. Thus, a higher societal trust could be related to economic growth. To test this hypothesis, we simulated the association between trust and economic growth in two artificial societies. One artificial society (New Zealand) exhibited higher levels of initial trust, and the other (Argentina) had lower levels of trust. Initial starting points for simulations were set using representative survey data (using the global trust inventory). Computational simulation relied on a rule-based model (RBM), integrating time through a stochastic simulation algorithm implemented in PISKaS. Agents in the artificial societies were distributed according to proportions of four trust profiles, with more high trusters (HTs) in New Zealand. In each iteration, the agents played a prisoner&#39;s dilemma, earning or losing money according to different payoff matrices, cooperation probabilities, and interaction frequencies, modeling different conditions for economic exchange. We analyzed the economic performance of each country, together with the performance of each trust profile. Results support the notion that societies with high trust perform economically better, on average, than those with low trust, but only if interaction frequency is held constant. Despite the relevance of HTs for economic development, their performance is tightly linked to the type of society in which they interact: they prosper more in a Rule of Law society, and where HTs are more common, compared with a predators&#39; paradise, where the sucker&#39;s payoff is more punitive.},

It is a time-consuming and costly process as universities annually spend millions of dollars on handling the degree verification requests. Hence, there is a dire need to improve the degree verification process, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA, has introduced the blockcerts, a blockchain-based solution for freely handling the degree verification requests. Although blockcerts eliminates the cost of the degree verification process, it also alters the existing workflow of degree issuance. This is because blockcerts are primarily focused on facilitating the students, and there is room for improvement from the perspective of educational institutes. In this article, we have introduced the docschain to tackle the three mentioned limitations of the blockcerts. Docschain seamlessly incorporates within the existing workflow of degree issuance by operating over the hard copies of the degree documents. This is achieved through optical character recognition (OCR), and the record of each degree document is stored along with the details of the corresponding OCR template to understand the semantics of the data stored at different sections of the degree document. In contrast to blockcerts, docschain also supports the bulk submission of degree details for both the previously and newly graduated students.},

However, malicious users may deliberately generate poisoning locations and send these poisoning locations to the MEC server, aiming to poison the statistical results learned by the MEC server and even the other users’ location privacy. Existing work concerning privacy preservation in MEC has not studied such poisoning attacks in MEC. Another line of somehow related work focused on poisoning attacks in a different scenario—adversarial machine learning. However, MEC exhibits different features with the machine learning settings, and thus, the privacy preservation against poisoning attacks in MEC faces significantly new challenges. To address the problem, we propose the privacy-preserving scheme, i.e., privacy-preserving scheme against poisoning (P 3 ), that utilizes the feature learning model to infer the social relationships among users from their location data and then constructs the inferred social graph. Thereafter, it searches the optimal map between the inferred social graph and the social graph from social networks to identify the poisoning locations. Experiments on two real-world data sets, two baseline works, and two kinds of poisoning attacks have demonstrated the privacy preservation against the poisoning attacks in MEC P 3 provides.},

  abstract     = {Community detection or identification problem has emerged as an important task in the field of network analysis. The problem becomes more challenging when the communities overlap each other. Since the community detection problem can be modeled as an optimization problem, the genetic algorithm (GA) can be used to develop a solution. Typically, overlapping community detection problem is a multiobjective optimization problem and there may exist some conflicts among these objectives. Therefore, a simple GA-based solution is not efficient for detecting overlapping communities in a social network. For this purpose, we have proposed an overlapping community detection method based on nondominated sorting GA (NSGA)-II having two objective functions. The first objective function maximizes internal link density within the community using fuzzy membership values while the second objective function minimizes the external link density of the communities. The initial population has been created based on the neighbors. A mutation operator has been proposed in this article to restrict the randomness in the chromosome. An updation operator has also been proposed to modify a chromosome after crossover and mutation operation. The proposed method can handle different network structures properly. In order to show the effectiveness, the proposed method has been compared with some popular methods on several real-world environments in terms of two performance measurement techniques, namely, generalized normalized mutual information (gNMI) and extended modularity (Q ov ). The empirical results reveal that our proposed method has succeeded to obtain better gNMI and comparable extended modularity values.},

  abstract     = {The crowdsourcing system is a distributed problem-solving platform, in which tasks are delivered to the crowd (i.e., crowdworkers) in the form of an open call. Usually, large-scale crowdsourcing systems contain abundant microtasks, and the overhead of a crowdworker spending on searching the appropriate task may be comparable to the cost of completing the task. Therefore, task recommendation is necessary. However, existing work ignores the dynamics in crowdsourcing system, i.e., new tasks continually arrive, which leads to the issues of task cold-start. To overcome the challenge of the new coming task recommendation, this article proposes a feature-based Bayesian task recommendation (BTR) scheme. The key idea to deal with the dynamics of the crowdsourcing system lies in that the BTR learns the latent factor of the task through the task features instead of task ID and then learns the user&#39;s preference according to their historical behaviors. Specifically, based on task features and the user&#39;s historical behavior records, BTR can not only timely provide crowdworkers with personalized task recommendations but also solve the task cold-start problem. The simulations based on the real crowdsourced data set demonstrate that BTR performs better than other typical schemes that target at recommending the newly arrived tasks to crowdworkers.},

  abstract     = {In the real-world social networks, hashtags are widely applied for understanding the content of an individual microblog. However, users do not always take the initiative in attaching hashtags when posting a microblog so that much effort has been invested for automatically hashtag recommendation. As a new trend, users no longer only post texts but prefer to share with multimodal data, such as images. To deal with these situations, we propose an attention-based multimodal neural network model (AMNN) to learn the representations of multimodal microblogs and recommend relevant hashtags. In this article, we convert the hashtag recommendation task into a sequence generation problem. Then, we propose a hybrid neural network approach to extract the features of both texts and images and incorporate them into the sequence-to-sequence model for hashtag recommendation. Experimental results on the data set collected on Instagram and two public data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves the best performance in three different metrics: precision, recall, and accuracy. The source code of this article can be obtained from “ https://github.com/w5688414/AMNN .”},

We tested how robust various information sharing strategies are to information overload and bounds on rationality in terms of the speed and accuracy of collective decision-making. Our results suggest distinct strategies depending on whether speed or accuracy is imperative and, more broadly, shed light on how intelligence is best attained in collective decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Online marketplaces often witness opinion spam in the form of reviews. People are often hired to target specific brands for promoting or impeding them by writing highly positive or negative reviews. This often is done collectively in groups. Although some previous studies attempted to identify and analyze such opinion spam groups, little has been explored to spot those groups who target a brand as a whole, instead of just products. In this article, we collected the reviews from the Amazon product review site and manually labeled a set of 923 candidate reviewer groups. The groups are extracted using frequent itemset mining over brand similarities such that users are clustered together if they have mutually reviewed (products of) a lot of brands. We hypothesize that the nature of the reviewer groups is dependent on eight features specific to a ( group, brand ) pair. We develop a feature-based supervised model to classify candidate groups as extremist entities. We run multiple classifiers for the task of classifying a group based on the reviews written by the users of that group to determine whether the group shows signs of extremity. A three-layer perceptron-based classifier turns out to be the best classifier. We further study behaviors of such groups in detail to understand the dynamics of brand-level opinion fraud better. These behaviors include consistency in ratings, review sentiment, verified purchase, review dates, and helpful votes received on reviews. Surprisingly, we observe that there are a lot of verified reviewers showing extreme sentiment, which, on further investigation, leads to ways to circumvent the existing mechanisms in place to prevent unofficial incentives on Amazon.},

User-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) is widely employed in practical RSs due to its outstanding performance. However, the traditional UBCF is subject to the new user cold-start issue because a new user is often extreme lack of available rating information. In this article, we develop a novel approach that incorporates a bipartite network into UBCF for enhancing the recommendation quality of new users. First, through the statistic and analysis of new users&#39; rating characteristics, we collect niche items and map the corresponding rating matrix to a weighted bipartite network. Furthermore, a new weighted bipartite modularity index merging normalized rating information is present to conduct the community partition that realizes coclustering of users and items. Finally, for each individual clustering that is much smaller than the original rating matrix, a localized low-rank matrix factorization is executed to predict rating scores for unrated items. Items with the highest predicted rating scores are recommended to a new user. Experimental results from two real-world data sets suggest that without requiring additional complex information, the proposed approach is superior in terms of both recommendation accuracy and diversity and can alleviate the new user cold-start issue of UBCF effectively.},

  abstract     = {Location-based recommendation has recently received a lot of attention in the communities of information service and mobile application. Its task is to provide personalized recommendations of points of interest (POIs) to users at a certain time and location. However, existing location-based recommendation models have at least two main drawbacks: first they cannot adequately capture semantic features of POIs and users, which may lead to unsatisfactory recommendations and second they cannot effectively address the cold-start problem. To address the above drawbacks, in this article, we first propose a novel deep representation learning-based model (DRLM) for improving the recommendation accuracy. In DRLM, we mainly focus on learning to accurately represent semantic features of POIs and users. Specifically, four co-occurrence matrices are constructed to produce four different original features for each POI, and a principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is utilized to generate a semantic feature of each POI from its four original features. On the other hand, a three-modal simple recurrent unit (TMSRU) network is given to constructed semantic features of users using semantic features of POIs, times, and locations. We further propose minimum description length (MDL)-based and skyline-based strategies to address the cold-start issues for new users and new POIs, respectively. Through experiments on two real-world data sets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed model DRLM can achieve the superior performance in terms of high recommendation accuracy and effectiveness in handling the cold-start problem.},

One method to improve the current quality assessment procedure is to include D/HoH viewers in the evaluation procedure for their subjective assessment input. However, it could be costly and impractical to perform evaluations for the entire broadcasted shows. Therefore, it would be helpful to model subjective assessments that could replicate and predict human decisions. In this article, we report on a model of probabilities of D/HoH viewer assessment decisions for CC quality factors based on actual user preferences. An online survey was designed and conducted to collect assessment data for 22 error variation samples from four quality factors: delay, speed, missing words, and paraphrasing of captions. The results are analyzed using the signal detection theory framework to create decision probability models for D/HoH viewers.},

However, as the real social networks are difficult to access, it is also difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the community detection algorithms on dynamic social networks. Existing dynamic social network generators only focus on edge or node changes, whereas the quality of the community structure (modularity) is not considered. We propose a time-evolving social network generator based on modularity (TESNG-M). In TESNG-M, according to the community partition of the original network, the evolutionary behavior is simulated by adding or deleting nodes and flipping edges so that a static social network with a specified modularity will be generated. By repeating the static generation process, we obtain a dynamic social network with a specified partition and modularity at each time step. Thus, the network generated by TESNG-M can effectively simulate a real dynamic social network and be used for community detection. Furthermore, the specified modularity of static synthetic networks and the dynamic modularity of dynamic synthetic networks could be regarded as the performance baseline of community detection algorithms in static and dynamic social networks, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Memorability is one of the intrinsic image properties, which enables one to quantify to what extent images are memorable to the human cognitive system. Many works have shed light on various visual factors that influence the image memorability. Recently, one such study showed the influence of image depth and motion information on image memorability [3]. Based on these findings, this article proposes a deep learning-based prediction model, which utilizes depth and motion cues to predict the image memorability scores. The proposed model contains three deep CNN networks. Each of these three networks is individually trained to utilize one of the three visual factors: 1) visual depth information; 2) optical flow information; and 3) fine-tuned scene- and object-related features. In the end, all three networks are ensembled to predict the final memorability scores for the given image. An extensive set of experiments are conducted on large scale image memorability data set LaMem. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed model performs better than the current state-of-the-art model [3] by 2.44%.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of social media, users are getting involved in virtual socialism, generating a huge volume of textual and image contents. Considering the contents such as status updates/tweets and shared posts/retweets, liking other posts is reflecting the online behavior of the users. Predicting personality of a user from these digital footprints has become a computationally challenging problem. In a profile-based approach, utilizing the user-generated textual contents could be useful to reflect the personality in social media. Using huge number of features of different categories, such as traditional linguistic features (character-level, word-level, structural, and so on), psycholinguistic features (emotional affects, perceptions, social relationships, and so on) or social network features (network size, betweenness, and so on) could be useful to predict personality traits from social media. According to a widely popular personality model, namely, big-five-factor model (BFFM), the five factors are openness-to-experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Predicting personality is redefined as predicting each of these traits separately from the extracted features. Traditionally, it takes huge number of features to get better accuracy on any prediction task although applying feature selection algorithms may improve the performance of the model. In this article, we have compared the performance of five feature selection algorithms, namely the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), correlation-based feature subset (CFS), information gain (IG), symmetric uncertainly (SU) evaluator, and chi-squared (CHI) method. The performance is evaluated using the classic metrics, namely, precision, recall, f-measure, and accuracy as evaluation matrices.},

In this article, we focus on obtaining deep feature representations of legal and fraud transactions from the aspect of the loss function of a deep neural network. Our purpose is to obtain better separability and discrimination of features so that it can improve the performance of our fraud detection model and keep its stability. We propose a new kind of loss function, full center loss (FCL), which considers both distances and angles among features and, thus, can comprehensively supervise the deep representation learning. We conduct lots of experiments on two big data sets of credit card transactions, one is private and another is public, to demonstrate the detection performance of our model by comparing FCL with other state-of-the-art loss functions. The results illustrate that FCL outperforms others. We also conduct experiments to show that FCL can ensure a more stable model than others.},

Visitors are considered as prospect-theoretic utility maximizers, whose behavioral risk attitudes affect not only their personal decisions and experiences but also those of others, thus creating an interdependent social system. To address the congestion problem within such a probabilistic and uncertain environment, pricing is introduced as an effective mechanism to drive visitor actions in efficient operation points, preserving museum operation stability. The corresponding problem of determining the time invested by each visitor at museum exhibits toward optimizing their obtained experience, as expressed via properly designed prospect-theoretic utility functions with pricing, is formulated and treated as a noncooperative game. The theory of S-modular games is adopted to prove existence and convergence to Nash equilibrium. Based on this framework, we study and analyze the validity and effectiveness of pricing as a tool to manage congestion in museums.},

  abstract     = {The last decade has witnessed the explosive growth of online social media in users and contents. Due to the unprecedented scale and the cascading power of the underlying social networks, social media has created a new paradigm for sharing information, broadcasting breaking news, and reporting real-time events by any user from anywhere at any time. Many popular social media sites including Twitter provide streaming data services by standard APIs to the broad researcher and developer communities. Given the sheer data volume, rapid velocity, and feature variety of online social media, these sites often supply only a sampled set of streaming data, rather than the full data set to reduce the resource cost of computations, storage, and network bandwidth. In light of the substantial impact of sampling in Twitter data stream, this article explores a combination of spectral clustering, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling, and differential equation modeling to mitigate the impact of sampling on social media data analysis, in particular on detecting real-world events and predicting information diffusion. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is able to detect effectively the real-time emerging events and predict accurately the cascading pattern of these events from the 1% sampled Twitter data stream. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first effort to introduce a systematic methodology to study and mitigate the impact of data sampling on social media analysis and mining.},

First, considering the influence of multimessage interaction on user participation behavior, a multimessage interaction influence-driving mechanism was proposed to predict user participation behavior more accurately. Second, in the view of the behavioral complexity of users engaging in multimessage hotspots and the simple structure of backpropagation (BP) neural networks (which can map complex nonlinear relationships), this study proposes a user participant behavior prediction model of social hotspots based on a multimessage interaction-driving mechanism and the BP neural network. Finally, the multimessage interaction has an iterative guiding effect on user behavior, which easily causes overfitting of the BP neural network. To avoid this problem, the traditional BP neural network is optimized by a simulated annealing algorithm to further improve the prediction accuracy. In evaluation experiments, the model not only predicted the user participation behavior in actual situations of multimessage interaction but also further quantified the correlations among multiple messages on hot topics.},

This article proposes a novel approach called two-stage rating prediction (TS-RP) to matrix clustering with implicit information. In the first stage, implicit feedback is used to discover the inherent structure of the user-item rating matrix by spectral clustering. In the second stage, we conduct rating prediction on the dense blocks of explicit information of user-item clusters discovered in the first stage. The proposed TS-RP approach can not only alleviate the data sparsity problem in recommendation but also increase the computation scalability. Experiments on the MovieLens-100K data set demonstrate that the proposed TS-RP approach performs better than most state-of-the-art methods of rating prediction based on MF in terms of recommendation accuracy and computation complexity.},

In this article, we propose a novel embedding algorithm that incorporates network motifs to capture higher order structures in the network. To evaluate its effectiveness for link prediction, experiments were conducted on three types of networks: social networks, biological networks, and academic networks.

  abstract     = {In this article, we computationally model the social behavior of beetles and apply it to the tracking control of manipulators. The beetles demonstrate excellent skills to forage food in a previously unknown environment by merely using their olfactory senses. The goal of the beetle is to search the region with the maximum smell. Therefore, the actions of the beetle can be characterized as an optimization algorithm. This article mathematically models this behavior in the form of a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a temporal-feedback connection. We apply the formulated RNN controller for the redundancy resolution and tracking control of the redundant manipulators with an unknown kinematic model. Most of the industrial robots have redundant manipulators, and kinematic trajectory tracking is a fundamental problem for any industrial task. The behavior of the beetle allows us to formulate a position-level controller without relying on the manipulation of the Jacobian matrix. It is in contrast with the conventional velocity-level controllers, which require an accurate kinematic model of the manipulator and calculation of pseudoinverse of Jacobian, a computationally expensive task. The proposed algorithm, called Beetle Antennae Olfactory Recurrent Neural Network (BAORNN) algorithm, is capable of driving the manipulator by only using the feedback from the position and orientation sensors. The stability and convergence of the proposed algorithm are theoretically proved, and the simulations results using a seven-degree-of-freedom (DOF) industrial robotic arm, KUKA LBR IIWA14, are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The widespread use of advanced mobile devices has led to the emergence of a new class of mobile crowdsourcing called spatial mobile crowdsourcing (SMCS). The main feature of SMCS is the presence of spatial tasks that require workers to be physically present at a particular location for task fulfillment. These tasks usually take advantage of the built-in sensors in mobile devices by requesting environment sensing services. Because cameras are becoming the most common way for visual logging techniques and sensing in our daily lives, we propose, in this article, a photo-based SMCS framework for event reporting. The proposed framework allows event report requesters to solicit photos of ongoing events and keep track of any updates. We propose a full architecture in which we solve the SMCS recruitment problem using different fairness strategies in the presence of multiple events and reporters. Then, once submissions are received and before forwarding final responses to event requesters, we proceed with a data processing phase for data quality monitoring. In short, our event reporting platform helps requesters recruit ideal reporters, select highly relevant data from an evolving picture stream, and receive accurate responses. This solution mainly incorporates: 1) a strategic and generic recruitment algorithm for recruiting and scheduling suitable reporters to events; 2) a deep learning model that eliminates false submissions and ensures photo&#39;s credibility; and 3) an A-tree shape data structure model for clustering streaming pictures to reduce information redundancy and provide maximum event coverage. Experiment results investigate the performances of the proposed recruitment approach and show that our algorithm outperforms two other benchmarking approaches. Also, we conduct simulations to evaluate the strategies of the proposed recruitment algorithm, given different fairness levels among events. Data quality simulation results show effectiveness in reducing false submissions and delivering high-quality responses. Finally, framework implementation for real-world applications is provided.},

  abstract     = {Although public transport vehicles such as buses have always been an economical means of commuting in the cities of many developing countries, it is always considered as a secondary mode of transport owing to poor infrastructure, chaotic and reckless driving habits, and absence of any proper information system in buses. Based on rigorous experiments carried out over a period of two years and multiple surveys, we have tried to learn the problems faced by bus commuters. As a solution, in this article, we develop a novel energy-efficient system which would help commuters navigate through their journey safely. Along with making them aware of any upcoming points of concerns (PoCs) such as sudden bumps, sharp turns, and bad roads, we also inform commuters about the expected time of arrival at the destination. The system makes use of several landmarks such as speed breakers, turns, and bus stops on a trail stored in a specialized data structure, the probabilistic timed automata. We conducted extensive experiments using 25 volunteers over 50 trails. The system showed an average localization error of only 50 m and mean estimated time of arrival (ETA) error of 2.5 mins and a fairly high alert prediction accuracy while consuming significantly less energy when compared to GPS.},

  abstract     = {Community detection in complex networks is significant to social network analysis. Most of the algorithms take advantage of single-objective optimization methods, which may not be effective for complex networks. Compared with single-objective algorithms, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms can avoid local optimization. However, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms often encounter problems of excessive search space and low efficiency. To solve these issues, this study introduces network embedding into the multiobjective particle swarm algorithm and maps nodes into a low-latitude space, thereby effectively reducing the search space while increasing search efficiency via a consensus propagation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that a novel effective algorithm based on multiobjective particle swarm optimization (NE-PSO) performs effectively and has competitive performance in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches on synthetic and real-world networks, especially the large-scale ones.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have shown the importance of utilizing hashtags for sentiment analysis task on social media data. However, as the hashtag generation process is less restrictive, it throws several challenges, such as hashtag normalization, topic modeling, and semantic similarity. Recently, researchers have tried to address the above-mentioned challenges through representation learning. However, most of the studies on hashtag embedding try to capture the semantic distribution of hashtags and often fail to capture the sentiment polarity. Furthermore, generating a task-specific hashtag embedding can distort its semantic representation, which is undesirable for sentiment representation of hashtag. Therefore, this article proposes a semisupervised sentiment hashtag embedding (SHE) model, which is capable of preserving both semantic as well as sentiment distribution of the hashtags. In particular, SHE leverages a multitask learning approach using an autoencoder and a convolutional neural network-based classifier. To assess the efficacy of hashtag embedding, we compare the performance of SHE against suitable baselines for three different tasks, namely, hashtag sentiment classification, tweet sentiment classification, and retrieval of semantically similar hashtags. It is evident from various experimental results that SHE outperforms the majority of the baselines with significant margins.},

A comprehensive framework of factor identification of SHMWD from wide-ranging considerations is needed. Indeed, quantitative support of identifying significant factors/features affecting product rating and review needs to be studied as well. This article aims to identify 123 environmental factors (EFs) and their associated categories of SHMWD from various perspectives, determine the important EFs based on customers&#39; interest, and investigate the significant levels of EFs and each category on product rating, the significant EFs of each category, the correlation among EFs, and the principle components of the data set. Data analysis was conducted based on real data collected online (n = 769). Statistical learning methods, including relative weighted method, analysis of variance, hypothesis testing, multiple regression analysis, backward elimination method, and principle component analysis, are employed to analyze the collected data. We also identify the top 15 important EFs which can be further incorporated in product development and maintenance. For researchers, this article points to the improvement directions of the current technologies applied in SHMWD as well as the new technologies to be implemented in the area of human-machine interactions. For practitioners, this article provides the managerial suggestions of time and resource allocation to the development team given each team may have different focused category and a general guide of feature selection for product development and maintenance and improvement for customer satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {Twitter is an active communication channel for the spreading of updated information in emergency situations. Retrieving specific information related to infrastructure damage offers the situational views to the concerned authorities, who can take necessary action to disburse help. However, such usages of Twitter demand significant accuracy of the retrieved information. Previous techniques on IR have not been able to capture the semantic variations satisfactorily in the tweets, due to low content quality and vocabulary gap, and consequently have failed to yield considerable performance. This has left ample scope for further improvement in this area of research. There are two major contributions of our work: 1) developing a relevant tweet retrieval framework that provides information about infrastructure damage and 2) assignment of a relative damage score to the affected regions so that the severity of the damage can be assessed. Our proposed technique involves a novel split-query-based mechanism with topic aligned query expansion (TAQE) to retrieve relevant tweets that are subsequently used for measuring the infrastructure damage across different locations. We report empirical results on multiple-crisis-related data sets to establish the efficacy of our approach to these events at different locations. Empirical validation of our proposed approach on manually annotated ground-truth data reveals considerably better performance metrics in terms of precision, recall, Bpref, and MAP over several state-of-the-art techniques.},

The concept was scarcely studied until 2013, when the series of workshops on SMs was created, and the topic began to receive more attention. However, it is not clear how research has evolved since then. This article aims to investigate and summarize how the research field of SM has evolved since 2013, to outline the state of the art and practice, and identify research opportunities within this field. We performed a systematic literature review analyzing the quantity and quality of publications, the main topics addressed, the current classifications of SMs, the context in which the concepts are used, and the main perceived challenges. We identified and analyzed 56 relevant studies addressing 12 topics, representing the current practical landscape of research regarding SM. Our findings suggest that: 1) research interest in SM is increasing, but is still concentrated into two research clusters; 2) topics are grouped under two main headings: a) human behavior and b) software development; 3) there is still a need for a common taxonomy to define and classify SM; 4) the main contexts are crowdsourcing and social networks, and the majority of studies are small-scale studies in an academic setup; and 5) more empirical rigor and evidence is needed regarding their use, benefits and challenges, despite some evidence regarding challenges related to user engagement, trust, scalability, and a better human-machine collaboration. Finally, a vision of the future of SMs, with the integration of web of people, artificial intelligence, and things, is also presented and discussed.},

To this purpose, this article proposes a stochastic multiagent model that incorporates a simplified description of the modulation of the interaction intensity exerted by the platform manager. Various transient and steady-state properties of the model are established. In particular, it is studied how emerging collective behaviors, e.g., consensus, polarization, and community cleavage, depend on the interaction intensity parameter. Notably, the nonmonotonic effects of such a parameter are observed for suitable distributions of influenceability across the community. By means of a newly introduced concept of individual stochastic social power, some insights are given on the role of the interaction intensity parameter in the conflict between opposite factions in simple scenarios. A major finding of this article is that an apparently neutral intervention, i.e., unbiased with respect to the conflicting opinions, can favor one faction just by tuning the interaction intensity.},

In this article, we explore the network of the director boards for the top Indian corporations to better understand the effects of the interlocking of management boards when the financial performance is considered. To study the corporate networks, we collected and analyzed relevant data set of the top 150 Indian companies on the basis of the maximum revenue generation. We find that the debt-to-equity ratio (D/E), on average, tends to decrease as the measure of the degree centrality of certain corporations increases. Furthermore, we study a modularity maximization-based community structure of the network of director boards to better comprehend the interconnections of the Indian corporates. Moreover, the underlying relationship between the modularity and the corporate performance is also analyzed, and it can be observed that most of the top Indian corporations, with low net current asset value per share, belong to the larger communities.},

  abstract     = {Vaccination is one of the most effective strategies against epidemics. Traditionally, the evolutionary game theory focuses on individual behaviors, rather than psychological cognition behind which reflects individual risk attitude. How does individual perception impact the collective decision and performance of vaccination? To explore this question, we propose an evolutionary vaccination game model by integrating the prospect theory (PT), which accounts for individual subjective perception under uncertainty. In this article, the uncertainty stems from the interactions of individuals in the potential infection process. After analyzing the evolutionary vaccination dynamics, we compare the vaccination equilibrium under the PT and the expected utility theory (EUT) and highlight the role of perceptions on promoting vaccination. In addition, we find that the performance of different perceptions captured by the weighting effect (WE) and the framing effect in epidemic control depends on the vaccination cost. Specifically, both the fraction of infected individuals and the social cost decrease with the decrease of the rationality coefficient under the WE when the vaccination cost is relatively small. The dependence reveals that risk-averse and loss aversion dominate individual vaccination behavior. The numerical simulations verify the effect of perception and the effectiveness of vaccinating the network epidemics.},

We performed qualitative analyses by gathering data from social media and weather data websites. Various analysis methods are proposed to aggregate the diffused information from the social network to generate influencing data. The analyses results further identify the connected user acknowledgment for dominant information in the public domain. This information is mapped by applying a convolutional neural network for a physical sensor data set to detect weather anomalies. Moreover, we exploited the reinforcement learning technique to determine smart policy on the influencing data.

  abstract     = {One of the most interesting topics in the scope of social network analysis is dynamic community detection, keeping track of communities’ evolutions in a dynamic network. This article introduces a new Louvain-based dynamic community detection algorithm relied on the derived knowledge of the previous steps of the network evolution. The algorithm builds a compressed graph, where its supernodes represent the detected communities of the previous step and its superedges show the edges among the supernodes. The algorithm not only constructs the compressed graph with low computational complexity but also detects the communities through the integration of the Louvain algorithm into the graph. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is widely investigated in this article. By doing so, several evaluations have been performed over three standard real-world data sets, namely Enron Email, Cit-HepTh, and Facebook data sets. The obtained results indicate the superiority of the proposed algorithm with respect to the execution time as an efficiency metric. Likewise, the results show the modularity of the proposed algorithm as another effectiveness metric compared with the other well-known related algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been a rapid growth in location-based systems and applications in which users submit their location information to service providers in order to gain access to a service, resource, or reward. We have seen that in these applications, dishonest users have an incentive to cheat on their location. Unfortunately, no effective protection mechanism has been adopted by service providers against these fake location submissions. This is a critical issue that causes severe consequences for these applications. Motivated by this, we propose the Privacy-Aware and Secure Proof Of pRoximiTy (PASPORT) scheme in this article to address the problem. Using PASPORT, users submit a location proof (LP) to service providers to prove that their submitted location is true. PASPORT has a decentralized architecture designed for ad hoc scenarios in which mobile users can act as witnesses and generate LPs for each other. It provides user privacy protection as well as security properties, such as unforgeability and nontransferability of LPs. Furthermore, the PASPORT scheme is resilient to prover-prover collusions and significantly reduces the success probability of Prover-Witness collusion attacks. To further make the proximity checking process private, we propose P-TREAD, a privacy-aware distance bounding protocol and integrate it into PASPORT. To validate our model, we implement a prototype of the proposed scheme on the Android platform. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method can efficiently protect location-based applications against fake submissions.},

Contents inside mobile applications can provide valuable insights for social sensing and application development. However, unlike Web search, there is a lack of efficient methods to sense and index information from mobile applications. This article proposes an automated mobile application content sensing (AMACS) framework, which can be the fundamental tool to extract effectively the contents and conducting measurements in mobile applications. AMACS uses a content-aware discovery model to extract effectively the contents from a variety of mobile applications without any manual intervention. Its modular design with independent building blocks can be readily expanded into a distributed system for large-scale deployment. AMACS is compared with the existing relevant mobile automated analysis methods to evaluate its performance. The results show that the crawler can cover more contents efficiently in mobile applications with low overheads, and it can be used to extract contents for application scenarios like social sensing and network measurements.},

In order to obtain valuable criminal clues, considerable research works have been done to analyze criminal suspects’ social data. However, most of them did not pay much attention on privacy-preserving problems, which may leak some sensitive data in the analysis process. To solve this problem, we propose a novel analysis approach of criminal suspects by exploiting social data and crime data that are collected by social network and police information systems. We enable the social cloud server and public security cloud server to exchange social information of criminal suspects and user’s public information in a privacy-preserving way. Specifically, we propose a privacy-preserving data retrieving method based on oblivious transfer to guarantee that only the authorized entities can perform queries on suspects’ social data, while the social cloud server cannot infer anything during the query. Moreover, several building blocks, such as encrypted data comparing, secure classification and regression tree ( CART ) model are also proposed. Based on these building blocks, we designed a privacy-preserving criminal suspects sensing scheme. Finally, we demonstrate a performance evaluation which shows that our scheme can enhance analysis of criminal suspects without privacy leakage, while with low overhead.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development and proliferation of multimedia systems and applications, there is a growing need to handle multimedia heterogeneous data safely and efficiently on the cloud. Tensor models are effective in representing multimedia multidimensional data, and the tensor decomposition is one of the basic building blocks of data analysis and learning models. In this article, we propose a secure tensor singular value decomposition ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${S}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -tSVD), in which the time-domain operation is converted into a scheme featuring frequency-domain multilinear circular unfolding–folding. First, we represent various multimedia data as cipher subtensors, using fully homomorphic encryption. We then take the fast Fourier transform (FFT) approach to launch a new multiplication operation along the tubal fibers of a unified high-order tensor. Second, relying on the homomorphism of addition and multiplication theory, we prove the fully homomorphic consistency of the proposed &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${S}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -tSVD algorithm. Third, we provide an elegant solution to tackle the typical dimensionality inconsistency problem while working with multiple subtensors. Finally, we carry out theoretical analyses with respect to dimensionality reduction, reconstruction error of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${S}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -tSVD, running time, and data security. We use real unstructured video data and semistructured XML documents, integrating them within a unified tensor model for decomposition. We demonstrate that the error ratio of the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${S}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -tSVD is lower than the same compression ratio compared to the SVD decomposition and tSVD-slice approaches. Moreover, the specific &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${S}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -tSVD decomposition not only enables effective data mining and dimensionality reduction but also ensures the accuracy of the decomposition result and data privacy protection.},

  abstract     = {The aptitude to identify the emotional states of others and response to exposed emotions is an important aspect of human social intelligence. Robots are expected to be prevalent in society to assist humans in various tasks. Human-robot interaction (HRI) is of critical importance in the assistive robotics sector. Smart digital assistants and assistive robots fail quite often when a request is not well defined verbally. When the assistant fails to provide services as desired, the person may exhibit an emotional response such as anger or frustration through expressions in their face and voice. It is critical that robots understand not only the language, but also human psychology. A novel affection-based perception architecture for cooperative HRIs is studied in this paper, where the agent is expected to recognize human emotional states, thus encourages a natural bonding between the human and the robotic artifact. We propose a method to close the loop using measured emotions to grade HRIs. This metric will be used as a reward mechanism to adjust the assistant&#39;s behavior adaptively. Emotion levels from users are detected through vision and speech inputs processed by deep neural networks (NNs). Negative emotions exhibit a change in performance until the user is satisfied.},

Currently, in the field of knowledge engineering, knowledge graphs, especially domain knowledge graphs, play important roles and become the infrastructure of Internet knowledge-driven intelligent applications. Domain concept extraction is critical to the construction of domain knowledge graphs. Although there have been some works that have extracted concepts, semantic information has not been fully used. However, the excellent concept extraction results can be obtained by making full use of semantic information. In this article, a novel concept extraction method, Semantic Graph-Based Concept Extraction (SGCCE), is proposed. First, the similarities between terms are calculated using the word co-occurrence, the LDA topic model and Word2Vec. Then, a semantic graph of terms is constructed based on the similarities between the terms. Finally, according to the semantic graph of the terms, community detection algorithms are used to divide the terms into different communities where each community acts as a concept. In the experiments, we compare the concept extraction results that are obtained by different community detection algorithms to analyze the different semantic graphs. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method. This method can effectively use semantic information, and the results of the concept extraction are better from domain big data in smart cities.},

To address this issue, we develop a differential privacy (DP)-enabled DNN learning framework, DNN-DP, that intentionally injects noise to the affine transformation of the input data features and provides DP protection for the crowdsourced sensitive training data. Specifically, we correspondingly estimate the importance of each feature related to target categories and follow the principle that less noise is injected into the more important feature to ensure the data utility of the model. Moreover, we design an adaptive coefficient for the added noise to accommodate the heterogeneous feature value ranges. Theoretical analysis proves that DNN-DP preserves ε-differentially private in the computation. Moreover, the simulation based on the US Census data set demonstrates the superiority of our method in predictive accuracy compared with other existing privacy-aware machine learning methods.},

However, the violation of the security of end users&#39; social data stored and shared through the social computing system becomes a serious and urgent issue. The data protection on social media platforms is very different compared with the scenario of the traditional encryption algorithms, and most of the existing schemes are not suitable for data protection in the current social sensing and data-sharing system. In this article, we present a novel design based on the agnostic selective encryption concept to efficiently protect the social data based on the embedded block coding with optimized truncation system. By selectively encrypting only a small portion of the bitstreams in the middle layer of this coding system, a high level of protection and efficiency can both be achieved. We also experiment with our method on four common social data formats, and the security analysis tests are performed to verify the high protection level of our method.},

Various mechanisms have been proposed to motivate normal users to participate in sensing tasks or provide high-quality sensing data. However, there exist some conflicts among tasks and participants, which make participant recruitment a challenging issue. For this issue, a conflict-aware participant recruitment (CAPR) mechanism is proposed for mobile crowdsensing, where there may exist task correlations and conflicts. First, two definitions of conflicts are introduced, and then, the participant recruitment problem is formalized. Next, an efficient heuristic algorithm is proposed followed by the payment determination and reputation update of participants. Simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism can effectively improve the platform utility and the average task quality while guaranteeing no conflicts in fulfilling sensing tasks.},

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a novel sensing scenario of cyber-physical-social systems. MCS has been widely adopted in smart cities, personal health care, and environment monitor areas. MCS applications recruit participants to obtain sensory data from the target area by allocating reward to them. Reward mechanisms are crucial in stimulating participants to join and provide sensory data. However, while the MCS applications execute the reward mechanisms, sensory data and personal private information can be in great danger because of malicious task initiators/participants and hackers. This article proposes a novel blockchain-based MCS framework that preserves privacy and secures both the sensing process and the incentive mechanism by leveraging the emergent blockchain technology. Moreover, to provide a fair incentive mechanism, this article has considered an MCS scenario as a sensory data market, where the market separates the participants into two categories: monthly-pay participants and instant-pay participants. By analyzing two different kinds of participants and the task initiator, this article proposes an incentive mechanism aided by a three-stage Stackelberg game. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, the evaluation addresses two aspects: the reward mechanism and the performance of the blockchain-based MCS. The proposed reward mechanism achieves up to a 10% improvement of the task initiator&#39;s utility compared with a traditional Stackelberg game. It can also maintain the required market share for monthly-pay participants while achieving sustainable sensory data provision. The evaluation of the blockchain-based MCS shows that the latency increases in a tolerable manner as the number of participants grows. Finally, this article discusses the future challenges of blockchain-based MCS.},

  abstract     = {The studies on signed networks have received a great attention due to their capabilities on presenting conflicting relationships, which reflect the potential conflicts and tensions of complex systems. To further understand those conflicts and tensions, many methods have been proposed for computing the global structural balance (GSB) of signed networks, which aim to discover the most balanced state of the networks with the least number of unbalanced links. However, most of them request full access to all information (structures, signs, and balance states) of links, which are usually sensitive and private. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving GSB computation (PGSBC) framework, which aims to compute the GSB while preserving the privacy of the networks. The PGSBC first protects the sensitive information (structures, signs, and balance states) of links by using encryption techniques (the homomorphic cryptosystem and the random disturbances) and then computes the GSB of the signed networks on the encrypted structures. In the PGSBC, a balance-aware energy function is adopted to evaluate the balance degree of a clustering, while a fast two-level greedy algorithm (called as HM-Louvain) is presented to discover the most balanced clustering of signed networks. Simulation results on 11 LFR benchmark networks and 10 real signed networks show that the proposed framework can effectively compute the GSB of the networks while preserving the privacy of links’ sensitive information.},

  abstract     = {Community detection is an effective approach to unveil relationships among individuals in online social networks. In the literature, quite a few algorithms have been proposed to conduct community detection by exploiting the topology of social networks and the attributes of social actors. In practice, community detection is usually conducted by third parties, such as advertisement companies and hospitals, with access to social networks for different purposes, which can easily lead to a privacy breach. In this paper, we investigate community detection in social networks aiming to protect the privacy of both the network topology and the users&#39; attributes. We show that with additional prior knowledge, community detection can be performed by querying the information of only a fraction of instead of the entire population. In particular, we first propose a new scheme called differentially private community detection (DPCD). DPCD detects communities in social networks via a probabilistic generative model, which can be decomposed into subproblems solved by individual users. The private social relationships and attributes of each user are protected by objective perturbation with differential privacy guarantees. Then, we propose a parsimonious node affiliation recovery (NAR) algorithm, which is also differentially private, to unveil the community affiliation information of the whole population based on that of the limited number of queried individuals by solving a sparse optimization problem. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation using synthetic and real-world social networks, we demonstrate that the proposed DPCD scheme detects social communities under the modest privacy budget. In addition, we show the effectiveness of NAR to perform community detection by querying a limited number of individuals in social networks.},

  abstract     = {Online social networks (OSNs) have emerged as a major platform for sharing information through social relationships and are one of the major sources of big data. Social networks can even accommodate sharing of live streaming data among the connected users. However, social information on social networks is often locally exploited rather than capturing the changes in the entire network over time. Obtaining user&#39;s influence statistics is limited only in their local vicinity, which may not facilitate capturing the changes in the user and post influences across the entire network, thereby resulting in lower accuracy while measuring user&#39;s topical influence. Moreover, low-influence users always exist in the network publishing low-quality posts. With the objectives of accurately capturing highly influential users and posts, this article proposes a novel dynamic social sensing model, named dynamic PageRank (DPRank) model, to evaluate the dynamic topical influence of the users of social information on social networks during the social information evolution. We deploy our proposed model to real-world Twitter data sets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model against notable existing methods while identifying the true influence of users and posts in a dynamically evolving social network.},

It is a very complicated task to manage and extract useful information from social media platforms. As people are more interested in seeking online health guidance, the medical textual data created by patients, healthcare professionals, and medical staff are expanding fast. In order to address this challenge, an ontology-based approach is used to annotate the medical domain data in this article. We have considered Twitter as our social media platform to filter the medical data from the general category data. In this article, we have used the Open Biomedical Annotator (OBA), which is an ontology-based Web service that annotates raw text with biomedical ontology concepts based on their textual metadata. Domain-specific knowledge is gathered by using MedlinePlus Health Topics and National Drug Data File (NDDF) ontologies licensed under the U. S. National Library of Medicine (UMLS), which will filter out all medical related terms. Furthermore, these medical terms are stored in a medical term database, which will then be forwarded to the UMLS REST Application Programming Interface (API) that provides important entities, such as Concept Unique Identifier (CUIs), semantic relations, attributes, definitions, and much more under the subset of SNOMEDCT_US which is the most precise and comprehensive health terminology platform in the world.},

  abstract     = {In an opinionated long review, there may be several targets described by different potential terms. Traditional review-level techniques for Persian sentiment analysis addressed the problem using a one-method-fits-all solution in which the overall polarity of a review is calculated using all its opinionated words without considering their target. In this article, a new method is proposed, which first decomposes a long review into its constituent sentences and then detects the main target of each sentence. In the next step, five policies, including most occurring first (MOF), most general first (MGF), most specific first (MSF), first occurring first (FOF), and last occurring first (LOF), are proposed to come up with the main target of the review. Finally, using the part-of-speech (POS) tags, potential terms in the sentences are specified and a comprehensive sentiment lexicon is employed to compute the polarity of the sentences. In order to evaluate the proposed method, three data sets of user reviews about different topics, including digital equipment, hotels, and movies, are created as no previous study addressed the problem of target identification in the Persian language. The results of comparing the proposed method with a state-of-the-art lexicon-based method show that specifying the main targets of reviews can improve the performance of the systems about 17% and 12% in terms of accuracy and F1-measure. Moreover, the proposed method using the MGF policy achieves the best performance in finding the main target of reviews, while for finding the ultimate polarity of reviews, the MOF outperforms other policies.},

  abstract     = {Social networks have integrated into the daily lives of most people in the way of interactions and of lifestyles. The users&#39; identity, relationships, or other characteristics can be explored from the social networking data, in order to provide personalized services to the users. In this article, we focus on predicting the user&#39;s emotional intelligence (EI) based on social networking data. As an essential facet of users&#39; psychological characteristics, EI plays an important role on well-being, interpersonal relationships, and overall success in people&#39;s life. Perception of EI contributes to predicting one&#39;s behavior or group behavior. Most existing work on predicting people&#39;s EI is based on questionnaires that may collect dishonest answers or unconscientious responses, thus leading in potentially inaccurate prediction results. In this article, we are motivated to propose EI prediction models based on the sentiment analysis of social networking data. The models are represented by four dimensions, including self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, and social relationships. The EI of a user is then measured by four numerical values or the sum of them. In the experiments, we predict the EIs of over a hundred thousand users based on one of the largest social networks of China, Weibo. The predicting results demonstrate the effectiveness of our models. The results show that the distribution of the four EI&#39;s dimensions of users is roughly normal. The results also indicate that EI scores of females are generally higher than males&#39; EI scores. This is consistent with previous findings. In addition, the four dimensions of EI are correlated. We finally analyze the advantages and the disadvantages of our models in predicting users&#39; EI with social networking data.},

Considering the problem of unfair payment, negative work of participants, and cooperative cheating, how to assess data quality of tasks reliably is an important problem in crowdsensing. Therefore, a lightweight blockchain-based model for data quality assessment is proposed in this article. First, there are two data quality assessment processes in the model. One is implemented in the selection of participants and the other is implemented in data quality assessment. Second, consensus mechanism and smart contracts are redesigned to be suitable for crowdsensing. The lightweight consensus mechanism delegated proof of reputation (DPoR) is proposed in the blockchain-based model instead of proof of work (PoW). Furthermore, three smart contracts, verifiers selection contract (VSC), participants employment contract (PEC), and data verify contract (DVC), are generated to constrain the behaviors of the involved parties. Finally, expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with multiverifiers is proposed to evaluate the performance of task participants. Experiments on the open data sets Wine Quality show that our new method outperforms the existing methods in improving the quality of sensing task.},

  abstract     = {Mobile instant messaging (MIM) systems have provided very convenient ways for communication and information exchange in recent years. Interesting features of these applications have made them important platforms for spreading information, idea, behavior, and rumor. In contrast to traditional social networks, communication in MIM applications is not necessarily based on friendship relations. In group-based communication and broadcasting in channels that are prominent features of MIM systems, users may send messages to and receive messages from people with whom do not already have friendly relations. This kind of communication leads to the creation of special network in which not only users and their contact lists but also groups and channels are involved. Existing complex network models are not sufficiently expressive to represent this kind of communication network. In this article, we introduce the concept of social communication network (SCN) to be able to consider special structural properties of communications in MIM systems and propose a model for representing and generating the SCN in MIM systems. The proposed model covers all social communications between users, groups, and channels and exhibits the statistics observed in real-world data. We also redefine some existing properties and introduce some new properties of the MIM network that earlier models of complex networks do not capture. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct a number of simulation experiments on the model and compare the results with a real-world graph that we have extracted from Telegram. The results show that SCN derived by the model is highly compatible with the real-world graph. The proposed model provides a useful basis for analysis and evaluation of MIM network properties.},

We first quantitatively define convex edges using hidden geometry space defined by Ricci curvature and show these to be capable of predicting highly interacted edges in social networks. From empirical studies of social networks, we find that convex edges often occur on two connected nodes with similar popularity and allow for frenemy (or versatile node) identification, and that almost all nodes maintain an upper bound of convex edges. These findings present further evidence of the limited attention in an attention economy from a different perspective. Using three well-known synthetic networks, we show that convex edges can reflect the formation of a network from scatter (concave) to aggregation (convex). Taken together, our results show that convex edges are a novel mechanism to investigate social networks from different disciplines and offer insights into many network phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Although most game theory models assume that payoff matrices are provided as input, getting payoff matrices in strategic games (e.g., corporate negotiations and counter-terrorism operations) has proven difficult. To tackle this challenge, we propose a payoff inference engine (PIE) that finds payoffs assuming that players in a game follow a myopic best response or a regret minimization heuristic. This assumption yields a set of constraints (possibly nonlinear) on the payoffs with a multiplicity of solutions. PIE finds payoffs by considering solutions of these constraints and their variants via three heuristics. First, we approximately compute a centroid of the resulting polytope of the constraints. Second, we use a soft constraint approach that allows violation of constraints by penalizing violations in the objective function. Third, we develop a novel approach to payoff inference based on support vector machines (SVMs). Unlike past work on payoff inference, PIE has the following advantages. PIE supports reasoning about multiplayer games, not just one or two players, it can use short histories, not long ones which may not be available in many real-world situations, it does not require all players to be fully rational, and it is one to two orders of magnitude more scalable than past work. We run experiments on a synthetic data set where we generate payoff functions for the players and see how well our algorithms can learn them, a real-world coarse-grained counter-terrorism data set about a set of different terrorist groups, and a real-world fine-grained data set about a specific terrorist group. As the ground truth about payoffs for the terrorist groups cannot be tested directly, we test PIE by using the payoffs to make predictions about the actions of the groups and corresponding governments (even though this is not the purpose of this article). We show that compared with recent work on payoff inference, PIE has both higher accuracy and much shorter runtime.},

  abstract     = {In industry, the method of hypothesis acceptance based on available information is widely used in applications such as system modeling. Xie and Pham modeled the reliability of weighted threshold voting systems with a general recursive reliability function in human organization systems. As an extended study, we introduce a generalized weighted indecisive-voting n-unit system using a new decision rule consisting both a threshold parameter τ and a new indecisive parameter θ. In general, indecision happens due to limited information, and an indecisive parameter is then applied if no decision is made. System reliability R is calculated to show the system performance. Main results imply a strong dependence of system performance on decision rule and large potential of model adjustment via parameter initialization. The contribution of this article is that we introduce the indecisive effect to make the model more adjustable for specific needs.},

  abstract     = {Open social network (OSN) plays a more significant role in information propagation through the rapid developing of information technology. Since information diffusion is an essential process happens in OSN, it has been studied in many studies. Several models have been proposed to infer the diffusion process and reproduce diffusion network. However, these methods have two critical problems: 1) ignoring the effects of user social characteristics and 2) inaccuracy resulted from calculating the influence of different features independently. To address these limitations, a diffusion inferring method based on a recommender system (DIM-SPTF) was proposed. The DIM-SPTF method considers the propagation process between the users as the recommendation process of information and employs a recommender system to infer the propagation relationship. Through determining the propagation relations among all users in the observed topic data set, an information diffusion network can be finally obtained. Experimental results show that DIM-SPTF leads to improvements in performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Users acting as real-time sensors post information about current events on various social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and so on. This generates a huge amount of data requiring significant effort to process and filter it to detect events/topics. It becomes more challenging when data are generated as a tweet stream because of its speed, presence of noise, slangs, phrases, abbreviations, and so on. In recent years, many approaches have been proposed either for detecting small- or large-scale events, individually. There is a lack of a complete solution that provides analysis from different perspectives. We propose a novel approach Mythos that detects events, subevents within an event, and generates abstract summary and storyline to provide different perspectives for an event. There are three modules in Mythos. Online incremental clustering algorithm identifies small-scale events in the form of small clusters, the event hierarchy generator generates bigger events in the form of hierarchies, and the summarization module produces summary of events/subevents. The summarization module uses a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based learning model to generate summaries at different levels-from the most abstracted to the most detailed. The summaries at different levels are used to generate a storyline for the event. Our experimental analysis on a variety of twitter data sets from different domains compares Mythos against the known existing approaches for event detection and summarization. It outperforms baseline approaches for both. The generated summaries are evaluated against summaries provided by external reference sources like Guardian and Wikipedia.},
