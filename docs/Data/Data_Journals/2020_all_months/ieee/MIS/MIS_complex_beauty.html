  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a nonlinear model based on hidden-layer neural networks and local Gaussian process regression. The hidden-layer neural networks have short training time, whereas the local Gaussian process regression is more suitable for nonlinearity. According to the abovementioned advantages of hidden-layer neural network and local Gaussian process regression, we get the measurement learning model and global process learning model offline and local process learning model online. Then, the proposed learning-based models have been applied to extended Kalman filter-simultaneous localization and mapping (EKF-SLAM), Rao-Blackwellised particle filter formulation of simultaneous localisation and mapping (FastSLAM), and unscented Kalman filter--simultaneous localization and mapping (UKF-SLAM) for autonomous underwater vehicles position tracking with field experiments. Compared with the conventional process and measurement models, improved position tracking performance can be achieved without cumbersome system analysis nor identification, benefiting from the proposed model. Experiments in more than 3883-m run show that the root-mean-square error has been improved by 36.95%, 37.14%, and 27.65% in EKF-SLAM, FastSLAM, and UKF-SLAM frameworks, respectively.},

In this article, a parallel URTS system for passenger emergency management is presented based on artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) approach. The agent-based modeling technology is applied to build the artificial URTS system, which contains the models of personal, trains, facilities, events, environments, and center control and decision unit. The computational experiments are performed on the artificial system to analyze and evaluate emergency management strategies. The mechanism of parallel execution between the actual system and artificial system is presented to manage and optimize the emergency strategy, which is capable of guiding the actual URTS system through real-time online supervision and adjustment and providing an active rather than a traditionally passive optimization of passenger emergency management. The ACP-based parallel URTS system provides a novel approach to formulation, evaluation, and optimization of passenger emergency management strategies for URTS.},

An attacker exploits a vulnerability by crafting input that causes the program to behave incorrectly. Such an input is called an exploit. This article deals with diagnosing exploits, i.e., given an exploit, the task is to return the vulnerability that allowed it. We show that existing software diagnosis algorithms are ill-suited for this problem, and introduce two novel techniques for adapting them to this problem. This includes manipulating an automated testing tool to generate additional inputs that are similar to the given exploit, and tracing below the desired granularity level to improve diagnostic accuracy. Experimental evaluation on real exploits from four open-source projects shows that our algorithm significantly reduces diagnostic efforts.},

Intelligence, in fact, is much more than just IQ: it comprises many other kinds of intelligence, including physical intelligence, cultural intelligence, linguistic intelligence, and emotional intelligence (EQ). While traditional classification tasks and standard phenomena in computer science are easy to define, however, emotions are still a rather mysterious subject of study. That is why so many different emotion classifications have been proposed in the literature and there is still no common agreement on a universal emotion categorization model. In this article, we revisit the Hourglass of Emotions, an emotion categorization model optimized for polarity detection, based on some recent empirical evidence in the context of sentiment analysis. This new model does not claim to offer the ultimate emotion categorization but it proves the most effective for the task of sentiment analysis.},

  abstract     = {Cold-start has being a critical issue in recommender systems with the explosion of data in e-commerce. Most existing studies proposed to alleviate the cold-start problem are also known as hybrid recommender systems that learn representations of users and items by combining user-item interactive and user/item content information. However, previous hybrid methods regularly suffered poor efficiency bottlenecking in online recommendations with large-scale items, because they were designed to project users and items into continuous latent space where the online recommendation is expensive. To this end, we propose a collaborative generated hashing (CGH) framework to improve the efficiency by denoting users and items as binary codes, then fast hashing search techniques can be used to speed up the online recommendation. In addition, the proposed CGH can generate potential users or items for marketing application where the generative network is designed with the principle of minimum description length, which is used to learn compact and informative binary codes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the advantages for recommendations in various settings over competing baselines and analyze its feasibility in marketing application.},

  abstract     = {Discrete matrix factorization (DMF) has been a promising solution to improve the inferring efficiency of matrix factorization (MF) against the rapidly growing numbers of users and items. However, DMF suffers from a serious encoding loss due to its oversimplified modeling on the original data geometry. In this article, we propose a semi-discrete matrix factorization (SDMF) model to combine the predicting efficacy of MF with the inferring efficiency of DMF. It first learns real-valued latent features by MF, and then, taking them as group-wise and point-wise smoothness, learns binary codes in the DMF framework, for preserving the geometrical structures collectively hidden in users and items, as well as aligning binary codes originated from Hamming space with their real-valued counterparts learned from vector space. Particularly, we devise a computationally efficient optimization algorithm to estimate model parameters. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of our SDMF model over state-of-the-art hash-based recommendation methods.},

  abstract     = {Online recommendation is an important feature in many applications. In practice, the interaction between the users and the recommender system might be sparse, i.e., the users are not always interacting with the recommender system. For example, some users prefer to sweep around the recommendation instead of clicking into the details. Therefore, a response of zero may not necessarily be a negative response, but a nonresponse. It comes worse to distinguish these two situations when only one item is recommended to the user each time and few further information is reachable. Most existing recommendation strategies ignore the difference between nonresponses and negative responses. In this article, we propose a novel approach to make online recommendations via sparse interactions. We design a contextual bandit algorithm, named hSAOR, for online recommendation. Our method makes probabilistic estimations on whether the user is interacting or not, by reasonably assuming that similar items are similarly attractive. It uses positive and negative responses to build the user preference model, ignoring all nonresponses. Theoretical analyses and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.},

However, as these approaches either defer the user-item interactions until the prediction layer or simply concatenate all the reviews of a user/item into a single review, they fail to capture the complex correlations between each user-item pair or introduce noises. Thus, we propose a novel Hierarchical and Interactive Gate Network (HIGnet) model for rating prediction. Modeling local word informativeness and global review semantics in a hierarchical manner enable us to exploit textual features of users/items and capture complex semantic user-item correlations at different levels of granularities. Experiments on five challenging real-world datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed HIGnet model. To facilitate community research, the implementation of the proposed model is made publicly available (https://github.com/uqjwen/higan).},

The state-of-the-art algorithm hypothesizes that unknown items are weakly rated and sets an explicit prior to unknown ratings. However, the prior assuming unknown ratings be close to zero may be questionable and it is challenging to set appropriate prior ratings for unknown items. In this article, to avert the use of prior ratings, we propose a ranking-based prior by hypothesizing that each user&#39;s unknown ratings are close to each other. This prior essentially acts as a regularizer to penalize the discrepancy of predicted ratings between any two unknown items. With the ranking-based prior, we design a generic collaborative filtering framework for explicit feedback and develop an efficient optimization algorithm for parameter learning. We finally evaluate the proposed algorithms on four real-world rating datasets. The results show that the proposed algorithms consistently outperform the state-of-the-art baselines and that the ranking-based prior leads to superior recommendation accuracy.},

One challenging in POI recommendation is to effectively exploit geographical information since users usually care about the physical distance to the recommended POIs. Though spatial relevance has been widely considered in recent recommendation methods, it is modeled only from the POI perspective, failing to capture user personalized preference to spatial distance. Moreover, these methods suffer from a diversity-deficiency problem since they are often based on collaborative filtering which always favors popular POIs. To overcome these problems, we propose in this article a personalized geographical influence modeling method called PGIM, which jointly learns users’ geographical preference and diversity preference for POI recommendation. Specifically, we model geographical preference from three aspects: user global tolerance, user local tolerance, and spatial distance. We also extract user diversity preference from interactions among users for diversity-promoting recommendation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of PGIM.},

And indeed, this type of situation is by far the most commonly studied scenario in game theory. But sometimes in the real world, we are not a player within a game–– we are the designer of the game. This situation is increasingly common in computing and AI. For example, if you build an online marketplace like eBay, then you are creating a system in which self-interested agents will interact according to the rules that you create.

The textual memory module in our model treats the textual representation as memory vectors, and uses attention mechanism to embody the important parts. For commonsense knowledge memory module, we jointly leverage the entity and relation embeddings learned by TransE model to take full advantage of constraints of the knowledge graph.

  abstract     = {Traditional distributed deep reinforcement learning (RL) commonly relies on exchanging the experience replay memory (RM) of each agent. Since the RM contains all state observations and action policy history, it may incur huge communication overhead while violating the privacy of each agent. Alternatively, this article presents a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving distributed RL framework, coined federated reinforcement distillation (FRD). In FRD, each agent exchanges its proxy experience RM (ProxRM), in which policies are locally averaged with respect to proxy states clustering actual states. To provide FRD design insights, we present ablation studies on the impact of ProxRM structures, neural network architectures, and communication intervals. Furthermore, we propose an improved version of FRD, coined mixup augmented FRD (MixFRD), in which ProxRM is interpolated using the mixup data augmentation algorithm. Simulations in a Cartpole environment validate the effectiveness of MixFRD in reducing the variance of mission completion time and communication cost, compared to the benchmark schemes, vanilla FRD, federated RL (FRL), and policy distillation.},

Smart healthcare achieves great success by training machine learning models on a large quantity of user personal data. However, there are two critical challenges. First, user data often exist in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Second, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this article, we propose FedHealth, the first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated learning, and then builds relatively personalized models by transfer learning. Wearable activity recognition experiments and real Parkinson&#39;s disease auxiliary diagnosis application have evaluated that FedHealth is able to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security. FedHealth is general and extensible in many healthcare applications.},

However, in reality, data are mostly scattered across different organizations and cannot be easily integrated due to many legal and practical constraints. To address this important challenge in the field of machine learning, we introduce a new technique and framework, known as federated transfer learning (FTL), to improve statistical modeling under a data federation. FTL allows knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy and enables complementary knowledge to be transferred across domains in a data federation, thereby enabling a target-domain party to build flexible and effective models by leveraging rich labels from a source domain. This framework requires minimal modifications to the existing model structure and provides the same level of accuracy as the nonprivacy-preserving transfer learning. It is flexible and can be effectively adapted to various secure multiparty machine learning tasks.},

However, FL participants need to incur some cost for contributing to the FL models. The training and commercialization of the models will take time. Thus, there will be delays before the federation could pay back the participants. This temporary mismatch between contributions and rewards has not been accounted for by existing payoff-sharing schemes. To address this limitation, we propose the FL incentivizer (FLI). It dynamically divides a given budget in a context-aware manner among data owners in a federation by jointly maximizing the collective utility while minimizing the inequality among the data owners, in terms of the payoff received and the waiting time for receiving payoffs. Comparisons with five state-of-the-art payoff-sharing schemes show that FLI attracts high-quality data owners and achieves the highest expected revenue for a federation.},

As federated learning (FL) could solve the problems from data security and privacy-issue, it starts to be applied in many different applied machine learning tasks. However, FL does not verify the quality of the data from different parties in the system. Hence, the low-quality datasets with fewer common entities can be cotrained with others. This could result in a huge amount of computing-resources waste, and the attack on the FL model from malicious clients as federal members. To solve this problem, this article proposes a secure member selection strategy (SMSS), which can evaluate the data qualities of members before training. With SMSS, only datasets share more common entities than a certain threshold can be selected for learning, whereas malicious clients with fewer common objects cannot acquire any information about the model. This article implements SMSS, and evaluate its performance via several extensive experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that SMSS is safe, efficient, and effective.},

However, due to issues such as privacy security and industry or area competition, the integration of isolated test results may face large unimaginable difficulty in information security and encrypted model training. To address this, we derive the federated multiplicative update (FMU) algorithm with boundary constraints to solve the nonnegative matrix factorization based joint intelligence ranking. The encrypted learning process is developed to alternate original computation steps in multiplicative update algorithms. Owning feasible property for the fast convergence and secure exchange of variables, the proposed framework outperforms the previous work on both real and simulated data. Further experimental analysis reveals that the introduced federated mechanism does not harm the overall time efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The growing number of mobile and IoT devices has nourished many intelligent applications. In order to produce high-quality machine learning models, they constantly access and collect rich personal data such as photos, browsing history, and text messages. However, direct access to personal data has raised increasing public concerns about privacy risks and security breaches. To address these concerns, there are two emerging solutions to privacy-preserving machine learning, namely local differential privacy and federated machine learning. The former is a distributed data collection strategy where each client perturbs data locally before submitting to the server, whereas the latter is a distributed machine learning strategy to train models on mobile devices locally and merge their output (e.g., parameter updates of a model) through a control protocol. In this article, we conduct a comparative study on the efficiency and privacy of both solutions. Our results show that in a standard population and domain setting, both can achieve an optimal misclassification rate lower than 20% and federated machine learning generally performs better at the cost of higher client CPU usage. Nonetheless, local differential privacy can benefit more from a larger client population ($&gt;$&gt; 1k). As for privacy guarantee, local differential privacy also has flexible control over the data leakage.},

It is an important topic in sentiment analysis, as the study of sentiment-related quantities and trends across a population is often of higher interest than the analysis of individual instances. In this article, we propose a method for cross-lingual sentiment quantification, the task of performing sentiment quantification when training documents are available for a source language $\mathcal {S}$S, but not for the target language $\mathcal {T}$T, for which sentiment quantification needs to be performed. Cross-lingual sentiment quantification (and cross-lingual text quantification in general) has never been discussed before in the literature; we establish baseline results for the binary case by combining state-of-the-art quantification methods with methods capable of generating cross-lingual vectorial representations of the source and target documents involved. Experiments on publicly available datasets for cross-lingual sentiment classification show that the presented method performs cross-lingual sentiment quantification with high accuracy.},

Because of high dimensionality, mixed attributes, different importance, and different generation time of information, P2P lending data often leads to the mining results unable to reflect the important borrower characteristics that affect the approval results and the approval loan amount. In this article, we are the first to propose the attributes partition of lending data considering the business process to classify variables into different types. Furthermore, we propose a multiangle data mining method for lending data by attributes partition considering the business process to discover the characteristics of P2P borrowers from multiple perspectives. Experimental results on the real dataset demonstrate that the method depicts the important characteristics of borrowers that affect the approval results and the loan amount, makes the research on P2P borrower characteristics more comprehensive and specific, and provides new ideas for the research on high-dimensional lending data.},

  abstract     = {The goal of this article is to investigate the roles of individual behavior characteristics and Internet finance industry risk in the light of bank run theory for P2P. We know that risk evaluation is clearly important for peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms in China, as during the last two years, the industry has experienced thousands of platform crashes. Traditional approaches to evaluate enterprise risk are increasingly ineffective in this industry, due to the difficulty of assessing the real information. In addition, the Internet business model makes it possible to record new kinds of information. By applying a data-driven analytics method, we build an intelligent risk evaluation model for P2P platforms that have comparable targeting platforms. The case study shows that our risk evaluation method can generate early warning signals regarding platform or industry risk, which is able to provide effective supporting for P2P business in practice.},

Moreover, we explore the dynamic influencing mechanism of different types of information through information usage frequency in the learning process. In particular, we find that the jump component of oil realized volatility is efficient only in bull market, and currency information contributes most rather than oil information in bear market.

However, most prior methods have neglected the contribution of each sample to the integral measure when adaptively matching either marginal distribution, conditional distribution, or both between domains. In this article, an improved algorithm based on mean discrepancy embedding with structural similarity is proposed, which aims at the contribution of each sample to the integral measure on the performance of target domain learning model by using labeled source samples and unlabeled target samples. The discrepancy between both marginal and conditional distribution are minimized with dimensionality reduction procedure to feature extraction with structural similarity weights for all samples from the source and target domains.

Then, the BFSDA introduces and improves the blockchain-based fair and secure multiparty computation protocol (BFSMPC) to ensure fairness while increasing the success rate of secret recovery. In addition, BFSDA uses a fairer and more efficient protocol for secure two-party comparing to obtain the final marketing clearing price. The schema analysis result of BFSDA shows that: first, the private input data will not be revealed as long as data owner is not compromised, second, honest participants can get the result or economic compensation, and third, participants only need to pay the deposit once and a large amount of complicated verification operations are carried out off the chain, which ensures the efficiency of the protocol.},

The example shows that the counter-example path given by the contract model is accord with our expected results based on code analysis, proving the correctness of the solution.

In this study, we propose a coupled system subjected to the ratchet utility potential, to mimic the cooperative growth mechanism of the SMEs with strategic and nonstrategic partners under the tech-economic paradigm. By decoupling the system, we approximately obtain the average probability current to measure the mesoscopic performance in terms of growth ability and cooperation efficiency. Further, we systematically study the performance dependence on system parameters, and discuss the sensitivity to parameter changes. The results provide the latent support for regulating the growth behaviors, and further leads us to create useful decision rules in the SME management practices.},

Such decision making in game theory is distinguished from conventional optimization problems by the fact that the consequences of an individual’s decision will depend not just on their choice, but on the choices made by others. This motivates the development of solution concepts for the game theory, of which Nash equilibrium is the best-known. These solution concepts attempt to characterize how rational agents would make choices in such situations. But there is another way of thinking about games, as follows. Suppose, instead of being a player within the game, you were a benevolent omniscient external entity, who was able to simply choose the outcome for the game.},

However, at present, most of the study is still at the level of using macrolevel qualitative analysis, and lack of quantitative analysis and evaluation system for the effectiveness of policy implementation. The goal of this article is to discuss the utility evaluation system of public management policy from the perspective of social computing. First, based on the data obtained through questionnaire survey, we obtain indicators of the survey data by using factor analysis, and a new BDI (belief–desire–intention) model is created based on the observation indicators, and then the simulation platform is constructed; then, a brand new quantitative analysis method for policy optimization is proposed by using modified logistic functions as a tool. As application, we conducted the case study for the “Targeted poverty alleviation policy in Yulin region” (Guangxi, China), in which the key indicators for the poverty were established, and then the policy optimization suggestions were given based on the results of simulation experiments. This case study has Chinese characteristics, which might be applied to the poverty alleviation work globally.},

  abstract     = {In this article, inspired by the state-of-the-art research progress of the fractional-order memristor, a fractional-order memristive prediction model of the trading price of future is attempted to be proposed, which can feasibly predict the variation trend of the following unknown trading price data only depending on a small sampling of the given ones in a previous short time. At first, the analogy analysis of the relationship between an actual system of future trading and a physical memristive system of charge transfer is achieved. Second, the achievement of a corresponding capacitive string scaling fracmemristor (LCSF) is mathematically derived and analyzed in detail. Third, a 5-years data from 2015 to 2019 of the 300 exchange traded fund open-end index securities investment fund of Shanghai Stock Exchange is selected to verify the multiscale prediction ability of trading price of future of the LCSF. The theoretical contribution of this article is the first application of the fractional-order memristive electronic system to feasibly achieve an intelligent prediction model of the financial technology.},

This study develops a new deep coupled long short-term memory (LSTM) approach, namely, DC-LSTM, to capture the complex couplings for USD/CNY exchange rate forecasting. In this approach, a deep structure consisting of stacked LSTMs is built to model the complex couplings. The experimental results with 10 years data indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms seven other benchmarks. The DC-LSTM is verified to be a useful tool to make wise investment decisions through a profitability discussion. The purpose in this article is to clarify the importance of coupling learning for exchange rate forecasting, and the usefulness of deep coupled model to capture the couplings.},

  abstract     = {Modern applications of FinTech are challenged by enormous volumes of financial data. One way to handle these is to adopt a streaming setting where data are only available to the algorithms during a very short time. When a new data point (financial transaction) is generated, it needs to be processed directly, and be forgotten immediately after. Especially, ongoing globalization efforts in FinTech require modern methods of fault detection to be able to work efficiently through more than 10 000 financial transactions per second if they are to be deployed as a first line of defence. This article investigates two algorithms able to perform well in this demanding setting: $K$K-means and FADO. Especially, this article provides supports for the claim that “the use of multiple clusters does not necessarily translate into increased detection performance.” To support this claim, results are reported when operating in a quasi-realistic case study of Anti Money Laundering (AML) detection in real-time payment systems. We focus on two prototypical algorithms: the passive aggressive FADO assuming a single cluster, and the well-known $K$K-means algorithm working with $K&gt;1$K&gt;1 clusters. We find—in this case—that the use of $K$K-means with multiple clusters is unfavorable as 1) both tuning for $K$K, as well as the need for additional complexity in the $K$K-means algorithm challenges the computational constraints; 2) $K$K-means introduces necessarily added variability (unreliability) in the results; 3) it requires dimensionality reduction, compromising interpretability of the detections; 4) the prevalence of singleton clusters adds unreliability to the outcome. This makes in the presented case FADO favorable over K-means (with $K&gt;1$K&gt;1).},

  abstract     = {In financial trading, trading at key time points (i.e., the best times for buying or selling in specific contexts) is one of the most effective trading methods. Since key points are random and sparse, their randomness needs to be investigated to predict key points reliably. Based on measure theory, we propose an event mapping model to formally define this randomness and express it in a low dimensional and normalized space $\mathcal {Q}$Q through mapping functions. Interestingly, when mapping functions are monotonic, the probability of a key event can be approximated by those of nested random events in $\mathcal {Q}$Q. Based on this finding, we designed a long short-term memory based neural network to learn the mapping functions and derived an asymptotic statistical learning (ASL) algorithm. ASL automatically analyzes the convergence of random events in space $\mathcal {Q}$Q and makes point estimates on key events in trading. Compared with 12 existing algorithms on six real datasets from NYSE, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, cryptocurrency markets, etc., the algorithm ASL reliably predicts sparse key events from many random events, which provides a method to deal with the imbalance classification problem in predicting key events in trading. ASL significantly outperforms other algorithms under different market situations in both bull and bear markets.},

One of popular meta learning methodologies is based on cross validation, especially for selection processes among different machine learning models. However, the challenge is that it is very time-consuming to do cross validation among models in large data sets, especially in financial big data with high noise. This article proposes two asymptotic meta learning algorithms (AML-Lin and AML-Xiang), which are ordinal optimization algorithms for meta learning based on cross validation. The numerical experiments and real-world cases are conducted to illustrate its efficiency in cross validation of models in different scenarios, especially for financial data. The method proposed in this article has significant improvement by comparing with those ones in existing algorithms OCBA and IAML (e.g., see the work done by Chen et al. and Lin et al.),8 ,9 and it is new in dealing with financial data.},

Because there are many abnormal users in these data, they are “real but false data” for personal credit evaluation. In order to better carry out personal credit scoring, we propose three criteria, power exponents of time interval distribution of individual user $\gamma _i$γi, user activity $A_i$Ai, and the ratio of out-degree and in-degree $R_i$Ri of user $i$i, which are used to systematically clean the data. And then, we used the logistic regression method to score the individual credits of users before and after data cleaning, and found that the rank order of personal credit scoring has changed significantly. This change is largely attributed to the changes of network structure after data cleaning. We believe that our work is very important to use the social media data to establish a credible personal credit evaluation system to reduce the credit risk of the current Internet financial industry.},

Then, we follow long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which are made bidirectional. The best performing model is hierarchical, such that it can take advantage of the natural taxonomy within classes. The main experiments are a comparison between these methods on an open sourced academic dataset. In the first experiment, we consider the full dataset. We also consider the given subsets of data separately, in order to compare our results with state-of-the-art vendor solutions. In general we find that the SVM models outperform the LSTM models. The former models achieve the highest macro-F1 for the full dataset, and in most of the individual datasets.

Because it makes the assumption that the input sentence has a flattened structure, it often fails to recognize nested named entities. In our previous work, a boundary assembling (BA) model was proposed. It is a cascading framework, which identifies named entity boundaries first, and then assembles them into entity candidates for further assessment. This model is effective to recognize nested named entities, but still suffers from poor performance caused by the sparse feature problem. In this article, the BA model is remodeled with the advancement of neural networks, which enables the model to capture semantic information of a sentence by using word embeddings pretrained in external resources. In our experiments, it shows an impressive improvement on the final performance, outperforming the state of the art more than 17% in F-score.},

  abstract     = {This research proposes a novel methodology for adaptive learning in electricity markets negotiations, based on the principles of the determinism theory. The determinism theory states that all events are predetermined due to the cause-effect rule. At the same time, it is unmanageable to consider all causes to a certain effect, making it impossible to predict future events. However, in a controlled simulation environment, it is possible to access and analyze all involved variables; thus, making the application of this theory promising in such environments. This research applies the principles of the determinism theory to a new learning methodology, which optimizes players’ actions, considering the predicted behavior of all involved players, with the objective of maximizing market gains. A case-based reasoning approach is used, providing adaptive context-aware decision support. Results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve better market results than all reference market strategies.},

Situational awareness systems are based on safe big data, and they are environmentally, dynamically, and holistically aware of security. A comprehensive system of risk capabilities. Therefore, this article uses the situational awareness system to study the rescue problem of mine fires, in order to reduce the casualties and economic losses caused by mine fires. On this basis, the convolutional neural network algorithm is used for situational awareness. By optimizing the algorithm, from region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) model to fast R-CNN model, the optimal model of faster R-CNN is finally proposed and implemented.

  abstract     = {The demand for automatic scene change detection has massively increased in the last decades due to its importance regarding safety and security issues. Although deep learning techniques have provided significant enhancements in the field, such methods must learn which object belongs to the foreground or background beforehand. In this article, we propose an approach that employs siamese U-Nets to address the task of change detection, such that the model learns to perform semantic segmentation using background reference frames only. Therefore, any object that comes up into the scene defines a change. The experimental results show the robustness of the proposed model over the well-known public dataset CDNet2014. Additionally, we also consider a private dataset called “PetrobrasROUTES,” which comprises obstruction or abandoned objects in escape routes in hazardous environments. Moreover, the experiments show that the proposed approach is more robust to noise and illumination changes.},

First, this article introduced the structure of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) model. Then, it analyzed the structure and function of battlefield situational awareness system, and concluded that: in the whole situational awareness system, the discovery, category, and location analysis of situational elements, namely object target, is the foundation and key to realize the function. On this basis, this article establishes a battlefield situational awareness model based on the YOLO model. Finally, five common objects on the battlefield (helicopter gunship, missile, tank, soldier and gun) are classified and located, respectively. The YOLO model based on CNN is used to process the input image, and then the position, category, and corresponding confidence probability of all objects in the image are obtained directly, which realizes end-to-end learning, greatly improves the speed of target detection, and lays a foundation for assessing the battlefield situation.},

Analyzing IoT data through machine learning techniques requires the use of mathematical algorithms, computational techniques, and an accurate tuning of the input parameters. In this article, we present a study of unsupervised learning techniques applied on IoT data to support decision-making processes inside intelligent environments. To assess the proposed approach, we discuss two case studies in which behavioral IoT data have been collected, also in a noninvasive way, in order to achieve an unsupervised classification that can be adopted during a decision-making process. The use of unsupervised learning techniques is acquiring a key role to complement the more traditional services with new decision-making ones supporting the needs of companies, stakeholders, and consumers.},

  abstract     = {In decision-making problem, fuzzy system is considered as an effective tool with access to uncertain information by fuzzy representations. Evolutionary fuzzy systems have been developed with the appearance of intuitionistic fuzzy, hesitant fuzzy, neutrosophic representations, etc. Moreover, by capturing compound features and convey multifaceted information, complex numbers are utilized to generalize fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy sets. However, the order relations established in these existing systems have certain limitations, such as they are not total order relations or they are defined based on intermediate functions, hence it is difficult to use in building and ensuring important properties of logical operators and distance measures in the systems. In this article, a representation of the intuitionistic fuzzy systems based on complex numbers (IFS-C) in the polar form by a new way is proposed to overcome the above restrictions. Specifically, an intuitionistic fuzzy set is characterized by the two functions of modulus and argument. A new order relation, set-theoretic operations, and a new distance measure by the polar form of IFS-C are defined and investigated. The applicability of the proposal is illustrated by a new decision-making model called P-distance measure. It is tested on the benchmark medical datasets in comparison with the existing methods. The experiments confirm the advantages of the proposal.},

The objective of the HCI is to make the computer smart via receiving enough knowledge about the environment where it is deployed and reduce the human intervention aspect toward decision making. This enables development of high-end computers that are context aware and smart in making decisions with reference to the context.
