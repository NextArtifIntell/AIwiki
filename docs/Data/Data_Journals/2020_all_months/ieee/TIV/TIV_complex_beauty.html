  abstract     = {As a good example of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), Advisory Speed Assistance (ASA) helps improve driving safety and possibly energy efficiency by showing advisory speed to the driver of an intelligent vehicle. However, driver-based speed tracking errors often emerge, due to the perception and reaction delay, as well as imperfect vehicle control, degrading the effectiveness of ASA system. In this study, we propose a learning-based approach to modeling driver behavior, aiming to predict and compensate for the speed tracking errors in real time. Subject drivers are first classified into different types according to their driving behaviors using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. A nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network is then adopted to predict the speed tracking errors generated by each driver. A specific traffic scenario has been created in a Unity game engine-based driving simulator platform, where ASA system provides advisory driving speed to the driver via a head-up display (HUD). A human-in-the-loop simulation study is conducted by 17 volunteer drivers, revealing a 53% reduction in the speed error variance and a 3% reduction in the energy consumption with the compensation of the speed tracking errors. The results are further validated by a field implementation with a real passenger vehicle.},

Such predictions can improve driving safety by alerting the driver to the danger of unsafe or risky traffic situations. In this research, we developed a model to predict driver maneuvers, including left/right lane changes, left/right turns and driving straight forward 3.6 seconds on average before they occur in real time. For this, we propose a deep learning method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which utilizes data on the driver&#39;s gaze and head position as well as vehicle dynamics data. We applied our approach on real data collected during drives in an urban environment in an instrumented vehicle. In comparison with previous IOHMM techniques that predicted three maneuvers including left/right turns and driving straight, our prediction model is able to anticipate two more maneuvers. In addition to this, our experimental results show that our model using identical dataset improved F1 score by 4% and increased to 84%.},

This paper overviews several models and methods for generating, through simulation, GPS, IMU, and lidar data.

First, cellular pseudoranges are characterized from an extensive wardriving campaign collected with a ground vehicle in different environments: open sky, urban, and deep urban. Then, a framework is developed, which accounts for outliers due to line-of-sight blockage and short multipath delays. These outliers induce biases in cellular pseudoranges and compromise the integrity of the navigation solution. Experimental results are presented evaluating the efficacy of the proposed framework on a ground vehicle navigating in the absence of GNSS signals. The results demonstrate the proposed framework detecting and excluding outliers, reducing the position root mean squared error (RMSE) by 41.5% and the maximum position error by 43.1%.},

Learning-based approaches are usually black-box systems which are difficult to interpret/verify. We propose a real-time continuous safety checking system which monitors the validity of the mapping from the sensor input to the actuator command (i.e., controller-focused anomaly detection) and from the actuator command to the sensor input (i.e., system-focused anomaly detection). Our controller-focused anomaly monitor is an image conditioned energy based generative adversarial network in which the discriminator acts as an energy function attributing low energies to proper actuator commands and high energy to anomalous actuator commands. Our system-focused anomaly monitor is based on an action condition video prediction framework, which finds the action conditioned future frame most similar to the actual future frame and compares it with the true action to detect anomaly. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for an autonomous navigation system in indoor (on datasets from our ground vehicle) and outdoor environments (on Udacity dataset). Furthermore, we show through experimental evaluations that our proposed framework is resilient to various data corruptions common in a vision based system.},

Also, many control systems do not take the road characteristics into account, despite being an important contributor to a vehicle&#39;s dynamics. This work presents a predictive vehicle controller to help prevent roadside departures during cornering that incorporates the road&#39;s geometry and roughness to estimate the vehicle&#39;s safe operating speed. An Optimized Speed Profile generates a speed trajectory to allow the vehicle to successfully navigate the corner while preserving ride quality. Simulation results demonstrate cases in which vehicles equipped with ESC would depart from the road while the proposed system does not. Simulations demonstrate that road roughness effects account for up to 10% of the velocity changes in the maximum allowable cornering speed; simulations based on a real-world highway off-ramp measurement demonstrate that the proposed control system is capable of lane-keeping while maintaining stability.},

Its main contribution is to improve the infrared maritime target detection accuracy in different backgrounds, for various targets, using multiple infrared wave bands. The accuracy and the computational time of traditional infrared maritime searching systems are improved by our proposed Local Peak Singularity Measurement (LPSM)-Based Image Enhancement and Grayscale Distribution Curve Shift Binarization (GDCSB)-Based Target Segmentation. The first part uses LPSM to quantize the local singularity of each peak. Additionally, an enhancement map (EM) is generated based on the quantitative local singularity. After multiplying the original image by the EM, targets can be enhanced and the background will be suppressed. The second part of GDCSB-Based Target Segmentation calculates the desired threshold by cyclic shift of the grayscale distribution curve (GDC) of the enhanced image. After binarizing the enhanced image, real targets can be segmented from the image background. To verify the proposed algorithm, experiments based on 13,625 infrared maritime images and five comparison algorithms were conducted. Results show that the proposed algorithm has solid performance in strong and weak background clutters, different wave bands, different maritime targets, etc.},

The first is to achieve preview distance adaptivity by a dynamic multi-point preview model (DMPPM), which provides the desired course deviation according to the vehicle speed and the reference path. The second is to improve the adaptivity of an adaptive fuzzy steering controller (AFSC) with an adaptive steering gain model which is built via the path curvature and vehicle speed. The third is that an optimal parameter surface is devised to enhance the adaptivity of the AEPTS at high speeds. Such a surface can provide the optimal coefficients for the AEPTS, and it is implemented using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a curve fitting method. At last, simulation experiments are given to verify the adaptivity of the proposed method.},

Moreover, location information is necessary prior information for tasks such as behavioural decision-making and path planning. Recently, the technology of map-based localization has been widely concerned due to its accuracy. A prior map for localization stores one or more environmental features extracted by on-board sensors. These features represent fundamental information about the ground environment such as curbs and lane markings, or the vertical environment such as building outlines. In order to enhance the robustness and positioning accuracy, this paper uses two layers of features to express the environment: one is a bottom layer composed of ground and curb features, and the other is an upper layer composed of a 2D point cloud with vertical features. Firstly, a novel collision-based detection method is proposed to extract the curb features, and a vertical-projection-based detection algorithm is used to detect vertical feature points from multilayer LIDAR. Then, the fusion of a multi-frame feature point cloud is used to represent the rich and complete information on the environment of the intelligent vehicle. Finally, the Monte Carlo localization algorithm is used to obtain an optimal estimate of the vehicle position. The experimental results indicate that the proposed localization algorithm can realize localization accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Using a Powered Two-Wheeler (PTW) for everyday commuting has become particularly attractive in large metropolitan areas. The industry has also picked upon the rising interest for PTW oriented services using crowdsourcing and smartphones. However, current navigation or other travel information services are not at all customized to the needs of PTWs, which are systematically being neglected from the target group. To address the needs of this diverse mode, one should first be able to identify PTWs from the rest of the vehicles. The aim of the specific study is to develop models to reveal the contributing factors which are related to the identification of PTWs using solely smartphone sensors&#39; data and tree-based machine learning approaches. To boost the accuracy of the identification task, popular feature selection algorithms and meta-modeling strategies are implemented and evaluated. Additionally, in order to deal with the unbalanced dataset different oversampling techniques are examined. Results show that high accuracy models can be developed for the specific classification problem with the proper feature representation.},

As per the survey of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), distracted driving is a leading factor in road accidents. In this paper, we present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach for detecting and classifying the driver distraction. In the development of safety features for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, the algorithm not only has to be accurate but also efficient in terms of memory and speed. Hence, we focused on developing computationally efficient CNN while maintaining good accuracy. We propose a new architecture named as mobileVGG based on depthwise separable convolutions. We evaluate results of the proposed network on the American University in Cairo (AUC) distracted driver detection dataset as well as Statefarm&#39;s dataset on Kaggle and compare the performance with state-of-the-art CNN architectures from literature. Our proposed mobileVGG architecture with just 2.2M parameters outperforms earlier approaches while achieving 95.24% and 99.75% accuracy on AUC and Statefarm&#39;s dataset respectively with less computational complexity and memory requirement.},

This study focuses on current and future lane keeping assistance (LKA) systems and their potential safety effects by analysing real-world crash data and LKA&#39;s possibilities to prevent fatal passenger car crashes. The analysed data includes in-depth analysis of 364 fatal head-on and single-vehicle crashes in Finland. According to statistical analysis, 27% of these crashes could potentially have been prevented had currently available LKA been deployed. In this study, many issues are examined related to the lane markings&#39; visibility, infrastructure, weather, and driver-related risks, which rationalise the results, compliment previous research, and highlight possibilities to increase the safety potential of LKA. Related to the lane markings&#39; visibility, safety potential could be improved by allocating more resources to road maintenance and to snow clearance. Advanced LKA enabling exploiting digital lane markings could hypothetically almost double the safety potential as weather conditions or the visibility of lane markings would not restrict LKA&#39;s operation. While the driver is still in charge of driving tasks, driver-related risks are difficult to manage and the crashes caused intendedly or due to driver&#39;s attack of illness are not preventable by current LKA systems.},

  abstract     = {The rapidly increasing connectedness of modern vehicles leads to new security challenges for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs), where some potential attackers can achieve unauthorized access to gain control of the vehicle by injecting malicious information into in-vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). Therefore, in this paper, a secure attribute-isolated communication architecture for an ICV, which introduces attributes into the ECUs to achieve authorized access among the ECU nodes is proposed. First, an analysis of the functional attributes of all of the in-vehicle ECUs in an intelligent connected environment and a division of the functional attributes of the ECUs into five classifications are performed. Second, based on the above-classified attributes, a secure attribute-isolated communication architecture is demonstrated. The ECUs have different access rights, allowing only the ECUs with the same functional attributes in the internal network of the vehicle to communicate. Then, it is proven that the proposed architecture can resist forgery and eavesdropping attacks under the random oracle model. Finally, the secure attribute-isolated communication architecture is constructed in a hardware environment and evaluated with an in-vehicle network simulator (IVNS). The evaluation results show that the average memory usage with 120 ECUs and 100 messages is below 40 MB and the bus load can be reduced to 18.96% using the proposed security architecture compared to the bus load of existing architectures. Therefore, the proposed secure attribute-isolated communication architecture solves the problem of the tradeoff between the security threat of unauthorized access and the high bus load of existing in-vehicle architectures.},

However, effectively detecting and removing the shadows on the road to maintain illumination consistency remain challenging. Road shadows blur and change road features, greatly damaging the image quality and making further detection and tracking more difficult to implement. For example, detection could be mistaken due to incorrect identification of shadow boundaries. The adaptability and accuracy can be affected as well. To tackle the problems, this paper employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on color saliency space and gradient field to detect shadow. Nonlinear SVM classifier analyzes its color saliency space and gradient information, then reconstructs road shadow descriptor to distinguish shadowed regions. To remove the shadow, adaptive variable scale regional compensation operator is adopted. Following experiments verify the detection and removal method are feasible in the real world, and robust to many types of road conditions.},

The objective of this study is twofold: 1) evaluate risk of CNC using pre-incident variables using logistical regression models and; 2) classify and predict CNC events using machine learning methods. The regression models found that driving behavior, duration of secondary task and traffic density exerted a high influence on risk of CNC in work zones. Odds of a safety critical event for different risk factors followed similar trend for work zones and non-work zones. Duration of secondary task and traffic density variables contributed to increased crash risk in work zones than non-work zones. For the second objective, four machine learning algorithms: Random forest (RF), Deep Neural Network, Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network, and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), were applied to work zone events and non-work zone events within NDS data. The RF algorithm performed the best in classifying CNC events occurring in work zones. The prediction accuracy was 86.3% for three classes: crash, near-crash, and baseline and 91.2% for two classes: crash and near-crash. For non-work zone data, the Deep Neural Network model outperformed others in differentiating between crash and near-crash events.},

However, they need a huge amount of labeled data for training, which is difficult and expensive to acquire. A recently proposed workaround is to train deep networks using synthetic data, but the domain shift between real world and synthetic representations limits the performance. In this work, a novel Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategy is introduced to solve this issue. The proposed learning strategy is driven by three components: a standard supervised learning loss on labeled synthetic data; an adversarial learning module that exploits both labeled synthetic data and unlabeled real data; finally, a self-teaching strategy applied to unlabeled data. The last component exploits a region growing framework guided by the segmentation confidence. Furthermore, we weighted this component on the basis of the class frequencies to enhance the performance on less common classes. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in adapting a segmentation network trained on synthetic datasets, like GTA5 and SYNTHIA, to real world datasets like Cityscapes and Mapillary.},

  abstract     = {Range anxiety has remained a critical technological bottleneck in electric vehicles (EVs). The issue lies in the fact that the estimation of the EV&#39;s batteries state of charge (SoC) is still inaccurate and unreliable due to the complex and nonlinear characteristics of the batteries. To tackle the problem, this paper presents a novel real-time mixed SoC estimation algorithm for the EV&#39;s lithium-ion batteries for implementation in an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). The mixed estimation algorithm combines: i) an improved Coulomb counting method (CCM) that takes into account the battery state-of-health, operating temperature, and aging effect, ii) a model-based method (MBM) that represents a real-time recursive structure of the battery, and iii) a bottom-up based method (BUBM) that takes into account a variety of the environmental conditions, traffic conditions, auxiliary loads, and driver&#39;s behavior. To validate the proposed algorithm, several laboratory tests under real-time driving cycles have been conducted on a Manganese-oxide Li-ion cell of a 2012 Nissan Leaf battery cell. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model has been demonstrated by driving the Nissan Leaf along a selected route in Australia. The results demonstrate a great accuracy for the SoC estimation compared to previous models.},

In the feature representation layer, we combine the deep autoencoders with a distance-based measure to map the sequential observations of driving encounters into a computationally tractable space, which quantifies the spatiotemporal interaction characteristics of two vehicles. The clustering algorithm is then applied to the extracted representations to cluster homogeneous driving encounters into groups. Our proposed generic framework is then evaluated using 2,568 naturalistic driving encounters.

First, it decouples sensor translational and rotational motion by estimating them from Doppler and spatial data, respectively. Secondly, it directly analyzes RADAR images to estimate rotational motion via correspondence-free non-linear optimization. Unlike other methods, RADARODO estimates ego-motion along with its predicted uncertainty from a single RADAR sensor without depending on a lever-arm offset or the zero side-slip assumption. The real-world results demonstrate accurate ego-motion estimates that are particularly suited for integration within a “tightly-coupled” sensor fusion framework.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an approach to produce accurate 3D detection boxes for objects on the ground using single monocular images. We do so by merging 2D visual cues, 3D object dimensions, and ground plane constraints to produce boxes that are robust against small errors and incorrect predictions. First, we train a single-shot convolutional neural network (CNN) that produces multiple visual and geometric cues of interest: 2D bounding boxes, 2D keypoints of interest, coarse object orientations and object dimensions. Subsets of these cues are then used to poll probable ground planes from a pre-computed database of ground planes, to identify the “best fit” plane with highest consensus. Once identified, the “best fit” plane provides enough constraints to successfully construct the desired 3D detection box, without directly predicting the 6DoF pose of the object. The entire ground plane polling (GPP) procedure is constructed as a non-parametrized layer of the CNN that outputs the desired “best fit” plane and the corresponding 3D keypoints, which together define the final 3D bounding box. Doing so allows us to poll thousands of different ground plane configurations without adding considerable overhead, while also creating a single CNN that directly produces the desired output without the need for post processing. We evaluate our method on the 2D detection and orientation estimation benchmark from the challenging KITTI dataset, and provide additional comparisons for 3D metrics of importance. This single-stage, single-pass CNN results in superior localization and orientation estimation compared to more complex and computationally expensive monocular approaches.},

  abstract     = {Drivers often engage in secondary in-vehicle activities that can be functional and/or to relieve monotony. Drivers believe they can safely do so when their perceived workload is low. However, driving requires concurrent execution of cognitive, physical, perceptual and motor tasks. Over allocation of a driver&#39;s attention to secondary tasks may impair the driver&#39;s control of the vehicle and attention to the surrounding traffic. Accurate assessment of a driver&#39;s workload is an important, but challenging, research topic with many applications in intelligent vehicle systems related to driving safety and enhance driving experience. In this article, we present our research on driver workload detection based on driver&#39;s physiological, vehicle signals as well as traffic contexts such as congestion level and traffic events. We obtained a collection of data from real driving scenarios. Twenty participants were recruited, whose workload was scaled to “low” as a base level, and “elevated” as a higher level. We developed two convolutional neural networks for multivariate temporal series (MTS-CNN). Extensive experiments were conducted in two scopes: within driver and cross-driver. The within-driver scope concentrates on experiments using data from a single driver, while in the cross-driver scope, transfer learning is leveraged and discussed. The experimental results demonstrate that one of the proposed models, i.e., MTS-CNN2, which combines features captured by the convolutional layers at all levels, is capable of learning well from the combined temporal physiological and vehicle signals and obtains the best performance.},

  abstract     = {Driving automation systems typically use surround sensors to perceive their local environment. Accidents with automated vehicles have shown that errors in sensor data measurement and interpretation can lead to fatal injuries. It is thus necessary to test the reliability of environmental perception systems before market introduction. Since critical weather conditions are random, rare, and change quickly, relevant data sets are biased towards clear conditions. Consequently, detection algorithms based on these data suffer from limited performance. This article focuses on a two-step approach based on a) an indoor rain facility to test under reproducible, realistic conditions and b) physical-based models to enrich sensor data from clear conditions with virtual rain effects in a post-processing step. We concentrate on data from camera, lidar, and radar sensors. Experimental results show that both approaches simulate critical effects on raw sensor data and, therefore, enable replicable testing and validation at every stage of development.},

This article aims to plan precise and optimal trajectory for a car-like tractor that tows standard or general N-trailers in an environment with static obstacles. This trajectory planning scheme can be formulated as a unified optimal control problem, but numerically solving that problem is difficult. Two efforts are made to address the difficulty. First, an extended hybrid A * search algorithm is proposed to provide an initial guess for the numerical optimization. Second, the numerical optimization process is eased through adopting a progressively constrained optimization strategy, which is about sequentially handling the kinematics, collision avoidance constraints, and boundary conditions. Particularly in dealing with the collision avoidance constraints, an adaptively homotopic warm-starting algorithm is proposed, which defines a sequence of subproblems with the obstacle areas adaptively increase towards their nominal scales. Through solving these subproblems in a sequence, the whole collision avoidance difficulties are dispersed and gradually tackled. Comparative simulations are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed trajectory planner.},

Among the leading cause of death among teenagers today are traffic accidents and major part of them are related to distracted driving. We propose here an end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network-based driver distraction recognition (DDR) system that can generalize to diverse driving conditions. The proposed method consists of two steps: developing generative models to produce images of different driving scenarios and developing a discriminative model for image classification. Unlike traditional methods based on image data-sets collected by simulation experiments, we collect a diverse data-set of drivers in different driving conditions and activity patterns from the Internet and train generative models for multiple driving scenarios. By sampling from these generative models, we augment the collected data-set with new training samples and train a Convolutional Neural Network for distraction recognition. We demonstrate that the generative models are able to generate images of drivers in different driving scenarios. With augmentative images, the DDR system achieves an improvement of 11.45% on image classification performance in a driving simulation environment. Moreover, we demonstrate how the trained DDR systems can be integrated within a driver monitoring system.},

In this paper, a novel optimal robust (mixed H ∞ /H 2 ) controller is proposed to achieve enhanced vibration attenuation performance of seat suspensions considering the parametric uncertainties due to variations in driver mass and external disturbances encountered at the cabin floor including occasional shocks. A direct Lyapunov based LMI approach is employed to prove stability of the closed-loop system. In search of an optimal solution for the designed robust controller, a H ∞ disturbance attenuation performance together with the weighted H 2 norm for minimizing the mean disturbance rejection, are considered using the Chaos-enhanced Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization (CAPSO). The optimization problem for the proposed controller is formulated to minimize the frequency-weighted vibration dose value (VDV) due to acceleration response at the seat, while constraining the relative displacement between the seat and the seat base. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is illustrated through comparisons with performance achieved through some of the reported other seat suspension robust controllers in addition to a passive suspension. Results show that the proposed optimal robust controller could provide substantial reductions in the frequency-weighted acceleration at the seat and the VDV, measures of the force applied to the driver due to terrain induced vibration and shock, while limiting the relative displacement between the seat and the seat base.},

This article introduces a fast ConvNet approach, based on the work of original work of OpenPose by Cao, et al. for full body joint estimation. The network is modified with fewer parameters and retrained using our own day-time naturalistic autonomous driving dataset to estimate joint and affinity heatmaps for driver and passenger&#39;s wrist and elbows, for a total of 8 joint classes and part affinity fields between each wrist-elbow pair. The approach runs real-time on real-world data at 40 fps on multiple drivers and passengers. The system is extensively evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing at least 95% detection performance on joint localization and arm-angle estimation.},

To overcome this problem, we propose a novel semi-persistent resource allocation scheme based on a two-tier heterogeneous network architecture. The architecture includes a central macro base station (MBS) and multiple roadside units (RSU). In the proposed semi-persistent scheme, the MBS pre-allocates persistent resource to RSUs based on predicted traffic, and then allocates dynamic resource upon real-time requests from RSUs while vehicles simultaneously communicate using the pre-allocated resource. A simple Space-Time k-Nearest Neighbour (ST-kNN) method is developed for short-term traffic prediction, and a geometric water-filling algorithm is developed for minimizing the relative latency. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-persistent scheme in comparison with two benchmark schemes.},

These limitations motivate us to model the powertrain dynamics by experiments and to design new speed controls, differing from the conventional cruise control that manipulates engine/brake torque directly with accurate models. This article explores the powertrain modeling and speed control algorithm design of these testing platforms, by taking the MKZ as an example. Two computationally-efficient algorithms are designed, i.e., a PID + C control when future information (i.e., reference speed and road slope profiles) is unavailable, and a preview control if the information is provided a priori. To guarantee speed tracking errors within a given safe range, a barrier control is also designed to supervise the two controllers, which adds additional brake/throttle actions when the error is approaching the boundary. The algorithms are implemented and tested on the Mcity MKZ platform, experimental results show the speed-tracking performance and the bounded errors achieved by the barrier function.},

However, due to the interference of the signal or the loss of part of the signal during the acquisition, processing, compression, transmission and decompression of the video image signal, the local area of the image is abnormal, which affects the perception and decision of the system. This article addresses the problems of inaccurate restored images and noise in the restored images by proposing an image restoration method that is applied to a multicamera system. We utilize different perspective images captured by different cameras to assist and constrain the restoration of the damaged image. This method restores the image by combining sample representations and sample distribution models which respectively based on self-encoder reconstruction loss learning and generative adversarial networks. In this method, the infrastructure is a conditional generative adversarial network, the condition is the images that are from the other perspectives, and the generator is a self-encoder structure with cross-layer connection, group convolution and feature map channel exchanged. This method was carried out on a dataset recorded in Zurich using a pair of cameras mounted on a mobile platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the existing methods in terms of mean L1 Loss, mean L2 Loss and the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).},

Fifty-two participants experienced two takeover situations with varying time headways (small and large). A low urgent, visual-tactile takeover-request was presented to half of the participants.

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles are complex systems that are challenging to test and debug. A requirements-driven approach to the development process can decrease the resources required to design and test these systems, while simultaneously increasing the reliability. We present a testing framework that uses signal temporal logic (STL), which is a precise and unambiguous requirements language. Our framework evaluates test cases against the STL formulae and additionally uses the requirements to automatically identify test cases that fail to satisfy the requirements. One of the key features of our tool is the support for machine learning (ML) components in the system design, such as deep neural networks. The framework allows evaluation of the control algorithms, including the ML components, and it also includes models of CCD camera, lidar, and radar sensors, as well as the vehicle environment. We use multiple methods to generate test cases, including covering arrays, which is an efficient method to search discrete variable spaces. The resulting test cases can be used to debug the controller design by identifying controller behaviors that do not satisfy requirements. The test cases can also enhance the testing phase of development by identifying critical corner cases that correspond to the limits of the system&#39;s allowed behaviors. We present STL requirements for an autonomous vehicle system, which capture both component-level and system-level behaviors. Additionally, we present three driving scenarios and demonstrate how our requirements-driven testing framework can be used to identify critical system behaviors, which can be used to support the development process.},

  abstract     = {Human Occupied Vehicle (HOV) is one of main tools to investigate submarine resources and carry out some underwater operations, and it can serve as a base for divers when they execute underwater activities. Therefore, the research on HOV is extremely significant. Aiming at the drive saturation (thrust overrun) problem of tracking control which is one of the main research directions, a hybrid control strategy based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization-model predictive control (QPSO-MPC) and adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) is put forward for “Jiaolong” HOV. The hybrid control strategy includes a QPSOMPC-based kinematic controller and an ASMC-based dynamic controller. The kinematic controller transforms the position error into the virtual desired speed. Then the error between the desired speed and real speed is used as the input for the dynamic controller. Through the design of S sliding manifold and dynamic control law, the thrusts of 4 DOF are obtained. The thrusts are distributed to eight thrusters in accordance with thrusters&#39; configuration of “Jiaolong” HOV. So that HOV can be driven to reach and track the known reference trajectory. The innovation of this hybrid control strategy is it takes into account the limited speed for HOV. The constraints on speed and speed increment are added in the optimization part of the kinematic controller. A simple trajectory generator designed by QPSO-MPC is presented with obstacle avoidance behavior. Compared with backstepping control and bioinspired backstepping control, the proposed strategy can deal with the speed jump phenomenon and the drive saturation (thrust overrun) caused by exceeded speed variation. From the simulation results, the hybrid strategy is able to achieve stable and accurate tracking control under the condition of satisfying the physical constraints (speed and thrust constraints). And the trajectory generator is verified to be capable of trajectory planning with obstacle avoidance behavior.},

According to the connectivity status between the leader and each follower, platoon control is modeled as a switched platoon control system with a connectivity-status-matrix-dependent controller. By using switched system theory, a series of sufficient conditions are obtained as a criteria for the stability analysis and control synthesis of the LF platoon. Based on the obtained conditions, a useful platoon control algorithm is proposed. For each obtained connectivity-status-matrix-dependent controller, the string stability and a zero steady-state spacing error can be guaranteed by additional conditions. Numerical simulations and experiments with laboratory-scale Arduino cars are conducted to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle platooning, a coordinated vehicle movement strategy, has been proposed to address a range of current transport challenges such as traffic congestion, road safety, energy consumption and pollution. While the current literature mainly focuses on platoon control strategies and intra-platoon communication, comparatively little work is done on how to form these platoons. Literature assumes platoon formation by tail merge which is sufficient only for planned formation on a ramp or at a ramp-highway junction. In this article we study the impact of three different merge operations, namely front, middle, and tail merge. The efficiency of these operations is analyzed under different scenarios, varying the vehicles speed adjustment strategy, traffic density, and the density of mergeable vehicles. The impact of the merge operations is represented in terms of merge time, merge distance, average traffic speed, and merge success rate. Our experiments show that in an ideal no traffic scenario, the middle merge is costlier in terms of merge time for the same merge distance whereas in the presence of traffic middle merge helps is quick platoon formation on an average in a higher traffic density in particular. This insight should provide a more flexible toolkit for planning a platoon formation.},

  abstract     = {This article concerns the open question of creating control policies of autonomous vehicles (AVs) that lead to courteous motion. The study is built on a two-agent interaction between two agents (M and H), where each agent plans its motion by optimizing a trade-off of goal fulfillment, safety, and courtesy losses. The paper has three contributions: First, the “double-blindness” issue in intent inference, i.e., inferring H&#39;s intent requires knowledge about H&#39;s inference of M&#39;s intent, is addressed. An empathetic intent inference algorithm is proposed, where H&#39;s intent, along with its inference of M&#39;s intent, are jointly inferred. Second, vehicle dynamics is explicitly incorporated into intent inference to acknowledge its influence on decision making in driving by the drivers&#39; knowledge about dynamical properties of surrounding vehicles. Lastly, a courtesy loss that leverages intent inference is introduced. This loss measures the expected additional loss to H caused by M&#39;s motion from a baseline where M behaves rationally and in favor of H. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate that (1) joint inference and knowledge about vehicle dynamics are important to intent decoding and motion planning, and (2) the proposed courtesy definition leads to more rational motions than those from an existing definition.},

  abstract     = {An essential and challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is turning at mixed-flow intersections when they interact with motorized, non-motorized and pedestrian traffic simultaneously. In these situations, sensor measurement noise and blind zones create additional complexity in an already problematic environment. In order to make motion planning feasible in a multi-interaction environment with detection uncertainty feasible, this article proposes a hierarchical framework that divides the highly-related driving process into a decision, planning and action layer. The decision layer first employs a logit model combined with Bayes&#39; theorem to make a discrete choice about whether to turn or not. Then, the plan layer initializes a local trajectory with selected waypoints considering the location of interacting objects based on a Bézier curve. Finally, feedback is used to adjust the vehicle&#39;s decision and trajectory plan when collision risks increase due to the unexpected behavior of other objects. Additionally, in order to consider sensor data noise and blind zones of AVs, an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) was used to estimate the status of sensory targets. The performance of the proposed model was compared with drivers&#39; performance for the same turning scenarios at two mixed-flow intersections. The results show that the simulation produced human-like flexibility when planning trajectories in a multi-interaction environment. Moreover, the travel time of AVs did not show a statistically significant difference when compared with manually driven vehicles (MVs). Instead, the AVs actually performed better in terms of safety than the MVs.},

In the second branch, a novel neural network architecture is used for recurrent instance segmentation on radar point clouds of moving objects. The class probabilities assigned to each cell in the grid map are mapped back to the radar targets in this spatial region so that in a merging step the results from the two classifiers can be combined into one point cloud. In addition to a novel network structure for recurrent instance segmentation of point clouds, we present a new set of layers for radar grid maps which are beneficial for semantic segmentation tasks and we also develop a weighting scheme for the network&#39;s loss function to account for the data integration process in grid maps.

We first pretrain a model with autogenerated samples from a rule-based classifier so that human knowledge can be propagated into the network. Based on the pretrained model, only a small set of annotations is required for further fine-tuning. Quantitative experiments show that the pretrained model achieves better performance than random initialization in almost all cases; furthermore, our method can achieve similar performance with fewer manual annotations.},

While allowing a scalable hardware architecture inside the cars, this concept demands to reconstruct the recording locations of the individual images aggregated in the back-end. Varying environmental conditions, dynamic scenes, and small numbers of significant landmarks may hamper camera pose estimation through sparse reconstruction from unordered road scene images. Tackling those problems, we extend a state-of-the-art Structure from Motion pipeline by selecting keypoints based on a semantic image segmentation and removing GPS outliers. We present three challenging image datasets recorded on repetitive test drives under differing environmental conditions for evaluation of our method. The results demonstrate that our optimized pipeline is able to reconstruct the camera viewpoints robustly in the majority of road scenes observed while preserving high image registration rates.

One inconvenience in MoD-EV systems is the need of some customers to perform in-routing charging, which may cause delays in the trip time. Moreover, the customer choice of which station to charge at is an operational issue for the MoD-EV service operator due to the different pricing for the charging at different stations. Given a connected system, we propose a routing scheme that aims to reduce these inconveniences for both customers and the operator. By modeling the routing problem between multiple MoD-EV stations as a multi-server queuing system, we formulate the joint problem of minimizing the average trip time for all customers and the average cost of charging as a dual-objective convex optimization problem. Single and multiple servers per charging stations are considered. Optimal routing decisions are derived analytically for any arbitrary weighting of the two problem objectives and simulation results show the significant merits of our proposed solution as compared to shortest time and random routing decisions. They also illustrate the trade-offs between the two objectives.},

The method is applied to a previously developed Bayesian localization filter called Odometry 2.0 estimator. Its architecture makes it feasible to individually combine different dead-reckoning models because the input is redundant. However, under different driving-conditions (DCs), in particular when parking, the models have individual advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, different cluster analysis methods are examined in order to automatically divide a parking maneuver into different useful segments and to enable dc-dependent optimization. In the next step these segments and statistical error and coefficient models serve as input for a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The error model provides potential sensor errors to ensure robust filter tuning and the coefficient model provides randomly found filter settings in the large parameter space. Finally, the MCS results and ground truth data are used for the optimization to find the filter tuning with minor model errors. The application of the so found adaptive tuning setting shows a significant increase in the robustness of the localization filter.},

To this end, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric method by integrating hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) with a hidden Markov model (HMM) in order to automatically extract the driving primitives from sequential observations without using any prior knowledge. Then, we propose a grid-based relative entropy approach, which allows quantifying the probabilistic similarity levels among these extracted primitives. Finally, the naturalistic driving data from 10 drivers are collected to evaluate the proposed framework, with comparison to traditional work. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed probabilistic framework based on driving primitives can provide a quantitative measurement of similar levels of driving behavior associated with the dynamic and stochastic characteristics.},

Our method leverages feedback control, positive invariant sets, and equilibrium trajectories of the closed-loop system to produce and track trajectories that are collision-free with guarantees according to the vehicle model. Our method jointly steers the vehicle to a target region and controls the velocity while satisfying constraints associated with future motion of surrounding obstacles. We develop a receding-horizon implementation of the control policy and verify the method in both a simulated road scenario and an experimental validation using a scaled mobile robot with car-like dynamics using only onboard sensing. The results show that our method generates dynamically feasible and safe (i.e., collision-free) trajectories in real time, and indicate that the proposed planner is robust to sensing and mapping errors.},

  abstract     = {High electric vehicles (EVs) penetration is expected to increase smart grid solicitation especially with various EV charging demands. As result, the EV charging process at the supply station has to be managed in the way to promote the EV satisfaction level while preserving smart grid stability. In this article, the bidirectional power flow between EV and grid; Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), is exploited. We make a profit from the unused electric power of EVs and we present an EV load management technique based on EV charging and EV discharging coordination. We propose a peak load management model (PLM) used to schedule EVs for charging or discharging service according to the power demand with the timing and location where each EV need to be served. Also, we propose an Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) selection model to guide EVs to the supply station. We develop a mathematical formalism for handling requests for EV charging/discharging at EVSE based on queuing theory. Those models are evaluated while considering the mobility of vehicles in an urban scenario and time-of-use-pricing (TOUP). Finally, extensive matlab simulations are conducted to validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {This article is motivated by the lack of empirical data on the performance of commercially available Society of Automotive Engineers level one automated driving systems. To address this, a set of car following experiments are conducted to collect data from a 2015 luxury electric vehicle equipped with a commercial adaptive cruise control (ACC) system. Velocity, relative velocity, and spacing data collected during the experiments are used to calibrate an optimal velocity relative velocity car following model for both the minimum and maximum following settings. The string stability of both calibrated models is assessed, and it is determined that the best-fit models are string unstable, indicating they are not able to prevent all traffic disturbances from amplifying into phantom jams. Based on the calibrated models, we identify the consequences of the string unstable ACC system on synthetic and empirical lead vehicle disturbances, highlighting that commercial ACC platoons of moderate size can dampen some disturbances even while being string unstable. The primary contributions of this article are the development of a data-driven approach to calculate string stability of ACC systems, and the collection and interpretation of a dataset to understand the car following behavior of a commercial ACC system.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop a game theoretic model predictive controller (GTMPC) with aggressiveness estimation to deal with the mandatory lane change (MLC) problem in presence of several surrounding vehicles. GTMPC is responsible for driving a subject vehicle (SV) to a desired longitudinal position and executing lane-changing at the optimal moment. Specifically, GTMPC constantly establishes and solves Stackelberg games corresponding to multiple game candidate vehicles (GCV) within the game scope when SV is able to interact with GCVs by signaling a lane change intention through turn signal. GTMPC first selects one target vehicle (TV) within multiple GCVs based on the Stackelberg equilibrium, followed by estimating TV&#39;s aggressiveness based on the interaction between SV and TV, then completes the maneuver through MPC. GTMPC performance is compared with level-k game theoretic controller. Human-in-the-Loop results showed that GTMPC is capable to safely complete the MLC by properly assessing the aggressiveness of surrounding vehicles, driven either by intelligent driver model or human drivers.},

  abstract     = {The lane-change strategy of autonomous vehicles is affected by its leading vehicle. It is necessary and challenging to simultaneously conduct the lane-change maneuvers while avoiding collisions with the leading vehicle. This article proposes a lane-change strategy considering the leading vehicle by synthesizing vehicle velocity prediction, motion planning, and trajectory tracking control. A scenario-based velocity prediction method using the input-output hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed to predict the leading vehicle velocity. Then a motion planner integrating the predicted velocity is developed to generate the optimal trajectories for the lane-change maneuvers. The generated trajectories are tracked by a trajectory tracking controller. An improved composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) control algorithm is proposed to obtain smooth transient performances and fast responses. Human driver tests on a driving simulator show the leading vehicle velocity can be predicted by the proposed method. The motion planner and the trajectory tracking controller are validated in the CarSim simulations. The collision-free optimal trajectories are generated and tracked by the motion planner and the improved CNF controller. A systematic lane-change strategy considering the leading vehicle is effectively developed in this study.},

  abstract     = {Ride comfort and road holding are two substantial performance criteria related to the suspension system of road vehicles. These performance criteria are critical in controller design and chassis stability of automated driving vehicles. Control demands in terms of accuracy, quick response and robustness to matched and mismatched uncertainties are suggestive of employing adaptive robust controllers. Herein, a state observer-based modified sliding mode interval fuzzy type-2 neural network (FT2NN) controller is designed to suppress the vibrations from a typical rough terrain imposed to the nonlinear suspension system of the vehicles. The nonlinear system dynamics are estimated using the universal approximation capacity of the neuro-fuzzy type-2 approach and the states are obtained by the adaptive robust state observer. The membership functions (MFs) of the fuzzy type-2 system are employed to deal with the uncertainties through variable mean and variances for upper and lower MFs. Furthermore, the proposed controller has the advantage of relaxing the condition for the approximation error boundaries while the estimation step is utilized to observe the boundaries adaptively. A new adaptive compensator is employed to withstand the effect of the external disturbance, the approximation errors related to the unknown nonlinear functions and state estimations. The results obtained from the proposed controller are suggestive of the higher effectiveness of the proposed controller compared to the tested Neuro-PID controller, and also the passive suspension system. The high-fidelity MSC ADAMS based co-simulations were implemented to validate the practicality of the proposed controller.},

In this article, we propose a data-driven approach for estimating the driver&#39;s take-over readiness based purely on observable cues from in-vehicle vision sensors. We present an extensive naturalistic driving dataset of drivers in a conditionally autonomous vehicle running on Californian freeways. We collect subjective ratings for the driver&#39;s take-over readiness from multiple human observers viewing the sensor feed. Analysis of the ratings in terms of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) shows a high degree of consistency in the ratings across raters. We define a metric for the driver&#39;s take-over readiness termed the `Observable Readiness Index (ORI)&#39; based on the ratings. Finally, we propose an LSTM model for continuous estimation of the driver&#39;s ORI based on a holistic representation of the driver&#39;s state, capturing gaze, hand, pose and foot activity. Our model estimates the ORI with a mean absolute error of 0.449 on a 5 point scale.},

Therefore, we focused on steering timing as a candidate factor for skill improvement in reverse parking. In this article, we developed an assist method based on auditory presentation that indicates the timing for starting of steering in order to follow the target trajectory during reverse parking.

In these settings, blind spots can arise from perception limitations. For example when overtaking unexpected objects on the vehicle&#39;s ego lane on a two-way street. In this case, a human driver would first make sure that the opposite lane is free and that there is enough room to successfully execute the maneuver, and then it would cut into the opposite lane in order to execute the maneuver successfully. We consider the practical problem of autonomous overtaking when the coverage of the perception system is impaired due to occlusion. Safe trajectories are generated by solving, in real-time, a non-linear constrained optimization, formulated as a receding horizon planner that maximizes the ego vehicle&#39;s visibility. The planner is complemented by a high-level behavior planner, which takes into account the occupancy of other traffic participants, the information from the vehicle&#39;s perception system, and the risk associated with the overtaking maneuver, to determine when the overtake maneuver should happen. The approach is validated in simulation and in experiments in real world traffic.},
