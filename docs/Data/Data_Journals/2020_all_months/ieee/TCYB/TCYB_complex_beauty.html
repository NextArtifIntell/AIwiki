  abstract     = {Aiming at the challenges of networked visual servo control systems, which rarely consider network communication duration and image processing computational cost simultaneously, we here propose a novel platform for networked inverted pendulum visual servo control using H∞ analysis. Unlike most of the existing methods that usually ignore computational costs involved in measuring, actuating, and controlling, we design a novel event-triggered sampling mechanism that applies a new closed-loop strategy to dealing with networked inverted pendulum visual servo systems of multiple time-varying delays and computational errors. Using the Lyapunov stability theory, we prove that the proposed system can achieve stability whilst compromising image-induced computational and network-induced delays and system performance. In the meantime, we use H ∞ disturbance attenuation level γ for evaluating the computational errors, whereas the corresponding H ∞ controller is implemented. Finally, simulation analysis and experimental results demonstrate the proposed system performance in reducing computational errors whilst maintaining system efficiency and robustness.},

When a change is detected in the environment, prediction mechanisms estimate the POS by utilizing information from previous populations to accelerate search toward the true POS. To achieve a robust prediction of POS, a mixture-of-experts-based ensemble framework is proposed. Unlike existing approaches, the framework utilizes multiple prediction mechanisms to improve the overall prediction. A gating network is applied to manage switching among the various predictors based on performance of the predictors at different time intervals of the optimization process. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through experimental studies based on 13 dynamic multiobjective benchmark optimization problems. The simulation results show that the proposed framework improves the dynamic optimization performance significantly, particularly for: 1) problems with distinct dynamic POS in decision space over time and 2) problems with highly nonlinear decision variable linkages.},

  abstract     = {Building an efficient and reliable collision perception visual system is a challenging problem for future robots and autonomous vehicles. The biological visual neural networks, which have evolved over millions of years in nature and are working perfectly in the real world, could be ideal models for designing artificial vision systems. In the locust&#39;s visual pathways, a lobula giant movement detector (LGMD), that is, the LGMD2, has been identified as a looming perception neuron that responds most strongly to darker approaching objects relative to their backgrounds; similar situations which many ground vehicles and robots are often faced with. However, little has been done on modeling the LGMD2 and investigating its potential in robotics and vehicles. In this article, we build an LGMD2 visual neural network which possesses the similar collision selectivity of an LGMD2 neuron in locust via the modeling of biased-ON and -OFF pathways splitting visual signals into parallel ON/OFF channels. With stronger inhibition (bias) in the ON pathway, this model responds selectively to darker looming objects. The proposed model has been tested systematically with a range of stimuli including real-world scenarios. It has also been implemented in a micro-mobile robot and tested with real-time experiments. The experimental results have verified the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model for detecting darker looming objects against various dynamic and cluttered backgrounds.},

First, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism (AETM) with an adaptive law is proposed to adjust the threshold in the AETM according to the error between the system states and the filter states. Such an AETM determines whether the measurement output should be transmitted or not, which is more effective to economize the communication resources comparing with the traditional event-triggered mechanism. Second, in view of network-induced delays, the quantization and the AETM, a time-varying filter error system (TV-FES) is modeled. Then, a new augmented time-varying Lyapunov functional containing triple sum terms is provided. Based on the new finite-sum inequality and improved reciprocally convex combination lemma, delay-dependent conditions are obtained, which can ensure the TV-FES to be input-output finite-time stable and satisfy the given generalized dissipative performance. Moreover, the recursive linear matrix inequalities are presented to obtain the desired filter gains. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the superiority and feasibility of the proposed method in this article.},

  abstract     = {Recently, microexpression recognition has attracted a lot of researchers&#39; attention due to its challenges and valuable applications. However, it is noticed that currently most of the existing proposed methods are often evaluated and tested on the single database and, hence, this brings us a question whether these methods are still effective if the training and testing samples belong to different domains, for example, different microexpression databases. In this case, a large feature distribution difference may exist between training (source) and testing (target) samples and, hence, microexpression recognition tasks would become more difficult. To solve this challenging problem, that is, cross-domain microexpression recognition, in this paper, we propose an effective method consisting of an auxiliary set selection model (ASSM) and a transductive transfer regression model (TTRM). In our method, an ASSM is designed to automatically select an optimal set of samples from the target domain to serve as the auxiliary set, which is used for subsequent TTRM training. As for TTRM, it aims at bridging the feature distribution gap between the source and target domains by learning a joint regression model with the source domain samples and the auxiliary set selected from the target domain. We evaluate the proposed TTRM plus ASSM by extensive cross-domain microexpression recognition experiments on SMIC and CASME II databases. Compared with the recent state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, our proposed method has a more satisfactory performance in dealing with the cross-domain microexpression recognition tasks.},

A key lemma is first derived which involves dynamically changing interaction topologies, and then a new kind of distributed control algorithms with Nussbaum-type functions are proposed based on this lemma. It is proven that if the topologies are time varying with integral weight uniform upper bound and reciprocity, then convergence is guaranteed with the proposed algorithms for nonlinear multiagent systems with nonidentical unknown control directions. An important feature of this paper is that, under time-varying topologies, the designed algorithms can deal with nonidentical unknown control directions by using classical Nussbaum-type functions. Moreover, with the proposed algorithms, we extend the adaptive cooperative control results to the case of $\delta $ -connected graphs. In particular, the adaptive leaderless consensus of high-order nonlinear agents with nonidentical unknown control directions and a directed graph having a spanning tree is also tackled as a special case. Finally, theoretical results are illustrated by a group of Genesio-Tesi systems with distributed control algorithms under time-varying topologies and some special network topologies.},

In this paper, a ridge regression-based S-DNN, dubbed deep analytic network (DAN), along with its kernelization (K-DAN), are devised for multilayer feature relearning from the pre-extracted baseline features and the structured features. Our theoretical formulation demonstrates that DAN/K-DAN relearn by perturbing the intra/interclass variations, apart from diminishing the prediction errors. We scrutinize the DAN/K-DAN performance for pattern classification on datasets of varying domains-faces, handwritten digits, generic objects, to name a few. Unlike the typical BP-optimized DNNs to be trained from gigantic datasets by GPU, we reveal that DAN/K-DAN are trainable using only CPU even for small-scale training sets. Our experimental results show that DAN/K-DAN outperform the present S-DNNs and also the BP-trained DNNs, including multiplayer perceptron, deep belief network, etc., without data augmentation applied.},

Furthermore, two self-triggered algorithms are developed for two cases, known functions and unknown ones, by the current state and information at the previous event time instant instead of the requirement for continuous monitoring auxiliary state errors. In theory, the stability of the resulting closed-loop system is rigorously investigated, and it is proven that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the Zeno behavior is ruled out.

  abstract     = {Causal feature selection has achieved much attention in recent years, which discovers a Markov boundary (MB) of the class attribute. The MB of the class attribute implies local causal relations between the class attribute and the features, thus leading to more interpretable and robust prediction models than the features selected by the traditional feature selection algorithms. Many causal feature selection methods have been proposed, and almost all of them employ conditional independence (CI) tests to identify MBs. However, many datasets from real-world applications may suffer from incorrect CI tests due to noise or small-sized samples, resulting in lower MB discovery accuracy for these existing algorithms. To tackle this issue, in this article, we first introduce a new concept of PCMasking to explain a type of incorrect CI tests in the MB discovery, then propose a cross-check and complement MB discovery (CCMB) algorithm to repair this type of incorrect CI tests for accurate MB discovery. To improve the efficiency of CCMB, we further design a pipeline machine-based CCMB (PM-CCMB) algorithm. Using benchmark Bayesian network datasets, the experiments demonstrate that both CCMB and PM-CCMB achieve significant improvements on the MB discovery accuracy compared with the existing methods, and PM-CCMB further improves the computational efficiency. The empirical study in the real-world datasets validates the effectiveness of CCMB and PM-CCMB against the state-of-the-art causal and traditional feature selection algorithms.},

The weighted try-once-discard (WTOD) protocol is utilized to arrange the transmission order of actuator nodes, under which only one node is permitted to obtain access to the communication network at any time. A key issue is how to integrate the WTOD protocol into the design of the SMC system. To this end, an update rule is proposed for the actuators to obtain the actual actuator signals. And then, a membership-function-dependent (MFD) sliding surface and a token-dependent sliding-mode controller are designed. By taking the information of membership functions into stability and reachability analysis, MFD sufficient conditions are derived such that both the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop fuzzy systems and the reachability of the specified sliding surface can be guaranteed. Moreover, the cone complementary linearization (CCL) algorithm is employed to convert nonlinear inequalities into a minimization problem with linear constraints. Finally, a numerical example is utilized to illustrate the proposed SMC design approach.},

  abstract     = {A novel policy iteration algorithm, called the continuous-time time-varying (CTTV) policy iteration algorithm, is presented in this paper to obtain the optimal control laws for infinite horizon CTTV nonlinear systems. The adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technique is utilized to obtain the iterative control laws for the optimization of the performance index function. The properties of the CTTV policy iteration algorithm are analyzed. Monotonicity, convergence, and optimality of the iterative value function have been analyzed, and the iterative value function can be proven to monotonically converge to the optimal solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Furthermore, the iterative control law is guaranteed to be admissible to stabilize the nonlinear systems. In the implementation of the presented CTTV policy algorithm, the approximate iterative control laws and iterative value function are obtained by neural networks. Finally, the numerical results are given to verify the effectiveness of the presented method.},

  abstract     = {Temporal link prediction in dynamic networks has attracted increasing attention recently due to its valuable real-world applications. The primary challenge of temporal link prediction is to capture the spatial-temporal patterns and high nonlinearity of dynamic networks. Inspired by the success of image generation, we convert the dynamic network into a sequence of static images and formulate the temporal link prediction as a conditional image generation problem. We propose a novel deep generative framework, called NetworkGAN, to tackle the challenging temporal link prediction task efficiently, which simultaneously models the spatial and temporal features in the dynamic networks via deep learning techniques. The proposed NetworkGAN inherits the advantages of the graph convolutional network (GCN), the temporal matrix factorization (TMF), the long short-term memory network (LSTM), and the generative adversarial network (GAN). Specifically, an attentive GCN is first designed to automatically learn the spatial features of dynamic networks. Second, we propose a TMF enhanced attentive LSTM (TMF-LSTM) to capture the temporal dependencies and evolutionary patterns of dynamic networks, which predicts the network snapshot at next timestamp based on the network snapshots observed at previous timestamps. Furthermore, we employ a GAN framework to further refine the performance of temporal link prediction by using a discriminative model to guide the training of the deep generative model (i.e., TMF-LSTM) in an adversarial process. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages of NetworkGAN compared to other strong competitors.},

The agents store the collected information in the form of environment models that compactly represent the surrounding environments. The agents, however, can only conduct limited tasks without an efficient and effective environment model. Thus, such an environment model takes a crucial role for the autonomy systems of intelligent agents. We claim the following characteristics for a versatile environment model: accuracy, applicability, usability, and scalability. Although a number of researchers have attempted to develop such models that represent environments precisely to a certain degree, they lack broad applicability, intuitive usability, and satisfactory scalability. To tackle these limitations, we propose 3-D scene graph as an environment model and the 3-D scene graph construction framework. The concise and widely used graph structure readily guarantees usability as well as scalability for 3-D scene graph. We demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the 3-D scene graph by exhibiting the deployment of the 3-D scene graph in practical applications. Moreover, we verify the performance of the proposed 3-D scene graph and the framework by conducting a series of comprehensive experiments under various conditions.},

  abstract     = {Time series with missing values (incomplete time series) are ubiquitous in real life on account of noise or malfunctioning sensors. Time-series imputation (replacing missing data) remains a challenge due to the potential for nonlinear dependence on concurrent and previous values of the time series. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for modeling incomplete time series, called a linear memory vector recurrent neural network (LIME-RNN), a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a learned linear combination of previous history states. The technique bears some similarity to residual networks and graph-based temporal dependency imputation. In particular, we introduce a linear memory vector [called the residual sum vector (RSV)] that integrates over previous hidden states of the RNN, and is used to fill in missing values. A new loss function is developed to train our model with time series in the presence of missing values in an end-to-end way. Our framework can handle imputation of both missing-at-random and consecutive missing inputs. Moreover, when conducting time-series prediction with missing values, LIME-RNN allows imputation and prediction simultaneously. We demonstrate the efficacy of the model via extensive experimental evaluation on univariate and multivariate time series, achieving state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world data. The statistical results show that our model is significantly better than most existing time-series univariate or multivariate imputation methods.},

  abstract     = {Cross-media hashing, which maps data from different modalities to a low-dimensional sharing Hamming space, has attracted considerable attention due to the rapid increase of multimodal data, for example, images and texts. Recent cross-media hashing works mainly aim at learning compact hash codes to preserve the class label-based or feature-based similarities among samples. However, these methods ignore the unbalanced semantic gaps between different modalities and high-level semantic concepts, which generally results in less effective hash functions and unsatisfying retrieval performance. Specifically, the key words of texts contain semantic meanings, while the low-level features of images lack of semantic meanings. That means the semantic gap in image modality is larger than that in text modality. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective hashing method for cross-media retrieval to address this problem, dubbed discrete semantic alignment hashing (DSAH). First, DSAH formulates to exploit collaborative filtering to mine the relations between class labels and hash codes, which can reduce memory consumption and computational cost compared to pairwise similarity. Then, the attribute of image modality is employed to align the semantic information with text modality. Finally, to further improve the quality of hash codes, we propose a discrete optimization algorithm to learn discrete hash codes directly, and each bit has a closed-form solution. Extensive experiments on multiple public databases show that our model can seamlessly incorporate attributes and achieve promising performance.},

  abstract     = {There are two common challenges in particle swarm optimization (PSO) research, that is, selecting proper exemplars and designing an efficient learning model for a particle. In this article, we propose a triple archives PSO (TAPSO), in which particles in three archives are used to deal with the above two challenges. First, particles who have better fitness (i.e., elites) are recorded in one archive while other particles who offer faster progress, called profiteers in this article, are saved in another archive. Second, when breeding each dimension of a potential exemplar for a particle, we choose a pair of elite and profiteer from corresponding archives as two parents to generate the dimension value by ordinary genetic operators. Third, each particle carries out a specific learning model according to the fitness of its potential exemplars. Furthermore, there is no acceleration coefficient in TAPSO aiming to simplify the learning models. Finally, if an exemplar has excellent performance, it will be regarded as an outstanding exemplar and saved in the third archive, which can be reused by inferior particles aiming to enhance the exploitation and to save computing resources. The experimental results and comparisons between TAPSO and other eight PSOs on 30 benchmark functions and four real applications suggest that TAPSO attains very promising performance in different types of functions, contributing to both higher solution accuracy and faster convergence speed. Furthermore, the effectiveness and efficiency of these new proposed strategies are discussed based on extensive experiments.},

To consider the fact that original data space does not well characterize the intrinsic geometric structure, we learn the latent representation of data, which is shared by different views, from the latent subspace rather than the original data space by linear transformation. Thus, the learned latent representation has a low-rank structure without solving the nuclear-norm. This reduces the computational complexity. Then, the similarity matrix is adaptively learned from the learned latent representation by manifold learning which well characterizes the local intrinsic geometric structure and neighbor relationship between data. Finally, we integrate clustering, manifold learning, and latent representation into a unified framework and develop a novel subspace learning-based multiview clustering method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

In particular, the state-of-the-art salient object detection methods enjoy high accuracy and efficiency from fully convolutional network (FCN)-based frameworks which are trained from end to end and predict pixel-wise labels. However, such framework suffers from adversarial attacks which confuse neural networks via adding quasi-imperceptible noises to input images without changing the ground truth annotated by human subjects. To our knowledge, this paper is the first one that mounts successful adversarial attacks on salient object detection models and verifies that adversarial samples are effective on a wide range of existing methods. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end trainable framework to enhance the robustness for arbitrary FCN-based salient object detection models against adversarial attacks. The proposed framework adopts a novel idea that first introduces some new generic noise to destroy adversarial perturbations, and then learns to predict saliency maps for input images with the introduced noise. Specifically, our proposed method consists of a segment-wise shielding component, which preserves boundaries and destroys delicate adversarial noise patterns and a context-aware restoration component, which refines saliency maps through global contrast modeling. The experimental results suggest that our proposed framework improves the performance significantly for state-of-the-art models on a series of datasets.},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) has established itself as a simple but efficient population-based, nonconvex optimization algorithm for continuous search spaces. Unlike the conventional real-coded genetic algorithms (GAs) and evolution strategies (ESs), DE uses a mandatory self-referential mutation for its population members, each of which are perturbed with the scaled difference(s) of the individuals from the current generation (iteration). These difference vectors determine the direction of the search moves for the individuals. However, unlike the better individuals, they are not retained in the elitist evolution cycle of DE. In this paper, we show that by archiving the most promising difference vectors from past generations and then by reusing them for generating offspring in the subsequent generations, we can strikingly improve the performance of DE. This strategy can be integrated with any classical or advanced DE variant with no serious overhead in time or space complexity. We demonstrate that when combined with the DE-based winners of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2013, 2014, and 2017 competitions on real parameter optimization, the simple reuse strategy leads to a statistically significant performance improvement in the majority of test cases. We further showcase the efficacy of our proposal on a practical optimization problem concerning the design of circular antenna arrays with a prespecified radiation pattern.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses two key issues in RGB-D salient object detection based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). 1) How to bridge the gap between the “data-hungry” nature of CNNs and the insufficient labeled training data in the depth modality? 2) How to take full advantages of the complementary information among two modalities. To solve the first problem, we model the depth-induced saliency detection as a CNN-based cross-modal transfer learning problem. Instead of directly adopting the RGB CNN as initialization, we additionally train a modality classification network (MCNet) to encourage discriminative modality-specific representations in minimizing the modality classification loss. To solve the second problem, we propose a densely cross-level feedback topology, in which the cross-modal complements are combined in each level and then densely fed back to all shallower layers for sufficient cross-level interactions. Compared to traditional two-stream frameworks, the proposed one can better explore, select, and fuse cross-modal cross-level complements. Experiments show the significant and consistent improvements of the proposed CNN framework over other state-of-the-art methods.},

Compared with the existing results for the CPSs with multiple transmission channels, the computational burden of designing observer-based controller is reduced, and the resilience against DoS is improved by adopting the proposed finite-time partial observers.

First, to overcome the difficulties caused by the nonlinear time-varying dynamics of process and to enable the RVFLNs to learn online and to avoid data saturation, an improved online sequential version of RVFLNs (OS-RVFLNs) is presented by sequential learning with forgetting factor. It has been shown that the improved OS-RVFLNs with forgetting factor is not only suitable for the large-scale and real-time data transfer situation but also can adjust the sensitivity of the algorithm to different samples. Second, in order to solve the issue of modeling robustness when the dataset is contaminated with various outliers, a Cauchy distribution function weighted M-estimator is introduced to strengthen the robustness of the improved OS-RVFLNs. The non-Gaussian Cauchy distribution function is used to estimate the weights of different data and thus the corresponding contribution on modeling can be properly distinguished. Experiments using actual industrial data of a large BF ironmaking process have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm produces a much stronger robustness and better estimation accuracy than other algorithms.},

In this paper, we present an ℓ 2,1 -norm constrained canonical correlation analysis (CCA) model, that is, L 2,1 -CCA, toward discovering compact and discriminative representation for the data associated with multiple views. To well exploit the complementary and coherent information across multiple views, the ℓ 2,1 -norm is employed to constrain the canonical loadings and measure the canonical correlation loss term simultaneously. It enables, on the one hand, the canonical loadings to be with the capacity of variable selection for facilitating the interpretability of the learned canonical variables, and on the other hand, the learned canonical common representation keeps highly consistent with the most canonical variables from each view of the data. Meanwhile, the proposed L 2,1 -CCA can also be provided with the desired insensitivity to noise (outliers) to some degree. To solve the optimization problem, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm and give its convergence analysis both theoretically and experimentally. Considerable experiment results on several realworld datasets have demonstrated that L 2,1 -CCA can achieve competitive or better performance in comparison with some representative approaches for multiview representation learning.},

This paper aims to develop a systematic methodology for analyzing complex dynamics in nonlinear networks with such emerging nanoscale mem-elements. The technique extends the flux-charge analysis method (FCAM) for nonlinear circuits with memristors to a broader class of nonlinear networks N containing also memcapacitors and meminductors. After deriving the constitutive relation and equivalent circuit in the flux-charge domain of each two-terminal element in N, this paper focuses on relevant subclasses of N for which a state equation description can be obtained. On this basis, salient features of the dynamics are highlighted and studied analytically: 1) the presence of invariant manifolds in the autonomous networks; 2) the coexistence of infinitely many different reduced-order dynamics on manifolds; and 3) the presence of bifurcations due to changing the initial conditions for a fixed set of parameters (also known as bifurcations without parameters). Analytic formulas are also given to design nonautonomous networks subject to pulses that drive trajectories through different manifolds and nonlinear reduced-order dynamics. The results, in this paper, provide a method for a comprehensive understanding of complex dynamical features and computational capabilities in nonlinear networks with mem-elements, which is fundamental for a holistic approach in neuromorphic systems with such emerging nanoscale devices.},

  abstract     = {We embed a spiking cerebellar model within an adaptive real-time (RT) control loop that is able to operate a real robotic body (iCub) when performing different vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) tasks. The spiking neural network computation, including event- and time-driven neural dynamics, neural activity, and spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms, leads to a nondeterministic computation time caused by the neural activity volleys encountered during cerebellar simulation. This nondeterministic computation time motivates the integration of an RT supervisor module that is able to ensure a well-orchestrated neural computation time and robot operation. Actually, our neurorobotic experimental setup (VOR) benefits from the biological sensory motor delay between the cerebellum and the body to buffer the computational overloads as well as providing flexibility in adjusting the neural computation time and RT operation. The RT supervisor module provides for incremental countermeasures that dynamically slow down or speed up the cerebellar simulation by either halting the simulation or disabling certain neural computation features (i.e., STDP mechanisms, spike propagation, and neural updates) to cope with the RT constraints imposed by the real robot operation. This neurorobotic experimental setup is applied to different horizontal and vertical VOR adaptive tasks that are widely used by the neuroscientific community to address cerebellar functioning. We aim to elucidate the manner in which the combination of the cerebellar neural substrate and the distributed plasticity shapes the cerebellar neural activity to mediate motor adaptation. This paper underlies the need for a two-stage learning process to facilitate VOR acquisition.},

We regard the optimized TFS as the “skeleton” (blueprint) of the original fuzzy set. Based on this skeleton, we further extend the TFS to a higher type, that is, an interval type-2 TFS (IT2 TFS), so that more information about the original fuzzy set could be captured but the number of the parameters used to describe the original fuzzy set is still maintained low (nine parameters are required for an IT2 TFS). The principle of justifiable granularity is used to ensure that the formed type-2 information granule exhibits a sound interpretation. Both synthetic fuzzy sets and those constructed by the fuzzy C-means algorithm applied to the publicly available data have been used to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approximation methods.},

  abstract     = {The main challenge of cross-domain text classification is to train a classifier in a source domain while applying it to a different target domain. Many transfer learning-based algorithms, for example, dual transfer learning, triplex transfer learning, etc., have been proposed for cross-domain classification, by detecting a shared low-dimensional feature representation for both source and target domains. These methods, however, often assume that the word clusters matrix or the clusters association matrix as knowledge transferring bridges are exactly the same across different domains, which is actually unrealistic in real-world applications and, therefore, could degrade classification performance. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a softly associative transfer learning algorithm for cross-domain text classification. Specifically, we integrate two non-negative matrix tri-factorizations into a joint optimization framework, with approximate constraints on both word clusters matrices and clusters association matrices so as to allow proper diversity in knowledge transfer, and with another approximate constraint on class labels in source domains in order to handle noisy labels. An iterative algorithm is then proposed to solve the above problem, with its convergence verified theoretically and empirically. Extensive experimental results on various text datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, even with the presence of abundant state-of-the-art competitors.},

A natural question that arises is whether these methods can be reformulated into a unifying framework and whether this framework assists in SR reconstruction? In this paper, we present a simple but effective single image SR method based on ensemble learning, which can produce a better performance than that could be obtained from any of SR methods to be ensembled (or called component super-resolvers). Based on the assumption that better component super-resolver should have larger ensemble weight when performing SR reconstruction, we present a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework for the inference of optimal ensemble weights. Especially, we introduce a reference dataset, which is composed of high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) image pairs, to measure the SR abilities (prior knowledge) of different component super-resolvers. To obtain the optimal ensemble weights, we propose to incorporate the reconstruction constraint, which states that the degenerated HR estimation should be equal to the LR observation one, as well as the prior knowledge of ensemble weights into the MAP estimation framework. Moreover, the proposed optimization problem can be solved by an analytical solution. We study the performance of the proposed method by comparing with different competitive approaches, including four state-of-the-art nondeep learning-based methods, four latest deep learning-based methods, and one ensemble learning-based method, and prove its effectiveness and superiority on some general image datasets and face image datasets.},

Two types of models are commonly used to generate ranking results: 1) long-term models and 2) session-based models. The long-term-based models represent the interactions between users and movies that are supposed to change slowly across time, while the session-based models encode the information of users&#39; interests and changing dynamics of movies&#39; attributes in short terms. In this paper, we propose the LSIC model, leveraging long and short-term information for content-aware movie recommendation using adversarial training. In the adversarial process, we train a generator as an agent of reinforcement learning which recommends the next movie to a user sequentially. We also train a discriminator which attempts to distinguish the generated list of movies from the real records. The poster information of movies is integrated to further improve the performance of movie recommendation, which is specifically essential when few ratings are available. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model has robust superiority over competitors and achieves the state-of-the-art results.},

The design objective is to learn the optimal control parameters by using only the measurable input-output data, without requiring model information. A state parametrization scheme is presented which reconstructs the system state based on the filtered input and output signals. Based on this parametrization, two new output feedback adaptive dynamic programming Bellman equations are derived for the LQR problem based on policy iteration and value iteration (VI). Unlike the existing output feedback methods for continuous-time systems, the need to apply discrete approximation is obviated. In contrast with the static output feedback controllers, the proposed method can also handle systems that are state feedback stabilizable but not static output feedback stabilizable. An advantage of this scheme is that it stands immune to the exploration bias issue. Moreover, it does not require a discounted cost function and, thus, ensures the closed-loop stability and the optimality of the solution. Compared with earlier output feedback results, the proposed VI method does not require an initially stabilizing policy. We show that the estimates of the control parameters converge to those obtained by solving the LQR algebraic Riccati equation. A comprehensive simulation study is carried out to verify the proposed algorithms.},

First, we give a selection criteria of the coupling gains, the eigenvalues of communication topology, and the event-triggered sampling interval to guarantee the hybrid consensus, which have an impact on system stability, due to the interaction and co-existence of discrete-time and continuous-time individuals. Second, the hybrid second-order consensus under the event-triggered strategy is proven, where the agents communicate with their neighbors and update their controllers only at the triggered instants. Finally, we give some simulation examples to prove the validity of the main results.},

  abstract     = {Due to the increasing complexity of optimization problems, distributed differential evolution (DDE) has become a promising approach for global optimization. However, similar to the centralized algorithms, DDE also faces the difficulty of strategies’ selection and parameters’ setting. To deal with such problems effectively, this article proposes an adaptive DDE (ADDE) to relieve the sensitivity of strategies and parameters. In ADDE, three populations called exploration population, exploitation population, and balance population are co-evolved concurrently by using the master–slave multipopulation distributed framework. Different populations will adaptively choose their suitable mutation strategies based on the evolutionary state estimation to make full use of the feedback information from both individuals and the whole corresponding population. Besides, the historical successful experience and best solution improvement are collected and used to adaptively update the individual parameters (amplification factor ${F}$ and crossover rate CR) and population parameter (population size ${N}$ ), respectively. The performance of ADDE is evaluated on all 30 widely used benchmark functions from the CEC 2014 test suite and all 22 widely used real-world application problems from the CEC 2011 test suite. The experimental results show that ADDE has great superiority compared with the other state-of-the-art DDE and adaptive differential evolution variants.},

A novel dynamic event-triggered protocol is employed in the data transmission from sensors to the observer with hope to improve the efficiency of resource utilization, where the threshold parameters are adaptive to the dynamical environment.

To deal with the random deception attacks induced by open networks, a networked power system model is well established, which couples the effects of METS and random deception attacks in a unified framework. Then, a sufficient stabilization criterion is derived to obtain the memory H ∞ LFC controller gains and event-triggered parameters simultaneously.

It is proved that the proposed adaptive RL optimal controllers can guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop systems are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The main feature is that the proposed schemes can solve the optimal control problem that the previous literature cannot deal with.

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral imaging, providing abundant spatial and spectral information simultaneously, has attracted a lot of interest in recent years. Unfortunately, due to the hardware limitations, the hyperspectral image (HSI) is vulnerable to various degradations, such as noises (random noise), blurs (Gaussian and uniform blur), and downsampled (both spectral and spatial downsample), each corresponding to the HSI denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks, respectively. Previous HSI restoration methods are designed for one specific task only. Besides, most of them start from the 1-D vector or 2-D matrix models and cannot fully exploit the structurally spectral–spatial correlation in 3-D HSI. To overcome these limitations, in this article, we propose a unified low-rank tensor recovery model for comprehensive HSI restoration tasks, in which nonlocal similarity within spectral–spatial cubic and spectral correlation are simultaneously captured by third-order tensors. Furthermore, to improve the capability and flexibility, we formulate it as a weighted low-rank tensor recovery (WLRTR) model by treating the singular values differently. We demonstrate the reweighed strategy, which has been extensively studied in the matrix, also greatly benefits the tensor modeling. We also consider the stripe noise in HSI as the sparse error by extending WLRTR to robust principal component analysis (WLRTR-RPCA). Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed WLRTR models consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods in typical HSI low-level vision tasks, including denoising, destriping, deblurring, and super-resolution.},

We first design several potential functions to guide the microsatellites to the given planar elliptical orbit with a proper radius. Next, the affine Laplacian matrix is introduced to characterize the desired formation shape of microsatellites. Based on the potential functions and the Laplacian matrix, a CCN control law is finally proposed.

Based on the observations that residual sorting can effectively reveal the data relationship (i.e., determine whether two data points belong to the same structure), and keypoint matching scores can be used to distinguish inliers from gross outliers, AGS effectively combines the benefits of residual sorting and keypoint matching scores to efficiently generate accurate hypotheses via information theoretic principles. Moreover, we reduce the computational cost of residual sorting in AGS by designing a new residual sorting strategy, which only sorts the top-ranked residuals of input data, rather than all input data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in computer vision tasks, such as homography matrix and fundamental matrix estimation.},

  abstract     = {The studies dealing with the problem of predicting scientific impacts in the scientific world mostly focus on predicting citation count of papers (PCCP). However, in the literature, only a little bit of research has been conducted on estimating the future influence of scientists individually. Estimating the impact of scientists individually is a worthwhile task for the following scientific research and cooperatives. From this point of view, a new supervised link prediction method is proposed to predict the citation count of scientists (PCCS). Many PCCP studies employ document-based attributes, such as titles, abstracts, and keywords of papers; institutions of scientists; impact factors of publishers; etc. and they do not take advantage of any topological features of complex networks formed with citations among papers. However, citation networks include valuable features for PCCP and PCCS. Therefore, we formulate the problem of PCCS as a link prediction problem in directed, weighted, and temporal citation networks. The proposed approach predicts not only links but also its weights. Our supervised link prediction method is tested on two citation networks in Experiment 1. The results of Experiment 1 confirm that our method achieves promising performances when considering prediction links with its weights are addressed for the first time in terms of link prediction in directed, weighted, and temporal networks. In Experiment 2, the performance of the proposed link prediction metric and five well-known link prediction metrics are compared in terms of prediction new links in complex networks. The results of Experiment 2 demonstrate that the proposed link prediction metric outperforms all baseline link prediction metrics.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) facilitates approximate reasoning in fuzzy rule-based systems only with sparse knowledge available, remedying the limitation of conventional compositional rule of inference working with a dense rule base. Most of the existing FRI work assumes equal significance of the conditional attributes in the rules while performing interpolation. Recently, interesting techniques have been reported for achieving weighted interpolative reasoning. However, they are either particularly tailored to perform classification problems only or employ attribute weights that are obtained using additional information (rather than just the given rules), without integrating them with the associated FRI procedure. This paper presents a weighted rule interpolation scheme for performing prediction tasks by the use of fuzzy sparse knowledge only. The weights of rule conditional attributes are learned from a given rule base to discriminate the relative significance of each individual attribute and are integrated throughout the internal mechanism of the FRI process. This scheme is demonstrated using the popular scale and move transformation-based FRI for resolving prediction problems, systematically evaluated on 12 benchmark prediction tasks. The performance is compared with the relevant state-of-the-art FRI techniques, showing the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE) has been proposed to encode overall geometry manifold embedding information. However, the class-special structure of the data is destroyed by noise or outliers existing in the data. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a novel embedding approach called robust flexible preserving embedding (RFPE). First, RFPE recovers the noisy data by low-rank learning and obtains clean data. Then, the clean data are used to learn the projection matrix. In this way, the projective learning is totally unaffected by noise or outliers. By encoding a flexible regularization term, RFPE can keep the property of the data points with a nonlinear manifold and be more flexible. RFPE searches the optimal projective subspace for feature extraction. In addition, we also extend the proposed RFPE to a kernel case and propose kernel RFPE (KRFPE). Extensive experiments on six public image databases show the superiority of the proposed methods over other state-of-the-art methods.},

The self-organized system can automatically construct the communication topology for intelligent units in swarm. Swarm control can realize aggregation and dispersion of intelligent units based on its communication topology when swarm moves. The proposed swarm control, in which distances between the related intelligent units are time varying, is different from traditional swarm consensus or swarm formation maintenance. To design swarm control, we define the normalization adjacency matrix and normalization degree matrix based on communication topology. The communication topology is automatically generated based on relation-invariable persistent formation. Depending on whether the communication topology changes or not, the swarm control can be classified as fixed topology and switching topology. Then, the swarm control with fixed and switching topology is designed and analyzed, respectively. The swarm control can realize stability asymptotically when topology is fixed and realize stability in finite time when topology is switched.

  abstract     = {Combining a high-spatial-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) with a low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) has become a common way to enhance the spatial resolution of the HSI. The existing state-of-the-art LR-HSI and HR-MSI fusion methods are mostly based on the matrix factorization, where the matrix data representation may be hard to fully make use of the inherent structures of 3-D HSI. We propose a nonlocal sparse tensor factorization approach, called the NLSTF_SMBF, for the semiblind fusion of HSI and MSI. The proposed method decomposes the HSI into smaller full-band patches (FBPs), which, in turn, are factored as dictionaries of the three HSI modes and a sparse core tensor. This decomposition allows to solve the fusion problem as estimating a sparse core tensor and three dictionaries for each FBP. Similar FBPs are clustered together, and they are assumed to share the same dictionaries to make use of the nonlocal self-similarities of the HSI. For each group, we learn the dictionaries from the observed HR-MSI and LR-HSI. The corresponding sparse core tensor of each FBP is computed via tensor sparse coding. Two distinctive features of NLSTF_SMBF are that: 1) it is blind with respect to the point spread function (PSF) of the hyperspectral sensor and 2) it copes with spatially variant PSFs. The experimental results provide the evidence of the advantages of the NLSTF_SMBF method over the existing state-of-the-art methods, namely, in semiblind scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Supply chain network design (SCND) is a complicated constrained optimization problem that plays a significant role in the business management. This article extends the SCND model to a large-scale SCND with uncertainties (LUSCND), which is more practical but also more challenging. However, it is difficult for traditional approaches to obtain the feasible solutions in the large-scale search space within the limited time. This article proposes a cooperative coevolutionary bare-bones particle swarm optimization (CCBBPSO) with function independent decomposition (FID), called CCBBPSO-FID, for a multiperiod three-echelon LUSCND problem. For the large-scale issue, binary encoding of the original model is converted to integer encoding for dimensionality reduction, and a novel FID is designed to efficiently decompose the problem. For obtaining the feasible solutions, two repair methods are designed to repair the infeasible solutions that appear frequently in the LUSCND problem. A step translation method is proposed to deal with the variables out of bounds, and a labeled reposition operator with adaptive probabilities is designed to repair the infeasible solutions that violate the constraints. Experiments are conducted on 405 instances with three different scales. The results show that CCBBPSO-FID has an evident superiority over contestant algorithms.},

In this article, we introduce the control cost in signed networks and present a cost-aware robust control (CRC) problem in this scenario. The aim of CRC is to minimize the cost to control a set of dominating nodes and transform a set of unbalanced links into balanced ones, such that the signed network can be robustly controlled without uncertain unbalanced factors (like nodes and links). To solve this problem, we first model CRC as a constrained combination optimization problem, and then present a memetic algorithm with some problem-specific knowledge (like the neighbors of nodes, the constraints of CRC, and the fast computation of the cost under each optimization) to solve this problem on signed networks. The extensive experiments on both real social and biological networks assess that our algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art RC algorithms.},

The theoretical basis for processing the continuous q-rung orthopair fuzzy information is q-rung orthopair fuzzy calculus (q-ROFC) and the main object is q-rung orthopair fuzzy functions (q-ROFFs). Recently, the authors proposed derivatives and differentials of q-ROFFs in the framework of q-ROFC. In this paper, we aim to further study the q-rung orthopair fuzzy integral (q-ROFI). It is the most important and fundamental part of the q-ROFC theoretical system with direct and powerful applications. Our contribution is the indefinite and definite integrals, and bridges the fuzzy calculus theoretical gap of the nonlinear q-ROFFs. In particular, we begin with the indefinite integral of q-ROFFs, which can be regarded as the anti-derivatives operations of our previous work. Some of their basic properties are discussed. Next, we give the accurate concept of definite integrals of q-ROFFs under additive operations, and obtain the explicit integral formula. Some properties of q-ROFIs, such as comparison, algebraic operations, and mean value theorem are analyzed. Finally, we generalize the q-ROFI to the case when membership and nonmembership functions are allowed to be correlated. After the theoretical results have been established, we present some numerical examples to demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of integrating continuous q-rung orthopair fuzzy data with the q-ROFIs.},

  abstract     = {Representation-based classification (RC) methods, such as sparse RC, have shown great potential in face recognition (FR) in recent years. Most previous RC methods are based on the conventional regression models, such as lasso regression, ridge regression, or group lasso regression. These regression models essentially impose a predefined assumption on the distribution of the noise variable in the query sample, such as the Gaussian or Laplacian distribution. However, the complicated noises in practice may violate the assumptions and impede the performance of these RC methods. In this paper, we propose a modal regression (MR)-based atomic representation and classification (MRARC) framework to alleviate such limitations. MR is a robust regression framework which aims to reveal the relationship between the input and response variables by regressing toward the conditional mode function. Atomic representation is a general atomic norm regularized linear representation framework which includes many popular representation methods, such as sparse representation, collaborative representation, and low-rank representation as special cases. Unlike previous RC methods, the MRARC framework does not require the noise variable to follow any specific predefined distributions. This gives rise to the capability of MRARC in handling various complex noises in reality. Using MRARC as a general platform, we also develop four novel RC methods for unimodal and multimodal FR, respectively. In addition, we devise a general optimization algorithm for the unified MRARC framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers and half-quadratic theory. The experiments on real-world data validate the efficacy of MRARC for robust FR and reconstruction.},

Moreover, a switching protocol together with a linear manifold is proposed to ensure that fixed-time leader-following consensus is realized for any initial conditions without causing singularity issues. In contrast to alternative fixed-time consensus protocols in some existing results, the protocol proposed in this article is designed by constructing the nonlinear or linear manifold, which builds a new framework for fixed-time leader-following consensus. Furthermore, the obtained upper bound of settling time is explicitly linked with a single parameter in the protocol, which facilitates the adjustment of the bound under different performance requirements.

In the case of a constant step size, the results indicate that a sufficiently small constant step size allows a solution to the problem to be approximated. In the case of a decreasing step size, conditions are shown under which the algorithm converges in probability to a solution. For the third case, a variation of the basic proposed algorithm also achieves convergence in probability to a solution.

  abstract     = {The objective of this paper is to present an approximation-based strategy for solving the problem of nonlinear trajectory optimization with the consideration of probabilistic constraints. The proposed method defines a smooth and differentiable function to replace probabilistic constraints by the deterministic ones, thereby converting the chance-constrained trajectory optimization model into a parametric nonlinear programming model. In addition, it is proved that the approximation function and the corresponding approximation set will converge to that of the original problem. Furthermore, the optimal solution of the approximated model is ensured to converge to the optimal solution of the original problem. Numerical results, obtained from a new chance-constrained space vehicle trajectory optimization model and a 3-D unmanned vehicle trajectory smoothing problem, verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Comparative studies were also carried out to show the proposed design can yield good performance and outperform other typical chance-constrained optimization techniques investigated in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Graph clustering, which aims at discovering sets of related vertices in graph-structured data, plays a crucial role in various applications, such as social community detection and biological module discovery. With the huge increase in the volume of data in recent years, graph clustering is used in an increasing number of real-life scenarios. However, the classical and state-of-the-art methods, which consider only single-view features or a single vector concatenating features from different views and neglect the contextual correlation between pairwise features, are insufficient for the task, as features that characterize vertices in a graph are usually from multiple views and the contextual correlation between pairwise features may influence the cluster preference for vertices. To address this challenging problem, we introduce in this paper, a novel graph clustering model, dubbed contextual correlation preserving multiview featured graph clustering (CCPMVFGC) for discovering clusters in graphs with multiview vertex features. Unlike most of the aforementioned approaches, CCPMVFGC is capable of learning a shared latent space from multiview features as the cluster preference for each vertex and making use of this latent space to model the inter-relationship between pairwise vertices. CCPMVFGC uses an effective method to compute the degree of contextual correlation between pairwise vertex features and utilizes view-wise latent space representing the feature-cluster preference to model the computed correlation. Thus, the cluster preference learned by CCPMVFGC is jointly inferred by multiview features, view-wise correlations of pairwise features, and the graph topology. Accordingly, we propose a unified objective function for CCPMVFGC and develop an iterative strategy to solve the formulated optimization problem. We also provide the theoretical analysis of the proposed model, including convergence proof and computational complexity analysis. In our experiments, we extensively compare the proposed CCPMVFGC with both classical and state-of-the-art graph clustering methods on eight standard graph datasets (six multiview and two single-view datasets). The results show that CCPMVFGC achieves competitive performance on all eight datasets, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Bounded delays and unbounded delays have been taken into consideration, respectively. First, a new generalized Halanay inequality on time scales is constructed by time-scale theory and some analytical techniques. Based on this inequality, the stabilization of NRNNs with bounded delays is discussed on time scales. The results are also applied to the synchronization of a class of drive-response NRNNs. Furthermore, the stabilization of NRNNs with unbounded delays is investigated. Especially, the stabilization of NRNNs with proportional delays is obtained without any variable transformation. The obtained generalized Halanay inequality on time scales develops and extends some existing ones in the literature. The stabilization criteria for the NRNNs with bounded or unbounded delays cover the results of continuous-time and discrete-time NRNNs and hold the results for the systems that involved on time interval as well. Some examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the results. An application to image encryption and decryption is addressed.},

By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and utilizing Cauchy-Schwartz-based summation inequality, the delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the existence of the desired estimator are derived in the absence of uncertainties which are further extended to available uncertain parameters of the prescribed memristor-based BAMNNs in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

It cannot only handle the complex multimodal recognition problem efficiently but also exploit the relations among the features, attributes, labels, and classes with semantic knowledge: 1) an adaptive multimodal mechanism (AMM) is proposed in convolutional neural network (CNN) to substantially promote the CNN sampling and transformation capability and significantly raise the output feature map resolutions by keeping almost all of the information; 2) deep attribute relation graph learning (DARGL) is proposed to jointly estimate the large numbers of heterogeneous attributes and collaboratively explore the relations among the features, attributes, labels, and classes with common knowledge graphs; and 3) relational-regularized convolutional sparse learning (RCSL) is proposed to further achieve good translation invariance and improve the accuracy and speed of the entire system.

It has demonstrated that both the real and the imaginary representation of GFR obey a Laplace distribution. Accordingly, the amplitude representation of GFR obeys a Gamma distribution. Whereas the phase representation of GFR is an important yet frequently ignored aspect in Gabor-based signal analysis; it is demonstrated to be a periodic distribution and can be expressed by a von Mises-like distribution model. Successively, a local spline regression (LSR)-based classifier that the maps scattered statistical feature points of froth images directly to the operation-state labels smoothly is introduced for the operation-state recognition. Extensive confirmatory and comparative experiments on an industrial-scale bauxite flotation process demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Performance effects on different parameter settings, e.g., parameters of Gabor kernel and dimensionalities of multivariate statistical models, are further discussed.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a multiuser cooperative mobile edge computing offloading (called CoMECO) system in a multiuser interference environment, in which delay-sensitive tasks may be executed on local devices, cooperative devices, or the primary MEC server. In this system, we jointly optimize the offloading decision and computation resource allocation for minimizing the total energy consumption of all mobile users under the delay constraint. If this problem is solved directly, the offloading decision and computation resource allocation are generally generated separately at the same time. Note, however, that they are closely coupled. Therefore, under this condition, their dependency is not well considered, thus leading to poor performance. We transform this problem into a bilevel optimization problem, in which the offloading decision is generated in the upper level, and then the optimal allocation of computation resources is obtained in the lower level based on the given offloading decision. In this way, the dependency between the offloading decision and computation resource allocation can be fully taken into account. Subsequently, a bilevel optimization approach, called BiJOR, is proposed. In BiJOR, candidate modes are first pruned to reduce the number of infeasible offloading decisions. Afterward, the upper-level optimization problem is solved by ant colony system (ACS). Furthermore, a sorting strategy is incorporated into ACS to construct feasible offloading decisions with a higher probability and a local search operator is designed in ACS to accelerate the convergence. For the lower-level optimization problem, it is solved by the monotonic optimization method. In addition, BiJOR is extended to deal with a complex scenario with the channel selection. Extensive experiments are carried out to investigate the performance of BiJOR on two sets of instances with up to 400 mobile users. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BiJOR and the superiority of the CoMECO system.},

Existing agent advising approaches have two limitations. The first limitation is that all the agents in a system are assumed to be friendly and cooperative. However, in the real world, malicious agents may exist and provide false advice to hinder the learning performance of other agents. The second limitation is that the analysis of communication overhead in these approaches is either overlooked or simplified. However, in communication-constrained environments, communication overhead has to be carefully considered. To overcome the two limitations, this paper proposes a novel differentially private agent advising approach. Our approach employs the Laplace mechanism to add noise on the rewards used by student agents to select teacher agents. By using the differential privacy technique, the proposed approach can reduce the impact of malicious agents without identifying them. Also, by adopting the privacy budget concept, the proposed approach can naturally control communication overhead. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

On social media, users&#39; ratings and reviews can be observed by all users, and have implicit influence on their future ratings. When these users make subsequent decisions about an item, they may be affected by existing ratings on the item. Thus, implicit influence propagates among the users who rated the same items, and it has significant impact on users&#39; ratings. However, implicit influence propagation and its effect on recommendation rarely have been studied. In this article, we propose an information propagation-based social recommendation method (SoInp) and model the implicit user influence from the perspective of information propagation. The implicit influence is inferred from ratings on the same items. We investigate the concrete effect of implicit user influence in the propagation process and introduce it into recommender systems. Furthermore, we incorporate the implicit user influence and explicit trust information in the matrix factorization framework. To demonstrate the performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets to compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art models. The results indicate that SoInp makes notable improvements in rating prediction.},

Multiple packet losses, Markovian communication constraints, and superposed process noise are considered simultaneously. In order to reduce the channel load during communication, at every step, just one transmission node is permitted to send data packets. Hence, a Markovian communication protocol is utilized to arrange the packets of these transmission nodes. Moreover, multiple data packet dropouts occur during transmission due to an imperfect communication channel. Therefore, the global observation information cannot be obtained by the state estimator. The real state of Markov chain is assumed to be unknown to the estimator except the transition probability matrix. By means of the innovation analysis approach and orthogonal projection principle, we design Kalman-like estimators in a recursive form.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised image hashing has recently gained significant momentum due to the scarcity of reliable supervision knowledge, such as class labels and pairwise relationship. Previous unsupervised methods heavily rely on constructing sufficiently large affinity matrix for exploring the geometric structure of data. Nevertheless, due to lack of adequately preserving the intrinsic information of original visual data, satisfactory performance can hardly be achieved. In this article, we propose a novel approach, called bidirectional discrete matrix factorization hashing (BDMFH), which alternates two mutually promoted processes of 1) learning binary codes from data and 2) recovering data from the binary codes. In particular, we design the inverse factorization model, which enforces the learned binary codes inheriting intrinsic structure from the original visual data. Moreover, we develop an efficient discrete optimization algorithm for the proposed BDMFH. Comprehensive experimental results on three large-scale benchmark datasets show that the proposed BDMFH not only significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts but also provides the satisfactory computational efficiency.},

Based on the formulation, a centralized Q-learning-based optimization algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm runs in an online manner and requires no prior information on the mathematical formulation of the actual cost functions, thus being capable of dealing with situations for which such cost functions are too difficult to obtain. Then, the distributed counterpart of the centralized algorithm is developed by relaxing the demand for global information and balancing exploration and exploitation cooperatively in a distributed way. Theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithms is also provided. Finally, several case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel technique to achieve plant-wide performance optimization for large-scale unknown industrial processes by integrating the reinforcement learning method with the multiagent game theory. A main advantage of this technique is that plant-wide optimal performance is achieved by a distributed approach where multiple agents solve simplified local nonzero-sum optimization problems so that a global Nash equilibrium is reached. To this end, first, the plant-wide performance optimization problem is reformulated by decomposition into local optimization subproblems for each production index in a multiagent framework. Then, the nonzero-sum graphical game theory is utilized to compute the operational indices for each unit process with the purpose of reaching the global Nash equilibrium, resulting in production indices following their prescribed target values. The stability and the global Nash equilibrium of this multiagent graphical game solution are rigorously proved. The reinforcement learning methods are then developed for each agent to solve the nonzero-sum graphical game problem using data measurements available in the system in real time. The plant dynamics do not have to be known. Finally, the emulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed automated decision algorithm by using measured data from a large mineral processing plant in Gansu Province, China.},

To this end, we first show the existence of the weighted gains which play an essential role for solving the consensus problem. Then, we establish the relationship between the weighted gains and scalar parameters to guarantee that the underlying “Laplacian” matrix contains a simple zero eigenvalue and the remaining eigenvalues enjoy positive real parts. Based on the above analysis, we further proceed to solve the considered problem. A major difficulty is that the Laplacian matrices, associated with the position and velocity information, are entirely distinct from each other, leading to the failure of the conventional consensus method for the second-order dynamics. We derive some criteria involving the weighted gains, the scaling parameters, and the real/image parts of the Laplacian matrix of the interaction graph. Moreover, some special frameworks, which have been extensively studied in the literature, are also elaborated on. Compared with the Altafini&#39;s model, we do not need to redefine a new Laplacian matrix, and more important, the restriction on the digon sign-symmetry property is removed. It is worth mentioning that the proposed consensus algorithm cannot be deduced by the Altafini&#39;s model or its variants. Finally, a wheeled multirobot system is formulated to validate the efficiency of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of online social networks not only enables prompt and convenient dissemination of desirable information but also incurs fast and wide propagation of undesirable information. A common way to control the spread of pollutants is to block some nodes, but such a strategy may affect the service quality of a social network and leads to a high control cost if too many nodes are blocked. This paper considers the node selection problem as a biobjective optimization problem to find a subset of nodes to be blocked so that the effect of the control is maximized while the cost of the control is minimized. To solve this problem, we design an ant colony optimization algorithm with an adaptive dimension size selection under the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm framework based on decomposition (MOEA/D-ADACO). The proposed algorithm divides the biobjective problem into a set of single-objective subproblems and each ant takes charge of optimizing one subproblem. Moreover, two types of pheromone and heuristic information are incorporated into MOEA/D-ADACO, that is, pheromone and heuristic information of dimension size selection and that of node selection. While constructing solutions, the ants first determine the dimension size according to the former type of pheromone and heuristic information. Then, the ants select a specific number of nodes to build solutions according to the latter type of pheromone and heuristic information. Experiments conducted on a set of real-world online social networks confirm that the proposed biobjective optimization model and the developed MOEA/D-ADACO are promising for the pollutant spreading control.},

These measures take into account the uncertainty information in the lower and the upper approximations. The relationships between these measures and their properties are discussed in detail. It is proven that the fourth measure, called relative neighborhood self-information, is better for feature selection than the other measures, because not only does it consider both the lower and the upper approximations but also the change of its magnitude is largest with the variation of feature subsets. This helps to facilitate the selection of optimal feature subsets. Finally, a greedy algorithm for feature selection has been designed and a series of numerical experiments was carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Since modes of original systems cannot be directly obtained, the hidden Markov model is employed to detect mode information. With the detected mode and the parallel distributed compensation approach, a suitable fuzzy integral sliding surface is devised. Then using Lyapunov function, a sufficient condition for the existence of sliding mode controller gains is developed, which can also ensure the stochastic stability of the sliding mode dynamics with a satisfactory dissipative performance. An AFISMC law is proposed to drive system trajectories into the predetermined sliding mode boundary layer in finite time. For the case with unknown bound of uncertainties, an adaptive AFISMC law is developed as well. The studied T-S fuzzy Markov jump systems involve both continuous-time and discrete-time domains.

A distributed interval observer is first constructed for uncertain networked systems in which the control algorithm of each agent involves only the upper bound information and the lower bound information of the interval observer associated with itself and its neighbors, respectively. With the help of the cooperativity theory, it is proved that the interval observer can estimate the piecewise state for each agent and the interval-observer-based control algorithm can drive the uncertain system to achieve coordination behavior. Then, time-varying coordinate transformation is introduced to construct a novel interval observer which can eliminate the cooperativity premise on the system matrices and bound the states of all agents in real time. It is shown that the novel interval-observer-based control algorithm can guide the uncertain system to reach coordinated behavior. Finally, the numerical simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Process monitoring based on deep learning has attracted considerable attention. Generally, several hidden layers exist in the deep-learning model, and only the output information of the last hidden layer neurons extracted by deep learning is applied. Considering that each hidden layer is a kind of information representation of the original data, the information of different hidden layers may contain positive elements for process monitoring. In this article, we found that when a fault occurs, there are some neurons in each hidden layer that the information they output are different, compared with the normal condition. These neurons are called unstable neurons. Obviously, the information they output are beneficial for process monitoring. Motivated by theoretical analysis and experimental studies on unstable neurons, a novel method (UN-DBN) based on the unstable neurons in hidden layers is proposed to integrate the useful information for process monitoring, the Euclidean metric, the moving average filter, and the kernel density estimation technique are employed to provide an intuitionistic expression of the working state. The comparable result applied on a mathematic simulation process and the TE process with other advanced monitoring methods confirms the superiority and feasibility of the proposed method UN-DBN in this article.},

  abstract     = {This article establishes a new multiunmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) system, where a number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are deployed as flying edge clouds for large-scale mobile users. In this system, we need to optimize the deployment of UAVs, by considering their number and locations. At the same time, to provide good services for all mobile users, it is necessary to optimize task scheduling. Specifically, for each mobile user, we need to determine whether its task is executed locally or on a UAV (i.e., offloading decision), and how many resources should be allocated (i.e., resource allocation). This article presents a two-layer optimization method for jointly optimizing the deployment of UAVs and task scheduling, with the aim of minimizing system energy consumption. By analyzing this system, we obtain the following property: the number of UAVs should be as small as possible under the condition that all tasks can be completed. Based on this property, in the upper layer, we propose a differential evolution algorithm with an elimination operator to optimize the deployment of UAVs, in which each individual represents a UAV&#39;s location and the entire population represents an entire deployment of UAVs. During the evolution, we first determine the maximum number of UAVs. Subsequently, the elimination operator gradually reduces the number of UAVs until at least one task cannot be executed under delay constraints. This process achieves an adaptive adjustment of the number of UAVs. In the lower layer, based on the given deployment of UAVs, we transform the task scheduling into a 0-1 integer programming problem. Due to the large-scale characteristic of this 0-1 integer programming problem, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm to obtain the near-optimal solution with much less time. The effectiveness of the proposed two-layer optimization method and the established multi-UAV-enabled MEC system is demonstrated on ten instances with up to 1000 mobile users.},

To analyze the stealthiness of the attack, the attack signal is decomposed into two parts, one of which is strict stealthy. The necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the case that the strict stealthy attack cannot lead to an unbounded benefit. In this case, the linear transformation of the optimal attack is proved to be a Gaussian distribution. With the mean value and covariance of the Gaussian distribution as variables, the original problem is transformed into a new problem which may not be convex.

  abstract     = {Histopathology image analysis serves as the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. Efficient and precise diagnosis is quite critical for the subsequent therapeutic treatment of patients. So far, computer-aided diagnosis has not been widely applied in pathological field yet as currently well-addressed tasks are only the tip of the iceberg. Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a quite challenging problem. First, the scarcity of annotations heavily impedes the pace of developing effective approaches. Pixelwise delineated annotations on WSIs are time consuming and tedious, which poses difficulties in building a large-scale training dataset. In addition, a variety of heterogeneous patterns of tumor existing in high magnification field are actually the major obstacle. Furthermore, a gigapixel scale WSI cannot be directly analyzed due to the immeasurable computational cost. How to design the weakly supervised learning methods to maximize the use of available WSI-level labels that can be readily obtained in clinical practice is quite appealing. To overcome these challenges, we present a weakly supervised approach in this article for fast and effective classification on the whole slide lung cancer images. Our method first takes advantage of a patch-based fully convolutional network (FCN) to retrieve discriminative blocks and provides representative deep features with high efficiency. Then, different context-aware block selection and feature aggregation strategies are explored to generate globally holistic WSI descriptor which is ultimately fed into a random forest (RF) classifier for the image-level prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to exploit the potential of image-level labels along with some coarse annotations for weakly supervised learning. A large-scale lung cancer WSI dataset is constructed in this article for evaluation, which validates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method that surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin with an accuracy of 97.3\%. In addition, our method also achieves the best performance on the public lung cancer WSIs dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We highlight that a small number of coarse annotations can contribute to further accuracy improvement. We believe that weakly supervised learning methods have great potential to assist pathologists in histology image diagnosis in the near future.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, image processing in a Euclidean domain has been well studied. Practical problems in computer vision and geometric modeling involve image data defined in irregular domains, which can be modeled by huge graphs. In this paper, a wavelet frame-based fuzzy $C$ -means (FCM) algorithm for segmenting images on graphs is presented. To enhance its robustness, images on graphs are first filtered by using spatial information. Since a real image usually exhibits sparse approximation under a tight wavelet frame system, feature spaces of images on graphs can be obtained. Combining the original and filtered feature sets, this paper uses the FCM algorithm for segmentation of images on graphs contaminated by noise of different intensities. Finally, some supporting numerical experiments and comparison with other FCM-related algorithms are provided. Experimental results reported for synthetic and real images on graphs demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient, and has a better ability for segmentation of images on graphs than other improved FCM algorithms existing in the literature. The approach can effectively remove noise and retain feature details of images on graphs. It offers a new avenue for segmenting images in irregular domains.},

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation (DA) aims to generalize a learning model across training and testing data despite the mismatch of their data distributions. In light of a theoretical estimation of the upper error bound, we argue, in this article, that an effective DA method for classification should: 1) search a shared feature subspace where the source and target data are not only aligned in terms of distributions as most state-of-the-art DA methods do but also discriminative in that instances of different classes are well separated and 2) account for the geometric structure of the underlying data manifold when inferring data labels on the target domain. In comparison with a baseline DA method which only cares about data distribution alignment between source and target, we derive three different DA models for classification, namely, close yet discriminative DA (CDDA), geometry-aware DA (GA-DA), and discriminative and GA-DA (DGA-DA), to highlight the contribution of CDDA based on 1), GA-DA based on 2), and, finally, DGA-DA implementing jointly 1) and 2). Using both the synthetic and real data, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DA methods over 49 image classification DA tasks through eight popular benchmarks.

The choice of deep neural networks is particularly interesting as they can represent exponentially many more affine regions compared to networks with only one hidden layer. We provide theoretical bounds on the minimum number of hidden layers and neurons per layer that a neural network should have to exactly represent a given MPC law. The proposed approach has a strong potential as an approximation method of predictive control laws, leading to a better approximation quality and significantly smaller memory requirements than previous approaches, as we illustrate via simulation examples. We also suggest different alternatives to correct or quantify the approximation error.

  abstract     = {One-shot image semantic segmentation poses a challenging task of recognizing the object regions from unseen categories with only one annotated example as supervision. In this article, we propose a simple yet effective similarity guidance network to tackle the one-shot (SG-One) segmentation problem. We aim at predicting the segmentation mask of a query image with the reference to one densely labeled support image of the same category. To obtain the robust representative feature of the support image, we first adopt a masked average pooling strategy for producing the guidance features by only taking the pixels belonging to the support image into account. We then leverage the cosine similarity to build the relationship between the guidance features and features of pixels from the query image. In this way, the possibilities embedded in the produced similarity maps can be adopted to guide the process of segmenting objects. Furthermore, our SG-One is a unified framework that can efficiently process both support and query images within one network and be learned in an end-to-end manner. We conduct extensive experiments on Pascal VOC 2012. In particular, our SG-One achieves the mIoU score of 46.3\%, surpassing the baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained remarkable success on many image classification tasks in recent years. However, the performance of CNNs highly relies upon their architectures. For the most state-of-the-art CNNs, their architectures are often manually designed with expertise in both CNNs and the investigated problems. Therefore, it is difficult for users, who have no extended expertise in CNNs, to design optimal CNN architectures for their own image classification problems of interest. In this article, we propose an automatic CNN architecture design method by using genetic algorithms, to effectively address the image classification tasks. The most merit of the proposed algorithm remains in its “automatic” characteristic that users do not need domain knowledge of CNNs when using the proposed algorithm, while they can still obtain a promising CNN architecture for the given images. The proposed algorithm is validated on widely used benchmark image classification datasets, compared to the state-of-the-art peer competitors covering eight manually designed CNNs, seven automatic + manually tuning, and five automatic CNN architecture design algorithms. The experimental results indicate the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing automatic CNN architecture design algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, parameter numbers, and consumed computational resources. The proposed algorithm also shows the very comparable classification accuracy to the best one from manually designed and automatic + manually tuning CNNs, while consuming fewer computational resources.},

This article addresses an important aspect of deep RL related to situations that require multiple agents to communicate and cooperate to solve complex tasks. A survey of different approaches to problems related to multiagent deep RL (MADRL) is presented, including nonstationarity, partial observability, continuous state and action spaces, multiagent training schemes, and multiagent transfer learning. The merits and demerits of the reviewed methods will be analyzed and discussed with their corresponding applications explored. It is envisaged that this review provides insights about various MADRL methods and can lead to the future development of more robust and highly useful multiagent learning methods for solving real-world problems.},

Based on this, a necessary and sufficient criterion is proposed for the global set stabilization of PBCNs by SD state-feedback control within finite time. Moreover, the time-optimal SD state-feedback controller is designed. It is interesting that if the sampled period (SP) is changed, the time of global set stabilization of PBCNs may also change or even the PBCNs cannot achieve set stabilization. Second, a criterion for the global set stabilization of PBCNs by SD state-feedback control within infinite time is obtained. Furthermore, all possible SD state-feedback controllers are obtained by using all the complete families of reachable sets. Finally, three examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

To surmount the design difficulty from nonaffine nonlinear term with multi-input and single-output (MISO) faulty modes, a novel nonlinear fault compensation function with adjustable parameter factor is first introduced to establish a standard adaptive fault-tolerant control (AFTC) strategy based on the mean-value theorem. Then, the remaining nonlinear function, including the partial loss of effectiveness, outage, and stuck cases, together with the constructed compound nonlinear function can be approximated by using the suitable fuzzy-logic system (FLS). Moreover, it is shown that all the states of nonaffine stochastic nonlinear systems are not violating the preset constraint bounds by employing the barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs). Also, the given adaptive controller can guarantee all the closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) in probability in the sense of fourth-moment within the appropriate compact sets.

To facilitate such challenges, this paper proposes a control system consisting of a novel type of fuzzy neural network and a robust compensator controller. The new fuzzy neural network is implemented by integrating a number of key components embedded in a Type-2 fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) and a brain emotional learning controller (BELC) network, thereby mimicking an ideal sliding mode controller. The system inputs are fed into the neural network through a Type-2 fuzzy inference system (T2FIS), with the results subsequently piped into sensory and emotional channels which jointly produce the final outputs of the network. That is, the proposed network estimates the nonlinear equations representing the ideal sliding mode controllers using a powerful compensator controller with the support of T2FIS and BELC, guaranteeing robust tracking of the dynamics of the controlled systems. The adaptive dynamic tuning laws of the network are developed by exploiting the popular brain emotional learning rule and the Lyapunov function. The proposed system was applied to a robot manipulator and a mobile robot, demonstrating its efficacy and potential; and a comparative study with alternatives indicates a significant improvement by the proposed system in performing the intelligent dynamic control.},

A state observer is first designed to estimate immeasurable system states, and then a novel observer-based backstepping control framework is proposed for DTSFNSs with known model information. To be specific, virtual control laws and the actual control law are derived using a variable substitution method that gets rid of the repeated accumulation of measurement noises in the recursive process. Furthermore, for technical derivation, the multiplicative noise is successively bounded by state estimation errors and controlled errors. Stability conditions are obtained to guarantee the exponential mean-square boundedness of the closed-loop system. Moreover, the nonlinear modeling uncertainties are taken into account to better reflect engineering practices. In virtue of the universal approximation property of fuzzy-logic systems, a fuzzy observer and the corresponding fuzzy output-feedback controller are simultaneously constructed to derive the stability criteria by using novel weight updated laws.

Different from previous studies, the proposed method significantly reshapes the desired trajectory during physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) based on force feedback, without requiring constant human guidance. The proposed scheme first formulates a quadratically constrained programming problem, which is then solved by neural dynamics optimization to obtain a smooth and minimal-energy trajectory similar to the natural human movement. Then, we propose an adaptive neural-network controller based on the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), which enables the robot to handle the uncertain dynamics and the joint space constraints directly.

Relative measurements related to local tracking errors are collected via some smart sensors. A local nonquadratic cost function is first introduced to evaluate the control performance with input constraints. Then, in view of the relative measurements, an NN-based observer under the event-triggered mechanism is designed to reconstruct the dynamics of the local tracking errors, where the adopted event-triggered condition has a time-dependent threshold and the weight of NNs is updated via a new adaptive tuning law catering to the employed event-triggered mechanism. Furthermore, an ideal control policy is developed for the addressed consensus control problem while minimizing the prescribed local nonquadratic cost function. Moreover, an actor–critic NN scheme with online learning is employed to realize the obtained control policy, where the critic NN is a three-layer structure with powerful approximation capability. Through extensive mathematical analysis, the consensus condition is established for the underlying MAS, and the boundedness of the estimated errors is proven for actor and critic NN weights. In addition, the effect from the adopted event-triggered mechanism on the local cost is thoroughly discussed, and the upper bound of the corresponding increment is derived in comparison with time-triggered cases.

  abstract     = {There exist many multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) containing a large number of decision variables in real-world applications, which are known as large-scale MOPs. Due to the ineffectiveness of existing operators in finding optimal solutions in a huge decision space, some decision variable division-based algorithms have been tailored for improving the search efficiency in solving large-scale MOPs. However, these algorithms will encounter difficulties when solving problems with complicated landscapes, as the decision variable division is likely to be inaccurate and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a competitive swarm optimizer (CSO)-based efficient search for solving large-scale MOPs. The proposed algorithm adopts a new particle updating strategy that suggests a two-stage strategy to update position, which can highly improve the search efficiency. The experimental results on large-scale benchmark MOPs and an application example demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over several state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, including problem transformation-based algorithm, decision variable clustering-based algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, and estimation of distribution algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Due to the multimodality of non-Gaussian data, traditional globality-preserved dimensionality reduction (DR) methods, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) are difficult to deal with. In this paper, we present a novel local DR framework via auto-optimized graph embedding to extract the intrinsic submanifold structure of multimodal data. Specifically, the proposed model seeks to learn an embedding space which can preserve the local neighborhood structure by constructing a k-nearest neighbors (kNNs) graph on data points. Different than previous works, our model employs the ℓ 0 -norm constraint and binary constraint on the similarity matrix to impose that there only be a k nonzero value in each row of the similarity matrix, which can ensure the k-connectivity in graph. More important, as the high-dimensional data probably contains some noises and redundant features, calculating the similarity matrix in the original space by using a kernel function is inaccurate. As a result, a mechanism of an auto-optimized graph is derived in the proposed model. Concretely, we learn the embedding space and similarity matrix simultaneously. In other words, the selection of neighbors is automatically executed in the optimal subspace rather than in the original space when the algorithm reaches convergence, which can alleviate the affect of noises and improve the robustness of the proposed model. In addition, four supervised and semi-supervised local DR methods are derived by the proposed framework which can extract the discriminative features while preserving the submanifold structure of data. Last but not least, since two variables need to be optimized simultaneously in the proposed methods, and the constraints on the similarity matrix are difficult to satisfy, which is an NP-hard problem. Consequently, an efficient iterative optimization algorithm is introduced to solve the proposed problems. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic data and several real-world datasets have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed methods in robustness and recognition accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Ear-electroencephalography (EEG) is a promising tool for practical brain-computer interface (BCI) applications because it is more unobtrusive, comfortable, and mobile than a typical scalp-EEG system. However, an ear-EEG has a natural constraint of electrode location (e.g., limited in or around the ear) for acquiring informative brain signals sufficiently. Achieving reliable performance of ear-EEG in specific BCI paradigms that do not utilize brain signals on the temporal lobe around the ear is difficult. For example, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), which are mainly generated in the occipital area, have a significantly attenuated and distorted amplitude in ear-EEG. Therefore, preserving the high level of decoding accuracy is challenging and essential for SSVEP BCI based on ear-EEG. In this paper, we first investigate linear and nonlinear regression methods to increase the decoding accuracy of ear-EEG regarding SSVEP paradigm by utilizing the estimated target EEG signals on the occipital area. Then, we investigate an ensemble method to consider the prediction variability of the regression methods. Finally, we propose an error correction regression (ECR) framework to reduce the prediction errors by adding an additional nonlinear regression process (i.e., kernel ridge regression). We evaluate the ECR framework in terms of single session, session-to-session transfer, and subject-transfer decoding. We also validate the online decoding ability of the proposed framework with a short-time window size. The average accuracies are observed to be 91.11±9.14\%, 90.52±8.67\%, 86.96±12.13\%, and 78.79±12.59\%. This paper demonstrates that SSVEP BCI based on ear-EEG can achieve reliable performance with the proposed ECR framework.},

Despite promising results obtained on some applications, the performance of existing methods deteriorates dramatically when the multiview data is sampled from nonlinear manifolds or suffers from heavy outliers. To circumvent this drawback, motivated by the Divide-and-Conquer strategy, we propose multiview hybrid embedding (MvHE), a unique method of dividing the problem of cross-view classification into three subproblems and building one model for each subproblem. Specifically, the first model is designed to remove view discrepancy, whereas the second and third models attempt to discover the intrinsic nonlinear structure and to increase the discriminability in intraview and interview samples, respectively. The kernel extension is conducted to further boost the representation power of MvHE. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets. Our methods demonstrate the overwhelming advantages against the state-of-the-art MvSL-based cross-view classification approaches in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.},

In this article, we propose a novel depth-guided transformation model (DTM) going from RGB saliency to RGBD saliency. The proposed model includes three components, that is: 1) multilevel RGBD saliency initialization; 2) depth-guided saliency refinement; and 3) saliency optimization with depth constraints. The explicit depth feature is first utilized in the multilevel RGBD saliency model to initialize the RGBD saliency by combining the global compactness saliency cue and local geodesic saliency cue. The depth-guided saliency refinement is used to further highlight the salient objects and suppress the background regions by introducing the prior depth domain knowledge and prior refined depth shape. Benefiting from the consistency of the entire object in the depth map, we formulate an optimization model to attain more consistent and accurate saliency results via an energy function, which integrates the unary data term, color smooth term, and depth consistency term. Experiments on three public RGBD saliency detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and performance improvement of the proposed DTM from RGB to RGBD saliency.},

A logic processor embedded in the controller is introduced to not only receive sampled signals but also capture information on the duration time of each DoS attack. Note that the duration time of DoS attacks is usually both lower and upper bounded. Then the closed-loop system is modeled as an aperiodic sampled-data system closely related to both lower and upper bounds of duration time of DoS attacks. By introducing a novel looped functional, which caters for the N-order canonical Bessel-Legendre inequalities, some N-dependent stability criteria are presented for the resultant closed-loop system. It is worth pointing out that a number of identity formulas are uncovered, which enable us to apply the notable free-weighting matrix approach to derive less conservative stability criteria. A linear-matrix-inequality-based criterion is provided to design stabilizing state-feedback controllers against DoS attacks. A satellite control system is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The RR protocol is introduced to mitigate a network burden by determining which component of the sensor node has access to the network at each transmission instant. The purpose of the issue under consideration is to construct a distributed recursive filter such that a certain filtering error covariance&#39;s upper bound can be found and the corresponding filter parameters&#39; explicit expression is given with both state saturations and RR protocols. By taking advantage of matrix difference equations, a filtering error covariance&#39;s upper bound can be presented and then be minimized by appropriately designing filter parameters.

  abstract     = {Deeper and wider convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve superior performance but bring expensive computation cost. Accelerating such overparameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical pruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and retraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during retraining and, thus, significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they directly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause unrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an asymptotic soft filter pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference procedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters during the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned model would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In this way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data. Second, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and asymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With asymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually concentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning process would be stable. The experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on image classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more than 40\% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14\% top-5 accuracy degradation, which is higher than the soft filter pruning by 8\%.},

  abstract     = {Mixed noise (such as Gaussian, impulse, stripe, and deadline noises) contamination is a common phenomenon in hyperspectral imagery (HSI), greatly degrading visual quality and affecting subsequent processing accuracy. By encoding sparse prior to the spatial or spectral difference images, total variation (TV) regularization is an efficient tool for removing the noises. However, the previous TV term cannot maintain the shared group sparsity pattern of the spatial difference images of different spectral bands. To address this issue, this article proposes a group sparsity regularization of the spatial difference images for HSI restoration. Instead of using ℓ 1 or ℓ 2 -norm (sparsity) on the difference image itself, we introduce a weighted ℓ 2,1 norm to constrain the spatial difference image cube, efficiently exploring the shared group sparse pattern. Moreover, we employ the well-known low-rank Tucker decomposition to capture the global spatial-spectral correlation from three HSI dimensions. To summarize, a weighted group sparsity-regularized low-rank tensor decomposition (LRTDGS) method is presented for HSI restoration. An efficient augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithm is employed to solve the LRTDGS model. The superiority of this method for HSI restoration is demonstrated by a series of experimental results from both simulated and real data, as compared with the other state-of-the-art TV-regularized low-rank matrix/tensor decomposition methods.},

Compared with the recent result from three important aspects (conservatism level, online computational burden, and offline computational burden), three positive results can be obtained: 1) it provides a chance for reducing the conservatism by a large margin; 2) the required online computational burden remains unchanged as referred ones; and 3) as a tradeoff, the required offline computational burden increases to some extent but is still affordable from the view of complexity analysis.

  abstract     = {In multiobjective optimization, it is nontrivial for decision makers to articulate preferences without a priori knowledge, which is particularly true when the number of objectives becomes large. Depending on the shape of the Pareto front, optimal solutions such as knee points may be of interest. Although several multi- and many-objective optimization test suites have been proposed, little work has been reported focusing on designing multiobjective problems whose Pareto front contains complex knee regions. Likewise, few performance indicators dedicated to evaluate an algorithm&#39;s ability of accurately locating all knee points in high-dimensional objective space have been suggested. This paper proposes a set of multiobjective optimization test problems whose Pareto front consists of complex knee regions, aiming to assess the capability of evolutionary algorithms to accurately identify all knee points. Various features related to knee points have been taken into account in designing the test problems, including symmetry, differentiability, and degeneration. These features are also combined with other challenges in solving the optimization problems, such as multimodality, linkage between decision variables, nonuniformity, and scalability of the Pareto front. The proposed test problems are scalable to both decision and objective spaces. Accordingly, new performance indicators are suggested for evaluating the capability of optimization algorithms in locating the knee points. The proposed test problems, together with the performance indicators, offer a new means to develop and assess preference-based evolutionary algorithms for solving multi- and many-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Multiview subspace clustering has received significant attention as the availability of diverse of multidomain and multiview real-world data has rapidly increased in the recent years. Boosting the performance of multiview clustering algorithms is challenged by two major factors. First, since original features from multiview data are highly redundant, reconstruction based on these attributes inevitably results in inferior performance. Second, since each view of such multiview data may contain unique knowledge as against the others, it remains a challenge to exploit complimentary information across multiple views while simultaneously investigating the uniqueness of each view. In this paper, we present a novel dual shared-specific multiview subspace clustering (DSS-MSC) approach that simultaneously learns the correlations between shared information across multiple views and also utilizes view-specific information to depict specific property for each independent view. Further, we formulate a dual learning framework to capture shared-specific information into the dimensional reduction and self-representation processes, which strengthens the ability of our approach to exploit shared information while preserving view-specific property effectively. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach against other state-of-the-art techniques.},

Obviously, there are not any unstable subsystems in unswitched systems. The unstable subsystems will involve many serious consequences and difficulties. Since the system states are unavailable, a switched state observer is designed. In addition, the fuzzy-logic systems (FLSs) are employed to approximate unknown internal dynamics in the controller design procedure. Then, the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is exploited to guarantee that the system output satisfy its constrained interval. Moreover, by using the average dwell-time method, all signals in the resulting systems are proofed to be bounded even when faults occur.

In this paper, we propose a subregion division-based evolutionary algorithm with an effective mating selection strategy, termed SdEA, for many-objective optimization. In SdEA, a subregion division approach is proposed to divide the objective space into different subregions for balancing the diversity and convergence of the population. Besides, an effective mating selection strategy is proposed to enhance the diversity of the mating pool solutions, aimed at enhancing the selection probability of solutions in the sparse subregions. The proposed SdEA is compared with five state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on 23 test problems from DTLZ, WFG, and MaF test suites. Experimental results on these problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive in solving many-objective problems. Furthermore, the proposed mating selection strategy is embedded in several evolutionary algorithms and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness on improving the performance of the embedded algorithms.},

Based on the above assumptions, an event-based protocol consisting of two different measurements corresponding to leader–followers and follower–follower is presented to schedule communications between agents, which can reduce the update frequency of the controller. Then, the stability of the resultant error system is analyzed to derive sufficient conditions of achieving secure consensus by employing the Lyapunov function and the inductive approach. Besides, positive low bounds on any two consecutive intervals of events generated by individual events are calculated to eliminate “Zeno behavior” under the developed triggering condition and event-triggered protocol.

The state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for IMOPs (IMOEAs) need a great deal of objective function evaluations to find a final Pareto front with good convergence and even distribution. Further, the final Pareto front is of great uncertainty. In this paper, we incorporate several local searches into an existing IMOEA, and propose a memetic algorithm (MA) to tackle IMOPs. At the start, the existing IMOEA is utilized to explore the entire decision space; then, the increment of the hypervolume is employed to develop an activation strategy for every local search procedure; finally, the local search procedure is conducted by constituting its initial population, whose center is an individual with a small uncertainty and a big contribution to the hypervolume, taking the contribution of an individual to the hypervolume as its fitness function, and performing the conventional genetic operators. The proposed MA is empirically evaluated on ten benchmark IMOPs as well as an uncertain solar desalination optimization problem and compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms with no local search procedure. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed MA.},

As a consequence, the MGR scheme not only eliminates the local optimal problem but also guarantees faster convergence rate than the gradient descent scheme.

  abstract     = {Classification of partially occluded images is a highly challenging computer vision problem even for the cutting-edge deep learning technologies. To achieve a robust image classification for occluded images, this article proposes a novel scheme using the subspace decomposition-based estimation (SDBE). The proposed SDBE-based classification scheme first employs a base convolutional neural network to extract the deep feature vector (DFV) and then utilizes the SDBE to compute the DFV of the original occlusion-free image for classification. The SDBE is performed by projecting the DFV of the occluded image onto the linear span of a class dictionary (CD) along the linear span of an occlusion error dictionary (OED). The CD and OED are constructed, respectively, by concatenating the DFVs of a training set and the occlusion error vectors of an extra set of image pairs. Two implementations of the SDBE are studied in this article: 1) the l 1 -norm and 2) the squared l 2 -norm regularized least-squares estimates. By employing the ResNet-152, pretrained on the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 (ILSVRC2012) training set, as the base network, the proposed SBDE-based classification scheme is extensively evaluated on the Caltech-101 and ILSVRC2012 datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SDBE-based scheme dramatically boosts the classification accuracy for occluded images, and achieves around 22.25\% increase in classification accuracy under 20\% occlusion on the ILSVRC2012 dataset.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale optimization with high dimensionality and high computational cost becomes ubiquitous nowadays. To tackle such challenging problems efficiently, devising distributed evolutionary computation algorithms is imperative. To this end, this paper proposes a distributed swarm optimizer based on a special master-slave model. Specifically, in this distributed optimizer, the master is mainly responsible for communication with slaves, while each slave iterates a swarm to traverse the solution space. An asynchronous and adaptive communication strategy based on the request-response mechanism is especially devised to let the slaves communicate with the master efficiently. Particularly, the communication between the master and each slave is adaptively triggered during the iteration. To aid the slaves to search the space efficiently, an elite-guided learning strategy is especially designed via utilizing elite particles in the current swarm and historically best solutions found by different slaves to guide the update of particles. Together, this distributed optimizer asynchronously iterates multiple swarms to collaboratively seek the optimum in parallel. Extensive experiments on a widely used large-scale benchmark set substantiate that the distributed optimizer could: 1) achieve competitive effectiveness in terms of solution quality as compared to the state-of-the-art large-scale methods; 2) accelerate the execution of the algorithm in comparison with the sequential one and obtain almost linear speedup as the number of cores increases; and 3) preserve a good scalability to solve higher dimensional problems.},

  abstract     = {As a hot topic in brain disease prognosis, predicting clinical measures of subjects based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data helps to assess the stage of pathology and predict future development of the disease. Due to incomplete clinical labels/scores, previous learning-based studies often simply discard subjects without ground-truth scores. This would result in limited training data for learning reliable and robust models. Also, existing methods focus only on using hand-crafted features (e.g., image intensity or tissue volume) of MRI data, and these features may not be well coordinated with prediction models. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised densely connected neural network (wiseDNN) for brain disease prognosis using baseline MRI data and incomplete clinical scores. Specifically, we first extract multiscale image patches (located by anatomical landmarks) from MRI to capture local-to-global structural information of images, and then develop a weakly supervised densely connected network for task-oriented extraction of imaging features and joint prediction of multiple clinical measures. A weighted loss function is further employed to make full use of all available subjects (even those without ground-truth scores at certain time-points) for network training. The experimental results on 1469 subjects from both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can efficiently predict future clinical measures of subjects.},

  abstract     = {In many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), forming sound tradeoffs between convergence and diversity for the environmental selection of evolutionary algorithms is a laborious task. In particular, strengthening the selection pressure of population toward the Pareto-optimal front becomes more challenging, since the proportion of nondominated solutions in the population scales up sharply with the increase of the number of objectives. To address these issues, this paper first defines the nondominated solutions exhibiting evident tendencies toward the Pareto-optimal front as prominent solutions, using the hyperplane formed by their neighboring solutions, to further distinguish among nondominated solutions. Then, a novel environmental selection strategy is proposed with two criteria in mind: 1) if the number of nondominated solutions is larger than the population size, all the prominent solutions are first identified to strengthen the selection pressure. Subsequently, a part of the other nondominated solutions are selected to balance convergence and diversity and 2) otherwise, all the nondominated solutions are selected; then a part of the dominated solutions are selected according to the predefined reference vectors. Moreover, based on the definition of prominent solutions and the new selection strategy, we propose a hyperplane assisted evolutionary algorithm, referred here as hpaEA, for solving MaOPs. To demonstrate the performance of hpaEA, extensive experiments are conducted to compare it with five state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on 36 many-objective benchmark instances. The experimental results show the superiority of hpaEA which significantly outperforms the compared algorithms on 20 out of 36 benchmark instances.},

In this paper, an automated system based on deep learning is presented for angle-closure detection in AS-OCT images. Our system learns a discriminative representation from training data that captures subtle visual cues not modeled by handcrafted features. A multilevel deep network is proposed to formulate this learning, which utilizes three particular AS-OCT regions based on clinical priors: 1) the global anterior segment structure; 2) local iris region; and 3) anterior chamber angle (ACA) patch. In our method, a sliding window-based detector is designed to localize the ACA region, which addresses ACA detection as a regression task. Then, three parallel subnetworks are applied to extract AS-OCT representations for the global image and at clinically relevant local regions. Finally, the extracted deep features of these subnetworks are concatenated into one fully connected layer to predict the angle-closure detection result. In the experiments, our system is shown to surpass previous detection methods and other deep learning systems on two clinical AS-OCT datasets.},

  abstract     = {The multimodal optimization problem (MMOP) requires the algorithm to find multiple global optima of the problem simultaneously. In order to solve MMOP efficiently, a novel differential evolution (DE) algorithm based on the local binary pattern (LBP) is proposed in this paper. The LBP makes use of the neighbors&#39; information for extracting relevant pattern information, so as to identify the multiple regions of interests, which is similar to finding multiple peaks in MMOP. Inspired by the principle of LBP, this paper proposes an LBP-based adaptive DE (LBPADE) algorithm. It enables the LBP operator to form multiple niches, and further to locate multiple peak regions in MMOP. Moreover, based on the LBP niching information, we develop a niching and global interaction (NGI) mutation strategy and an adaptive parameter strategy (APS) to fully search the niching areas and maintain multiple peak regions. The proposed NGI mutation strategy incorporates information from both the niching and the global areas for effective exploration, while APS adjusts the parameters of each individual based on its own LBP information and guides the individual to the promising direction. The proposed LBPADE algorithm is evaluated on the extensive MMOPs test functions. The experimental results show that LBPADE outperforms or at least remains competitive with some state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a convolutional neural network (CNN) semantic re-ranking system to enhance the performance of sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR). Distinguished from the existing approaches, the proposed system can leverage category information brought by CNNs to support effective similarity measurement between the images. To achieve effective classification of query sketches and high-quality initial retrieval results, one CNN model is trained for classification of sketches, another for that of natural images. Through training dual CNN models, the semantic information of both the sketches and natural images is captured by deep learning. In order to measure the category similarity between images, a category similarity measurement method is proposed. Category information is then used for re-ranking. Re-ranking operation first infers the retrieval category of the query sketch and then uses the category similarity measurement to measure the category similarity between the query sketch and each initial retrieval result. Finally, the initial retrieval results are re-ranked. The experiments on different types of SBIR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed re-ranking method. Comparisons with other re-ranking algorithms are also given to show the proposed method&#39;s superiority. Further, compared to the baseline systems, the proposed re-ranking approach achieves significantly higher precision in the top ten different SBIR methods and datasets.},

First, we design four types of convolutional and transposed convolutional layers that consider the characteristics of HSIs to help with extracting discriminative features from limited numbers of labeled HSI samples. Second, we construct semisupervised generative adversarial networks (GANs) to alleviate the shortage of training samples by adding labels to them and implicitly reconstructing real HSI data distribution through adversarial training. Third, we build dense conditional random fields (CRFs) on top of the random variables that are initialized to the softmax predictions of the trained GANs and are conditioned on HSIs to refine classification maps. This semisupervised framework leverages the merits of discriminative and generative models through a game-theoretical approach. Moreover, even though we used very small numbers of labeled training HSI samples from the two most challenging and extensively studied datasets, the experimental results demonstrated that spectral-spatial GAN-CRF (SS-GAN-CRF) models achieved top-ranking accuracy for semisupervised HSI classification.},

  abstract     = {Industrial products&#39; reuse, recovery, and recycling are very important because of their environmental and economic benefits. Effective product disassembly planning methods can improve their recovery efficiency and reduce their bad environmental impact. However, the existing approaches pay little attention to sequence-dependent disassembly with resource constraints, such as limited disassembly operators and tools, which makes the current planning methods ineffective in practice. This paper considers a multiobjective resource-constrained and sequence-dependent disassembly optimization problem with disassembly precedence constraints. Energy consumption is adopted to evaluate the disassembly efficiency. Its use with traditional optimization criterion leads to a novel multiobjective optimization model such that the energy consumption and disassembly time are minimized while disassembly profit is maximized. Since the problem complexity increases with the number of components in a product, a lexicographic multiobjective scatter search (SS) method is proposed to solve the proposed multiobjective optimization problem. Its effectiveness is verified by comparing the results of linear weight SS and genetic algorithms. The results show that it is able to provide a better solution in a short execution time and fulfills the precedence requirement in a product structure and resource constraints.},

Second, to efficiently generate accurate model hypotheses close to the true models, a novel global greedy search strategy initially samples from the inliers of the obtained model hypotheses and samples subsequent data subsets from the whole input data. Third, mutual information theory is applied to fuse the model hypotheses of the same model instance. The conventional greedy search strategy is used to generate model hypotheses for the remaining model instances, if the number of retained model hypotheses is less than that of the true model instances after fusion. The second and the third steps are performed iteratively until an adequate solution is obtained.

In some applications, we hope to acquire models for new persons as fast as possible, and reduce the demand for the labeled data amount. To achieve this goal, we propose a multisource transfer learning method, where existing persons are sources, and the new person is the target. The target data are divided into calibration sessions for training and subsequent sessions for test. The first stage of the method is source selection aimed at locating appropriate sources. The second is style transfer mapping, which reduces the EEG differences between the target and each source. We use few labeled data in the calibration sessions to conduct source selection and style transfer. Finally, we integrate the source models to recognize emotions in the subsequent sessions. The experimental results show that the three-category classification accuracy on benchmark SEED improves by 12.72\% comparing with the nontransfer method. Our method facilitates the fast deployment of emotion recognition models by reducing the reliance on the labeled data amount, which has practical significance especially in fast-deployment scenarios.},

Then, necessary and sufficient conditions can be obtained under a control protocol with time-varying gain.

These MASs are often equipped with small microprocessors that have limited computing capabilities, and they usually operate in a bandwidth and energy-constrained environment. The exigent need for a faster localizing algorithm under communication and computational resource constraints invites many design challenges. In this paper, we have designed a two-level hierarchical cooperative control strategy for heterogeneous nonlinear MASs for OSL. The agents are forced toward consensus expeditiously once the information on the whereabouts of the source is attained. The synthesis of the controller occurs in a hierarchical manner-obtaining a group decision, followed by resource-efficient robust control. Odor concentration and wind information have been used in a group decision-making layer to predict a probable location of the source as a tracking reference. This reference is then fed to the control layer that is synthesized using event-triggered sliding-mode control (SMC). The advantage of using event-triggered control scheduling in conjunction with the SMC is rooted in retaining the robustness of the SMC while lowering the resource utilization burden. Numerical simulations confirm the efficiency of the scheme put forth.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on current control in a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). This paper has two main objectives: the first objective is to develop a neural-network (NN) vector controller to overcome the decoupling inaccuracy problem associated with the conventional proportional-integral-based vector-control methods. The NN is developed using the full dynamic equation of a PMSM, and trained to implement optimal control based on approximate dynamic programming. The second objective is to evaluate the robust and adaptive performance of the NN controller against that of the conventional standard vector controller under motor parameter variation and dynamic control conditions by: 1) simulating the behavior of a PMSM typically used in realistic electric vehicle applications and 2) building an experimental system for hardware validation as well as combined hardware and simulation evaluation. The results demonstrate that the NN controller outperforms conventional vector controllers in both simulation and hardware implementation.},

  abstract     = {The so-called zeroing neural network (ZNN) is an effective recurrent neural network for solving dynamic problems including the dynamic nonlinear equations. There exist numerous unperturbed ZNN models that can converge to the theoretical solution of solvable nonlinear equations in infinity long or finite time. However, when these ZNN models are perturbed by external disturbances, the convergence performance would be dramatically deteriorated. To overcome this issue, this paper for the first time proposes a finite-time convergent ZNN with the noise-rejection capability to endure disturbances and solve dynamic nonlinear equations in finite time. In theory, the finite-time convergence and noise-rejection properties of the finite-time convergent and noise-rejection ZNN (FTNRZNN) are rigorously proved. For potential digital hardware realization, the discrete form of the FTNRZNN model is established based on a recently developed five-step finite difference rule to guarantee a high computational accuracy. The numerical results demonstrate that the discrete-time FTNRZNN can reject constant external noises. When perturbed by dynamic bounded or unbounded linear noises, the discrete-time FTNRZNN achieves the smallest steady-state errors in comparison with those generated by other discrete-time ZNN models that have no or limited ability to handle these noises. Discrete models of the FTNRZNN and the other ZNNs are comparatively applied to redundancy resolution of a robotic arm with superior positioning accuracy of the FTNRZNN verified.},

Then, a hybrid model of the MASs is constructed under a hybrid systems framework. Based on this hybrid model, how to construct the Lyapunov function is given and the event-triggering condition design is also developed, such that the asymptotic consensus is achieved.

First, under the framework of the generalized Caputo fractional-order derivative, some new results for fractional-order calculus are established by mainly using L&#39;Hospital&#39;s rule and Laplace transform. Besides, FICSs are translated into impulsive differential equations with fractional-order via utilizing the definition of Dirac function, which reveals that the effect of impulsive control on fractional systems is dependent of the order of the addressed systems. Furthermore, exponential stability of FICSs is proposed and some novel criteria are obtained by applying average impulsive interval and the method of induction. As an application of the stability for FICSs, exponential synchronization of FCGNNs is considered and several synchronization conditions are established under impulsive control.

Solving these optimization problems requires the knowledge of the system dynamics. To obviate this requirement, a model-free off-policy algorithm is presented to find the solution to the dynamic optimization problem using only measured data. Then, based on the solution to the dynamic optimization problem, a model-free approach is provided for the static optimization problem.

Moreover, a new Lyapunov function is considered to provide the lower and upper bounds of switching intervals explicitly. Thus, these bounds can be used to obtain less conservative stability results of switched systems.

Traditional approaches resorting to manually defined rules are gradually replaced by automated approaches empowered by machine learning. This revolution is accelerated by huge datasets which support machine-learning models with outstanding performance. In the context of a data-driven paradigm, this article reviews recent analytic research on cyber traffic over social networks and the Internet by using a set of common concepts of similarity, correlation, and collective indication, and by sharing security goals for classifying network host or applications and users or Tweets. The ability to do so is not determined in isolation, but rather drawn for a wide use of many different network or social flows. Furthermore, the flows exhibit many characteristics, such as fixed sized and multiple messages between source and destination. This article demonstrates a new research methodology of data-driven cyber security (DDCS) and its application in social and Internet traffic analysis. The framework of the DDCS methodology consists of three components, that is, cyber security data processing, cyber security feature engineering, and cyber security modeling. Challenges and future directions in this field are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Visual tracking addresses the problem of localizing an arbitrary target in video according to the annotated bounding box. In this article, we present a novel tracking method by introducing the attention mechanism into the Siamese network to increase its matching discrimination. We propose a new way to compute attention weights to improve matching performance by a sub-Siamese network [Attention Net (A-Net)], which locates attentive parts for solving the searching problem. In addition, features in higher layers can preserve more semantic information while features in lower layers preserve more location information. Thus, in order to solve the tracking failure cases by the higher layer features, we fully utilize location and semantic information by multilevel features and propose a new way to fuse multiscale response maps from each layer to obtain a more accurate position estimation of the object. We further propose a hierarchical attention Siamese network by combining the attention weights and multilayer integration for tracking. Our method is implemented with a pretrained network which can outperform most well-trained Siamese trackers even without any fine-tuning and online updating. The comparison results with the state-of-the-art methods on popular tracking benchmarks show that our method achieves better performance. Our source code and results will be available at https://github.com/shenjianbing/HASN.},

The stability and stabilization of the proposed closed-loop system have guaranteed through the Lyapunov stability theory and solvable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In detail, first, the nonlinear PMSG model has equivalently expressed into linear submodels via the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy approach based on suitable membership rules. Second, the sufficient conditions have been derived as LMIs that ensure the stability and stabilization of the formulated T-S fuzzy PMSG-based WECS.

It is a challenging task to analyze the consensus behaviors of the considered MASs as the dynamics of such MASs will be subjected to joint effects from delay-dependent impulses, aperiodic sampling, and switchings among different communication graphs. A novel analytical approach, based upon the discretization method, state augmentation, and linear state transformation, is developed to establish the sufficient consensus criteria on the range of the impulsive intervals and the control parameters. Remarkably, it is found that consensus in the closed-loop MASs can be always ensured by skillfully selecting the control parameters as long as the nonuniform delays and the impulsive intervals are bounded.

  abstract     = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system empowering humans to communicate with or control the outside world with exclusively brain intentions. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI is one of the promising solutions due to its convenient and portable instruments. Despite the extensive research of EEG in recent years, it is still challenging to interpret EEG signals effectively due to its nature of noise and difficulties in capturing the inconspicuous relations between EEG signals and specific brain activities. Most existing works either only consider EEG as chain-like sequences while neglecting complex dependencies between adjacent signals or requiring complex preprocessing. In this paper, we introduce two deep learning-based frameworks with novel spatio-temporal preserving representations of raw EEG streams to precisely identify human intentions. The two frameworks consist of both convolutional and recurrent neural networks effectively exploring the preserved spatial and temporal information in either a cascade or a parallel manner. Extensive experiments on a large scale movement intention EEG dataset (108 subjects, 3 145 160 EEG records) have demonstrated that the proposed frameworks achieve high accuracy of 98.3\% and outperform a set of state-of-the-art and baseline models. The developed models are further evaluated with a real-world brain typing BCI and achieve a recognition accuracy of 93\% over five instruction intentions suggesting good generalization over different kinds of intentions and BCI systems.},

At the same time, a fully distributed dynamic event-triggering mechanism is designed so that each agent can determine when to broadcast its information to its neighbors. Compared with existing related results, both the control law and the event-triggering mechanism in this paper are independent of any global information. It is shown that with the proposed dynamic event-triggered control strategy, the cooperative output regulation problem can be solved in a fully distributed manner by intermittent communication.

Then, a novel Lyapunov function is constructed to deal with the unknown state-dependent gain function of the controller design. The uncertain nonlinearities are approximated by employing ESNs with simple feedback structures, and the weight update laws are developed by combining the parameter adaptation in the time domain and iteration domain. Moreover, the proposed control scheme is further extended to handle the strict-feedback systems with input saturations. Through the Lyapunov-like synthesis, the closed-loop stability and error convergence of the proposed error-tracking control scheme are analyzed in the presence of the approximation errors.

The NCSs are considered as continuous-time linear multi-input multioutput (MIMO) systems with random reference noises. The controlled plants include unstable poles and nonminimum phase (NMP) zeros. The output feedback path is affected by multiple communication constraints. We focus on some basic communication constraints, including additive white noise (AWN), quantization noise, bandwidth, as well as encoder-decoder. The system performance is evaluated with the tracking error energy, and used a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) controller. The explicit representation of the tracking performance is given in this paper. The results indicate the tracking performance limitations rely to internal characteristics of the plant (unstable poles and NMP zeros), reference noises [the reference noise power distribution (RNPD) and its directions], and the characteristics of communication constraints. The characteristics of communication constraints include communication noise power distribution (CNPD); quantization noise power distribution (QNPD), and their distribution directions; transform bandwidth allocation (TBA); transform encoder-decoder allocation (TEA), and their allocation directions; and NMP zeros and MP part of bandwidth. Moreover, the tracking performance limitations are also affected by the angles between the each transform NMP zero direction and RNPD direction, and these angles between each transform unstable poles direction and the direction of communication constraint distribution/allocation. In addition, for MIMO NCSs, bandwidth (there are not identical two channels) can always affect the direction of unstable poles, and the channel allocation of bandwidth and encode-decode may be used for a feasible method for the performance allocation of each channel. Finally, an instance is given for verifying the effectiveness of the theoretical outcomes.},

In the proposed scheme, the ideal control input is derived in a recursive design process, which relies on system states only and is unrelated to virtual control laws. In this case, the high-order neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate the ideal control input (but not the virtual control laws), and then the corresponding adaptive neural controller is developed under the ET mechanism. A modified NN weight updating law, nonperiodically tuned at triggering instants, is designed to guarantee the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of NN weight estimates for all sampling times. In virtue of the bounded NN weight estimates and a dead-zone operator, the ET condition together with an adaptive ET threshold coefficient is constructed to guarantee the UUB of the closed-loop networked control system through the Lyapunov stability theory, thereby largely easing the network communication load. The proposed ET condition is easy to implement because of the avoidance of: 1) the use of the intermediate ET conditions in the backstepping procedure; 2) the computation of virtual control laws; and 3) the redundant triggering of events when the system states converge to a desired region. The validity of the presented scheme is demonstrated by simulation results.},

Based on this controller, the resulting consensus error system can be modeled as a periodic switching system. Furthermore, the exponential stability of the consensus error system is derived by utilizing the Lyapunov approach and the dwell-time analysis method. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.},

Radial basis function NNs (RBFNNs) are introduced to approximate unknown nonlinear functions. The command filter is adopted to solve the issue of “explosion of complexity.” By applying a one-to-one nonlinear mapping, the strict-feedback system with full-state constraints is converted into a new pure-feedback system without state constraints, and a novel NN control method is proposed. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved via the Lyapunov stability theory, and the tracking errors converge to small residual sets.

  abstract     = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) breaking out in late December 2019 is gradually being controlled in China, but it is still spreading rapidly in many other countries and regions worldwide. It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic. In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction. First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible–infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend. Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public’s prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52\%, 0.38\%, 0.05\%, and 0.86\% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.},

To reduce redundancy as well as noise, a CE selection (CES) step is added to further enhance performance. Quality and diversity are two important metrics of CES. However, most of the CES strategies adopt heuristic selection methods or a threshold parameter setting to achieve tradeoff between quality and diversity. In this paper, we propose a transfer CES (TCES) algorithm which makes use of the relationship between quality and diversity in a source dataset, and transfers it into a target dataset based on three objective functions. Furthermore, a multiobjective self-evolutionary process is designed to optimize these three objective functions. Finally, we construct a transfer CE framework (TCE-TCES) based on TCES to obtain better clustering results. The experimental results on 12 transfer clustering tasks obtained from the 20newsgroups dataset show that TCE-TCES can find a better tradeoff between quality and diversity, as well as obtaining more desirable clustering results.},

Second, a spatial objective function is proposed for the sensor placement. This function is defined in the obtained low-dimensional subspace by exploiting the time-space separation property of distributed processes, and in turn aims at minimizing the modeling error over the entire time and space domain. Third, the sensor placement configuration is mathematically formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) with specified elements. Finally, the sensor locations are optimized through learning the optimal policies of the MDP according to the spatial objective function. The experimental results of a simulated catalytic rod and a real snap curing oven system are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method in solving the combinatorial optimization problems, such as optimal sensor placement.},

  abstract     = {For real-world applications, multilabel learning usually suffers from unsatisfactory training data. Typically, features may be corrupted or class labels may be noisy or both. Ignoring noise in the learning process tends to result in an unreasonable model and, thus, inaccurate prediction. Most existing methods only consider either feature noise or label noise in multilabel learning. In this paper, we propose a unified robust multilabel learning framework for data with hybrid noise, that is, both feature noise and label noise. The proposed method, hybrid noise-oriented multilabel learning (HNOML), is simple but rather robust for noisy data. HNOML simultaneously addresses feature and label noise by bi-sparsity regularization bridged with label enrichment. Specifically, the label enrichment matrix explores the underlying correlation among different classes which improves the noisy labeling. Bridged with the enriching label matrix, the structured sparsity is imposed to jointly handle the corrupted features and noisy labeling. We utilize the alternating direction method (ADM) to efficiently solve our problem. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method over the state-of-the-art ones.},

Test problems are of great importance in order to facilitate the development of advanced algorithms that can handle dynamic environments well. However, many of the existing dynamic multiobjective test problems have not been rigorously constructed and analyzed, which may induce some unexpected bias when they are used for algorithmic analysis. In this paper, some of these biases are identified after a review of widely used test problems. These include poor scalability of objectives and, more important, problematic overemphasis of static properties rather than dynamics making it difficult to draw accurate conclusion about the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms studied. A diverse set of dynamics and features is then highlighted that a good test suite should have. We further develop a scalable continuous test suite, which includes a number of dynamics or features that have been rarely considered in literature but frequently occur in real life. It is demonstrated with empirical studies that the proposed test suite is more challenging to the DMO algorithms found in the literature. The test suite can also test algorithms in ways that existing test suites cannot.},

However, most of the existing tracking algorithms cannot achieve satisfactory performance in both of the two aspects. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate a novel and efficient visual tracker by exploiting the excellent feature learning and classification capabilities of an emerging learning technique, that is, extreme learning machine (ELM). The contributions of the proposed work are as follows: 1) motivated by the simplicity and learning ability of the ELM autoencoder (ELM-AE), an ELM-AE-based feature extraction model is presented, and this model can provide a compact and discriminative representation of the inputs efficiently and 2) due to the fast learning speed of an ELM classifier, an ELM-based appearance model is developed for feature classification, and is able to rapidly distinguish the object of interest from its surroundings. In addition, in order to cope with the visual changes of the target and its backgrounds, the online sequential ELM is used to incrementally update the appearance model.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the fixed-time anti-synchronization (FTAS) of discontinuous reaction-diffusion neural networks (DRDNNs) with both time-varying coefficients and time delay. First, differential inclusion theory is used to deal with the influence caused by discontinuous activations. In addition, a new fixed-time convergence theorem is used to handle the time-varying coefficients. Second, a novel state-feedback control algorithm and integral state-feedback control algorithm are proposed to realize FTAS of DRDNNs. During the generalized (adaptive) pinning control strategy, a guideline is proposed to select neurons to pin the designed controller.

  abstract     = {In recent years, neural networks have been used to generate symbolic melodies. However, the long-term structure in the melody has posed great difficulty to design a good model. In this article, we present a hierarchical recurrent neural network (HRNN) for melody generation, which consists of three long-short-term-memory (LSTM) subnetworks working in a coarse-to-fine manner along time. Specifically, the three subnetworks generate bar profiles, beat profiles, and notes, in turn, and the output of the high-level subnetworks are fed into the low-level subnetworks, serving as guidance to generate the finer time-scale melody components in the low-level subnetworks. Two human behavior experiments demonstrate the advantage of this structure over the single-layer LSTM which attempts to learn all hidden structures in melodies. Compared with the recently proposed models MidiNet and MusicVAE, the HRNN produces better melodies evaluated by humans.},

In this paper, we propose to fully exploit the edge and semantic information of a room image for layout estimation. More specifically, we present an encoder–decoder network with shared encoder and two separate decoders, which are composed of multiple deconvolution (transposed convolution) layers, to jointly learn the edge maps and semantic labels of a room image. We combine these two network predictions in a scoring function to evaluate the quality of the layouts, which are generated by ray sampling and from a predefined layout pool. Guided by the scoring function, we apply a novel refinement strategy to further optimize the layout hypotheses. Experimental results show that the proposed network can yield accurate estimates of edge maps and semantic labels. By fully utilizing the two different types of labels, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art layout estimation performance on the benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Cloud workflow scheduling is a significant topic in both commercial and industrial applications. However, the growing scale of workflow has made such a scheduling problem increasingly challenging. Many current algorithms often deal with small- or medium-scale problems (e.g., less than 1000 tasks) and face difficulties in providing satisfactory solutions when dealing with the large-scale problems, due to the curse of dimensionality. To this aim, this article proposes a dynamic group learning distributed particle swarm optimization (DGLDPSO) for large-scale optimization and extends it for the large-scale cloud workflow scheduling. DGLDPSO is efficient for large-scale optimization due to its following two advantages. First, the entire population is divided into many groups, and these groups are coevolved by using the master-slave multigroup distributed model, forming a distributed PSO (DPSO) to enhance the algorithm diversity. Second, a dynamic group learning (DGL) strategy is adopted for DPSO to balance diversity and convergence. When applied DGLDPSO into the large-scale cloud workflow scheduling, an adaptive renumber strategy (ARS) is further developed to make solutions relate to the resource characteristic and to make the searching behavior meaningful rather than aimless. Experiments are conducted on the large-scale benchmark functions set and the large-scale cloud workflow scheduling instances to further investigate the performance of DGLDPSO. The comparison results show that DGLDPSO is better than or at least comparable to other state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms and workflow scheduling algorithms.},

The fine details on some facial components fail to be generated. In this paper, inspired by the artists during drawing face sketches, we propose a bionic face sketch generator. It includes three parts: 1) a coarse part; 2) a fine part; and 3) a finer part. The coarse part builds the facial structure of a sketch by a generative adversarial network in the U-Net. In the middle part, the noise produced by the coarse part is erased and the fine details on the important face components are generated via a probabilistic graphic model. To compensate for the fine sketch with distinctive edge and area of shadows and lights, we learn a mapping relationship at the high-frequency band by a convolutional neural network in the finer part. The experimental results show that the proposed bionic face sketch generator can synthesize the face sketch with more delicate and striking details, satisfy the requirement of users in the digital entertainment, and provide the students with the coarse, fine, and finer face sketch copies when learning sketches.

  abstract     = {Exploiting reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic congestion reduction is a frontier topic in intelligent transportation research. The difficulty in this problem stems from the inability of the RL agent simultaneously monitoring multiple signal lights when taking into account complicated traffic dynamics in different regions of a traffic system. Such challenge is even more outstanding when forming control decisions on a large-scale traffic grid, where the RL action space grows exponentially with the number of intersections within the traffic grid. In this paper, we tackle such a problem by proposing a cooperative deep reinforcement learning (Coder) framework. The intuition behind Coder is to decompose the original difficult RL task as a number of subproblems with relatively easy RL goals. Accordingly, we implement Coder with multiple regional agents and a centralized global agent. Each regional agent learns its own RL policy and value functions over a small region with limited actions. Then, the centralized global agent hierarchically aggregates RL achievements from different regional agents and forms the final Q-function over the entire large-scale traffic grid. The experimental investigations demonstrate that the proposed Coder could reduce on average 30\% congestions in terms of the number of waiting vehicles during high density traffic flows in simulations.},

Very recently, many algorithms have been developed for video detection task, yet very few approaches can achieve real-time online object detection in videos. In this paper, based on the attention mechanism and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), we propose a temporal single-shot detector (TSSD) for real-world detection. Distinct from the previous methods, we take aim at temporally integrating pyramidal feature hierarchy using ConvLSTM, and design a novel structure, including a low-level temporal unit as well as a high-level one for multiscale feature maps. Moreover, we develop a creative temporal analysis unit, namely, attentional ConvLSTM, in which a temporal attention mechanism is specially tailored for background suppression and scale suppression, while a ConvLSTM integrates attention-aware features across time. An association loss and a multistep training are designed for temporal coherence. Besides, an online tubelet analysis (OTA) is exploited for identification. Our framework is evaluated on ImageNet VID dataset and 2DMOT15 dataset. Extensive comparisons on the detection and tracking capability validate the superiority of the proposed approach. Consequently, the developed TSSD-OTA achieves a fast speed and an overall competitive performance in terms of detection and tracking. Finally, a real-world maneuver is conducted for underwater object grasping.},

Based on the impulsive control theory and some analysis techniques, a new theoretical result for global exponential stability is derived from the impulsive control point of view. The significance of the presented result is that the stability can be achieved via the impulsive control at certain impulse points despite the existence of impulsive perturbations which causes negative effect to the control. That is, the impulsive control provides a super performance to allow the existence of impulsive perturbations. In addition, we apply the theoretical result to the problem of impulsive control of delayed neural networks. Some results for global exponential stability and synchronization control of neural networks with time delays are derived via impulsive control. Three illustrated examples are given to show the effectiveness and distinctiveness of the proposed impulsive control schemes.},

For each agent, only parts of its received information are used to design controller, which reduces the computing burden and complexity in the design process. According to the proposed prioritized strategy, the consensus tracking problem is transformed into general tracking problem. By utilizing the power integration technique, the uncertainties of nonlinear functions in MASs are dealt with.

However, due to the existence of approximation errors, the existing finite-time stability criterion cannot be used to analyze the stability of stochastic nonlinear systems. To deal with this difficulty, a finite-time stability criterion, by utilizing the mean value theorem of integrals, is first established in Lemma 5, which plays a significant role in the finite-time stability analysis of stochastic nonlinear systems.

  abstract     = {The graph embedding (GE) methods have been widely applied for dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral imagery (HSI). However, a major challenge of GE is how to choose the proper neighbors for graph construction and explore the spatial information of HSI data. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called spatial-spectral manifold reconstruction preserving embedding (SSMRPE) for HSI classification. At first, a weighted mean filter (WMF) is employed to preprocess the image, which aims to reduce the influence of background noise. According to the spatial consistency property of HSI, SSMRPE utilizes a new spatial-spectral combined distance (SSCD) to fuse the spatial structure and spectral information for selecting effective spatial-spectral neighbors of HSI pixels. Then, it explores the spatial relationship between each point and its neighbors to adjust the reconstruction weights to improve the efficiency of manifold reconstruction. As a result, the proposed method can extract the discriminant features and subsequently improve the classification performance of HSI. The experimental results on the PaviaU and Salinas hyperspectral data sets indicate that SSMRPE can achieve better classification results in comparison with some state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {This puts forth an infrastructure-free cooperative relative localization (RL) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in global positioning system (GPS)-denied environments. Instead of estimating relative coordinates with vision-based methods, an onboard ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging and communication (RCM) network is adopted to both sense the inter-UAV distance and exchange information for RL estimation in 2-D spaces. Without any external infrastructures prepositioned, each agent cooperatively performs a consensus-based fusion, which fuses the obtained direct and indirect RL estimates, to generate the relative positions to its neighbors in real time despite the fact that some UAVs may not have direct range measurements to their neighbors. The proposed RL estimation is then applied to formation control. Extensive simulations and real-world flight tests corroborate the merits of the developed RL algorithm.},

These nonconvergent learning methods may lead to sluggish response in the control system and make the parameter tuning complex. The aim of this paper is to propose a new learning strategy driven by the estimation error to design the alternative adaptive laws for adaptive control of nonlinear servo systems. The parameter estimation error is extracted and used as a new leakage term in the adaptive laws. By using this new learning method, the convergence of both the estimated parameters and the tracking error can be achieved simultaneously. The proposed learning algorithm is further tailored to retain finite-time convergence. To handle unknown nonlinearities in the servomechanisms, an augmented NN with a new friction model is used, where both the NN weights and some friction model coefficients are estimated online via the proposed algorithms. Comparisons with the σ-modification algorithm are addressed in terms of convergence property and robustness. Simulations and practical experiments are given to show the superior performance of the suggested adaptive algorithms.},

In each backstepping step, the virtual controller is driven to pass through a fractional dynamic surface whose fractional-order derivative can be calculated easily. An ADSC law that ensure tracking error convergence is designed. The proposed ADSC requires a stringent condition called persistent excitation (PE) to achieve parameter convergence. To relax this limitation, a prediction error is defined by using online recorded data and instantaneous data, and a composite learning law is proposed to utilize both the prediction error and the tracking error. Then, a composite learning ADSC (CLADSC) method is developed to guarantee tracking error convergence and accurate parameter estimation under an interval excitation condition that is weaker than the PE one.

It is assumed that the interaction time instants of each agent, at which this agent interacts with its neighbors, are independent of the other agents&#39; and can be unevenly distributed. An asynchronous distributed algorithm is proposed to implement the control strategy of linear MASs. The non-negative matrix theory and the composition of binary relations are utilized to handle the asynchronous containment control issue. It is shown that the leaders in each closed and strongly connected component of the network topology will reach a common state and the followers will gradually enter the dynamic convex hull constructed by the leaders. Moreover, it is also proved that the system matrix can be strictly unstable, and the upper bound of the system matrix&#39;s spectral radius is explicitly stated. Finally, two simulation examples are also provided to verify the efficacy of our theoretical results.},

At first, a nonlinear state observer is used to recover the unmeasured linear velocity and yaw rate as well as unknown uncertainty and disturbances. Then, observer-based cooperative time-varying formation maneuvering control laws are designed based on artificial potential functions, nonlinear tracking differentiators, and a backstepping technique. The stability of closed-loop distributed formation control system is analyzed based on input-to-state stability and cascade stability. The salient features of the proposed method are as follows. First, cooperative time-varying formation maneuvering with the capability of connectivity preservation and collision avoidance can be achieved in the absence of velocity measurements. Second, the complexity of the cooperative time-varying formation maneuvering control laws is reduced without resorting to dynamic surface control. Third, the uncertainty and disturbance are actively rejected in the presence of position-heading measurements.

In the game model, a shared affine constraint couples all players&#39; local decisions. Each player is assumed to only access its private objective function, private feasible set, and a local block matrix of the affine constraint. We first give an algorithm for the case when each agent is able to fully access all other players&#39; decisions. By using auxiliary variables related to communication links and the edge Laplacian matrix, each player can carry on its iteration asynchronously with only private data and possibly delayed information from its neighbors. Then, we consider the case when agents cannot know all other players&#39; decisions, called a partial-decision information case. We introduce a local estimation of the overall agents&#39; decisions and incorporate consensus dynamics on these local estimations. The two algorithms do not need any centralized clock coordination, fully exploit the local computation resource, and remove the idle time due to waiting for the “slowest” agent. Both algorithms are developed by preconditioned forward-backward operator splitting, and their convergence is shown by relating them to asynchronous fixed-point iterations, under proper assumptions and fixed and nondiminishing step-size choices. Numerical studies verify the algorithms&#39; convergence and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The community detection in dynamic networks is essential for important applications such as social network analysis. Such detection requires simultaneous maximization of the clustering accuracy at the current time step while minimization of the clustering drift between two successive time steps. In most situations, such objectives are often in conflict with each other. This article proposes the concept of consensus community. Knowledge from the previous step is obtained by extracting the intrapopulation consensus communities from the optimal population of the previous step. Subsequently, the intrapopulation consensus communities of the previous step obtained is voted by the population of the current time step during the evolutionary process. A subset of the consensus communities, which receives a high support rate, will be recognized as the interpopulation consensus communities of the previous and current steps. Interpopulation consensus communities are the knowledge that can be transferred from the previous to the current step. The population of the current time step can evolve toward the direction similar to the population in the previous time step by retaining such interpopulation consensus community during the evolutionary process. Community structure is subjected to evaluation, update, and mutation events, which are directed by using interpopulation consensus community information during the evolutionary process. The experimental results over many artificial and real-world dynamic networks illustrate that the proposed method produces more accurate and robust results than those of the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Most approaches on graph embedding focus on preserving the graph structure or minimizing the reconstruction errors for graph data. They have mostly overlooked the embedding distribution of the latent codes, which unfortunately may lead to inferior representation in many cases. In this article, we present a novel adversarially regularized framework for graph embedding. By employing the graph convolutional network as an encoder, our framework embeds the topological information and node content into a vector representation, from which a graph decoder is further built to reconstruct the input graph. The adversarial training principle is applied to enforce our latent codes to match a prior Gaussian or uniform distribution. Based on this framework, we derive two variants of the adversarial models, the adversarially regularized graph autoencoder (ARGA) and its variational version, and adversarially regularized variational graph autoencoder (ARVGA), to learn the graph embedding effectively. We also exploit other potential variations of ARGA and ARVGA to get a deeper understanding of our designs. Experimental results that compared 12 algorithms for link prediction and 20 algorithms for graph clustering validate our solutions.},

A novel network-based model is first established by constructing a PI control system and taking network-induced delays and stochastic packet dropouts into account. By using two different artificial delays to characterize the update of proportional and integral control signals, the network-based PI control system is modeled as a stochastic impulsive system with two input delays and reset equations at updating instants. Then, through involving the reset states and the relationship among two delayed states and the current state in the discontinuous Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and actively introducing the upper bounds of nonzero network-induced delays, some exponential mean-square stability and H ∞ performance conditions with less conservatism are derived in terms of tractable linear matrix inequalities. An algorithm is presented to determine the minimum H ∞ performance and the corresponding PI control parameters by combining a particle swarm optimization technique with the performance condition. These results can be extended to a network-based PI control of general continuous-time linear systems. A ZigBee-based network simulation platform is finally built and some simulation results are provided to validate the proposed methods.},

Finally, the filter gains are derived by a straightforward decoupling method, and with the aid of the algorithm of the continuous-time PDT switching regularity, the availability of the filter is expounded through a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a hybrid artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to solve a parallel batching distributed flow-shop problem (DFSP) with deteriorating jobs. In the considered problem, there are two stages as follows: 1) in the first stage, a DFSP is studied and 2) after the first stage has been completed, each job is transferred and assembled in the second stage, where the parallel batching constraint is investigated. In the two stages, the deteriorating job constraint is considered. In the proposed algorithm, first, two types of problem-specific heuristics are proposed, namely, the batch assignment and the right-shifting heuristics, which can substantially improve the makespan. Next, the encoding and decoding approaches are developed according to the problem constraints and objectives. Five types of local search operators are designed for the distributed flow shop and parallel batching stages. In addition, a novel scout bee heuristic that considers the useful information that is collected by the global and local best solutions is investigated, which can enhance searching performance. Finally, based on several well-known benchmarks and realistic industrial instances and via comprehensive computational comparison and statistical analysis, the highly effective performance of the proposed algorithm is favorably compared against several algorithms in terms of both solution quality and population diversity.},

Different from the existing periodically intermittent control, our control in control time is feedback control based on discrete-time state observations (FCDSOs) instead of a continuous-time one. By employing the Lyapunov method, graph theory, and theory of differential inclusions, the exponential synchronization of stochastic neural networks with a discontinuous right-hand side is realized by PIDOC and some sufficient conditions are presented. Especially, when control width tends to control period, PIDOC will be reduced to a general FCDSO and we give some detailed discussions.

  abstract     = {Given a query instance from one modality (e.g., image), cross-modal retrieval aims to find semantically similar instances from another modality (e.g., text). To perform cross-modal retrieval, existing approaches typically learn a common semantic space from a labeled source set and directly produce common representations in the learned space for the instances in a target set. These methods commonly require that the instances of both two sets share the same classes. Intuitively, they may not generalize well on a more practical scenario of zero-shot cross-modal retrieval, that is, the instances of the target set contain unseen classes that have inconsistent semantics with the seen classes in the source set. Inspired by zero-shot learning, we propose a novel model called ternary adversarial networks with self-supervision (TANSS) in this paper, to overcome the limitation of the existing methods on this challenging task. Our TANSS approach consists of three paralleled subnetworks: 1) two semantic feature learning subnetworks that capture the intrinsic data structures of different modalities and preserve the modality relationships via semantic features in the common semantic space; 2) a self-supervised semantic subnetwork that leverages the word vectors of both seen and unseen labels as guidance to supervise the semantic feature learning and enhances the knowledge transfer to unseen labels; and 3) we also utilize the adversarial learning scheme in our TANSS to maximize the consistency and correlation of the semantic features between different modalities. The three subnetworks are integrated in our TANSS to formulate an end-to-end network architecture which enables efficient iterative parameter optimization. Comprehensive experiments on three cross-modal datasets show the effectiveness of our TANSS approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods for zero-shot cross-modal retrieval.},

Based on the periodical sampled-data method, a sufficient condition ensuring synchronization under periodic updates is derived. In order to relax the requirement of having all data updated simultaneously, an event-triggered law is designed to implement asynchronous coupling updates. Our synchronization analysis does not rely on any linearization technique around equilibrium points. Instead, we employ the Lyapunov stability theory and nonsmooth analysis technique to deduce the synchronization conditions and estimate the region of attraction.

  abstract     = {Visual tracking is a complex problem due to unconstrained appearance variations and a dynamic environment. The extraction of complementary information from the object environment via multiple features and adaption to the target’s appearance variations are the key problems of this paper. To this end, we propose a robust object tracking framework based on the unified graph fusion (UGF) of multicue to adapt to the object’s appearance. The proposed cross-diffusion of sparse and dense features not only suppresses the individual feature deficiencies but also extracts the complementary information from multicue. This iterative process builds robust unified features which are invariant to object deformations, fast motion, and occlusion. Robustness of the unified feature also enables the random forest classifier to precisely distinguish the foreground from the background, adding resilience to background clutter. In addition, we present a novel kernel-based adaptation strategy using outlier detection and a transductive reliability metric. The adaptation strategy updates the appearance model to accommodate variations in scale, illumination, and rotation. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses on benchmark video sequences from OTB-50, OTB-100, VOT2017/18, and UAV123 show that the proposed UGF tracker performs favorably against 18 other state-of-the-art trackers under various object tracking challenges.},

  abstract     = {Robotic prostheses deliver greater function than passive prostheses, but we face the challenge of tuning a large number of control parameters in order to personalize the device for individual amputee users. This problem is not easily solved by traditional control designs or the latest robotic technology. Reinforcement learning (RL) is naturally appealing. The recent, unprecedented success of AlphaZero demonstrated RL as a feasible, large-scale problem solver. However, the prosthesis-tuning problem is associated with several unaddressed issues such as that it does not have a known and stable model, the continuous states and controls of the problem may result in a curse of dimensionality, and the human-prosthesis system is constantly subject to measurement noise, environmental change and human-body-caused variations. In this paper, we demonstrated the feasibility of direct heuristic dynamic programming, an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach, to automatically tune the 12 robotic knee prosthesis parameters to meet individual human users&#39; needs. We tested the ADP-tuner on two subjects (one able-bodied subject and one amputee subject) walking at a fixed speed on a treadmill. The ADP-tuner learned to reach target gait kinematics in an average of 300 gait cycles or 10 min of walking. We observed improved ADP tuning performance when we transferred a previously learned ADP controller to a new learning session with the same subject. To the best of our knowledge, our approach to personalize robotic prostheses is the first implementation of online ADP learning control to a clinical problem involving human subjects.},

To guarantee system security, a novel detector, that is, the summation (SUM) detector, is proposed to detect the false data-injection attacks. Different from the χ2 detector, the SUM detector not only utilizes the current compromise information but also collects all historical information to reveal the threat. Its evaluation value also satisfies χ2 distribution when no attacks compromise the systems, and the false alarm rate can be restricted to less than any given value by choosing the proper threshold value. Furthermore, an improved false data-injection attack with a time-variable increment coefficient is introduced based on the existing approaches. The effects of the SUM detector are also verified for the traditional and the improved false data-injection attacks, respectively. Finally, some simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the SUM detector.},

The hidden parameters determine the nonlinear mechanism of an estimator, while the bright parameters characterize the linear mechanism. In a traditional learning paradigm, hidden and bright parameters are not distinguished and trained simultaneously in one learning process. Such a one-stage learning (OSL) brings a benefit of theoretical analysis but suffers from the high computational burden. In this paper, we propose a two-stage learning scheme, learning through deterministic assignment of hidden parameters (LtDaHPs), suggesting to deterministically generate the hidden parameters by using minimal Riesz energy points on a sphere and equally spaced points in an interval. We theoretically show that with such a deterministic assignment of hidden parameters, LtDaHP with a neural network realization almost shares the same generalization performance with that of OSL. Then, LtDaHP provides an effective way to overcome the high computational burden of OSL. We present a series of simulations and application examples to support the outperformance of LtDaHP.},

In the proposed method, the squared error difference between the desired and designed responses of a filter is minimized. FDs are introduced to achieve higher accuracy at the reference frequency (ω 0 ), which helps to reduce the overall phase error. In this paper, two approaches are used for finding the appropriate values of the FDs and reference frequencies. In the first approach, these values are estimated from a series of experiments, which require more computation time but produce less accurate results. These experiments, however, justify the behavior of the error function, with respect to the FD and ω 0 , as a multimodal and nonconvex problem. In the second approach, a variant of the swarm-intelligence-based multimodal search space technique, known as the constraint-factor particle swarm optimization, is exploited for finding the suitable values for the FD and ω 0 . The performance of the proposed FD-based method is measured in terms of fidelity aspects, such as the maximum phase error, total squared phase error, maximum group delay error, and total squared group delay error. The FD-based approach is found to reduce the total phase error by 57\% by exploiting only two FDs.},

Most existing methods implicitly or explicitly rely on distances in Euclidean space. However, the Euclidean distance may be incapable of measuring the similarity among high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality, thus leading to inferior performance in practice. This paper presents an innovative approach for outlier detection from the view of meaningful structure scores. If two points have similar features, the difference between their structural scores is small and vice versa. The scores are calculated by measuring the variance of angles weighted by data representation, which takes the global data structure into the measurement. Thus, it could consistently rank more similar points. Compared with existing methods, our structural scores could be better to reflect the characteristics of data in a high-dimensional space. The proposed method consistently ranks more similar points. Experiments on synthetic and several real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {The ability to localize visual objects that are associated with an audio source and at the same time to separate the audio signal is a cornerstone in audio-visual signal-processing applications. However, available methods mainly focus on localizing only the visual objects, without audio separation abilities. Besides that, these methods often rely on either laborious preprocessing steps to segment video frames into semantic regions, or additional supervisions to guide their localization. In this paper, we aim to address the problem of visual source localization and audio separation in an unsupervised manner and avoid all preprocessing or post-processing steps. To this end, we devise a novel structured matrix decomposition method that decomposes the data matrix of each modality as a superposition of three terms: 1) a low-rank matrix capturing the background information; 2) a sparse matrix capturing the correlated components among the two modalities and, hence, uncovering the sound source in visual modality and the associated sound in audio modality; and 3) a third sparse matrix accounting for uncorrelated components, such as distracting objects in visual modality and irrelevant sound in audio modality. The generality of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it onto three applications, namely: 1) visual localization of a sound source; 2) visually assisted audio separation; and 3) active speaker detection. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method on these application domains.},

  abstract     = {Over the last few decades, the decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) have became one of the mainstreams for multiobjective optimization. However, there is not too much research on applying DMOEAs to uncertain problems until now. Usually, the uncertainty is modeled as additive noise in the objective space, which is the case this paper concentrates on. This paper first carries out experiments to examine the impact of noisy environments on DMOEAs. Then, four noise-handling techniques based upon the analyses of empirical results are proposed. First, a Pareto-based nadir point estimation strategy is put forward to provide a good normalization of each objective. Next, we introduce two adaptive sampling strategies that vary the number of samples used per solution based on the differences among neighboring solutions and their variance to control the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. Finally, a mixed objective evaluation strategy and a mixed repair mechanism are proposed to alleviate the effects of noise and remedy the loss of diversity in the decision space, respectively. These features are embedded in two popular DMOEAs (i.e., MOEA/D and DMOEA- ${\varepsilon }\text{C}$ ), and DMOEAs with these features are called noise-tolerant DMOEAs (NT-DMOEAs). NT-DMOEAs are compared with their various variants and four noise-tolerant multiobjective algorithms, including the improved NSGA-II, the classical algorithm Bayesian (1+1)-ES (BES), and the state-of-the-art algorithms MOP-EA and rolling tide evolutionary algorithm to show the superiority of proposed features on 17 benchmark problems with different strength levels of noise. Experimental studies demonstrate that two NT-DMOEAs, especially NT-DMOEA- ${\varepsilon }\text{C}$ , show remarkable advantages over competitors in the majority of test instances.},

By extending its parameters from real numbers to fuzzy ones, we have developed the fuzzy RBM (FRBM) which is demonstrated to possess better generative capability than RBM. In this paper, we first propose a generative model named Gaussian FRBM (GFRBM) to deal with real-valued inputs. Then, motivated by the fact that the discriminative variant of RBM can provide a self-contained framework for classification with competitive performance compared with some traditional classifiers, we establish the discriminative FRBM (DFRBM) and discriminative GFRBM (DGFRBM) that combine both the generative and discriminative facility by adding extra neurons next to the input units. Specifically, they can be trained into excellent stand-alone classifiers and retain outstanding generative capability simultaneously. The experimental results including text and image (both clean and noisy) classification indicate that DFRBM and DGFRBM outperform discriminative RBM models in terms of reconstruction and classification accuracy, and they behave more stable when encountering noisy data. Moreover, the proposed learning models show some promising advantages over other standard classifiers.},

The bound is unknown but lies within a prescribed fuzzy set (hence the fuzzy dynamical system). We propose an approach for the robust control design which is implemented in two steps. First, a class of robust controls is proposed based on tunable parameters. The proposed controls are deterministic and are not conventionally IF-THEN rules based. By the Lyapunov minimax approach, we prove that the proposed controls are able to guarantee deterministic system performance, namely, uniform boundedness and ultimate uniform boundedness. Second, optima seeking from the proposed controls is considered to improve fuzzy system performance. We formulate the optima-seeking problem as a two-player (one leader and one follower) Stackelberg game by developing two cost functions, each of which is in charge of one tunable parameter (i.e., the player). Each cost function consists of an average fuzzy system performance index and the associated player&#39;s control effort. We show that the solution of the optimal design problem (i.e., the optima of the tunable parameters), which is called the Stackelberg strategy, always exists and how to obtain the backwards-induction outcome is provided. Simulation results on the walking control of a biped robot model are presented for demonstration.},

  abstract     = {The particle swarm optimizer (PSO), originally proposed for single-objective optimization problems, has been widely extended to other areas. One of them is multiobjective optimization. Recently, using the PSO to handle many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) (i.e., problems with more than three objectives) has caught increasing attention from the evolutionary multiobjective community. In the design of a multiobjective/many-objective PSO algorithm, the selection of leaders is a crucial issue. This paper proposes an effective many-objective PSO where the above issue is properly addressed. For each particle, the leader is selected from a certain number of historical solutions by using scalar projections. In the objective space, historical solutions record potential search directions, and the leader is elected as the solution that is closest to the Pareto front in the direction determined by the nadir point and the point constructed by the objective vector of this particle. The proposed algorithm is compared with eight state-of-the-art many-objective optimizers on 37 test problems in terms of four performance metrics. The experimental results have shown the superiority and competitiveness of our proposed algorithm. The new algorithm is free of a set of weight vectors and can handle Pareto fronts with irregular shapes. Given the high performance and good properties of the proposed algorithm, it can be used as a promising tool when dealing with MaOPs.},

To this end, we first derive analytically the Hessian matrix of the hypervolume indicator, a widely used performance indicator for PF approximation sets. Based on this, we propose the hypervolume Newton method (HNM) for hypervolume maximization of a given set of candidate solutions. We first address unconstrained BOPs and focus further on first attempts for the treatment of inequality constrained problems. The resulting method may even converge quadratically to the optimal solution, however, this property is-as for all Newton methods-of local nature. We hence propose as a next step a hybrid of HNM and an evolutionary strategy in order to obtain a fast and reliable algorithm for the treatment of such problems. The strengths of both HNM and hybrid are tested on several benchmark problems and comparisons of the hybrid to state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms for hypervolume maximization are presented.},

T-S fuzzy model is employed to describe the nonlinear systems. In order to save the bandwidth and energy, we introduce the event-triggered mechanism to reduce the number of data for transmission and computation. Thus, it is necessary to consider the influence of data losses, data disorder, and transmission delay since the transmitted data packets become more important. Consequently, it is very complicated to analyze the performance of such networked system and one of the most difficult part, in the authors&#39; opinion, is to construct the mathematical model of closed-loop systems. In this paper, we present an auxiliary random series approach to describe the data transmitted in the system, and therefore, the closed-loop systems can be obtained. Associated with a tailor-made Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the stability analysis is processed and a fuzzy controller is designed. Asynchronous membership functions are considered to obtain more relaxed stability conditions.

First, Sun visibility is estimated by the efficient broad learning system. And then for the scene with visible Sun, we classify the information in the image by the proposed classification algorithm, which combines the geometric information and shadow information to make the most of the information. And we apply a respective algorithm for every class to estimate the illumination parameters. Finally, our approach integrates all of the estimating results by the Markov random field.

In this paper, we propose a novel subspace learning method, named recursive discriminative subspace learning with an ℓ 1 -norm distance constraint (RDSL). RDSL can robustly extract features from the contaminated images and learn a discriminative subspace. With the use of an inequation-based ℓ 1 -norm distance metric constraint, the minimized ℓ 1 -norm distance metric objective function with slack variables induces samples in the same class to cluster as close as possible, meanwhile samples from different classes can be separated from each other as far as possible. By utilizing ℓ 1 -norm items in both the objective function and the constraint, RDSL can well handle the noisy data and outliers. In addition, the large margin formulation makes the proposed method insensitive to initializations. We describe two approaches to solve RDSL with a recursive strategy. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets, including the original data and the contaminated data, demonstrate that RDSL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

Both consensus and complementarity are of significant importance to the success of multiview learning. In this paper, we explicitly formulate both of them for multiview classification. On the one hand, a cohesion-increasing loss term with a learnable label-adjusting matrix is designed to facilitate consensus among views in the training stage. With this kind of loss, the learned classifiers of all views are more likely to obtain the correct classification, thereby maximizing the agreement among views. On the other hand, an independence measurement is adopted as the diversity-promoting regularization to encourage classifiers to be diverse such that more complementary information can be captured by these “diversified” classifiers. Overall, the resultant model is capable of achieving more comprehensive and accurate classification by exploring and exploiting the common and complementary information across multiple views more thoroughly. An iterative optimization algorithm with proved convergence is proposed for training the model. Extensive experimental results on various datasets have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method.},

Service robots and Internet of Things (IoT) play the key roles in the development of Smart Home. The service provision with these two main components in a Smart Home environment requires: 1) learning and reasoning algorithms and 2) the integration of robot and IoT systems. Conventional computational intelligence-based learning and reasoning algorithms do not successfully manage dynamic changes in the Smart Home data, and the simple integrations fail to fully draw the synergies from the collaboration of the two systems. To tackle these limitations, we propose: 1) a stabilized memory network with a feedback mechanism which can learn user behaviors in an incremental manner and 2) a robot-IoT service provision framework for a Smart Home which utilizes the proposed memory architecture as a learning and reasoning module and exploits synergies between the robot and IoT systems. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments under various conditions to verify the performance of the proposed memory architecture and the service provision framework and analyze the experiment results.},

  abstract     = {Point set registration is a problem with a long history in many pattern recognition tasks. This paper presents a robust point set registration algorithm based on optimizing the distance between two probability distributions. A major problem in point to point algorithms is defining the correspondence between two point sets. This paper follows the idea of some probability-based point set registration methods by representing the point sets as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). By optimizing the distance between the two GMMs, rigid transformations (rotation and translation) between two point sets can be obtained without having to find a correspondence. Previous studies have used L2, Kullback Leibler, etc. distance to measure similarity between two GMMs; however, these methods have problems with robustness to noise and outliers, especially when the covariance matrix is large, or a local minimum exists. Therefore, in this paper, the signature quadratic form distance is derived to measure the distribution similarity. The contribution of this paper lies in adopting the signature quadratic form distance for the point set registration algorithm. The experimental results show the precision and robustness of this algorithm and demonstrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art point set registration algorithms regarding factors, such as noise, outliers, missing partial structures, and initial misalignment.},

  abstract     = {Negative sequential patterns (NSPs), which capture both frequent occurring and nonoccurring behaviors, become increasingly important and sometimes play a role irreplaceable by analyzing occurring behaviors only. Repetition sequential patterns capture repetitions of patterns in different sequences as well as within a sequence and are very important to understand the repetition relations between behaviors. Though some methods are available for mining NSP and repetition positive sequential patterns (RPSPs), we have not found any methods for mining repetition NSP (RNSP). RNSP can help the analysts to further understand the repetition relationships between items and capture more comprehensive information with repetition properties. However, mining RNSP is much more difficult than mining NSP due to the intrinsic challenges of nonoccurring items. To address the above issues, we first propose a formal definition of repetition negative containment. Then, we propose a method to convert repetition negative containment to repetition positive containment, which fast calculates the repetition supports by only using the corresponding RPSP&#39;s information without rescanning databases. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm, called e-RNSP, to mine RNSP efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, e-RNSP is the first algorithm to efficiently mine RNSP. Intensive experimental results on the first four real and synthetic datasets clearly show that e-RNSP can efficiently discover the repetition negative patterns; results on the fifth dataset prove the effectiveness of RNSP which are captured by the proposed method; and the results on the rest 16 datasets analyze the impacts of data characteristics on mining process.},

We illustrate that the covariance matrix of the underlying distribution can be considered as an ensemble of simple models constructed by two vectors.

A necessary and sufficient consensus condition based on the coupling gains, the sampling period, the communication width, and the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix is established to reach the consensus, and the right intervals of the sampling period are given. Furthermore, a delay-induced consensus protocol is designed, and a necessary and sufficient condition is also given, by which the sampling period and the communication width can easily be chosen to achieve the consensus.

  abstract     = {Salient object detection is usually used as a preprocessing step to facilitate a variety of subsequent applications which should take little time cost. With the quick development of deep learning recently, profound progresses have been made to achieve a new state-of-the-art performance. However, the learned features of the existing deep learning-based methods are not accurate enough thus leading to unsatisfactory detection in complex scenes, such as low contrast or very similar between salient object and background region and multiple (small) salient objects with diverse characteristics. In addition, some post-processing techniques are usually needed for refinement, which is time consuming. To address these issues, this paper presents an efficient fully convolutional salient object detection network. Specifically, we first introduce a visual attention mechanism to guide feature learning in side output layers. In detail, attention weight is employed in a top-down manner which can bridge high level semantic information to help shallow layers better locate salient objects and also filter out noisy response in the background region. Second, we propose a residual refinement network to fuse the learned multilevel features gradually. Not to simply add or concatenate them step by step as previous works, we introduce a second-order term into element-wise addition to learn stage-wise residual features for refinement. Such a second-order term not only benefits efficient gradient propagation but also increases network nonlinearity. Extensive experiments on seven standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistently superior performance and performs well on small salient object detection in comparison with the very recent state-of-the-arts, especially in the metric of structure-measure.},

The use of discriminative classification algorithms helps to alleviate this problem. However, it is still an open problem to accurately model the relationships between visual representations and human perception. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel multiview semantic representation (MVSR) algorithm for efficient visual recognition. First, we leverage visually based methods to get initial image representations. We then use both visual and semantic similarities to divide images into groups which are then used for semantic representations. We treat different image representation strategies, partition methods, and numbers as different views. A graph is then used to combine the discriminative power of different views. The similarities between images can be obtained by measuring the similarities of graphs. Finally, we train classifiers to predict the categories of images. We evaluate the discriminative power of the proposed MVSR method for visual recognition on several public image datasets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

By virtue of the semi-time-varying (STV) Lyapunov function, the synchronization criteria for transmitter-receiver systems in a switched version are obtained to satisfy a prescribed synchronization error bound. An estimate of the synchronization error bound is provided via the reachable set approach and, further, an explicit description of the error bounds is given. Then, sufficient conditions on the existence of STV observers are derived with a predetermined error bound, and the corresponding observer gains are calculated via solving a group of linear matrix inequalities.

  abstract     = {Data center (DC) plays an important role to support services, such as e-commerce and cloud computing. The resulting energy consumption from this growing market has drawn significant attention, and noticeably almost half of the energy cost is used to cool the DC to a particular temperature. It is thus an critical operational challenge to curb the cooling energy cost without sacrificing the thermal safety of a DC. The existing solutions typically follow a two-step approach, in which the system is first modeled based on expert knowledge and, thus, the operational actions are determined with heuristics and/or best practices. These approaches are often hard to generalize and might result in suboptimal performances due to intrinsic model errors for large-scale systems. In this paper, we propose optimizing the DC cooling control via the emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Compared to the existing approaches, our solution lends itself an end-to-end cooling control algorithm (CCA) via an off-policy offline version of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, in which an evaluation network is trained to predict the DC energy cost along with resulting cooling effects, and a policy network is trained to gauge optimized control settings. Moreover, we introduce a de-underestimation (DUE) validation mechanism for the critic network to reduce the potential underestimation of the risk caused by neural approximation. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated on an EnergyPlus simulation platform and on a real data trace collected from the National Super Computing Centre (NSCC) of Singapore. The resulting numerical results show that the proposed CCA can achieve up to 11\% cooling cost reduction on the simulation platform compared with a manually configured baseline control algorithm. In the trace-based study of conservative nature, the proposed algorithm can achieve about 15\% cooling energy savings on the NSCC data trace. Our pioneering approach can shed new light on the application of DRL to optimize and automate DC operations and management, potentially revolutionizing digital infrastructure management with intelligence.},

  abstract     = {While 3-D steganography and digital watermarking represent methods for embedding information into 3-D objects, 3-D steganalysis aims to find the hidden information. Previous research studies have shown that by estimating the parameters modeling the statistics of 3-D features and feeding them into a classifier we can identify whether a 3-D object carries secret information. For training the steganalyzer, such features are extracted from cover and stego pairs, representing the original 3-D objects and those carrying hidden information. However, in practical applications, the steganalyzer would have to distinguish stego-objects from cover-objects, which most likely have not been used during the training. This represents a significant challenge for existing steganalyzers, raising a challenge known as the cover source mismatch (CSM) problem, which is due to the significant limitation of their generalization ability. This paper proposes a novel feature selection algorithm taking into account both feature robustness and relevance in order to mitigate the CSM problem in 3-D steganalysis. In the context of the proposed methodology, new shapes are generated by distorting those used in the training. Then a subset of features is selected from a larger given set, by assessing their effectiveness in separating cover-objects from stego-objects among the generated sets of objects. Two different measures are used for selecting the appropriate features: 1) the Pearson correlation coefficient and 2) the mutual information criterion.},

The influence of their characteristics on epidemic spreading is analyzed in a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model illustrated by the discrete-time Markov chain approach. We develop the analytical epidemic thresholds in terms of the spectral radius of weighted adjacency matrix by averaging temporal networks, e.g., periodic, nonperiodic Markovian networks, and a special nonperiodic non-Markovian network (the link activation network) in time. We discuss the impacts of statistical characteristics, e.g., bursts and duration heterogeneity, as well as time-reversed characteristic on epidemic thresholds. We confirm the tightness of the proposed epidemic thresholds with numerical simulations on seven artificial and empirical temporal networks and show that the epidemic threshold of our theory is more precise than those of previous studies.},

First, a new observer state-based resilient event-triggering scheme is developed in the presence of DoS attacks. Second, a novel event-based switched system model is established by considering the effect of the event-triggering scheme and DoS attacks simultaneously. By virtue of this new model combined with a piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, the sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee exponential stability of the resulting switched system. It is shown that the proposed results can establish a quantitative relationship among the launching/sleeping periods of the attacks, the event-triggering parameters, the sampling period, and the exponential decay rate. Third, criteria for designing a desired observer-based event-triggered controller are provided and expressed in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities.

To address the difficulty of designing the distributed compensation control laws under the time-varying asymmetrical network structure, a novel distributed-reference-observer-based fault-tolerant tracking control approach is established, under which the global tracking errors are proved to be asymptotically convergent in the presence of actuator failures. First, by constructing a group of distributed reference observers based on neighborhood state information, all followers can estimate the leader&#39;s state trajectories directly. Second, a decentralized adaptive fault-tolerant tracking controller via local estimation is designed to achieve the global synchronization. Furthermore, the reliable coordination problem under switching directed topology with intermittent communications is solved by utilizing the presented CFTC approach.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the distributed set-membership filtering problem is dealt with for a class of time-varying multirate systems in sensor networks with the communication protocol. For relieving the communication burden, the round-Robin (RR) protocol is exploited to orchestrate the transmission order, under which each sensor node only broadcasts partial information to both the corresponding local filter and its neighboring nodes. In order to meet the practical transmission requirements as well as reduce communication cost, the multirate strategy is proposed to govern the sampling/update rate of the plant, the sensors, and the filters. By means of the lifting technique, the augmented filtering error system is established with a unified sampling rate. The main purpose of the addressed filtering problem is to design a set of distributed filters such that, in the simultaneous presence of the RR transmission protocol, the multirate mechanism, and the bounded noises, there exists a certain ellipsoid that includes all possible error states at each time instant. Then, the desired distributed filter gains are obtained by minimizing such an ellipsoid in the sense of the minimum trace of the weighted matrix. The proposed resource-efficient filtering algorithm is of a recursive form, thereby facilitating the online implementation. A numerical simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol-based distributed filter design method.},

First, the actuator dynamics that is approximated by a first-order differential equation is inserted into the AUV dynamics model, which renders a high-order nonlinear dynamics analysis and design in the model-based backstepping controller by utilizing guidance errors. Second, to overcome the shaking control behavior resulted by the model-based high-order derivative calculation, a fuzzy approximator-based model-free controller is proposed, in order to online approximate the unknown part of the ideal backstepping architecture. In addition, the adaptive error estimation technology is resorted to compensate the system approximation error, ensuring that all the position and orientation errors of robust bottom following control tend to zero. Third, to further tackle the potential unstable control behavior from inherent saturation of control surfaces driven by rudders, an additional adaptive fuzzy compensator is introduced, in order to compensate control truncation between the unsaturated and saturation inputs. Subsequently, Lyapunov theory and Barbalat lemma are adopted to synthesize asymptotic stability of the entire bottom following control system. Finally, comparative numerical simulations with different controllers, environmental disturbances and initial states are provided to illustrate adaptability and robustness of the proposed bottom following controller for a flight-style AUV with saturated actuator dynamics.},

Based on the proposed controller design methods, it can be obtained that all signals in the closed-loop switched system remain bounded and the tracking error can eventually converge to a small neighborhood of the origin.

However, real data are often corrupted, which may cause the learned graph to be inexact or unreliable. In this paper, we propose a novel robust graph learning scheme to learn reliable graphs from the real-world noisy data by adaptively removing noise and errors in the raw data. We show that our proposed model can also be viewed as a robust version of manifold regularized robust principle component analysis (RPCA), where the quality of the graph plays a critical role. The proposed model is able to boost the performance of data clustering, semisupervised classification, and data recovery significantly, primarily due to two key factors: 1) enhanced low-rank recovery by exploiting the graph smoothness assumption and 2) improved graph construction by exploiting clean data recovered by RPCA. Thus, it boosts the clustering, semisupervised classification, and data recovery performance overall. Extensive experiments on image/document clustering, object recognition, image shadow removal, and video background subtraction reveal that our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the quantized cooperative control problem for multiagent systems with unknown gains in the prescribed performance. Different from the finite-time control, a speed function is designed to realize that the tracking errors converge to a prescribed compact set in a given finite time for multiagent systems. Meanwhile, we consider the problem of unknown gains and input quantization, which can be addressed by using a lemma and Nussbaum function in cooperative control. Moreover, the fuzzy logic systems are proposed to approximate the nonlinear function defined on a compact set. A distributed controller and adaptive laws are constructed based on the Lyapunov stability theory and backstepping method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by some numerical simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Quality-of-service (QoS) data vary over time, making it vital to capture the temporal patterns hidden in such dynamic data for predicting missing ones with high accuracy. However, currently latent factor (LF) analysis-based QoS-predictors are mostly defined on static QoS data without the consideration of such temporal dynamics. To address this issue, this paper presents a biased non-negative latent factorization of tensors (BNLFTs) model for temporal pattern-aware QoS prediction. Its main idea is fourfold: 1) incorporating linear biases into the model for describing QoS fluctuations; 2) constraining the model to be non-negative for describing QoS non-negativity; 3) deducing a single LF-dependent, non-negative, and multiplicative update scheme for training the model; and 4) incorporating an alternating direction method into the model for faster convergence. The empirical studies on two dynamic QoS datasets from real applications show that compared with the state-of-the-art QoS-predictors, BNLFT represents temporal patterns more precisely with high computational efficiency, thereby achieving the most accurate predictions for missing QoS data.},

To reduce the resource occupancy, a novel event-triggered strategy is proposed where the concern is to broadcast those necessary measurements to update the innovation information only when certain events appear. The primary goal of this paper is to design a recursive filter rendering that, under the event-triggered communication mechanism, an upper bound (UB) on the filtering error variance is ensured and then optimized by properly determining the filter gains. As a distinct kind of 2-D systems, the LRPs are cast into a general Fornasini-Marchesini model by using the lifting technique. A new definition of the triggering-shift sequence is introduced and an event-triggered rule is then constructed for the transformed system. With the aid of mathematical induction, the filtering error variance is guaranteed to have a UB which is subsequently optimized with appropriate filter parameters via solving two series of Riccati-like difference equations. Theoretical analysis further reveals the monotonicity of the filtering performance with regard to the event-triggering threshold. Finally, an illustrative simulation is given to show the feasibility of the designed filtering scheme.},

Since the faulty system affects the healthy systems through interconnections, for each agent an estimator is designed to collect neighboring output estimations errors to consider its faulty effects on others, when computing its estimations for local state and faulty parameters. A new structure of distributed estimators is proposed by filtering regressor signals and sharing them among agents. Then, the sharings of signals are planned by properly constructing auxiliary graphs for undirected and directed networks. Two conditions are given to preselect estimators parameters for the convergences of the estimation errors. Unlike the existing results dealing with one common parameter with full state measurement and only for undirected graphs, this paper presents an output measurementbased approach for multiple parameters in undirected/directed networks. It shows that for the faults not providing persistent excitation in a signal agent, it is possible to estimate the faults exactly if the they excite all agents persistently. A simulation example of a group of single-link flexible-joint robots is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In our tracking framework, the target is partitioned into several parts whose occlusion states are automatically detected. A set of states for the target is defined in terms of the combination of the parts&#39; occlusion states. The probabilistic FSMs are then used to model the target&#39;s state transitions so as to reduce the effect of noise in the output response maps of correlation filters. Our target model&#39;s update strategy is adaptable online depending on the estimated state of the target.

To identify the subspaces, it is important to capture a global and local structure of the data which is achieved by imposing low-rank and sparseness constraints on the data representation matrix. In low-rank sparse subspace clustering (LRSSC), nuclear and ℓ 1 -norms are used to measure rank and sparsity. However, the use of nuclear and ℓ 1 -norms leads to an overpenalized problem and only approximates the original problem. In this paper, we propose two ℓ 0 quasi-norm-based regularizations. First, this paper presents regularization based on multivariate generalization of minimax-concave penalty (GMC-LRSSC), which contains the global minimizers of a ℓ 0 quasi-norm regularized objective. Afterward, we introduce the Schatten-0 (S 0 ) and ℓ 0 -regularized objective and approximate the proximal map of the joint solution using a proximal average method (S 0 /ℓ 0 -LRSSC). The resulting nonconvex optimization problems are solved using an alternating direction method of multipliers with established convergence conditions of both algorithms. Results obtained on synthetic and four real-world datasets show the effectiveness of GMC-LRSSC and S 0 /ℓ 0 -LRSSC when compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Graph-based clustering is one of the major clustering methods. Most of it works in three separate steps: 1) similarity graph construction; 2) clustering label relaxing; and 3) label discretization with k-means (KM). Such common practice has three disadvantages: 1) the predefined similarity graph is often fixed and may not be optimal for the subsequent clustering; 2) the relaxing process of cluster labels may cause significant information loss; and 3) label discretization may deviate from the real clustering result since KM is sensitive to the initialization of cluster centroids. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose an effective discrete optimal graph clustering framework. A structured similarity graph that is theoretically optimal for clustering performance is adaptively learned with a guidance of reasonable rank constraints. Besides, to avoid the information loss, we explicitly enforce a discrete transformation on the intermediate continuous label, which derives a tractable optimization problem with a discrete solution. Furthermore, to compensate for the unreliability of the learned labels and enhance the clustering accuracy, we design an adaptive robust module that learns the prediction function for the unseen data based on the learned discrete cluster labels. Finally, an iterative optimization strategy guaranteed with convergence is developed to directly solve the clustering results. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods compared with several state-of-the-art clustering approaches.},

In this paper, we study recursive KDEs, called recursive concept drift tracking KDEs, and prove their weak (in probability) and strong (with probability one) convergence, resulting in perfect tracking properties as the sample size approaches infinity. In three theorems and subsequent examples, we show how to choose the bandwidth and learning rate of a recursive KDE in order to ensure weak and strong convergence.

This paper formulates a robot motion planning problem for the optimization of two merging pedestrian flows moving through a bottleneck exit. To address the challenge of feature representation of complex human motion dynamics under the effect of HRI, we propose using a deep neural network to model the mapping from the image input of pedestrian environments to the output of robot motion decisions. The robot motion planner is trained end-to-end using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which avoids hand-crafted feature detection and extraction, thus improving the learning capability for complex dynamic problems. Our proposed approach is validated in simulated experiments, and its performance is evaluated. The results demonstrate that the robot is able to find optimal motion decisions that maximize the pedestrian outflow in different flow conditions, and the pedestrian-accumulated outflow increases significantly compared to cases without robot regulation and with random robot motion.},

Second, existing methods cannot fully exploit the complementary information across multiple views and meanwhile preserve the view-specific properties; therefore, the degraded learning performance will be generated. To address the above issues, we propose a novel multiview latent space learning framework with feature redundancy minimization. We aim to learn a latent space to mitigate the feature redundancy and use the learned representation to reconstruct every original data point. More specifically, we first project the original features from multiple views onto a latent space, and then learn a shared dictionary and view-specific dictionaries to, respectively, exploit the correlations across multiple views as well as preserve the view-specific properties. Furthermore, the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion is adopted as a diversity constraint to explore the complementarity of multiview representations, which further ensures the diversity from multiple views and preserves the local structure of the data in each view. Experimental results on six public datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our multiview learning approach against other state-of-the-art methods.},

By introducing a Nussbaum-type function and an integrable auxiliary signal, a switched decentralized adaptive control scheme is developed to deal with the potentially infinite times of actuator failures and the unknown control directions. The basic idea is to design different parameter update laws and control laws for distinct switched subsystems. It is proved that the state variables of the resulting closed-loop system are asymptotically stable. Finally, a numerical simulation on a double-inverted pendulum model is given to verify the proposed control scheme.},

Due to some real-world requirements, a typical trajectory optimization model may need to be formulated containing several objectives. Because of the discontinuity or nonlinearity in the vehicle dynamics and mission objectives, it is challenging to generate a compromised trajectory that can satisfy constraints and optimize objectives. To address the multiobjective trajectory planning problem, this paper applies a specific multiple-shooting discretization technique with the newest NSGA-III optimization algorithm and constructs a new evolutionary optimal control solver. In addition, three constraint handling algorithms are incorporated in this evolutionary optimal control framework. The performance of using different constraint handling strategies is detailed and analyzed. The proposed approach is compared with other well-developed multiobjective techniques. Experimental studies demonstrate that the present method can outperform other evolutionary-based solvers investigated in this paper with respect to convergence ability and distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions. Therefore, the present evolutionary optimal control solver is more attractive and can offer an alternative for optimizing multiobjective continuous-time trajectory optimization problems.},

In this paper, a geometric structural ensemble (GSE) learning framework is proposed to address the issue. It is known that the traditional ensemble methods train and combine a series of basic classifiers according to various weights, which might lack the geometric meaning. Oppositely, the GSE partitions and eliminates redundant majority samples by generating hyper-sphere through the Euclidean metric and learns basic classifiers to enclose the minority samples, which achieves higher efficiency in the training process and seems easier to understand. In detail, the current weak classifier builds boundaries between the majority and the minority samples and removes the former. Then, the remaining samples are used to train the next. When the training process is done, all of the majority samples could be cleaned and the combination of all basic classifiers is obtained. To further improve the generalization, two relaxation techniques are proposed. Theoretically, the computational complexity of GSE could approach O(nd log(n min ) log(n maj )). The comprehensive experiments validate both the effectiveness and efficiency of GSE.},

  abstract     = {Spammers, who manipulate online reviews to promote or suppress products, are flooding in online commerce. To combat this trend, there has been a great deal of research focused on detecting review spammers, most of which design diversified features and thus develop various classifiers. The widespread growth of crowdsourcing platforms has created largescale deceptive review writers who behave more like normal users, that the way they can more easily evade detection by the classifiers that are purely based on fixed characteristics. In this paper, we propose a hybrid semisupervised learning model titled hybrid PU-learning-based spammer detection (hPSD) for spammer detection to leverage both the users&#39; characteristics and the user-product relations. Specifically, the hPSD model can iteratively detect multitype spammers by injecting different positive samples, and allows the construction of classifiers in a semisupervised hybrid learning framework. Comprehensive experiments on movie dataset with shilling injection confirm the superior performance of hPSD over existing baseline methods. The hPSD is then utilized to detect the hidden spammers from real-life Amazon data. A set of spammers and their underlying employers (e.g., book publishers) are successfully discovered and validated. These demonstrate that hPSD meets the real-world application scenarios and can thus effectively detect the potentially deceptive review writers.},

In order to generate different RIPFs in the switching topology, state and transition matrices are introduced. To achieve the minimum agent-movement among RIPFs, a downward-tree combinatorial optimization algorithm is presented. In the end, with the selected minimum agent-movement RIPF, a control law is designed to drive initial RIPF to desired RIPF with given distances among agents.

  abstract     = {Network embedding has attracted an increasing attention over the past few years. As an effective approach to solve graph mining problems, network embedding aims to learn a low-dimensional feature vector representation for each node of a given network. The vast majority of existing network embedding algorithms, however, are only designed for unsigned networks, and the signed networks containing both positive and negative links, have pretty distinct properties from the unsigned counterpart. In this paper, we propose a deep network embedding model to learn the low-dimensional node vector representations with structural balance preservation for the signed networks. The model employs a semisupervised stacked auto-encoder to reconstruct the adjacency connections of a given signed network. As the adjacency connections are overwhelmingly positive in the real-world signed networks, we impose a larger penalty to make the auto-encoder focus more on reconstructing the scarce negative links than the abundant positive links. In addition, to preserve the structural balance property of signed networks, we design the pairwise constraints to make the positively connected nodes much closer than the negatively connected nodes in the embedding space. Based on the network representations learned by the proposed model, we conduct link sign prediction and community detection in signed networks. Extensive experimental results in real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art network embedding algorithms for graph representation learning in signed networks.},

  abstract     = {Discriminating targets moving against a cluttered background is a huge challenge, let alone detecting a target as small as one or a few pixels and tracking it in flight. In the insect&#39;s visual system, a class of specific neurons, called small target motion detectors (STMDs), have been identified as showing exquisite selectivity for small target motion. Some of the STMDs have also demonstrated direction selectivity which means these STMDs respond strongly only to their preferred motion direction. Direction selectivity is an important property of these STMD neurons which could contribute to tracking small targets such as mates in flight. However, little has been done on systematically modeling these directionally selective STMD neurons. In this paper, we propose a directionally selective STMD-based neural network for small target detection in a cluttered background. In the proposed neural network, a new correlation mechanism is introduced for direction selectivity via correlating signals relayed from two pixels. Then, a lateral inhibition mechanism is implemented on the spatial field for size selectivity of the STMD neurons. Finally, a population vector algorithm is used to encode motion direction of small targets. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed neural network not only is in accord with current biological findings, i.e., showing directional preferences but also worked reliably in detecting the small targets against cluttered backgrounds.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of event-triggered adaptive control for a class of nonlinear systems subject to asymmetric input saturation and time-varying partial state constraints. To facilitate analyzing the influence of asymmetric input saturation, the saturation function is converted into a linear form with respect to control input. To achieve the objective that partial states do not exceed the constraints, a more general form of Lyapunov function is offered. Different from some existing results about output/full state constraints, the proposed scheme only requires that the partial states satisfy the time-varying constraints. Moreover, an event-triggered scheme with a varying threshold is designed to reduce the communication burden. With the time-varying asymmetric barrier Lyapunov functions, a novel event-triggered control scheme is developed, which ensures that partial states are without violation of required constraints and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin despite appearing as saturated phenomenon. Eventually, the theoretic results are confirmed by two examples.},

  abstract     = {Due to its strong representation learning ability and its facilitation of joint learning for representation and hash codes, deep learning-to-hash has achieved promising results and is becoming increasingly popular for the large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search. However, recent studies highlight the vulnerability of deep image classifiers to adversarial examples; this also introduces profound security concerns for deep retrieval systems. Accordingly, in order to study the robustness of modern deep hashing models to adversarial perturbations, we propose hash adversary generation (HAG), a novel method of crafting adversarial examples for Hamming space search. The main goal of HAG is to generate imperceptibly perturbed examples as queries, whose nearest neighbors from a targeted hashing model are semantically irrelevant to the original queries. Extensive experiments prove that HAG can successfully craft adversarial examples with small perturbations to mislead targeted hashing models. The transferability of these perturbations under a variety of settings is also verified. Moreover, by combining heterogeneous perturbations, we further provide a simple yet effective method of constructing adversarial examples for black-box attacks.},

  abstract     = {Recently, graph-based hashing that learns similarity-preserving binary codes via an affinity graph has been extensively studied for large-scale image retrieval. However, most graph-based hashing methods resort to intractable binary quadratic programs, making them unscalable to massive data. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional network-based hashing framework, dubbed GCNH, which directly carries out spectral convolution operations on both an image set and an affinity graph built over the set, naturally yielding similarity-preserving binary embedding. GCNH fundamentally differs from conventional graph hashing methods which adopt an affinity graph as the only learning guidance in an objective function to pursue the binary embedding. As the core ingredient of GCNH, we introduce an intuitive asymmetric graph convolutional (AGC) layer to simultaneously convolve the anchor graph, input data, and convolutional filters. By virtue of the AGC layer, GCNH well addresses the issues of scalability and out-of-sample extension when leveraging affinity graphs for hashing. As a use case of our GCNH, we particularly study the semisupervised hashing scenario in this paper. Comprehensive image retrieval evaluations on the CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the consistent advantages of GCNH over the state-of-the-art methods given limited labeled data.},

Second, a spectral constraint is used to achieve the low-dimensional representation of each view based on the spectral clustering. Third, we further introduce a co-regularization term to learn the common representation of samples for all views, and then use the k-means to partition the data into their respective groups. An efficient iterative algorithm is provided to optimize the model. Experimental results conducted on seven incomplete multiview datasets show that the proposed method achieves the best performance in comparison with some state-of-the-art methods, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method in incomplete multiview clustering.},

The inputs are transferred and placed in the feature nodes, and then sent into the enhancement nodes for nonlinear transformation. The structure of a BLS can be extended in a wide sense. Incremental learning algorithms are designed for fast learning in broad expansion. Based on the typical BLSs, a novel recurrent BLS (RBLS) is proposed in this paper. The nodes in the enhancement units of the BLS are recurrently connected, for the purpose of capturing the dynamic characteristics of a time series. A sparse autoencoder is used to extract the features from the input instead of the randomly initialized weights. In this way, the RBLS retains the merit of fast computing and fits for processing sequential data. Motivated by the idea of “fine-tuning” in deep learning, the weights in the RBLS can be updated by conjugate gradient methods if the prediction errors are large. We exhibit the merits of our proposed model on several chaotic time series. Experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of the RBLS. For chaotic benchmark datasets, the RBLS achieves very small errors, and for the real-world dataset, the performance is satisfactory.},

  abstract     = {Complementarity between activities reveals that doing any one of them increases the returns to doing the others. In other words, complementarity leads to the synergistic effect that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Identifying and exploiting complementarity can benefit many cybernetic activities, where human-machine interactions are inherent and dominant. One such activity is requirements tracing that helps stakeholders to track the status of their goals. Although various kinds of support for human analysts in requirements tracing have been proposed, little is known about the nature of complementarity when different tracing practices are involved. In this paper, we explore the role of complementarity by considering together the tagging-to-trace (T2T) and learning-to-trace (L2T) activities. We present a novel approach to examining which T2T and L2T practices enhance the qualities of each other. Our approach also uncovers the environmental factors which the complementarity is sensitive to. Applying our approach to the logs of 140 analyst-tracing units offers operational insights into the rigorous detection of complementarity and shows the importance of understanding the cybernetic conditions under which the requirements tracing practices may in fact be complementary.},

To improve the transient and steady-state performance, a modified funnel variable, which relaxes the limitation of the original FC (e.g., systems with relative degree 1 or 2), is developed using the tracking error to replace the scaling factor. Then, by applying the error transformation method, the original error is transformed into a new error variable which is used in the controller design. By using an improved funnel function in a dynamic surface control procedure, an adaptive funnel controller is proposed to guarantee that the output error remains within a predefined funnel boundary. A novel command filter technique is introduced by using the Levant differentiator to eliminate the “explosion of complexity” problem in the conventional backstepping procedure. Neural networks are used to approximate the unknown dead-zone and unknown nonlinear functions. Comparative experiments on a turntable servo mechanism confirm the effectiveness of the devised control method.},

All followers in such a system are driven into a convex hull spanned by multiple leaders, which can be transformed into a problem of tracking a virtual trajectory generated by these leaders. For this purpose, a local state observer is put forward to estimate the state of each agent itself. Then, the estimated state is transmitted to corresponding neighbors governing by an innovation-based event-triggered scheduling protocol. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design both an event-based distributed controller and a state observer such that a prescribed ${\mathcal {H}_\infty }$ containment index can be achieved over a given finite horizon. First, with the help of the completing the square method, a sufficient condition is established to ensure the desired ${\mathcal {H}_\infty }$ containment performance. Then, by resort to a novel nominal energy cost index combined with Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse method, the desired controller and observer parameters are obtained by solving two coupled backward recursive Riccati difference equations. Two positive scalars in proposed nominal energy cost index provide a tradeoff among the controlled tracking errors, the energy of transformed control inputs, and the precision of estimated states.

  abstract     = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) underpin the solution to many problems in computational neuroscience. However, it is still unclear how to implement inference of HMMs with a network of neurons in the brain. The existing methods suffer from the problem of being nonspiking and inaccurate. Here, we build a precise equivalence between the inference equation of HMMs with time-invariant hidden variables and the dynamics of spiking winner-take-all (WTA) neural networks. We show that the membrane potential of each spiking neuron in the WTA circuit encodes the logarithm of the posterior probability of the hidden variable in each state, and the firing rate of each neuron is proportional to the posterior probability of the HMMs. We prove that the time course of the neural firing rate can implement posterior inference of HMMs. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed WTA circuit can get accurate inference results of HMMs.},

The first two methods, respectively, use a set of multiplier functions and multipliers for the hidden-layer nodes and implement the L 1 regularization on those, while the third method equipped with the same multipliers uses a smoothing approximation of the L 1 regularization. Each of these methods begins with a given number of hidden nodes, then the network is trained to obtain an optimal architecture discarding redundant hidden nodes using the multiplier functions or multipliers. A simple and generic method, namely, the matrix-based convergence proving method (MCPM), is introduced to prove the weak and strong convergence of the presented smoothing algorithms. The performance of the three pruning methods has been tested on 11 different classification datasets. The results demonstrate the efficient pruning abilities and competitive generalization by the proposed methods. The theoretical results are also validated by the results.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a framework for human-pose estimation from the wearable sensors that rely on a Lie group representation to model the geometry of the human movement. Human body joints are modeled by matrix Lie groups, using special orthogonal groups SO(2) and SO(3) for joint pose and special Euclidean group SE(3) for base-link pose representation. To estimate the human joint pose, velocity, and acceleration, we develop the equations for employing the extended Kalman filter on Lie groups (LG-EKF) to explicitly account for the non-Euclidean geometry of the state space. We present the observability analysis of an arbitrarily long kinematic chain of SO(3) elements based on a differential geometric approach, representing a generalization of kinematic chains of a human body. The observability is investigated for the system using marker position measurements. The proposed algorithm is compared with two competing approaches: 1) the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and 2) unscented KF (UKF) based on the Euler angle parametrization, in both simulations and extensive real-world experiments. The results show that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements over the Euler angle-based filters. It provides more accurate pose estimates, is not sensitive to gimbal lock, and more consistently estimates the covariances.},

This paper provides a survey of recent advances in distributed event-triggered estimation for dynamical systems operating over resource-constrained sensor networks. Local estimates of an unavailable state signal are calculated in a distributed and collaborative fashion based on only invoked sensor data. First, several fundamental issues associated with the design of distributed estimators are discussed in detail, such as estimator structures, communication constraints, and design methods. Second, an emphasis is laid on recent developments of distributed event-triggered estimation that has received considerable attention in the past few years. Then, the principle of an event-triggered mechanism is outlined and recent results in this subject are sorted out in accordance with different event-triggering conditions. Third, applications of distributed event-triggered estimation in practical sensor network-based monitoring systems including distributed grid-connected generation systems and target tracking systems are provided.

  abstract     = {Deep multitask learning for face analysis has received increasing attentions. From literature, most existing methods focus on optimizing a main task by jointly learning several auxiliary tasks. It is challenging to consider the performance of each task in a multitask framework due to the following reasons: 1) different face tasks usually rely on different levels of semantic features; 2) each task has different learning convergence rate, which could affect the whole performance when joint training; and 3) multitask model needs rich label information for efficient training, but existing facial datasets provide limited annotations. To address these issues, we propose a task-oriented feature-fused network (TFN) for simultaneously solving face detection, landmark localization, and attribute analysis. In this network, a task-oriented feature-fused block is designed to learn task-specific feature combinations; then, an alternative multitask training scheme is presented to optimize each task with considering of their different learning capacities. We also present a large-scale face dataset called JFA in support of proposed method, which provides multivariate labels, including face bounding box, 68 facial landmarks, and 3 attribute labels (i.e., apparent age, gender, and ethnicity). The experimental results suggest that the TFN outperforms several multitask models on the JFA dataset. Furthermore, our approach achieves competitive performances on WIDER FACE and 300W dataset, and obtains state-of-the-art results for gender recognition on the MORPH II dataset.},

  abstract     = {We develop a novel method for measuring the similarity between complete weighted graphs, which are probed by means of the discrete-time quantum walks. Directly probing complete graphs using discrete-time quantum walks is intractable due to the cost of simulating the quantum walk. We overcome this problem by extracting a commute time minimum spanning tree from the complete weighted graph. The spanning tree is probed by a discrete-time quantum walk which is initialized using a weighted version of the Perron–Frobenius operator. This naturally encapsulates the edge weight information for the spanning tree extracted from the original graph. For each pair of complete weighted graphs to be compared, we simulate a discrete-time quantum walk on each of the corresponding commute time minimum spanning trees and, then, compute the associated density matrices for the quantum walks. The probability of the walk visiting each edge of the spanning tree is given by the diagonal elements of the density matrices. The similarity between each pair of graphs is then computed using either: 1) the inner product or 2) the negative exponential of the Jensen–Shannon divergence between the probability distributions. We show that in both cases the resulting similarity measure is positive definite and, therefore, corresponds to a kernel on the graphs. We perform a series of experiments on publicly available graph datasets from a variety of different domains, together with time-varying financial networks extracted from data for the New York Stock Exchange. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measures.},

Unlike using absolute coordinate, relative coordinate, interagent distance, or interagent bearing to specify the target formation and coordinate agents to achieve the formation, we study a coordination problem where the desired formation varies with time and only its geometric shape is predefined. Matrix-valued Laplacian approach has been adopted to address this problem in the continuous-time setting. However, the discrete-time counterpart is more challenging due to the constraint in information exchange. On the other hand, observe that in many real operations, at a given time instant, the agents will be able to plan their target formation configurations for a period of time ahead. We propose preview-based P-like and PDlike controllers for the formation control. The controllers with proper parameter setting are proved to be effective to address the dynamic formation control problem.

Dynamic active learning and cooperative learning are recently proposed approaches to reduce human effort of annotating data with subjective phenomena. In this paper, we introduce a novel generic annotation framework, with the aim to achieve the optimal tradeoff between label reliability and cost reduction by making efficient use of human and machine work force. To this end, we use dropout to assess model uncertainty and thereby to decide which instances can be automatically labeled by the machine and which ones require human inspection. In addition, we propose an early stopping criterion based on inter-rater agreement in order to focus human resources on those ambiguous instances that are difficult to label. In contrast to the existing algorithms, the new confidence measures are not only applicable to binary classification tasks but also regression problems. The proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark datasets for nonnative English prosody estimation, provided in the INTERSPEECH computational paralinguistics challenge. In the result, the novel dynamic cooperative learning algorithm yields 0.424 Spearman&#39;s correlation coefficient compared to 0.413 with passive learning, while reducing the amount of human annotations by 74\%.},

Each sensor is capable of sharing its measurement with its neighboring sensors in accordance with a prescribed network topology while suffering from random communication link failure.

First, a unified sensor measurement transmission model is put forward to account for the simultaneous presence of deception attacks and various network-induced constraints. Second, delicate secure distributed filters are constructed by admitting the corrupted sensor measurement. Third, theoretical analysis on finite-time 11-gain boundedness of the filtering error system and design of desired positive filters are carried out.

The MAP framework consists of two levels, namely, centralized mission planning and decentralized motion planning. On the first level, the centralized mission planning algorithm estimates the density of UAV in a given environment for determining the number of UGVs and their initial operating location. In the subsequent level, a decentralized motion planning algorithm which provides a closed-form expression for velocity command using adaptive density estimation has been proposed. Further, the physical and geographical constraints are integrated into motion planning. A Monte-Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the advantages of the MAP over distributed stationary stations (DSSs) often used in the literature. The obtained results clearly indicate that in comparison with DSS, MAP reduces the average distance traveled by UAVs about 20\%, reduces the loss of mission time by 90 s per interruption and power loss by 3 dB.},

  abstract     = {Mining useful patterns from varied types of databases is an important research topic, which has many reallife applications. Most studies have considered the frequency as sole interestingness measure to identify high-quality patterns. However, each object is different in nature. The relative importance of objects is not equal, in terms of criteria, such as the utility, risk, or interest. Besides, another limitation of frequent patterns is that they generally have a low occupancy, that is, they often represent small sets of items in transactions containing many items and, thus, may not be truly representative of these transactions. To extract high-quality patterns in real-life applications, this paper extends the occupancy measure to also assess the utility of patterns in transaction databases. We propose an efficient algorithm named high-utility occupancy pattern mining (HUOPM). It considers user preferences in terms of frequency, utility, and occupancy. A novel frequency-utility tree and two compact data structures, called the utility-occupancy list and frequency-utility table, are designed to provide global and partial downward closure properties for pruning the search space. The proposed method can efficiently discover the complete set of high-quality patterns without candidate generation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Results show that the derived patterns are intelligible, reasonable, and acceptable, and that HUOPM with its pruning strategies outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm, in terms of runtime and search space, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the proposal of using two bio-inspired metaheuristics-genetic algorithms (GAs) and particle swarm optimization (PSO)-to adjust the free coefficients of a Gaussian adaptive proportional-integral-derivative (GAPID) controller. When a specific adaptation rule is imposed to a conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, either by means of a hyperbolic tangent function or a Gaussian function, the solution is left exposed to the function restrictions/impositions. Finding the correct proportionality between the parameters is an arduous task, which often does not have an algebraic solution. Each Gaussian function of each control action has three parameters, resulting in a total of nine parameters to be defined. This paper proposes making the parameters linked to the linear PID gains, in order to keep the GAPID the same design requirements as for the PID. Then, two metaheuristics (GA and PSO) were employed in order to find the best parameters for the GAPID. A comparison between these two strategies is presented. In this investigation, a well-known plant of a step-down dc-dc converter is used, which represents a typical second-order system, where the absence of significant nonlinearities helps focus the study on the control behavior. Simulation and experimentation were performed, and both have been successful, but PSO stood out due to its simplicity and low-computational effort.},

However, previous studies usually considered PCMs to be an integral component of a complex DE algorithm. Thus, the characteristics and performance of each method are poorly understood. We present an in-depth review of 24 PCMs for the scale factor and crossover rate in DE and a large-scale benchmarking study. We carefully extract the 24 PCMs from their original, complex algorithms and describe them according to a systematic manner. Our review facilitates the understanding of similarities and differences between existing, representative PCMs. The performance of DEs with the 24 PCMs and 16 variation operators is investigated on 24 black-box benchmark functions. Our benchmarking results reveal which methods exhibit high performance when embedded in a standardized framework under 16 different conditions, independent from their original, complex algorithms. We also investigate how much room there is for further improvement of PCMs by comparing the 24 methods with an oracle-based model, which can be considered to be a conservative lower bound on the performance of an optimal method.},

  abstract     = {Noise that afflicts natural images, regardless of the source, generally disturbs the perception of image quality by introducing a high-frequency random element that, when severe, can mask image content. Except at very low levels, where it may play a purpose, it is annoying. There exist significant statistical differences between distortion-free natural images and noisy images that become evident upon comparing the empirical probability distribution histograms of their discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients. The DWT coefficients of low- or no-noise natural images have leptokurtic, peaky distributions with heavy tails; while noisy images tend to be platykurtic with less peaky distributions and shallower tails. The sample kurtosis is a natural measure of the peakedness and tail weight of the distributions of random variables. Here, we study the efficacy of the sample kurtosis of image wavelet coefficients as a feature driving, an extreme learning machine which learns to map kurtosis values into perceptual quality scores. The model is trained and tested on five types of noisy images, including additive white Gaussian noise, additive Gaussian color noise, impulse noise, masked noise, and high-frequency noise from the LIVE, CSIQ, TID2008, and TID2013 image quality databases. The experimental results show that the trained model has better quality evaluation performance on noisy images than existing blind noise assessment models, while also outperforming general-purpose blind and full-reference image quality assessment methods.},

The emergence of depth data provides additional information to construct more discriminating context representations. Depth data preserves the geometric relationship of objects in a scene, which is generally hard to be inferred from RGB images. While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successful in solving semantic segmentation, we encounter the problem of optimizing CNN training for the informative context using depth data to enhance the segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel switchable context network (SCN) to facilitate semantic segmentation of RGB-D images. Depth data is used to identify objects existing in multiple image regions. The network analyzes the information in the image regions to identify different characteristics, which are then used selectively through switching network branches. With the content extracted from the inherent image structure, we are able to generate effective context representations that are aware of both image structures and object relationships, leading to a more coherent learning of semantic segmentation network. We demonstrate that our SCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets.},

To address this issue, we propose a generic front modeling method for evolutionary multiobjective optimization, where the shape of the nondominated front is estimated by training a generalized simplex model. On the basis of the estimated front, we further develop an MOEA, where both the mating selection and environmental selection are driven by the approximate nondominated fronts modeled during the optimization process. For performance assessment, the proposed algorithm is compared with several state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms on a wide range of benchmark problems with various types of PFs and different numbers of objectives.

Unlike the vectorization of a feature matrix in traditional clustering algorithms, an unsupervised pattern recognition scheme based on matrix data is proposed for MTS samples in this paper. To reduce the computational load and time consumption, a novel variable-based principal component analysis (VPCA) is first devised for the dimensionality reduction of MTS samples. Afterward, a spatial weighted matrix distancebased fuzzy clustering (SWMDFC) algorithm is proposed to directly group MTS samples into clusters as well as preserve the structure of the data matrix. The spatial weighted matrix distance (SWMD) integrates the spatial dimensionality difference of elements of data into the distance of MST pairs. In terms of the SWMD, the MTS samples are clustered without vectorization in the dimensionality-reduced feature matrix space. Finally, three open-access datasets are utilized for the validation of the proposed unsupervised classification scheme. The results show that the VPCA can capture more features of MTS data than principal component analysis (PCA) and 2-D PCA. Furthermore, the clustering performance of SWMDFC is superior to that of fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms based on the Euclidean distance or image Euclidean distance.},

  abstract     = {Closed-loop control of functional electrical stimulation coupled with motorized assistance to induce cycling is a rehabilitative strategy that can improve the mobility of people with neurological conditions (NCs). However, robust control methods, which are currently pervasive in the cycling literature, have limited effectiveness due to the use of high stimulation intensity leading to accelerated fatigue during cycling protocols. This paper examines the design of a distributed repetitive learning controller (RLC) that commands an independent learning feedforward term to each of the six stimulated lower-limb muscle groups and an electric motor during the tracking of a periodic cadence trajectory. The switched controller activates lower limb muscles during kinematic efficient regions of the crank cycle and provides motorized assistance only when most needed (i.e., during the portions of the crank cycle where muscles evoke a low torque output). The controller exploits the periodicity of the desired cadence trajectory to learn from previous control inputs for each muscle group and electric motor. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees asymptotic tracking via an invariance-like corollary for nonsmooth systems. The switched distributed RLC was evaluated in experiments with seven able-bodied individuals and five participants with NCs. A mean root-mean-squared cadence error of 3.58 ± 0.43 revolutions per minute (RPM) (0.07 ± 7.35\% average error) and 4.26 ± 0.84 RPM (0.1 ± 8.99\% average error) was obtained for the healthy and neurologically impaired populations, respectively.},

LMDML employs the principle of margin maximization to learn the distance metric with the goal of improving k-nearest-neighbor classification. The main challenge of distance metric learning is the positive semidefiniteness constraint on the Mahalanobis matrix. Semidefinite programming is commonly used to enforce this constraint, but it becomes computationally intractable on large-scale data sets. To overcome this limitation, we develop an efficient algorithm based on a stochastic gradient descent. Our algorithm can avoid the computations of the full gradient and ensure that the learned matrix remains within the positive semidefinite cone after each iteration. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm is scalable to large data sets and outperforms other state-of-the-art distance metric learning approaches regarding classification accuracy and training time.},

It decomposes the original search space into L subregions and executes L parallel processes searching in these subregions simultaneously. Inside each subregion, the PPLS/D process is guided by a unique scalar objective function. PPLS/D differs from the well-known two phase PLS in that it uses the scalar objective function to guide every move of the PLS procedure in a fine-grained manner. In the experimental studies, PPLS/D is compared against the basic PLS and a recently proposed PLS variant on the multiobjective unconstrained binary quadratic programming problems and the multiobjective traveling salesman problems with, at most, four objectives.

  abstract     = {Cross-modal retrieval has drawn wide interest for retrieval across different modalities (such as text, image, video, audio, and 3-D model). However, existing methods based on a deep neural network often face the challenge of insufficient cross-modal training data, which limits the training effectiveness and easily leads to overfitting. Transfer learning is usually adopted for relieving the problem of insufficient training data, but it mainly focuses on knowledge transfer only from large-scale datasets as a single-modal source domain (such as ImageNet) to a single-modal target domain . In fact, such large-scale single-modal datasets also contain rich modal-independent semantic knowledge that can be shared across different modalities. Besides, large-scale cross-modal datasets are very labor-consuming to collect and label, so it is significant to fully exploit the knowledge in single-modal datasets for boosting cross-modal retrieval. To achieve the above goal, this paper proposes a modal-adversarial hybrid transfer network (MHTN), which aims to realize knowledge transfer from a single-modal source domain to a cross-modal target domain and learn cross-modal common representation. It is an end-to-end architecture with two subnetworks. First, a modal-sharing knowledge transfer subnetwork is proposed to jointly transfer knowledge from a single modality in the source domain to all modalities in the target domain with a star network structure, which distills modal-independent supplementary knowledge for promoting cross-modal common representation learning. Second, a modal-adversarial semantic learning subnetwork is proposed to construct an adversarial training mechanism between the common representation generator and modality discriminator, making the common representation discriminative for semantics but indiscriminative for modalities to enhance cross-modal semantic consistency during the transfer process. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used datasets show the effectiveness of MHTN.},

The aim of the proposed method is to eliminate the restrictive assumptions that the local input matrix Bi must be uniform and the sliding mode surface proposed did not consider the stochastic perturbations, which are required in most existing results.

The sliding mode surface parameter matrix K(x) can be obtained through the provided sum of squares conditions. Second, by using an improved Lyapunov method and a new proposed lemma, a novel sliding mode control law is designed to keep the state of the closed-loop systems on the VISMS approximately since the initial time. Third, a practical example and a numerical one are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances of subspace clustering have provided a new way of constructing affinity matrices for clustering. Unlike the kernel-based subspace clustering, which needs tedious tuning among infinitely many kernel candidates, the self-expressive models derived from linear subspace assumptions in modern subspace clustering methods are rigorously combined with sparse or low-rank optimization theory to yield an affinity matrix as a solution of an optimization problem. Despite this nice theoretical aspect, the affinity matrices of modern subspace clustering have quite different meanings from the traditional ones, and even though the affinity matrices are expected to have a rough block-diagonal structure, it is unclear whether these are good enough to apply spectral clustering. In fact, most of the subspace clustering methods perform some sort of affinity value rearrangement to apply spectral clustering, but its adequacy for the spectral clustering is not clear; even though the spectral clustering step can also have a critical impact on the overall performance. To resolve this issue, in this paper, we provide a nonparametric method to estimate the probabilistic cluster membership from these affinity matrices, which we can directly find the clusters from. The likelihood for an affinity matrix is defined nonparametrically based on histograms given the probabilistic membership, which is defined as a combination of probability simplices, and an additional prior probability is defined to regularize the membership as a Bernoulli distribution. Solving this maximum a posteriori problem replaces the spectral clustering procedure, and the final discrete cluster membership can be calculated by selecting the clusters with maximum probabilities. The proposed method provides state-of-the-art performance for well-known subspace clustering methods on popular benchmark databases.},

  abstract     = {Multispectral images contain rich recognition information since the multispectral camera can reveal information that is not visible to the human eye or to the conventional RGB camera. Due to this characteristic of multispectral images, multispectral face recognition has attracted lots of research interest. Although some multispectral face recognition methods have been presented in the last decade, how to fully and effectively explore the intraspectrum discriminant information and the useful interspectrum correlation information in multispectral face images for recognition has not been well studied. To boost the performance of multispectral face recognition, we propose an intraspectrum discrimination and interspectrum correlation analysis deep network (IDICN) approach. Multiple spectra are divided into several spectrum-sets, with each containing a group of spectra within a small spectral range. The IDICN network contains a set of spectrum-set-specific deep convolutional neural networks attempting to extract spectrum-set-specific features, followed by a spectrum pooling layer, whose target is to select a group of spectra with favorable discriminative abilities adaptively. IDICN jointly learns the nonlinear representations of the selected spectra, such that the intraspectrum Fisher loss and the interspectrum discriminant correlation are minimized. Experiments on the well-known Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Western Australia multispectral face datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over several state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper proposes a new text image motion deblurring method by exploiting the sparse properties of both text image itself and kernel. It incorporates the L 0 -norm for regularizing the blur kernel in the deblurring model, besides the L 0 sparse priors for the text image and its gradient. Such a L 0 -norm-based model is efficiently optimized by half-quadratic splitting coupled with the fast conjugate descent method. To further improve the quality of the recovered kernel, a structure-preserving kernel denoising method is also developed to filter out the noisy pixels, yielding a clean kernel curve. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method. The source code and results are available at: https://github.com/shenjianbing/text-image-deblur.},

Specifically, the primary encoder conducts coarse encoding in a regular way, while the secondary encoder models the importance of words and generates more fine encoding based on the input raw text and the previously generated output text summarization. The two level encodings are combined and fed into the decoder to generate more diverse summary that can decrease repetition phenomenon for long sequence generation. The experimental results on two challenging datasets (i.e., CNN/DailyMail and DUC 2004) demonstrate that our dual encoding model performs against existing methods.},

Under the proposed law, the position vectors of all the agents are shown to reach an agreement in the intersection of their individual targeted sets and the velocity vector of each agent is shown to converge to zero. Then, a time-dependent performance bound is set for the norm of the weighted error of the relative positions among neighboring agents and the absolute velocity of the agent, and a performance-guaranteed aggregation controller is designed to guarantee the prescribed transient performance. During the process of aggregation, the norm of the weighted error is shown to not exceed the performance bound. The convergence conditions of the proposed algorithms with respect to the control strength and the terms induced by the approximate projection are obtained by using the techniques of convex analysis and Lyapunov stability.

In one LKF, the system state vector is coupled with those vectors inherited from the second-order Bessel-Legendre inequality through delay-dependent matrices, while no such coupling of them exists in the other LKF. These two LKFs are referred to as the coupled LKF and the noncoupled LKF, respectively. A number of delay-dependent passivity criteria are derived by employing a convex approach and a nonconvex approach to deal with the square of the time-varying delay appearing in the derivative of the LKF. Through numerical simulation, it is found that: 1) the coupled LKF is more beneficial than the noncoupled LKF for reducing the conservatism of the obtained passivity criteria and 2) the passivity criteria using the convex approach can deliver larger delay upper bounds than those using the nonconvex approach.},

Accordingly, we propose a dual-decomposition-based approach that includes both objective decomposition and domain decomposition. In the former, the original objective function is decomposed into several relatively simple subobjectives to isolate the nondifferentiable part of the objective function, and the problem is consequently formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP). In the latter decomposition, we decompose the domain into two subdomains, that is, the differentiable and nondifferentiable domains, to isolate the nondifferentiable domain of the nondifferentiable subobjective. Subsequently, the problem can be optimized with different schemes in the different subdomains. We propose a population-based optimization algorithm, called the simulated water-stream algorithm (SWA), for solving this MOP. The SWA is inspired by the natural phenomenon of water streams moving toward a basin, which is analogous to the process of searching for the minimal solutions of an optimization problem. The proposed SWA combines the deterministic search and heuristic search in a single framework. Experiments show that the SWA yields promising results compared with its existing counterparts.},

One challenging problem that obstructs the development of the control scheme is that the direct application of the quantized signal containing high-frequency components to the hysteretic actuator will lead to system performance deterioration. To resolve this challenge, we propose a filter-connected quantizer in which a hysteretic quantizer is employed to reduce the communication rate and an adaptive high-cut filter is designed to smooth the hysteresis input. Furthermore, based on fuzzy logic systems&#39; online approximation capability, a novel adaptive fuzzy control scheme involves a new control strategy and an adaptive strategy is constructed via a backstepping technique. It is proved that the proposed control scheme guarantees the tracking error is asymptotically convergent to an adjustable neighborhood of zero and all of the closed-loop signals are uniform ultimate bounded.

First, a dynamic event-triggering mechanism is introduced, including some existing static event-triggering mechanisms as its special cases. Second, based on the dynamic event-triggering mechanism, a distributed control protocol is developed, which ensures that all agents can reach consensus with an exponential convergence rate. Third, it is shown that, with the dynamic event-triggering mechanism, the minimum interevent time between any two consecutive triggering instants can be prolonged and no agent exhibits Zeno behavior. Finally, an algorithm is provided to avoid continuous communication when the dynamic eventtriggering mechanism is implemented. The effectiveness of the results is confirmed through a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {Locating a mobile target, untrackable in real-time, is pertinent to numerous time-critical applications, such as wilderness search and rescue. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to this dynamic problem, where both static and mobile sensors are utilized for the goal of detecting a target. The approach is novel in that a team of robots utilized to deploy a staticsensor network also actively searches for the target via on-board sensors. Synergy is achieved through: 1) optimal deployment planning of static-sensor networks and 2) optimal routing and motion planning of the robots for the deployment of the network and target search. The static-sensor network is planned first to maximize the likelihood of target detection while ensuring (temporal and spatial) unbiasedness in target motion. Robot motions are, subsequently, planned in two stages: 1) route planning and 2) trajectory planning. In the first stage, given a static-sensor network configuration, robot routes are planned to maximize the amount of spare time available to the mobile agents/sensors, for target search in between (just-in-time) static-sensor deployments. In the second stage, given robot routes (i.e., optimal sequences of sensor delivery locations and times), the corresponding robot trajectories are planned to make effective use of any spare time the mobile agents may have to search for the target. The proposed search strategy was validated through extensive simulations, some of which are given in detail here. An analysis of the method&#39;s performance in terms of target-search success is also included.},

Designing fixed-time control has recently gained much attention since, for this type of control structure, the convergence time of the states does not depend on initial conditions, unlike other control methods providing faster convergence. This paper proposes a new distributed algorithm for second-order consensus in multiagent systems by using a full-order fixed-time convergent sliding surface. The stability analysis is performed using the Lyapunov function and bi-homogenous property. Moreover, the proposed control is smooth and free from any singularity. The robustness of the proposed scheme is verified both in the presence of Lipschitz disturbances and uncertainties in the network.

  abstract     = {Many well-known first-order gradient methods have been extended to cope with large-scale composite problems, which often arise as a regularized empirical risk minimization in machine learning. However, their optimal convergence is attained only in terms of the weighted average of past iterative solutions. How to make the individual convergence of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimal, especially for strongly convex problems has now become a challenging problem in the machine learning community. On the other hand, Nesterov&#39;s recent weighted averaging strategy succeeds in achieving the optimal individual convergence of dual averaging (DA) but it fails in the basic mirror descent (MD). In this paper, a new primal averaging (PA) gradient operation step is presented, in which the gradient evaluation is imposed on the weighted average of all past iterative solutions. We prove that simply modifying the gradient operation step in MD by PA strategy suffices to recover the optimal individual rate for general convex problems. Along this line, the optimal individual rate of convergence for strongly convex problems can also be achieved by imposing the strong convexity on the gradient operation step. Furthermore, we extend PA-MD to solve regularized nonsmooth learning problems in the stochastic setting, which reveals that PA strategy is a simple yet effective extra step toward the optimal individual convergence of SGD. Several real experiments on sparse learning and SVM problems verify the correctness of our theoretical analysis.},

Let X denote the feature and Y as the label. The most typical problem to be addressed is that P XY has a so large variation between different domains that classification in the target domain is difficult. In this paper, we study the generalized conditional domain adaptation (DA) problem, in which both P Y and P X|Y change across domains, in a causal perspective. We propose transforming the class conditional probability matching to the marginal probability matching problem, under a proper assumption. We build an intermediate domain by employing a regression model. In order to enforce the most relevant data to reconstruct the intermediate representations, a low-rank constraint is placed on the regression model for regularization. The low-rank constraint underlines a global algebraic structure between different domains, and stresses the group compactness in representing the samples. The new model is considered under the discriminant subspace framework, which is favorable in simultaneously extracting the classification information from the source domain and adaptation information across domains. The model can be solved by an alternative optimization manner of quadratic programming and the alternative Lagrange multiplier method. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to exploit low-rank representation, from the source domain to the intermediate domain, to learn the domain adaptive features. Comprehensive experimental results validate that the proposed method provides better classification accuracies with DA, compared with well-established baselines.},

More general nonlinear systems are described in the model since the selections of premise variables are the states of the system. First, a novel integral sliding surface function is proposed on the observer space, then the sliding mode dynamics and error dynamics are obtained in accordance with estimated premise variables. Second, sufficient conditions for stochastic stability with an H∞ performance disturbance attenuation level γ of the sliding mode dynamics with different input matrices are obtained based on generally uncertain transition rates. Third, an observer-based adaptive controller is synthesized to ensure the finite time reachability of a predefined sliding surface. Finally, the single-link robot arm model is provided to verify the control scheme numerically.},

  abstract     = {Texture analysis has attracted increasing attention in computer vision due to its power in describing images and the physical properties of objects. Among the methods for texture analysis, complex network (CN)-based ones have emerged to model images because of their flexibility. In image modeling, each pixel is mapped to a vertex of the CN and two vertices are connected if they are spatially close in the image. Then measurements are extracted from the CN to characterize its topology and therefore characterize the image content. Despite the promising results, the accuracy of these methods depends on the suitability of the measurement for the application. In texture analysis, simple measurements have been used, such as those based on vertex degree and shortest paths. Motivated by these issues, this paper proposes a new method for texture analysis based on the CN and a new measurement that calculates the importance of each vertex within its neighborhood. For calculating the importance of vertices, we extend the pagerank to CN in order to correlate the vertex importance with its degree and show that this new measurement extracts texture properties. Experimental results on well-known datasets and in the recognition of soybean diseases using leaf texture show the effectiveness of the proposed method for texture recognition.},

  abstract     = {As a novel computational paradigm, Physarum solver has received increasing attention from the researchers in tackling a plethora of network optimization problems. However, the convergence of Physarum solver is grounded by solving a system of linear equations iteratively, which often leads to low computational performance. Two factors have been highlighted along the process: 1) high time complexity in solving the system of linear equations and 2) extensive iterations required for convergence. Thus, Physarum solver has been largely restricted by its unsatisfactory computational performance. In this paper, we aim to address these two issues by developing two enhancement strategies: 1) pruning inactive nodes and 2) terminating Physarum solver in advance. First, extensive nodes and edges become and stay inactive after a few iterations in identifying the shortest path. Removing these inactive nodes and edges significantly decreases the graph size, thereby reducing computational complexity. Second, we define a transition phase for edges. All of the paths experiencing such a transition phase are dynamically aggregated to form a set of near-optimal paths among which the optimal path is included. Depth-first search is then leveraged to identify the optimal path from the near-optimal paths set. Earlier termination of Physarum solver saves considerable iterations while guaranteeing the optimality of the found solution. Empirically, 20 randomly generated sparse and complete graphs with network sizes ranging from 50 to 2000 as well as two realworld traffic networks are used to compare the performance of accelerated Physarum solver to the other two state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Facing the challenges of an increasing number of objectives, many techniques have been developed which help to balance the convergence and diversity. Nevertheless, according to a recent study by Ishibuchi et al., due to the predefined search directions toward the ideal point, their performance strongly depends on the Pareto front (PF) shapes, especially the orientation of the PFs. To balance the convergence and diversity for decomposition-based methods and to alleviate their performance dependence on the orientation of the PFs, this paper develops an adversarial decomposition method for many-objective optimization, which leverages the complementary characteristics of different subproblem formulations within a single paradigm. More specifically, two populations are co-evolved by two subproblem formulations with different contours and adversarial search directions. To avoid allocating redundant computational resources to the same region of the PF, the two populations are matched into one-to-one solution pairs according to their working regions upon the PF. Each solution pair can at most contribute one principal mating parent during the mating selection process. When comparing nine state-of-the-art many-objective optimizers, we have witnessed the competitive performance of our proposed algorithm on 130 many-objective test problems with various characteristics, including regular and inverted PFs.},

A novel transfer-based additive LS-SVM classifier is accordingly proposed. This method also simultaneously determines the influence of classification errors caused by each incomplete sample using a fast leave-one-out cross validation strategy, as an alternative way to clean the training data to further improve the data quality. The proposed method has been applied to seven public datasets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves at least comparable, if not better, performance than case deletion, mean imputation, and k-nearest neighbor imputation methods, followed by the standard LS-SVM and support vector machine classifiers.

In order to make the defensive measures better, one needs to understand the behavior from the view of an attacker. In this paper, the problem of false data injection attack on remote state estimation with resource constraints is studied in two cases, where the first case is that the attacker adds a Gaussian noise to the innovation, while the other is that the attacker employs a Gaussian noise to replace the innovation. In addition, the attacker is assumed to has a resource constraint, i.e., he/she cannot attack all the sensors, at the same time should decide which sensors to attack. By using the matrix theory, the optimal attack strategy problem, which aims to maximize the trace of the remote estimation error covariance, is converted into a convex optimization problem that can be solved. Thus, an optimal attack strategy is given to illustrate which sensors should be attacked. An example is given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The digital age has empowered brands with new and more effective targeted marketing tools in the form of key opinion leaders (KOLs). Because of the KOLs&#39; unique capability to draw specific types of audience and cultivate long-term relationship with them, correctly identifying the most suitable KOLs within a social network is of great importance, and sometimes could govern the success or failure of a brand&#39;s online marketing campaigns. However, given the high dimensionality of social media data, conducting effective KOL identification by means of data mining is especially challenging. Owing to the generally multiple modalities of the user profiles and user-generated content (UGC) over the social networks, we can approach the KOL identification process as a multimodal learning task, with KOLs as a rare yet far more important class over non-KOLs in our consideration. In this regard, learning the compact and informative representation from the high-dimensional multimodal space is crucial in KOL identification. To address this challenging problem, in this paper, we propose a novel subspace learning algorithm dubbed modality-consistent harmonized discriminant embedding (MCHDE) to uncover the low-dimensional discriminative representation from the social media data for identifying KOLs. Specifically, MCHDE aims to find a common subspace for multiple modalities, in which the local geometric structure, the harmonized discriminant information, and the modality consistency of the dataset could be preserved simultaneously. The above objective is then formulated as a generalized eigendecomposition problem and the closed-form solution is obtained. Experiments on both synthetic example and a realworld KOL dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

They, however, show poor scalability to large-scale networks due to the exponential increase of search space. In this paper, we suggest a network reduction-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for community detection in large-scale networks, where the size of the networks is recursively reduced as the evolution proceeds. In each reduction of the network, the local communities found by the elite individuals in the population are identified as nodes of the reduced network for further evolution, thereby considerably reducing the search space. A local community repairing strategy is also suggested to correct the misidentified nodes after each network reduction during the evolution. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over several state-of-the-art community detection algorithms for large-scale networks, in terms of both computational efficiency and detection performance.},

Simulation results of two multiobjective test problems with multiple subpopulations justify the derived Markov model, and show that the proposed multipopulation method can improve the optimization ability of the MOGA.

  abstract     = {Existing methodologies for tool condition monitoring (TCM) still rely on batch approaches which cannot cope with a fast sampling rate of a metal cutting process. Furthermore, they require a retraining process to be completed from scratch when dealing with a new set of machining parameters. This paper presents an online TCM approach based on Parsimonious Ensemble+ (pENsemble+). The unique feature of pENsemble+ lies in its highly flexible principle where both the ensemble structure and base-classifier structure can automatically grow and shrink on the fly based on the characteristics of data streams. Moreover, the online feature selection scenario is integrated to actively sample relevant input attributes. This paper presents advancement of a newly developed ensemble learning algorithm, pENsemble, where the online active learning scenario is incorporated to reduce the operator&#39;s labeling effort. The ensemble merging scenario is proposed which allows reduction of ensemble complexity while retaining its diversity. Experimental studies utilizing two real-world manufacturing data streams: 1) metal turning and 2) 3-D-printing processes and comparisons with wellknown algorithms were carried out. Furthermore, the efficacy of pENsemble+ was examined using benchmark concept drift data streams. It has been found that pENsemble+ incurs low structural complexity and results in a significant reduction of the operator&#39;s labeling effort.},

Based on the framework, a multiobjective rule-based cooperative continuous ant-colony optimization (MO-RCCACO) algorithm is proposed to optimize all of the free parameters in FSs. Instead of optimization using a single colony of FSs (solutions), the MO-RCCACO consists of r subcolonies of size N cooperatively optimizing an FS that consists of r rules, with a subcolony optimizing only a single fuzzy rule. In addition, an auxiliary colony is created to store all of the fuzzy rules in the best-so-far N FSs to enhance the optimization ability of MO-RCCACO. The performance ranking of different fuzzy rules in the same subcolony is performed based on the multiobjective function values of their participating FSs by using Pareto nondominated sorting and the crowding distance. The MO-RCCACO is applied to find the Pareto-optimal fuzzy controllers (FCs) of a mobile robot for wall following with multiple control objectives. The optimization ability of the MO-RCCACO is verified through comparisons with various multiobjective population-based optimization algorithms in the robot wall-following control problem. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the MO-RCCACO-based FCs for the boundary following control of a real robot.},

  abstract     = {Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical supervised subspace learning technique that has wide applications. However, it is designed for vector only, which cannot exploit the tensor structures and may lead to suboptimal results when dealing with tensorial data. To address this problem, several multilinear LDA (MLDA) methods have been proposed to learn the subspaces from tensors. By exploiting the tensor structures, they achieve compact subspace representations, reduced parameter sizes, and improved robustness against the small sample size problem. However, existing MLDA methods do not take data uncertainty into account, fail to converge properly, or have to introduce additional tuning parameters for good convergence properties. In this paper, we therefore solve these limitations by proposing a probabilistic MLDA method for matrix inputs. Specifically, we propose a new generative model to incorporate structural information into the probabilistic framework, where each observed matrix is represented as a linear combination of collective and individual rank-one matrices. This provides our method with both the expressiveness of capturing discriminative features and nondiscriminative noise, and the capability of exploiting the 2-D tensor structures. To overcome the convergence problem of existing MLDAs, we develop an EMtype algorithm for parameter estimation, which has closed-form solutions with convergence guarantees. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the superiority of the proposed method to other probabilistic and MLDA variants.},

  abstract     = {The desired rhythmic signals for adaptive walking of humanoid robots should have proper frequencies, phases, and shapes. Matsuoka&#39;s central pattern generator (CPG) is able to generate rhythmic signals with reasonable frequencies and phases, and thus has been widely applied to control the movements of legged robots, such as walking of humanoid robots. However, it is difficult for this kind of CPG to generate rhythmic signals with desired shapes, which limits the adaptability of walking of humanoid robots in various environments. To address this issue, a new framework that can generate desired rhythmic signals for Matsuoka&#39;s CPG is presented. The proposed framework includes three main parts. First, feature processing is conducted to transform the Matsuoka&#39;s CPG outputs into a normalized limit cycle. Second, by combining the normalized limit cycle with robot feedback as the feature inputs and setting the required learning objective, the neural network (NN) learns to generate desired rhythmic signals. Finally, in order to ensure the continuity of the desired rhythmic signals, signal filtering is applied to the outputs of NN, with the aim of smoothing the discontinuous parts. Numerical experiments on the proposed framework suggest that it can not only generate a variety of rhythmic signals with desired shapes but also preserve the frequency and phase properties of Matsuoka&#39;s CPG. In addition, the proposed framework is embedded into a control system for adaptive omnidirectional walking of humanoid robot NAO. Extensive simulation and real experiments on this control system demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to generate desired rhythmic signals for adaptive walking of NAO on fixed and changing inclined surfaces. Furthermore, the comparison studies verify that the proposed framework can significantly improve the adaptability of NAO&#39;s walking compared with the other methods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the multiview nonlinear subspace representation problem. Traditional multiview subspace learning methods assume that the heterogeneous features of the data usually lie within the union of multiple linear subspaces. However, instead of linear subspaces, the data feature actually resides in multiple nonlinear subspaces in many real-world applications, resulting in unsatisfactory clustering performance. To overcome this, we propose a hyper-Laplacian regularized multilinear multiview self-representation model, which is referred to as HLR-M 2 VS, to jointly learn multiple views correlation and a local geometrical structure in a unified tensor space and view-specific self-representation feature spaces, respectively. In unified tensor space, a well-founded tensor low-rank regularization is adopted to impose on the self-representation coefficient tensor to ensure global consensus among different views. In view-specific feature space, hypergraph-induced hyper-Laplacian regularization is utilized to preserve the local geometrical structure embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. An efficient algorithm is then derived to solve the optimization problem of the established model with theoretical convergence guarantee. Furthermore, the proposed model can be extended to semisupervised classification without introducing any additional parameters. An extensive experiment of our method is conducted on many challenging datasets, where a clear advance over state-of-the-art multiview clustering and multiview semisupervised classification approaches is achieved.},

With the goal of providing match ranking results between each query person image and the gallery ones, the person re-id technique has been widely explored and a large number of person re-id methods have been developed. As these algorithms leverage different kinds of prior assumptions, image features, distance matching functions, et al., each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses. Inspired by these facts, this paper proposes a novel person re-id method based on the idea of inferring superior fusion results from a variety of previous base person re-id algorithms using different methodologies or features. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel framework which mainly consists of two steps: 1) a number of existing person re-id methods are implemented, and the ranking results are obtained in the test datasets. and 2) the robust fusion strategy is applied to obtain better re-ranked matching results by simultaneously considering the recognition abilities of various base re-id methods and the difficulties of different gallery person images to be correctly recognized under the generative model of labels, abilities, and difficulties framework. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method, and we have received state-of-the-art results on recent popular person re-id datasets.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the distributed containment control problem for a class of general second-order multiagent systems with switched dynamics, which is composed of a continuous-time (CT) subsystem and a discrete-time (DT) subsystem. For this switched multiagent system under fixed directed topology, a distributed containment control protocol is proposed for each follower based on the relative local measurements of neighboring followers and leaders. Some necessary and sufficient conditions are derived under the condition that the network topology contains a directed spanning forest, and these conditions ensure that the general second-order containment control problem can be solved under arbitrary CT-DT switching. If the general second-order system is reduced to the double integrator system, some simpler containment conditions are presented. Furthermore, the similar results are also obtained under switching directed topology. Finally, some simulation examples are presented to show the efficiency of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world optimization problems can be solved by using the data-driven approach only, simply because no analytic objective functions are available for evaluating candidate solutions. In this paper, we address a class of expensive data-driven constrained multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems, where the objectives and constraints can be calculated only on the basis of a large amount of data. To solve this class of problems, we propose using random forests (RFs) and radial basis function networks as surrogates to approximate both objective and constraint functions. In addition, logistic regression models are introduced to rectify the surrogate-assisted fitness evaluations and a stochastic ranking selection is adopted to further reduce the influences of the approximated constraint functions. Three variants of the proposed algorithm are empirically evaluated on multiobjective knapsack benchmark problems and two real-world trauma system design problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the variant using RF models as the surrogates is effective and efficient in solving data-driven constrained multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, keystroke-based pattern recognition techniques, as a forensic tool for behavioral biometrics, have gained increasing attention. Although a number of machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, they are limited in terms of their capability to recognize and profile a set of an individual&#39;s characteristics. In addition, up to today, their focus was primarily gender and age, which seem to be more appropriate for commercial applications (such as developing commercial software), leaving out from research other characteristics, such as the educational level. Educational level is an acquired user characteristic, which can improve targeted advertising, as well as provide valuable information in a digital forensic investigation, when it is known. In this context, this paper proposes a novel machine learning model, the randomized radial basis function network, which recognizes and profiles the educational level of an individual who stands behind the keyboard. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by using the empirical data obtained by recording volunteers&#39; keystrokes during their daily usage of a computer. Its performance is also compared with other well-referenced machine learning models using our keystroke dynamic datasets. Although the proposed model achieves high accuracy in educational level prediction of an unknown user, it suffers from high computational cost. For this reason, we examine ways to reduce the time that is needed to build our model, including the use of a novel data condensation method, and discuss the tradeoff between an accurate and a fast prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model in the literature that predicts the educational level of an individual based on the keystroke dynamics information only.},

  abstract     = {Exploiting semantic interactions between the source and target linguistic items at different levels of granularity is crucial for generating compact vector representations for bilingual phrases. To achieve this, we propose alignment-supervised bidimensional attention-based recursive autoencoders (ABattRAE) in this paper. ABattRAE first individually employs two recursive autoencoders to recover hierarchical tree structures of bilingual phrase, and treats the subphrase covered by each node on the tree as a linguistic item. Unlike previous methods, ABattRAE introduces a bidimensional attention network to measure the semantic matching degree between linguistic items of different languages, which enables our model to integrate information from all nodes by dynamically assigning varying weights to their corresponding embeddings. To ensure the accuracy of the generated attention weights in the attention network, ABattRAE incorporates word alignments as supervision signals to guide the learning procedure. Using the general stochastic gradient descent algorithm, we train our model in an end-to-end fashion, where the semantic similarity of translation equivalents is maximized while the semantic similarity of nontranslation pairs is minimized. Finally, we incorporate a semantic feature based on the learned bilingual phrase representations into a machine translation system for better translation selection. Experimental results on NIST Chinese-English and WMT English-German test sets show that our model achieves substantial improvements of up to 2.86 and 1.09 BLEU points over the baseline, respectively. Extensive in-depth analyses demonstrate the superiority of our model in learning bilingual phrase embeddings.},

  abstract     = {Cross-modal hashing maps heterogeneous multimedia data into a common Hamming space to realize fast and flexible cross-modal retrieval. Supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieved considerable progress by incorporating semantic side information. However, they heavily rely on large-scale labeled cross-modal training data which are hard to obtain, since multiple modalities are involved. They also ignore the rich information contained in the large amount of unlabeled data across different modalities, which can help to model the correlations between different modalities. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised cross-modal hashing approach by generative adversarial network (SCH-GAN). The main contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) we propose a novel generative adversarial network for cross-modal hashing, in which the generative model tries to select margin examples of one modality from unlabeled data when given a query of another modality (e.g., giving a text query to retrieve images and vice versa). The discriminative model tries to distinguish the selected examples and true positive examples of the query. These two models play a minimax game so that the generative model can promote the hashing performance of the discriminative model and 2) we propose a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to drive the training of proposed SCH-GAN. The generative model takes the correlation score predicted by discriminative model as a reward, and tries to select the examples close to the margin to promote a discriminative model. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach, compared with nine state-of-the-art methods on three widely used datasets.},

  abstract     = {Grammatical evolution (GE) is one of the most widespread techniques in evolutionary computation. Genotypes in GE are bit strings while phenotypes are strings, of a language defined by a user-provided context-free grammar. In this paper, we propose a novel procedure for mapping genotypes to phenotypes that we call weighted hierarchical GE (WHGE). WHGE imposes a form of hierarchy on the genotype and encodes grammar symbols with a varying number of bits based on the relative expressive power of those symbols. WHGE does not impose any constraint on the overall GE framework, in particular, WHGE may handle recursive grammars, uses the classical genetic operators, and does not need to define any bound in advance on the size of phenotypes. We assessed experimentally our proposal in depth on a set of challenging and carefully selected benchmarks, comparing the results of the standard GE framework as well as two of the most significant enhancements proposed in the literature: 1) position-independent GE and 2) structured GE. Our results show that WHGE delivers very good results in terms of fitness as well as in terms of the properties of the genotype-phenotype mapping procedure.},

However, these works mainly focused on either interspatial or interkernel redundancy. In this paper, we further accelerate existing CNNs by removing both types of redundancies. First, we convert interspatial redundancy into interkernel redundancy by decomposing one convolutional layer to one block that we design. Then, we adopt rank-selection and pruning methods to remove the interkernel redundancy. The rank-selection method, which considerably reduces manpower, contributes to determining the number of kernels to be pruned in the pruning method. We apply a layer-wise training algorithm rather than the traditional end-to-end training to overcome the difficulty of convergence. Finally, we fine-tune the entire network to achieve better performance. Our method is applied on three widely used datasets of an image classification task. We achieve better results in terms of accuracy and compression rate compared with previous state-of-the-art methods.},

We put forward certain switching functions to account for the discrete-time yet state-dependent characteristics of the memristive connection weights. By resorting to the robust analysis theory and the Lyapunov-functional analysis theory, we derive some sufficient conditions to guarantee the desired estimation performance. The derived sufficient conditions rely not only on the size of discrete time-delays and the probability distribution law of the distributed time-delays but also on the statistics information of the coefficients of the adopted Rice fading model. Based on the established existence conditions, the gain matrices of the desired estimator are obtained by means of the feasibility of a set of matrix inequalities that can be checked efficiently via available software packages.

In this paper, we propose a multiple relevant feature ensemble selection (MRFES) algorithm based on multilayer coevolutionary consensus MapReduce (MCCM). We construct an effective MCCM model to handle feature ensemble selection of large-scale datasets with multiple relevant feature sources, and explore the unified consistency aggregation between the local solutions and global dominance solutions achieved by the co-evolutionary memeplexes, which participate in the cooperative feature ensemble selection process. This model attempts to reach a mutual decision agreement among co-evolutionary memeplexes, which calls for the need for mechanisms to detect some noncooperative co-evolutionary behaviors and achieve better Nash equilibrium resolutions. Extensive experimental comparative studies substantiate the effectiveness of MRFES to solve large-scale dataset problems with the complex noise and multiple relevant feature sources on some well-known benchmark datasets. The algorithm can greatly facilitate the selection of relevant feature subsets coming from the original feature space with better accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. Moreover, we apply MRFES to human cerebral cortex-based classification prediction. Such successful applications are expected to significantly scale up classification prediction for large-scale and complex brain data in terms of efficiency and feasibility.},

  abstract     = {A novel neuro-fuzzy model named fuzzy broad learning system (BLS) is proposed by merging the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy system into BLS. The fuzzy BLS replaces the feature nodes of BLS with a group of TS fuzzy subsystems, and the input data are processed by each of them. Instead of aggregating the outputs of fuzzy rules produced by every fuzzy subsystem into one value immediately, all of them are sent to the enhancement layer for further nonlinear transformation to preserve the characteristic of inputs. The defuzzification outputs of all fuzzy subsystem and the outputs of enhancement layer are combined together to obtain the model output. The k-means method is employed to determine the centers of Gaussian membership functions in antecedent part and the number of fuzzy rules. The parameters that need to be calculated in a fuzzy BLS are the weights connecting the outputs of enhancement layer to model output and the randomly initialized coefficients of polynomials in consequent part in fuzzy subsystems, which can be calculated analytically. Therefore, fuzzy BLS retains the fast computational nature of BLS. The proposed fuzzy BLS is evaluated by some popular benchmarks for regression and classification, and compared with some state-of-the-art nonfuzzy and neuro-fuzzy approaches. The results indicate that fuzzy BLS outperforms other models involved. Moreover, fuzzy BLS shows advantages over neurofuzzy models regarding to the number of fuzzy rules and training time, which can ease the problem of rule explosion to some extent.},

However, the classic theory cannot deal with networks with general coupling coefficients involving negative ones, which have been discussed only in very few papers due to the technicalities involved. Motivated by these works, here we developed some new results for the products of matrices which generalize that of the classical stochastic matrices by admitting negative entries. Particularly, we obtained a generalized version of the classic Hajnal inequality on this generalized matrix class. Based on these results, we proved some convergence results for a class of discrete-time consensus algorithms with time-varying delays and general coupling coefficients. At last, these results were applied to the analysis of a class of continuous-time consensus algorithms with discrete-time controller updates in the existence of communication/actuation delays.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a robust online multilabel learning method dealing with dynamically changing multilabel data streams is proposed. The proposed method has three advantages: 1) higher accuracy due to a newly defined objective function based on labels ranking; 2) fast training and update based on a newly derived closed-form (rather than gradient descent based) solution for the new objective function; and 3) high robustness to a newly identified concept drift in multilabel data streams, namely, changes in data distribution with labels (CDDL). The high robustness benefits from two novel works: 1) a new sequential update rule that preserves the labels ranking information learned from all old (but discarded) samples while updating the model only based on new incoming samples and 2) a fixed threshold for label bipartition that is insensitive to any kind of changes in data distribution including CDDL. The proposed method has been evaluated over 13 benchmark datasets from various domains. As shown in the experimental results, the proposed work is highly robust to CDDL in both the sequential model update and multilabel thresholding. Furthermore, the proposed method improves the performance in different evaluation measures, including Hamming loss, F1-measure, Precision, and Recall while taking short training time on most evaluated datasets.},

By exploiting the multiple images captured by the on-board camera, the current and desired poses (i.e., scaled translation and orientation) of the mobile robot are reconstructed to define system errors. Then, an adaptive time-varying controller is proposed to achieve the trajectory tracking task in the presence of nonholonomic constraint and unknown depth parameters. Most of previous works require the measurement of the desired velocity information to facilitate the controller design, leading to tedious offline computation. In this paper, to eliminate this requirement, the desired velocities are estimated in real-time based on a reduced order observer. Moreover, an augmented update law is designed to compensate for the unknown depth parameters and identify the inverse depth constant. The Lyapunov-based method is employed to prove that the proposed controller achieves asymptotic tracking, and the inverse depth estimate converges to its actual value provided that a persistent excitation condition is satisfied. Subsequently, a robust data-driven algorithm is introduced to ensure the convergence of the inverse depth estimate under a relaxed finite excitation condition. Simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In the framework of the continuous-time gradient method and algebraic graph theory, each agent can deal with one local objective function with local constraints. At the impulsive instants, each agent can communicate with its neighboring agents over the network. Under certain conditions, the impulsive average quasi-consensus is achieved. It is shown that the state of average quasi-consensus is the optimal solution of the aforementioned unconstrained optimization problem, and the state of each agent can also reach the neighborhood of the optimal solution. Finally, two numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed impulsive average quasi-consensus algorithm.

A random information pattern is considered, where the information is transmitted among the subsystems with random communication delays. For the random information pattern, the optimal LQG problems for both global estimation case and local estimation case are studied. It is difficult to derive the optimal controller under random framework, because the gains of the controller must be designed to satisfy the random sparse structure constraints. In this paper, we design the optimal controller by Hadamard product method. For global estimation case, the gains of the controller are obtained by solving linear matrix equation. For local estimation case, an iterative algorithm is exploited to compute the gains. In addition, the value of the cost function achieved by the designed controller is found and shown to monotonically increase with the increase of the delay probability for both global and local estimation cases.

  abstract     = {Face hallucination is a technique that reconstructs high-resolution (HR) faces from low-resolution (LR) faces, by using the prior knowledge learned from HR/LR face pairs. Most state-of-the-arts leverage position-patch prior knowledge of the human face to estimate the optimal representation coefficients for each image patch. However, they focus only the position information and usually ignore the context information of the image patch. In addition, when they are confronted with misalignment or the small sample size (SSS) problem, the hallucination performance is very poor. To this end, this paper incorporates the contextual information of the image patch and proposes a powerful and efficient context-patch-based face hallucination approach, namely, thresholding locality-constrained representation and reproducing learning (TLcR-RL). Under the context-patch-based framework, we advance a thresholding-based representation method to enhance the reconstruction accuracy and reduce the computational complexity. To further improve the performance of the proposed algorithm, we propose a promotion strategy called reproducing learning. By adding the estimated HR face to the training set, which can simulate the case that the HR version of the input LR face is present in the training set, it thus iteratively enhances the final hallucination result. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed TLcR-RL method achieves a substantial increase in the hallucinated results, both subjectively and objectively. In addition, the proposed framework is more robust to face misalignment and the SSS problem, and its hallucinated HR face is still very good when the LR test face is from the real world.

In this paper, we introduce a coordinate-free rendezvous control strategy to enable multiple robots to gather at different locations (dynamic leader robots) by tracking their hierarchy in a connected interaction graph. A key novelty in this strategy is the gathering of robots in different groups rather than at a single consensus point, motivated by autonomous multipoint recharging and flocking control problems. We show that the proposed rendezvous strategy guarantees convergence and maintains connectivity while accounting for practical considerations such as robots with limited speeds and an obstacle-rich environment. The algorithm is distributed and handles minor faults such as a broken immobile robot and a sudden link failure. In addition, we propose an approach that determines the locations of rendezvous points based on the connected interaction topology and indirectly optimizes the total energy consumption for rendezvous in all robots. Through extensive experiments with the Robotarium multirobot testbed, we verified and demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach and its properties.},

This method can make each term play a distinct and important role when conducting detection. This method is utilized and extended by introducing the sliding window technique to extract local features from e-mails. The global classifier and local classifiers are constructed on a global feature vector set and local feature vector sets, respectively, and together make the ensemble decision by adopting the voting technique. The principles of the TSP-based approach and mechanism of the ensemble decision method are presented in detail. Five different and standard benchmark corpora are applied to experiments for performance evaluation of this proposed method. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed method brings significant performance improvement and better robustness on the basis of the TSP-based approach. In addition, the proposed method outperforms the current prevalent and state-of-the-art approaches, especially when a comprehensive consideration of performance, efficiency, and robustness is taken.

For all agents, a positive L p signal function is embedded in the event detector functions, which aims to avoid the possible comparison of an event error term to a zero threshold that may happen in a zero-crossing scenario. We further propose a Zeno-free self-triggered algorithm to achieve multiagent consensus, which enables discrete-time measurements and thus avoids continuous measurements between the neighboring agents.

Specifically, we point out that the novel correlation filter model can be regarded as the ridge regression model which takes into account the different importance of the samples and has the consistent objective with tracking. Second, we focus on the scale variation problem in tracking. By making use of the spatial structure of the correlation filter, the multiscale filter banks can be generated via interpolation to handle the scale estimation problem easily. Third, we present a novel distance importance-based confidence calculation model to determine the final tracking result, which not only makes use of the fine discriminability of the correlation filter but also takes the distance importance of the candidate samples into account to alleviate the impact of similar distractors. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to several state-of-the-art trackers and many other correlation filter-based methods in the benchmark datasets.},

Then distributed preselectors and observers are presented to solve the secure state estimation problems. Furthermore, with the obtained state estimation, fractional dynamic surface-based distributed secure controllers are also proposed for the secure control problem. Theoretical analysis shows that, with the proposed distributed secure observers and controllers, not only the state of the CPS under attacks can be obtained in a given finite time but also the dynamic surface can be achieved and maintained in a finite time.

  abstract     = {Spectral clustering is an important clustering method widely used for pattern recognition and image segmentation. Classical spectral clustering algorithms consist of two separate stages: 1) solving a relaxed continuous optimization problem to obtain a real matrix followed by 2) applying ${K}$ -means or spectral rotation to round the real matrix (i.e., continuous clustering result) into a binary matrix called the cluster indicator matrix. Such a separate scheme is not guaranteed to achieve jointly optimal result because of the loss of useful information. To obtain a better clustering result, in this paper, we propose a joint model to simultaneously compute the optimal real matrix and binary matrix. The existing joint model adopts an orthonormal real matrix to approximate the orthogonal but nonorthonormal cluster indicator matrix. It is noted that only in a very special case (i.e., all clusters have the same number of samples), the cluster indicator matrix is an orthonormal matrix multiplied by a real number. The error of approximating a nonorthonormal matrix is inevitably large. To overcome the drawback, we propose replacing the nonorthonormal cluster indicator matrix with a scaled cluster indicator matrix which is an orthonormal matrix. Our method is capable of obtaining better performance because it is easy to minimize the difference between two orthonormal matrices. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method (called JSESR).},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel algorithm called bi-objective elite differential evolution (BOEDE) is proposed to optimize multivalued logic (MVL) networks. It is a multiobjective algorithm completely different from all previous single-objective optimization ones. The two objective functions, error and optimality, are put into evaluating the fitness of individuals in evolution simultaneously. BOEDE innovatively uses an archive population with different ranks to store elite individuals and offsprings. Moreover, a characteristic updating method based on this archive structure is designed to produce the parent population. Because of the particularity of MVL network problems, the performance of BOEDE to solve them is further improved by strictly distinguishing elite solutions and Pareto optimal solutions, and by modifying the method of dealing with illegal variables. The simulations show that BOEDE can collect a great number of solutions to provide decision support for a variety of applications. The comparison results also indicate that BOEDE is significantly better than the existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Leader-follower controllability on signed multiagent networks is investigated in this paper. Specifically, we consider a dynamic signed multiagent network, where the agents interact via neighbor-based Laplacian feedback and the network allows positive and negative edges to capture cooperative and competitive interactions among agents. The agents are classified as either leaders or followers, thus forming a leader-follower signed network. To enable full control of the leader-follower signed network, controllability ensured leader group selection approaches are investigated in this paper, that is, identifying a small subset of nodes in the signed network, such that the selected nodes are able to drive the network to a desired behavior, even in the presence of antagonistic interactions. In particular, graphical characterizations of the controllability of signed networks are first developed based on the investigation of the interaction between network topology and agent dynamics. Since signed path and cycle graphs are basic building blocks for a variety of networks, the developed topological characterizations are then exploited to develop leader selection methods for signed path and cycle graphs to ensure leader-follower controllability. Along with illustrative examples, heuristic algorithms are also developed showing how leader selection methods developed for path and cycle graphs can be potentially extended to more general signed networks. In contrast to existing results that mainly focus on unsigned networks, this paper characterizes controllability and develops leader selection methods for signed networks. In addition, the developed results are generic, in the sense that they are not only applicable to signed networks but also to unsigned networks, since unsigned networks are a particular case of signed networks that only contain positive edges.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a systematic and interpretable design approach to generate type-2 (T2) fuzzy logic-based linguistic pursuing strategies (PSs) and their deployment to a real-world pursuit-evasion game (PEG). First, we have developed a novel T2 fuzzy logic-based strategy planner (T2-FSP). Then, through detailed theoretical investigations on the input- output mapping of the T2-FSP, it has been shown that it is possible to design a linguistic PS which defines both pursuer&#39;s approaching behavior (aggressive, smooth) and side (left or right) to the evader by simply tuning the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) sizes of the T2 fuzzy sets. Hence, an interpretable relationship has been revealed between the FOU sizes and the PSs through comparative theoretical explorations and derivations. Additionally, as there is a need to employ different PSs in a dynamic PEG environment, a type-1 fuzzy decision making (T1-FDM) mechanism has been designed to tune the FOU sizes of the T2-FSP and, thus, adjust the PS to be employed in real time. A real-world game environment is constructed in order to validate the developed T2 fuzzy logic-based PSs and T1-FDM mechanism in real time. Comparative experimental results have been presented to show that the T2 fuzzy logic-based PSs have satisfactory performance against a human user.},

In this paper, we study first-order consensus dynamics in binary scale-free networks, where vertices are subject to white noise. We focus on the coherence of networks characterized in terms of the H 2 -norm, which quantifies how closely the agents track the consensus value. We first provide a lower bound of coherence of a network in terms of its average degree, which is independent of the network order. We then study the coherence of some sparse, scale-free real-world networks, which approaches a constant. We also study numerically the coherence of Barabási-Albert networks and high-dimensional random Apollonian networks, which also converges to a constant when the networks grow. Finally, based on the connection of coherence and the Kirchhoff index, we study analytically the coherence of two deterministically growing sparse networks and obtain the exact expressions, which tend to small constants. Our results indicate that the effect of noise on the consensus dynamics in power-law networks is negligible. We argue that scale-free topology, together with loopy structure, is responsible for the strong robustness with respect to noisy consensus dynamics in power-law networks.},

On the other hand, when a new data that belongs to a new class is given, the existing classification methods should be retrained for all data including the new data. To deal with these issues, we propose an adaptive resonance theory-supervised predictive mapping for hierarchical classification (ARTMAP-HC) network that allows incremental class learning for raw data without normalization in advance. Our proposed ARTMAP-HC is composed of hierarchically stacked modules, and each module incorporates two fuzzy ARTMAP networks. Regardless of the level of the class hierarchy and the number of classes for each level, ARTMAPHC is able to incrementally learn sequentially added input data belonging to new classes. By using a novel online normalization process, ARTMAP-HC can classify the new data without prior knowledge of the maximum value of the dataset. By adopting the prior labels appending process, the class dependency between class hierarchy levels is reflected in ARTMAP-HC. The effectiveness of the proposed ARTMAP-HC is validated through experiments on hierarchical classification datasets. To demonstrate the applicability, ARTMAP-HC is applied to a multimedia recommendation system for digital storytelling.},

It could be used in longitudinal studies to analyze their perceptive process, explore human-machine interactions, and develop innovative computer-aided imaging systems. However, using a remote eye tracker in an unconstrained environment and over time periods of weeks requires a certain guarantee of performance to ensure that collected gaze data are fit for purpose. We report the results of evaluating eye tracking calibration for longitudinal studies. First, we tested the performance of an eye tracker on a cohort of 13 users over a period of one month. For each participant, the eye tracker was calibrated during the first session. The participants were asked to sit in front of a monitor equipped with the eye tracker, but their position was not constrained. Second, we tested the performance of the eye tracker on sonographers positioned in front of a cart-based ultrasound scanner. Experimental results show a decrease of accuracy between calibration and later testing of 0.30° and a further degradation over time at a rate of 0.13°. month -1 . The overall median accuracy was 1.00° (50.9 pixels) and the overall median precision was 0.16° (8.3 pixels). The results from the ultrasonography setting show a decrease of accuracy of 0.16° between calibration and later testing. This slow degradation of gaze tracking accuracy could impact the data quality in long-term studies. Therefore, the results we present here can help in planning such long-term gaze tracking studies.},

  abstract     = {As a typical model-based evolutionary algorithm, estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) possesses unique characteristics and has been widely applied in global optimization.

This paper first systematically analyzes the reasons for the deficiency of traditional GEDA, then tries to enhance its performance by exploiting the evolution direction, and finally develops a new GEDA variant named EDA 2 . Instead of only utilizing some good solutions produced in the current generation to estimate the Gaussian model, EDA 2 preserves a certain number of high-quality solutions generated in the previous generations into an archive and employs these historical solutions to assist estimating the covariance matrix of Gaussian model. By this means, the evolution direction information hidden in the archive is naturally integrated into the estimated model, which in turn can guide EDA 2 toward more promising solution regions. Moreover, the new estimation method significantly reduces the population size of EDA 2 since it needs fewer individuals in the current population for model estimation. As a result, a fast convergence can be achieved. To verify the efficiency of EDA 2 , we tested it on a variety of benchmark functions and compared it with several state-of-the-art EAs. The experimental results demonstrate that EDA 2 is efficient and competitive.},

During the learning phase, the robot observes and learns how a demonstrator performs a specific impedance-based task successfully, and in the reproduction phase, the robot can provide the subjects with just enough assistance by extracting human skills from demonstrations to prevent the motion of the robot end-effector deviating far from desired ones, due to variation in the interaction force caused by environmental disturbances.

More specific, a three-tower PToP mapping is first developed to seek an accurate representation from HSI to LiDAR data, aiming at merging multiscale features between two different sources. Then, by integrating hidden layers of the designed PToP CNN, extracted features are expected to possess deeply fused characteristics. Accordingly, features from different hidden layers are concatenated into a stacked vector and fed into three fully connected layers. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classification framework, experiments are executed on two benchmark remote sensing data sets.

  abstract     = {An image is compressed or stretched during the multidevice displaying, which will have a very big impact on perception quality. In order to solve this problem, a variety of image retargeting methods have been proposed for the retargeting process. However, how to evaluate the results of different image retargeting is a very critical issue. In various application systems, the subjective evaluation method cannot be applied on a large scale. So we put this problem in the accurate objective-quality evaluation. Currently, most of the image retargeting quality assessment algorithms use simple regression methods as the last step to obtain the evaluation result, which are not corresponding with the perception simulation in the human vision system (HVS). In this paper, a deep quality evaluator for image retargeting based on the segmented stacked AutoEnCoder (SAE) is proposed. Through the help of regularization, the designed deep learning framework can solve the overfitting problem. The main contributions in this framework are to simulate the perception of retargeted images in HVS. Especially, it trains two separated SAE models based on geometrical shape and content matching. Then, the weighting schemes can be used to combine the obtained scores from two models. Experimental results in three well-known databases show that our method can achieve better performance than traditional methods in evaluating different image retargeting results.},

  abstract     = {Multitask feature selection (MTFS) methods have become more important for many real world applications, especially in a high-dimensional setting. The most widely used assumption is that all tasks share the same features, and the l2,1 regularization method is usually applied. However, this assumption may not hold when the correlations among tasks are not obvious. Learning with unrelated tasks together may result in negative transfer and degrade the performance. In this paper, we present a flexible MTFS by graph-clustered feature sharing approach. To avoid the above limitation, we adopt a graph to represent the relevance among tasks instead of adopting a hard task set partition. Furthermore, we propose a graph-guided regularization approach such that the sparsity of the solution can be achieved on both the task level and the feature level, and a variant of the smooth proximal gradient method is developed to solve the corresponding optimization problem. An evaluation of the proposed method on multitask regression and multitask binary classification problem has been performed. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to capture task structure.},

  abstract     = {These days, many multiview learning methods have been proposed by integrating the complementary information of multiple views and can significantly improve the performance of machine learning tasks comparing with single-view learning methods. However, most of these methods fail to learn better models when the multiview data are unpaired (or partially paired) or incomplete (or partially complete). Although some previous attempts have been made to address these problems, these methods often lead to poor results when dealing with incomplete multiview data that contain a relatively large number of missing instances. In fact, this incomplete problem is more challenging than the unpaired problem since less shared information can be caught by the model in the former case. In this paper, we propose a shared Gaussian process (GP) latent variable model for incomplete multiview clustering to gain the merits of two worlds (i.e., GP and multiview learning). Specifically, it learns a set of intentionally aligned representative auxiliary points in individual views jointly to not only compensate for missing instances but also implement the group-level constraint. Thus, the shared information among these views can be explicitly built into the model. All of the hyper-parameters and auxiliary points are simultaneously learned by variational inference. Compared with the existing methods, our method naturally inherits the advantages of GP. Furthermore, it is also straightforwardly extended to cases with more than two views without adding any complexity in formulation. In the experiments, we compare it with the state-of-the-art methods for incomplete multiview data clustering to demonstrate its superiorities.},

  abstract     = {The resilient control refers to the control methodology which provides an interdisciplinary solution to secure the control system. In this paper, the resilient control problem is investigated for a class of wireless networked control systems (WNCS) under a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. In the presence of the DoS attacker, the control command sent by the transmitter may be interfered, which can cause the degradation of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and further lead to packet dropout phenomenon. Such a packet dropout phenomenon is described by a two-state Markov-chain. A cross-layer view is adopted toward the security issue of the considered WNCS. The Nash power strategies and optimal control strategy in the delta-domain are obtained in the cyber- and physical-layer, respectively. Based on the obtained strategies, the coupled-design problem is solved which aims to drive the underlying control performance to the desired security region by dynamically manipulating the cyber-layer pricing parameters. Finally, a numerical simulation is conducted to verify the validity of the proposed methodology.},

In this paper, we discuss the impulsive consensus problem of nonlinear multiagent systems via impulsive protocol with limited bandwidth communication based on encoding-decoding. The scheme based on encoding-decoding with impulsive protocol is introduced to multiagent systems in general directed networks topology of which the graph is strongly connected. The impulsive protocols and limited bandwidth communication enhance the performance on energy saving and the involvement of nonlinear dynamics could suit more real-world cases. The design of encoders and decoders is presented, which is the key to achieve the goal that the information exchanged is subject to limited bandwidth communication. The conditions to guarantee the impulsive consensus and the conditions to avoid quantizer saturation are obtained. Moreover, the convergence rate of such multiagent systems are also characterized by the analysis of the exponential consensus. The numerical simulations are presented to support the theoretical results.},

On the basis of the local state information of neighboring agents, an adaptive fault-tolerant control protocol, which consists of the adaptive estimation of faults, is constructed to compensate for the loss of actuator effectiveness in the leader–follower consensus of MASs. Moreover, the modification term in the adaptive estimation can avoid high-frequency oscillations. It is shown that the tracking errors converge to a neighborhood around the origin in the presence of actuator faults, and the performance of the tracking problem is improved. Furthermore, the protocol is distributed in the sense that the coupling gains are independent. Finally, two examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control protocol.},

Existing control algorithms either ignore motion constraints or impose additional feasibility conditions. In this paper, by integrating a nonlinear state-dependent transformation into each step of backstepping design, we develop a control scheme that not only directly accommodates asymmetric yet time-varying motion (position and velocity) constraints but also removes the feasibility conditions on virtual controllers, simplifying design process, and making implementation less demanding. Neural network (NN) unit accounting for system uncertainties is included in the loop during the entire system operational envelope in which the precondition on the NN training inputs is always ensured. The effectiveness and benefits of the proposed control method for robotic manipulator are validated via computer simulation.},

The underlying target plants are subject to fading measurements where the fading rates are described by continuous-time random variables with known statistical properties dependent on the system modes. The adjacency matrices characterizing the topology of the sensor networks are also allowed to be mode-dependent. Based on the multiple Lyapunov functional approach and average dwell-time concept, the distributed H ∞ filter is designed by means of the convex optimization scheme. A dedicated technique is developed via a simple algebraic equality in order to avoid solving a transcendental equation used in the existing results. With the designed filter, the error dynamics of the state estimation is guaranteed to have the mean-square exponential stability with a prescribed H ∞ disturbance attenuation level. Finally, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},
