  abstract     = {This article deals with output feedback selection in linear time-invariant structured systems. We assume that the inputs and the outputs are dedicated, i.e., each input directly actuates a single state and each output directly senses a single state. Given a structured system with dedicated inputs and outputs and a cost matrix that denotes the cost of each feedback connection, our aim is to select a minimum cost set of feedback connections such that the closed-loop system satisfies arbitrary pole-placement. This problem is referred to as the optimal feedback selection problem for dedicated i/o. The optimal feedback selection problem for dedicated i/o is NP-hard and in approximable to a constant factor of log n, where n denotes the system dimension. To this end, we propose an algorithm to find an approximate solution to the problem. The proposed algorithm consists of a potential function incorporated with a greedy scheme and attains a solution with a guaranteed approximation ratio. We consider two special network topologies of practical importance, referred to as back-edge feedback structure and hierarchical networks. For the first case, which is NP-hard and in approximable to a multiplicative factor of log n, we provide a log-n-approximate solution. For hierarchical networks, we give a dynamic programming based algorithm to obtain an optimal solution in polynomial time.},

Also, the leader&#39;s cost function depends on its own strategy and the aggregate strategy of all the followers. The leader infinitely often wakes up, receives the aggregate strategy of the followers, updates its decision value, and broadcasts it to all the followers. Then, the followers apply the updated strategy of the leader into their cost functions. The establishment of information exchange between each neighboring pair of followers, and also, decision updating by a follower at each iteration, that is to say the activeness of the follower in that iteration, are both considered to be drawn from two arbitrary distributions. Moreover, a distributed algorithm based on subgradient method is proposed for updating the strategies of leader and followers. The convergence of the proposed algorithm to the unique Stackelberg equilibrium point of the game is proven in both almost sure and mean square senses.},

We provide a Monte Carlo importance sampling method to reduce the computational complexity of the distributed decision fusion. For the K-out-of-L rule, we derive a group of analytic sensor rules based on the necessary and sufficient condition of the optimal sensor rules. In term of efficiency, it is significantly better than the traditional iterative search algorithms, such as the Riemann sum approximation iteration algorithm. The analytic solution is also a general result since it does not rely on the specific K value of the K-out-of-L rule, the specific conditional probability density function and the dimension of sensor observations. Thus, it can be applied to multisensor decision fusion problems with high dimensional dependent sensor observations. For the general fusion rules rather than the K-out-of-L rule, the Monte Carlo Gauss-Seidel algorithm is also provided. The numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the analytic solution and the Monte Carlo Gauss-Seidel algorithm.},

The STVBN consists of a system model describing the evolution of the Boolean states and a model relating the noisy measurements to the Boolean states. Both the process noise and the measurement noise are characterized by sequences of mutually independent Bernoulli distributed stochastic variables taking values of 1 or 0, which imply that the state/measurement variables may be flipped with certain probabilities. First, an algebraic representation of the STVBNs is derived based on the semitensor product. Then, based on Bayes&#39; theorem, a recursive matrix-based algorithm is obtained to calculate the one-step prediction and estimation of the forward-backward state probability distribution vectors. Owing to the Boolean nature of the state variables, the Boolean Bayesian filter is designed that can be utilized to provide the minimum MSE state estimate for the STVBNs. The fixed-interval smoothing filter is also obtained by resorting to the forward-backward technique. Finally, a simulation experiment is carried out for the context estimation problem of the $p53$-$MDM2$ negative-feedback gene regulatory network.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with stabilization of Lotka-Volterra (LV) systems in the presence of interval uncertainty and a physical limitation on the control input, which restricts this input to be strictly positive. Considering the positiveness property of LV systems, a quasi-monomial structure for the state feedback based control input is proposed. Considering this structure, stability of the closed-loop system with no uncertainty is analyzed. This analysis leads to an algebraic inequality, whose satisfaction guarantees stability of the closed-loop system. To extend this result to uncertain LV systems with interval parameter uncertainty, a new approach, by which stability of the positive equilibrium point of the closed-loop uncertain LV systems can be checked in terms of feasibility of a component-wise linear matrix inequality (LMI), is introduced. To achieve a stabilizing controller, the unknown controller parameters are obtained by using the feasible solutions of the mentioned LMI. To overcome some restrictions on the proposed method, a new Lyapunov function is employed, which leads to a bilinear matrix inequalities (BMI) to ensure stabilization. This BMI approach reduces the conservativeness of the above-mentioned LMI-based approach. Also, it is shown that the BMI-based approach can be extended for global stabilization of time-varying LV systems. The efficiency of the proposed schemes is shown through some examples inspired from chemical/biological processes.},

Although the solution to this problem was obtained previously via the stochastic maximum principle or by solving the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, our approach is simple and direct. Specifically, we develop a direct approach, also known as the completion of squares method, to characterize the explicit optimal solution and the optimal cost. The corresponding optimal solution is linear characterized in terms of the stochastic Riccati differential equation (SRDE) and the linear backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). In our approach, the completion of squares method, together with the SRDE and the BSDE, allows us to construct an equivalent cost functional that is quadratic in the control u, provided that an additional positive definiteness condition in terms of the SRDE holds. Then, the optimal control and the associated cost can be obtained by eliminating the quadratic term of u in the equivalent cost functional. The additional positive definiteness condition is induced due to the indefiniteness of the cost parameters and the dependence of the control on the diffusion term.

  abstract     = {This article discusses the stability and stabilization problems for the discrete-time semi-Markov jump linear systems (S-MJLSs) with bounded sojourn times. By using the method of multiple-Lyapunov functions and the concept of discrete-time semi-Markov kernel, we provide the sufficient conditions for σ-error mean square stability of S-MJLSs. In such conditions, the transition probability matrix of embedded Markov chain is considered, which is more general than the scenarios in previous works that only consider the sojourn time of each subsystem mode. Based on such conditions, the stabilization controller design method is also proposed for the resulting closed-loop systems. Two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that the supertwisting algorithm is robust to matched perturbation but is sensitive to measurement noise. Contrary to this, the classical linear algorithm is less sensitive to measurement noise but less robust to perturbation. To combine both the good accuracy of the supertwisting algorithm with respect to perturbation and the good performance of the linear algorithm with respect to measurement noise, this article proposes a new differentiator/observer with a varying exponent gain α whose variation depends on the magnitude of measurement noise (high-frequency signal). When the magnitude of measurement noise increases (respectively, decreases) α tends to 1 (respectively, tends to 0.5) and the proposed differentiator/observer behaves as a linear algorithm (respectively, as a supertwisting algorithm). Thus, by one parameter α, the differentiator/observer can take care of high-frequency noise and matched perturbations. A complete stability analysis of the proposed differentiator/observer is provided. To highlight the applicability of the proposed methodology, the dedicated differentiator/observer is, respectively, validated on the electropneumatic actuator and electric machine test benches. These experimental results are compared to those of linear and supertwisting algorithms.},

In this article, a framework of the actor-critic deep neural network is utilized to solve this problem. The actor network establishes the continuous pure policy to replace the mixed policy, and the critic network converts the global interacted results into a local performance potential. The local search for a constrained equilibrium average objective is converted into an unconstrained minimax optimization. Based on the equivalent conversion, the optimality function of the local action is given to evaluate the influence of the single decision maker&#39;s action on the global system. The proposed algorithm simultaneously iterates the local constraint multiplier and policy along opposite directions, and a typical congestion control numerical result in the emerging Internet of Things shows the efficiency.},

For the NLSs with unknown input signals, the conventional MHE strategy is incapable of guaranteeing the satisfactory performance as the estimation error is dependent on the external disturbances. In this work, a novel MHE strategy is developed to cope with the underlying NLS with unknown inputs by dedicatedly introducing certain temporary estimates of unknown inputs, where the desired estimator parameters are designed to decouple the estimation error dynamics from the unknown inputs. A two-step design strategy (namely, decoupling step and convergence step) is proposed to obtain the estimator parameters. In the decoupling step, the decoupling parameter of the moving horizon estimator is designed based on certain assumptions on system parameters and quantization parameters. In the convergence step, by employing a special observability decomposition scheme, the convergence parameters of the moving horizon estimator are achieved such that the estimation error dynamics is ultimately bounded. Moreover, the developed MHE strategy is extended to the scenario with direct feedthrough of unknown inputs. Two simulation examples are given to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed MHE strategies.},

The problem is nonconvex and we write it in terms of the Gramians of the error system. We propose two solutions. The first solution assumes that the error system admits a block diagonal observability Gramian, allowing for a simple convex reformulation as semidefinite programming, but at the cost of some performance loss. We also derive the sufficient conditions to guarantee the block diagonalization of the Gramian. The second solution employs a gradient projection method for a smooth reformulation, yielding the (locally) optimal interpolation points and free parameters.

  abstract     = {To study optimal control and disturbance attenuation problems, two prominent-and somewhat alternative-strategies have emerged in the last century: dynamic programming (DP) and Pontryagin&#39;s minimum principle (PMP). The former characterizes the solution by shaping the dynamics in a closed loop (a priori unknown) via the selection of a feedback input, at the price, however, of the solution to (typically daunting) partial differential equations. The latter, instead, provides (extended) dynamics that must be satisfied by the optimal process, for which boundary conditions (a priori unknown) should be determined. The results discussed in this article combine the two approaches by matching the corresponding trajectories, i.e., combining the underlying sources of information: knowledge of the complete initial condition from DP and of the optimal dynamics from PMP. The proposed approach provides insights for linear as well as nonlinear systems. In the case of linear systems, the derived conditions lead to matrix algebraic equations, similar to the classic algebraic Riccati equations (AREs), although with coefficients defined as polynomial functions of the input gain matrix, with the property that the coefficient of the quadratic term of such equation is sign definite, even if the corresponding coefficient of the original ARE is sign indefinite, as it is typically the case in the H ∞ control problem. This feature is particularly appealing from the computational point of view, since it permits the use of standard minimization techniques for convex functions, such as the gradient algorithm. In the presence of nonlinear dynamics, the strategy leads to algebraic equations that allow us to (locally) construct the optimal feedback by considering the behavior of the closed-loop dynamics at a single point in the state space.},

To solve the problem, a nonsmooth embedded control framework is established, which consists of two parts. In the first part, by using nonsmooth control theory and designing some distributed finite-time estimators to estimate the gradients of the agents&#39; local cost functions, a distributed finite-time optimal signal generator with fractional powers is constructed, of which the output signals converge to the minimizer of the global function in finite time.

Under the proposed control framework, all the agents&#39; outputs converge to the minimizer of the global cost function in finite time and the distributed finite-time optimization goal is achieved.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with a compositional approach for constructing both infinite (reduced-order models) and finite abstractions [a.k.a. finite Markov decision processes (MDPs)] of large-scale interconnected discrete-time stochastic systems. The proposed framework is based on the notion of stochastic simulation functions enabling us to employ an abstract system as a substitution of the original one in the controller design process with guaranteed error bounds. In the first part of this article, we derive sufficient small-gain-type conditions for the compositional quantification of the probabilistic distance between the interconnection of stochastic control subsystems and that of their infinite abstractions. We then construct infinite abstractions together with their corresponding stochastic simulation functions for a particular class of discrete-time nonlinear stochastic control systems. In the second part of this article, we leverage small-gain-type conditions for the compositional construction of finite abstractions. We propose an approach to construct finite MDPs as finite abstractions of concrete models or their reduced-order versions satisfying an incremental input-to-state stability property. We also show that for the particular class of nonlinear stochastic control systems, the aforementioned property can be readily checked by matrix inequalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results by applying our approaches to a fully interconnected network of 20 nonlinear subsystems (totally 100 dimensions). We construct finite MDPs from their reduced-order versions (together 20 dimensions) with guaranteed error bounds on their output trajectories. We also apply the proposed results to a temperature regulation in a circular building and construct compositionally a finite abstraction of a network containing 1000 rooms. We employ the constructed finite abstractions as substitutes to compositionally synthesize policies regulating the temperature in each room for a bounded time horizon.},

  abstract     = {This article studies multiagent (convex and nonconvex) optimization over static digraphs. We propose a general distributed asynchronous algorithmic framework whereby 1) agents can update their local variables as well as communicate with their neighbors at any time, without any form of coordination; and 2) they can perform their local computations using (possibly) delayed, out-of-sync information from the other agents. Delays need not be known to the agent or obey any specific profile, and can also be time-varying (but bounded). The algorithm builds on a tracking mechanism that is robust against asynchrony (in the above sense), whose goal is to estimate locally the average of agents&#39; gradients. When applied to strongly convex functions, we prove that it converges at an R-linear (geometric) rate as long as the step-size is sufficiently small. A sublinear convergence rate is proved, when nonconvex problems and/or diminishing, uncoordinated step-sizes are considered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed algorithm with provable geometric convergence rate in such a general asynchronous setting. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and validate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Advanced persistent threats (APTs) infiltrate cyber systems and compromise specifically targeted data and/or resources through a sequence of stealthy attacks consisting of multiple stages. Dynamic information flow tracking has been proposed to detect APTs. In this article, we develop a dynamic information flow tracking game for resource-efficient detection of APTs via multistage dynamic games. The game evolves on an information flow graph, whose nodes are processes and objects (e.g., file, network endpoints) in the system and the edges capture the interaction between different processes and objects. Each stage of the game has prespecified targets that are characterized by a set of nodes of the graph. The goal of the APT is to evade detection and reach a target node of each stage. The goal of the defender is to maximize the detection probability while minimizing performance overhead on the system. The resource costs of the players are different and the information structure is asymmetric, resulting in a nonzero-sum imperfect information game. We first calculate the best responses of the players and then compute Nash equilibrium for single-stage attacks. We then provide a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a correlated equilibrium for the multistage attack case. Finally, we simulate our model and algorithm on real-world nation state attack data obtained from the Refinable Attack INvestigation (RAIN) system.},

Specifically, we define and solve a probabilistic safety problem for Markov processes. Based on the knowledge of the extended generator, we are able to develop an evolution equation, as a system of integral equations, describing the connection between unsafe and initial states. Subsequently, using the moment method, we approximate the infinite-dimensional optimization problem searching for the largest set of safe states by a finite-dimensional polynomial optimization problem. In particular, we address the above safety problem to a special class of stochastic hybrid processes, namely piecewise-deterministic Markov processes. These are characterized by deterministic dynamics and stochastic jumps, where both the time and the destination of the jumps are stochastic. In addition, the jumps can be both spontaneous (in the style of a Poisson process) and forced (governed by guards). In this case, the extended generator of this process and its corresponding martingale problem turn out to be defined on a rather restricted domain. To circumvent this difficulty, we bring the generalized differential formula of this process into the evolution equation and, subsequently, formulate a polynomial optimization.},

We first assume that there exists an observer design for a given nonlinear system. The structure of the system output is often crucial for estimating the system states. Therefore, we consider the problem that arises when the output is only available under a nonlinear transformation (affected by noise). This formulation is especially useful in engineering applications, where nonlinear sensors are frequent. We propose a new interconnected observer that estimates both the unavailable output and the system states, and we establish small-gain type conditions ensuring the asymptotic convergence of the overall error dynamics. To explicit our design parameters, we study the particular cases of state-affine systems up to output injection and systems with additive triangular nonlinearities. Finally, we provide corresponding numerical examples and comparisons with known observers.},

The objective is to identify one-step-ahead models and their accuracy in terms of worst-case simulation error bounds. To do so, the set membership identification framework is exploited. Theoretical results are derived, allowing one to estimate the noise bound and system decay rate. Then, these quantities and the data are employed to define the feasible parameter set (FPS), which contains all possible models compatible with the available information. Here, the estimated decay rate is used to refine the standard FPS formulation, by adding constraints that enforce the desired converging behavior of the models&#39; impulse response. Moreover, guaranteed simulation error bounds for an infinite future horizon are derived, improving over recent results pertaining to finite simulation horizon only. These bounds are the basis for a result and method to guarantee asymptotic stability of the identified model. Finally, the desired one-step-ahead model is identified by means of numerical optimization, and the related simulation error bounds are evaluated. Both input-output and state-space model structures are addressed. The approach is showcased on a numerical example and on real-world experimental data of the roll rate dynamics of an autonomous glider.},

A BCN is observable (reconstructible) if one can use an input sequence and the corresponding output sequence to determine the initial (current) state. In this article, we study when a node aggregation approach can be used to overcome the computational complexity in verifying these properties. We first define a class of node aggregations with subnetworks being BCNs. For acyclic node aggregations in this class, all corresponding subnetworks being observable (reconstructible) implies that the whole BCN is observable (reconstructible), although the converse is not true. In general, for cyclic node aggregations, the whole BCN being observable (reconstructible) does not imply that all subnetworks are observable (reconstructible), or vice versa. We design an algorithm to search for all acyclic node aggregations in this class, and show that finding acyclic node aggregations with small subnetworks can significantly reduce the computational complexity in verifying observability (reconstructibility). We also define a second class of node aggregations with subnetworks being finite-transition systems (more general than BCNs), which compensates for the drawback of the first class when the BCN has only a small number of output nodes. Finally, we use a BCN T-cell receptor kinetics model from the literature with 37 state nodes and 3 input nodes to illustrate the efficiency of the results derived from the two node aggregation methods. For this model, we derive the unique minimal set of 16 state nodes needed to be directly measured to make the overall BCN observable. We also compute 5 of the 16 state nodes needed to be directly measured to make the model reconstructible.},

As a consequence, the resulting optimization problem involves just one regularization parameter balancing the tradeoff between the number of latent variables and the sparseness of the learned graph. Hence, the cross-validation procedure is performed on a one-dimensional grid significantly reducing the computational burden with respect to existing methods, which require a two-dimensional grid. A convenient matricial reformulation is proposed for which the variational analysis can be carried out. The properties of the dual problem are analyzed and existence of solutions is established.

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel data-driven framework for constructing eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator geared toward prediction and control. The method leverages the richness of the spectrum of the Koopman operator away from attractors to construct a set of eigenfunctions such that the state (or any other observable quantity of interest) is in the span of these eigenfunctions and hence predictable in a linear fashion. The eigenfunction construction is optimization-based with no dictionary selection required. Once a predictor for the uncontrolled part of the system is obtained in this way, the incorporation of control is done through a multistep prediction error minimization, carried out by a simple linear least-squares regression. The predictor so obtained is in the form of a linear controlled dynamical system and can be readily applied within the Koopman model predictive control (MPC) framework of (M. Korda and I. Mezić, 2018) to control nonlinear dynamical systems using linear MPC tools. The method is entirely data-driven and based predominantly on convex optimization. The novel eigenfunction construction method is also analyzed theoretically, proving rigorously that the family of eigenfunctions obtained is rich enough to span the space of all continuous functions. In addition, the method is extended to construct generalized eigenfunctions that also give rise Koopman invariant subspaces and hence can be used for linear prediction. Detailed numerical examples demonstrate the approach, both for prediction and feedback control. ** Code for the numerical examples is available from https://homepages.laas.fr/mkorda/Eigfuns.zip.},

In problems where stability matters, one needs a more specific result, the stability-preserving Morse normal form. This new form applies to stable systems, and it is canonical with respect to stability-preserving state feedback, stability-preserving output injection, and input-, output-, and state-coordinate transformations. The complete invariant is shown to consist of three lists of integers and two lists of polynomials, one having only stable zeros and the other one only unstable zeros.

  abstract     = {In this article, we aim to investigate the synchronization problem of dynamical systems, which can be of generic linear or Lipschitz nonlinear type, communicating over directed switching network topologies. A mild connectivity assumption on the switching topologies is imposed, which allows them to be directed and jointly connected. We propose a novel analysis framework from both algebraic and geometric perspectives to justify the attractiveness of the synchronization manifold. Specifically, it is proven that the complementary space of the synchronization manifold can be spanned by certain subspaces constructed from the network structure. This allows to project the states of the dynamical systems onto these subspaces and transform the synchronization problem under consideration equivalently into a convergence one of the projected states in each subspace. Then, assuming the joint connectivity condition on the communication topologies, we are able to work out a unified convergence analysis for both types of dynamical systems. More specifically, for partial-state coupled generic linear systems, it is proven that synchronization can be reached if an extra condition, which is easy to verify in several cases, on the system dynamics is satisfied. For Lipschitz nonlinear systems with positive-definite inner coupling matrix, synchronization is realized if the coupling strength is strong enough to stabilize the evolution of the projected states in each subspace under certain conditions. The above claims generalize the existing results concerning both types of dynamical systems to so far the most general framework. Some illustrative examples are provided to verify our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {We develop a novel regional stability analysis framework based on the proposed region-parametrized Lyapunov function to study the synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators. A new synchronization definition is introduced and characterized by frequency boundedness and phase cohesiveness, the latter of which requires phase angles of any two connected nodes rather than any two arbitrary nodes to stay cohesive. This definition allows for time-varying natural frequencies and can lead to less conservative synchronization condition. Applying the analysis framework to Kuramoto oscillators, we derive two algebraic synchronization conditions that relate the underlying network topology and system parameters to the synchronization. Finally, we give estimations of the region of attraction explicitly in terms of phase angles as well as the energy function. They require no calculation for critical equilibrium points compared to traditional methods for power systems. The numerical example shows that two synchronization conditions can complement each other for predicting the synchronization.},

The proposed controller utilizes the prescribed performance control methodology and high-gain observers. To avoid the propagation of the peaking phenomenon, the developed controller is appropriately saturated without compromising the closed-loop system performance attributes. Moreover, the selection of the observer gains is significantly relaxed owing to the fact that the adopted prescribed performance control technique seeks only for boundedness properties to establish the desired transient and steady-state performance specifications. Finally, various simulation studies clarify and verify the approach.},

These methods are motivated by effective methods for continuous-time systems based on differential inequalities (DI). Modern DI methods, particularly those using refinement techniques based on redundant model equations, have demonstrated very sharp enclosures at low cost for several challenging test cases. However, they rely on key properties of continuous-time systems that do not hold generally in discrete time. Nevertheless, we show that discrete-time analogues of these methods do provide valid enclosures for systems satisfying certain monotonicity conditions. We show that these conditions are always satisfied for systems obtained by forward Euler discretization of continuous-time models with step sizes below a computable upper limit. New refinement algorithms are presented for exploiting redundant model equations in the discrete-time setting. The resulting discrete-time DI methods are compared to existing algorithms using several case studies.},

A purely input-output treatment of these systems is given without recourse to state-space models, and, thus, the results are applicable to certain classes of distributed systems. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for MSS in terms of the spectral radius of a linear matrix operator whose dimension is that of the number of uncertainties, rather than the dimension of any underlying state-space models. Our condition is applicable to the case of correlated uncertainties, and reproduces earlier results for uncorrelated uncertainties.

Despite a rich history, the problem can only be considered solved for networks that contain at most two energy storage elements, and in a small number of other special cases. In this article, we solve the minimal network realization problem for the class of impedances realized by series-parallel networks containing at most three energy storage elements.

The phase compensation of the dither signals is handled as a trajectory generation problem and the inclusion of a multivariable diffusion feedback controller with a perturbation-based (averaging-based) estimate of the Hessian&#39;s inverse allow to obtain local exponential convergence results to a small neighborhood of the optimal point. The stability analysis is carried out using backstepping transformation and averaging in infinite dimensions, capturing the infinite-dimensional state due the diffusion PDEs. In addition, the generalization of the results for different classes of parabolic (reaction-advection-diffusion) PDEs, wave equations and/or first-order hyperbolic (transport-dominated) PDEs is also discussed. As for ordinary differential equations case, the proposed Newton approach removes the dependence of the algorithm&#39;s convergence rate on the unknown Hessian of the nonlinear map to be optimized, being user-assignable unlike the gradient algorithm.

To achieve the control objective under the given constraints, the distributed control algorithms are designed for the second leader group and followers, in which the backstepping, distributed estimation, $PD^m$, and adaptive gain design techniques are employed.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of designing finite-horizon safe controllers for a dynamical system for which no explicit analytical model exists and limited data only along a single trajectory of the system are available. Given samples of the states and inputs of the system, and additional side information in terms of regularity of the evolution of the states, we synthesize a controller such that the evolution of the states avoid some prespecified unsafe set over a given finite horizon. Motivated by recent results on Whitney&#39;s extension theorem, we use piecewise-polynomial approximations of the trajectories based on the data along with the regularity side information to formulate a data-driven differential inclusion model that can predict the evolution of the trajectories. For these classes of data-driven differential inclusions, we propose a safety analysis theorem based on barrier certificates. As a corollary of this theorem, we demonstrate that we can design controllers ensuring safety of the solutions to the data-driven differential inclusion over a finite horizon. From a computational standpoint, our results are cast into a set of sum-of-squares programs whenever the certificates are parametrized by polynomials of fixed degree and the sets are semialgebraic.},

The specific feature of this algorithm is that it can ensure the convergence of the output variable and maintain it in a predefined neighborhood of zero independent from the upper bound of the disturbances derivatives.

The origin of a dynamical system is predefined-time stable if it is fixed-time stable, and an upper bound of the settling-time function can be arbitrarily chosen a priori through a suitable selection of the system parameters. We show that the studied Lyapunov-like conditions allow us to demonstrate the equivalence between previous Lyapunov theorems for predefined-time stability for autonomous systems. Moreover, the obtained Lyapunov-like theorem is extended for analyzing the property of predefined-time ultimate boundedness with predefined bound, which is useful when analyzing uncertain dynamical systems. Therefore, the proposed results constitute a general framework for analyzing the predefined-time stability, and they also unify a broad class of systems that present the predefined-time stability property. On the other hand, the proposed framework is used to design robust controllers for affine control systems, which induce predefined-time stability (predefined-time ultimate boundedness of the solutions) w.r.t. to some desired manifold. A simulation example is presented to show the behavior of a developed controller, especially regarding the settling time estimation.},

We provide some Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions for uniform stability and globally asymptotical stability. Unlike normal time-triggered impulsive control, event-triggered impulsive control is triggered only when an event occurs. Thus our stability conditions rely greatly on the event-triggering mechanism given in terms of Lyapunov functions. Moreover, the Zeno behavior can be excluded in our results. Then, we apply the theoretical results to the nonlinear impulsive control system, where event-triggered impulsive control strategies are designed to achieve stability of the addressed system.

  abstract     = {Bilinear systems emerge in a wide variety of fields as natural models for dynamical systems ranging from robotics to quantum dots. Analyzing controllability of such systems is of fundamental and practical importance, for example, for the design of optimal control laws, stabilization of unstable systems, and minimal realization of input-output relations. Tools from the Lie theory have been adopted to establish controllability conditions for bilinear systems, and the most notable development was the Lie algebra rank condition (LARC). However, the application of the LARC may be computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems. In this article, we present an alternative and effective algebraic approach to investigate controllability of bilinear systems. The central idea is to map Lie bracket operations of the vector fields governing the system dynamics to permutation multiplications on a symmetric group, so that controllability and the controllable submanifold can be characterized by permutation orbits. The method is further shown to be applicable to characterize controllability of systems defined on undirected graphs, such as multiagent systems with controlled couplings between agents and Markov chains with tunable transition rates between states, which, in turn, reveals a graph representation of controllability through graph connectivity.},

This article addresses the issues of forgetting for RC. Using the properties of inhomogeneous products of nonnegative matrices, this article establishes that a RC forget its endpoint distributions in a more complicated manner. In particular, this article shows that the forgetting function for the initial conditions is bounded by a superposition of increasing and decreasing geometric terms. Implications for modeling using RC are then discussed. The particular case of those RC that are MC with prescribed marginal distributions on the endpoints is considered. The tightness of the forgetting bounds is illustrated with numerical examples.},

The existence of a small parameter in the wave equation (as a factor multiplying the time derivative) suggests the idea of applying a singular perturbation method to get the stability of the full system by analyzing the stability of some appropriate subsystems given by the method. However, for infinite-dimensional systems, it is known that in some cases, this method does not work. Indeed, one cannot be sure of the stability of the full system even if the given subsystems are stable. In this article, we prove that the singular perturbation method works for the system under study.

We use the Lambert W function to determine: 1) in what systems the delay can lead to increase in the rate of convergence; 2) the exact range of time delay, for which the rate of convergence is greater than that of the delay-free system; and 3) an estimate on the value of the delay that leads to the maximum rate of convergence. For the special case when the system matrix eigenvalues are all negative real numbers, we expand our results to show that the rate of convergence in the presence of delay depends only on the eigenvalues with minimum and maximum real parts. Moreover, we determine the exact value of the maximum rate of convergence and the corresponding maximizing time delay. We demonstrate our results through a numerical example on the practical application in accelerating an agreement algorithm for networked systems by using a delayed feedback.},

This situation arises naturally in a scenario, where a system undergoes a critical failure. In that case, it is imperative to retain the ability to satisfy basic control objectives in order to avert an imminent catastrophe. To deal with limitations on the knowledge of system dynamics, we develop a theory of myopic control. At any given time, myopic control optimizes the current direction of the system trajectory, given solely the knowledge about system dynamics obtained from data until that time. We propose an algorithm that uses small perturbations in the control effort to learn system dynamics around the current system state, while ensuring that the system moves in a nearly optimal direction, and provide bounds for its suboptimality.},

However, we prove that the original VB method for the non-Gaussian state-space models, modeled by the Gaussian mixture distributions, is analytically intractable. To overcome this problem, we propose a partial VB-based adaptive Gaussian sum Kalman filter, which uses a feedback-based filtering framework to independently calculate the posterior distribution of the state and posterior distribution of the NGMN.

For linear systems with delay and rate constrained communications between the observer and the controller, previous work shows that a deterministic approach, the $\ell _\infty$ control has low complexity but can only handle bounded disturbances. In this article, we take a stochastic approach and propose a linear-quadratic (LQ) controller that can handle arbitrarily large disturbance but has large complexity in time and space. The differences in robustness and complexity of the $\ell _\infty$ and LQ controllers motivate the design of a hybrid controller that interpolates between the two: The $\ell _\infty$ controller is applied when the disturbance is not too large (normal mode) and the LQ controller is resorted to otherwise (acute mode). We characterize the switching behavior between the normal and acute modes. Using our theoretical bounds which are supplemented by numerical experiments, we show that the hybrid controller can achieve a sweet spot in the robustness-complexity tradeoff, i.e., reject occasional large disturbance while operating with low complexity most of the time.},

Instead, the proposed approach relies on a novel information mixing approach that exploits both rowand column-stochastic weights to achieve agreement toward the optimal solution when the underlying graph is directed. We show that TV-AB converges linearly to the optimal solution when the global objective is smooth and strongly convex, and the underlying time-varying graphs exhibit bounded connectivity, i.e., a union of every C consecutive graphs is strongly connected. We derive the convergence results based on the stability analysis of a linear system of inequalities along with a matrix perturbation argument. Simulations confirm the findings in this article.},

Persistency of excitation is a strong condition that also allows unique identification of the underlying dynamical system from the data within a given model class. In this article, we develop a new framework in order to work with data that are not necessarily persistently exciting. Within this framework, we investigate necessary and sufficient conditions on the informativity of data for several data-driven analysis and control problems. For certain analysis and design problems, our results reveal that persistency of excitation is not necessary. In fact, in these cases, data-driven analysis/control is possible while the combination of (unique) system identification and model-based control is not. For certain other control problems, our results justify the use of persistently exciting data, as data-driven control is possible only with data that are informative for system identification.},

Rather than addressing feasibility separately, CSP utilizes a penalty function method to convert the original problem into a series of simulation optimization problems without stochastic constraints that are then solved via adaptive search. We present conditions under which the CSP approach converges almost surely from inside the feasible region, and under which it converges to the optimal solution but without feasibility guarantee. We also conduct numerical studies aimed at assessing the efficiency of CSP under the two different convergence modes. Our numerical results show that the CSP method converges to the optimal solution in all settings we considered. Moreover, it converges faster when the optimal solution is interior to the feasible region. Finally, if there are binding constraints at the optimal solution, then convergence is faster when feasibility is not guaranteed.},

Formally, this problem can be cast as the analysis of solutions of a set of nonlinear algebraic equations of the form f(x) = 0, where f : R n → R n , to which we associate the differential equation x = f(x). By invoking advanced concepts of dynamical systems theory and effectively exploiting its monotonicity, the following properties are established: First, prove that, if there are equilibria, there is a distinguished one that is stable and attractive, and give conditions such that it is unique. Second, give a simple online procedure to decide whether equilibria exist or not and to compute the distinguished one. Third, prove that the method is also applicable for the case when the parameters of the system are not exactly known. It is shown how the proposed tool can be applied to the analysis of long-term voltage stability in ac power systems, and to the study of existence of equilibria of multiterminal high-voltage dc systems and dc microgrids.},

This nested information structure is obtained through an appropriate monitoring structure. Under this monitoring structure, we show that, given mild assumptions, the set of perfect Bayesian equilibrium payoffs coincides with Markov perfect equilibrium payoffs, and hence, a dynamic programming formulation can be obtained for the computation of equilibrium strategies of the strategic long-lived player in the discounted setup. We also consider the undiscounted average-payoff setup, where we obtain an optimal equilibrium strategy of the strategic long-lived player under further technical conditions. We then use this optimal strategy in the undiscounted setup as a tool to obtain a tight upper payoff bound for the arbitrarily patient long-lived player in the discounted setup. Finally, by using measure concentration techniques, we obtain a refined lower payoff bound on the value of reputation in the discounted setup.

In order to conduct this search, polynomials are introduced for approximating the matrix exponential and for quantifying the feasibility of the Lyapunov inequalities. It is shown that a stabilizing controller exists if and only if a condition built solving three convex optimization problems with linear matrix inequalities holds for polynomials of degree sufficiently large. Analogous conditions for the existence of a controller ensuring desired upper bounds on the H 2 norm and on the rms gain of the closed-loop system are derived by searching for a family of homogeneous rational Lyapunov functions parameterized rationally by the sought controller.},

We investigate the role the logic matrix and its structure plays in determining the final opinions, including existence of the limiting opinions, of a strongly connected network of individuals. We provide a set of results that, given a set of individuals&#39; belief systems, allow a systematic determination of which topics will reach a consensus, and of which topics will disagreement arise. For irreducible logic matrices, each topic reaches a consensus. For reducible logic matrices, which indicates a cascade interdependence relationship, conditions are given on whether a topic will reach a consensus or not. It turns out that heterogeneity among the individuals&#39; logic matrices, and a cascade interdependence relationship, are necessary conditions for disagreement. Thus, this article attributes for the first time, a strong diversity of limiting opinions to heterogeneity of belief systems in influence networks, in addition to the more typical explanation that strong diversity arises from individual stubbornness.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a decentralized design of a distributed state observer for a continuous-time linear time-invariant plant. The plant is monitored by a group of agents and each agent&#39;s measurement of the plant&#39;s state suffers from lack of detectability with the plant dynamics. Then the missing information (i.e., the undetectable portion) is compensated by a local communication with the neighboring agents. In particular, when the local observer for each agent is designed, no global information such as the structure of network and the number of agents is needed, and so, the decentralized design is achieved. Therefore, the plug-and-play operation is enabled; that is, during the operation, a new agent can design a local observer for itself without any global information and join the network, and any agent may leave the network without hampering the operation as long as the rest of the agents remain detectable. The main idea is to let each agent recover its own detectable part while the undetectable part is compensated by a projection of the neighbors&#39; estimates into the receiver&#39;s undetectable subspace. An adaptive algorithm for individual agent is designed in order to find suitable gains for compensating the undetectable portion.

  abstract     = {This article studies the parameter tuning problem of positive linear systems for optimizing their stability properties. We specifically show that, under certain regularity assumptions on the parameterization, the problem of finding the minimum-cost parameters that achieve a given requirement on a system norm reduces to a geometric program, which, in turn, can be exactly and efficiently solved by convex optimization. The flexibility of geometric programming allows the state, input, and output matrices of the system to simultaneously depend on the parameters to be tuned. The class of system norms under consideration includes the H 2 norm, H ∞ norm, Hankel norm, and Schatten p-norm. Also, the parameter tuning problem for ensuring the robust stability of the system under structural uncertainties is shown to be solved by geometric programming. The proposed optimization framework is further extended to delayed positive linear systems, where it is shown that the parameter tuning problem jointly constrained by the exponential decay rate, the L 1 -gain, and the L ∞ -gain can be solved by convex optimization. The assumption on the system parameterization is stated in terms of posynomial functions, which form a broad class of functions and thus allow us to deal with various interesting positive linear systems arising from, for example, dynamical buffer networks and epidemic spreading processes. We present numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework.},

A test of quantum Hamiltonian identifiability is an important tool to save time and cost when exploring the identification capability of quantum probes and experimentally implementing quantum identification schemes. In this article, we generalize the identifiability test based on the similarity transformation approach (STA) in classical control theory and extend it to the domain of quantum Hamiltonian identification. We employ the STA to prove the identifiability of spin-1/2 chain systems with arbitrary dimension assisted by single-qubit probes. We further extend the traditional STA method by proposing a structure preserving transformation (SPT) method for nonminimal systems. We use the SPT method to introduce an indicator for the existence of economic quantum Hamiltonian identification algorithms, whose computational complexity directly depends on the number of unknown parameters (which could be much smaller than the system dimension). Finally, we give an example of such an economic Hamiltonian identification algorithm and perform simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Game theory has emerged as a fruitful paradigm for the design of networked multiagent systems. A fundamental component of this approach is the design of agents&#39; utility functions so that their self-interested maximization results in a desirable collective behavior. In this article, we focus on a well-studied class of distributed resource allocation problems, where each agent is requested to select a subset of resources with the goal of optimizing a given system-level objective. Our core contribution is the development of a novel framework to tightly characterize the worst-case performance of any resulting Nash equilibrium (price of anarchy) as a function of the chosen agents&#39; utility functions. Leveraging this result, we identify how to design such utilities so as to optimize the price of anarchy through a tractable linear program. This provides us with a priori performance certificates applicable to any existing learning algorithm capable of driving the system to an equilibrium. Part II of this article specializes these results to submodular and supermodular objectives, discusses the complexity of computing Nash equilibria, and provides multiple illustrations of the theoretical findings.},

Surprisingly, we find that uncertainties in different directions have qualitatively distinct impacts on equilibria. Namely, contrary to the usual notion that uncertainty increases inefficiencies, network congestion decreases when users overestimate their costs. On the other hand, underestimation of costs leads to increased congestion. We apply these results to urban transportation networks, where drivers have different estimates about the cost of congestion. In light of the dynamic pricing policies aimed at tackling congestion, our results indicate that users&#39; perception of these prices can significantly impact the policy&#39;s efficacy, and “caution in the face of uncertainty” leads to favorable network conditions.},

Based on this result, we further prove the main contribution of this article: GALES and uniform observability imply SGAS by sampled-data output feedback, which is indeed a hybrid version of the “separation principle” for nonlinear systems. The development of the “digital separation principle” is made possible by employing a subtle Lyapunov argument that makes the estimation of domains of attraction and semiglobal asymptotic analysis relatively intuitive and simple, without involving intricate Lyapunov functions and the corresponding level sets. Results on SGAS by sampled-data feedback for representative classes of nonlinear systems are also given as illustrations.},

Nearby solutions jump at close but noncoincident times, making the standard notion of closeness, based on vector difference, unsuitable to compare trajectories point-wise in time. With tracking control as ultimate goal, we propose a notion of stability and a constructive stability proof based on sensitivity analysis applicable to single-jump-flow trajectories. A key role in the analysis is played by a time-triggered linear system, associated with the discontinuous trajectory of interest, whose uniform asymptotic stability suffices to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the original discontinuous trajectory. As an illustrative example, the stability analysis is applied to guarantee closed-loop stable tracking for a trajectory with velocity jumps of a 2 DoF mechanical system with unilateral constraint.},

The constraints are generally sparse, meaning that only a small subset of the agents are involved in them. This scenario arises in many applications, including decentralized control formulations, resource allocation problems, and smart grids. Traditional decentralized solutions tend to ignore the structure of the constraints and lead to degraded performance. We instead develop a decentralized solution that exploits the sparsity structure. Under constant step-size learning, the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm is established in the presence of nonsmooth terms, and it occurs at a linear rate in the smooth case. We also examine how the performance of the algorithm is influenced by the sparsity of the constraints. Simulations illustrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy.},

We show that searches in discrete time for FIR multipliers are effective even for large orders. As expected, the numerical results provide the best ℓ 2 -stability results in the literature for slope-restricted nonlinearities. In particular, we establish the equivalence between the state-of-the-art Lyapunov results for slope-restricted nonlinearities and a subset of the FIR multipliers.

We are interested in graph-theoretic conditions for identifiability of such dynamical networks, where we assume that only a subset of nodes is measured but the underlying graph structure of the network is known. This problem has recently been investigated from a generic viewpoint. Roughly speaking, generic identifiability means that the transfer functions in the network can be identified for “almost all” network matrices associated with the graph. In this article, we investigate the stronger notion of identifiability for all network matrices. To this end, we introduce a new graph-theoretic concept called the graph simplification process. Based on this process, we provide necessary and sufficient topological conditions for identifiability. Notably, we also show that these conditions can be verified by polynomial time algorithms. Finally, we explain how our results generalize existing sufficient conditions for identifiability.},

Based on a general model of infinite delay systems and a newly approved key technical lemma, several new Lyapunov theorems for uniform asymptotical stability and exponential stability, respectively, are established. The stability results are more general than existing stability results, and the corresponding conditions are more easily satisfied than existing ones. Therefore, the new stability results are expected to be more widely applicable. These new Lyapunov theorems are then applied to the problems of stabilizing both time-invariant and time-varying linear systems with distributed infinite input delays, and the corresponding stabilizing controllers are developed. Key to obtaining the stabilizing controllers is to construct appropriate Lyapunov functionals for these systems via introduction of a regulation term into the Lyapunov functional. A distinctive advantage of the Lyapunov-based time-domain method proposed in this article over the existing frequency domain method is that the former can be adopted to deal with more general systems, such as time-varying linear systems or even nonlinear systems.

This article explores both the linear time-invariant multiple-input- multiple-output system (LTI MIMO) and the pairwise Markov model (PMM) with the related pairwise Kalman filter (PKF). In particular, we design robust gradient-based adaptive Kalman-like filtering methods for the simultaneous state and parameter estimation in the outlined model structures. Our methods are fast and accurate because their analytically computed gradient is utilized in the calculation instead of its numerical approximation. Also, these employ the numerically robust UDUT-factorization-based Kalman filter implementation, which is reliable in practice.

  abstract     = {In this article, a new event-triggered H i /H ∞ optimization fault detection (FD) scheme is proposed for linear discrete time systems. A linear discrete time system with varying sampling periods is first presented to describe the dynamics of an event-triggered system. Based on this, an observer-based fault detection filter (FDF) is constructed as an event-triggered residual generator so that the generated residual signal is completely decoupled from the event-triggered transmission error. The design of event-triggered FDF is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem denoted by H i /H ∞ and an optimal solution can be obtained by recursive calculation of Riccati equations. In addition, an event-triggered residual evaluation strategy is also presented. Comparing with the existing event-triggered FD schemes, the major contribution of this article is to decouple the residual signals from the event-triggered transmission errors completely and, consequently, the FD performance can be improved significantly. Moreover, an optimal tradeoff between the robustness of residual to unknown input and the sensitivity of residual to fault is achieved in the sense of H i /H ∞ optimization, while the design of FDF and event generator can be carried out independently. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a vehicle lateral dynamic system is used as a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {The invariant-set motion planner uses a collection of safe sets to find a collision-free path through an obstacle-filled environment [1]-[4]. This article extends the invariant-set motion planner to systems with persistently varying disturbances and parametric model uncertainty. This is accomplished by replacing the previously used positive invariant sets with robust positive invariant sets. Since the model uncertainty obfuscates the relationship between the invariant sets in the state space, and the references and obstacles in the output space, we reformulate the dynamics in velocity form so that the system output appears directly in the modified system state. Since the persistently varying disturbances will prevent the closed-loop system from converging to the desired reference, we introduce a new robust connection rule where references are connected when the invariant set of one reference contains the minimal volume robust invariant-set of another. In addition, we bound the time required to transition between invariant sets to ensure safety when the obstacles are moving. By parameterizing the invariant sets using a precomputed input-to-state Lyapunov function, we reduce the real-time computational complexity of our motion planner. The robust invariant-set motion planner is demonstrated for an automated highway driving case study.},

The resulting closed-loop system has been shown to be well-posed by the semigroup approach. The eigenvalues of the closed-loop system are tested to be located at the open left-half plane by the Nyquist criterion for distributed parameter systems. Then the Riesz basis method is adopted to show that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable. Numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the ADRC compensator to stabilize the unstable heat equation with one unstable pole.},

Second, if exact tracking is infeasible, which control performs most accurately. These are typical challenges for overactuated systems and for underactuated systems, respectively. We formulate both goals as optimal output regulation problems. Then, we contribute two new sets of regulator equations to output regulation theory that provide the desired solutions. A thorough study indicates solvability and uniqueness under weak assumptions. For example, we can always determine the solution of the classical regulator equations that is most input energy efficient. This is of great value if there are infinitely many solutions. We derive our results by a linear quadratic tracking approach and establish a useful link to output regulation theory.},

The probability distribution of the random variable is unknown to the agents. The agents aim to cooperatively find, using their collected data, a solution with guaranteed out-of-sample performance. The approach is to formulate a data-driven distributionally robust optimization problem using Wasserstein ambiguity sets, which turns out to be equivalent to a convex program. We reformulate the latter as a distributed optimization problem and identify a convex-concave augmented Lagrangian, whose saddle points are in correspondence with the optimizers, provided a min-max interchangeability criteria is met. Our distributed algorithm design, then consists of the saddle-point dynamics associated to the augmented Lagrangian. We formally establish that the trajectories converge asymptotically to a saddle point and, hence, an optimizer of the problem.

A postprocessing internal model design suitable for the multivariable nature of the system, which might have more inputs than regulation errors, is proposed. Uncertainties in the system and exosystem are dealt with by assuming that the ideal steady-state input belongs to a certain “class of signals,” by which an appropriate model set for the internal model can be derived. The adaptation mechanism for the internal model is then cast as an identification problem, and a least-squares solution is specifically developed. In line with recent developments in the field, the vision that emerges from this article is that approximate, possibly asymptotic, regulation is the appropriate way of approaching the problem in a multivariable and uncertain context. New insights about the use of identification tools in the design of adaptive internal models are also presented.},

This article focuses on designing an intelligent online attack, which can compromise a sensor, eavesdrop measurements, and inject false feedback information, against remote state estimation. From the viewpoint of the attacker, we design an event-based attack strategy to degrade the estimation quality with an arbitrary communication rate stealthy constraint. The approximate minimum mean-squared error estimation algorithm from the viewpoint of the attacker is derived under a Gaussian assumption. Furthermore, the relation between the attack threshold and the scheduling threshold is obtained in a closed form. We show that the mean-squared stability condition of the estimation is weakened under the attack. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the main results.},

In this context, we present a novel approach to design energy-efficient time-triggered communication policies for wireless networked control systems, while ensuring a given control performance. We consider a plant, modeled as a deterministic discrete-time linear system, which is controlled through a wireless network by an output-feedback law. We proceed by emulation, i.e., we construct the controller to stabilize the origin of the plant while ignoring communication constraints. Next, the wireless network is taken into account and we assume that the probability of packet drops depends on the transmission signal power. We introduce the notion of stochastic allowable transmission interval (SATI) to characterize stabilizing time-triggered transmission policies. We then explain how to minimize the average energy expenditure of the transmitting devices while satisfying the SATI constraints, thus ensuring the control requirements. Simulations results are provided to illustrate the tradeoff between the communication and the control costs.},

Most existing works are established on the assumption that the maximum tolerable number of attacks, which depends on the network connectivity, is known by all normal agents. All normal agents will use the maximum number of attacks to decide whether the received information will be used for iterations. In this article, we relax this assumption and propose a novel resilient distributed optimization algorithm. The proposed algorithm exploits the trusted agents which cannot be compromised by adversarial attacks and form a connected dominating set in the original graph to constrain effects of adversarial attacks. It is shown that local variables of all normal and trusted agents converge to the same value under the proposed algorithm. Further, the final solution belongs to the convex set of minimizers of the weighted average of local cost functions of all trusted agents. The upper bound of the distance between the final solution and the optimal one has also been provided. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Because the Kalman filter can be successfully modified slightly to accommodate each of these two additions, it is desired to attain a modification of the Kalman update equations that incorporates both. More precisely, it will be ideal to design an event-based trigger under a Bernoulli packet drop such that the resulting distribution of the state variable remains Gaussian. The article shows that this is impossible. We further explore a larger family of probability distributions, the p-generalized normal distribution, and show that the existence of the trigger is impossible in most cases.

To make full use of the delay probability distribution, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed with the distributed kernel.

It predicts changes in the solution of the parameterized OCP as the parameter varies by calculating the semiderivative of the solution mapping.

Abstracting a discrete transition system from a real-world continuous-state system often results in a state machine with a large number of states and nondeterministic transitions. This makes controller synthesis for LTL specifications difficult specially when the design specification is lengthy. To reduce the complexity, we consider the specifications that are in the conjunctive form of practical LTL patterns. We use auditor product to incrementally restrict the system to satisfy the safety part of each subspecification. The control strategy, that satisfies the liveness part is then calculated by solving a generalized Buchi game on the result of the auditor product of the discrete transition system with all subspecifications. This approach has the same worst case computational complexity as GR(1) synthesis, but avoids some of the fundamental limitations involved with Assumption → Guarantee formulation of the problem.},

One of the designs is in the discrete-time domain, and the other is in the continuous-time domain. The control design to ensure the PS property in the continuous-time domain is also developed.

The distributed quaternion Kalman filter is formulated to mirror the operations of an optimal centralized approach in a fashion that will allow each agent to retain a Kalman style filtering operation and an intermediate estimate of the state vector. The article includes a comprehensive performance analysis of the developed distributed quaternion Kalman filtering algorithm, resulting in a closed-form expression for the second-order error moment. More importantly, due to the comprehensive framework for fusion of the covariance information and drawing upon concepts from the conducted performance analysis, a duality between the developed distributed Kalman filter and decentralized control is established. This essentially extends the duality between Kalman filtering and linear quadrature regulators to the quaternion domain and distributed setting.

In such systems, agents are partitioned into a few subpopulations so that the dynamics and cost of agents in each subpopulation is invariant to the indexing of agents. The goal of agents is to minimize a common cost function in such a manner that the agents in each subpopulation are not discriminated or privileged by the way they are indexed. Two nonclassical information structures are studied. In the first one, each agent observes its local state as well as the empirical distribution of the states of agents in each subpopulation, called deep state, whereas in the second one, the deep states of a subset (possibly all) of subpopulations are not observed. Novel dynamic programs are developed to identify globally optimal and suboptimal solutions for the first and second information structures, respectively. The computational complexity of finding the optimal solution in both space and time is polynomial (rather than exponential) with respect to the number of agents in each subpopulation and is linear (rather than exponential) with respect to the control horizon. This complexity is further reduced in time by introducing a forward equation, which we call deep Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, described by multiple convolutional layers of binomial probability distributions. Two different prices are defined for computation and communication, and it is shown that under mild conditions they converge to zero as the number of quantization levels and the number of agents tend to infinity. In addition, the main results are extended to infinite-horizon discounted models and arbitrarily asymmetric cost functions. Finally, a service management example with 200 users is presented.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a new state estimation scheme using the second-level adaptation technique and multiple high-gain observers (MHGO) for improving the transient response and attenuating undesired peaks of high-gain observers (HGOs). The proposed method, MHGO, considers state estimation as a convex combination of provided information by multiple HGOs. In this regard, it is shown that there exist some constant parameters in such combination that result in perfect state estimation; then, an adaptive algorithm is employed for estimating those parameters. The stability of the proposed scheme and convergence of state estimation to the state of the plant are guaranteed. In addition, MHGO is proved to be able to provide a state estimation with smaller peaks in comparison to a single HGO. The performance of MHGO in the presence of measurement noise is also investigated. We consider existence of abrupt external disturbances as well. To alleviate the effects of those disturbances and attenuate their resulting peaking, we present a resetting scheme. Moreover, the output feedback control problem is considered, and it is demonstrated that a separation principle is valid for MHGO. Finally, simulation results illustrate that MHGO provides an accurate state estimation, and MHGO-based controller is able to recover the performance of state feedback controller.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a unified identification framework called constrained subspace method for structured state-space models (COSMOS) is presented, where the structure is defined by a user-specified linear or polynomial parametrization. The new approach operates directly from the input and output data, which differs from the traditional two-step method that first obtains a state-space realization followed by the system-parameter estimation. The new identification framework relies on a subspace inspired linear regression problem which may not yield a consistent estimate in the presence of process noise. To alleviate this problem, the linear regression formulation is imposed by structured and low-rank constraints in terms of a finite set of system Markov parameters and the user specified model parameters. The nonconvex nature of the constrained optimization problem is dealt with by transforming the problem into a difference-of-convex optimization problem, which is then handled by the sequential convex programming strategy. Numerical simulation examples show that the proposed identification method is more robust than the classical prediction-error method initialized by random initial values in converging to local minima, but at the cost of heavier computational burden.},

Most of the existing approaches separate learning, i.e., the system identification based on a fixed dataset, and control, i.e., the execution of the model-based control law. This separation makes the performance highly sensitive to the initial selection of training data and possibly requires very large datasets. This article proposes a learning feedback linearizing control law using online closed-loop identification. The employed Gaussian process model updates its training data only if the model uncertainty becomes too large. This event-triggered online learning ensures high data efficiency and thereby reduces computational complexity, which is a major barrier for using Gaussian processes under real-time constraints. We propose safe forgetting strategies of data points to adhere to budget constraints and to further increase data efficiency. We show asymptotic stability for the tracking error under the proposed event-triggering law and illustrate the effective identification and control in simulation.},

When a network topology is already known (or partially known), two associated goals are, to derive estimators for nodes of the network, which cannot be directly observed or are impractical to measure; and to quantitatively identify the dynamic relations between nodes. We address both problems in the challenging scenario where only some outputs of the network are being measured and the inputs are not accessible. The approach makes use of the notion of d-separation for the graph associated with the network. In the considered class of networks, it is shown that the proposed technique can determine or guide the choice of optimal sparse estimators. This article also derives identification methods that are applicable to cases where loops are present providing a different perspective on the problem of closed-loop identification. The notion of d-separation is a central concept in the area of probabilistic graphical models, thus an additional contribution is to create connections between control theory and machine learning techniques.},

  abstract     = {Mechanism design for fully strategic agents typically assumes that agents broadcast their messages to a central authority that performs allocation and taxes/subsidizes agents. In addition, most of the designed mechanisms do not provide any guarantees that the Nash equilibrium (NE) will be reached asymptotically. Whenever such results are provided, they refer to convergence of specific predesigned learning dynamics and it is assumed that agents will follow such prescription. Both assumptions are an impediment in practical application of mechanism design in real-life allocation problems. In this article, we consider two common resource allocation problems: sharing K infinitely divisible resources among strategic agents for their private consumption (private goods), and determining the level for an infinitely divisible public good with P features, that is shared between strategic agents. For both cases, we present a distributed mechanism for a set of agents who communicate through a given network. In a distributed mechanism, agents&#39; messages are not broadcasted to all other agents as in the standard mechanism design framework, but are exchanged only in the local neighborhood of each agent. The presented mechanisms produce a unique NE, they fully implement the social welfare maximizing allocation, and are budget-balanced at NE. Subsequently, it is shown that the mechanisms induce a game with contractive best-response, leading to guaranteed convergence for all learning dynamics within the adaptive best-response dynamics class, including dynamics such as Cournot best-response, k-period best-response, and Fictitious Play. While the abovementioned mechanisms have message dimensionality that grows quadratically with the number of agents, we show that if one is willing to forgo the strong convergence guarantees, it is possible to design a distributed mechanism with total message space dimensionality growing only linearly with the number of agents. Finally, we demonstrate the abovementioned results through a numerical study of convergence under repeated play, for various communication graphs and learning dynamics.},

First, graphon dynamical system models are formulated in an appropriate infinite dimensional space in order to represent arbitrary-size networks of linear dynamical systems, and to define the convergence of sequences of network systems with limits in the space. Exact controllability and approximate controllability of graphon dynamical systems are then investigated. Second, the minimum energy state-to-state control problem and the linear quadratic regulator problem for systems on complex networks are considered. The control problem for graphon limit systems is solved in each case and approximations are defined which yield control laws for the original control problems. Furthermore, convergence properties of the approximation schemes are established. A systematic control design methodology is developed within this framework. Finally, numerical examples of networks with randomly sampled weightings are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the graphon control methodology.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the problem of designing a centralized controller for vehicle collision avoidance at road junctions and intersections. The controller supervises a set of vehicles, and overrides their inputs when necessary to prevent side and rear-end collisions. By supervising vehicles, rather than taking full control, we obtain a system that can work with semiautomated human-driven vehicles. The price to pay is in complexity: an override is only necessary if, without an intervention, all future input signals will result in a collision. Thus, deciding overrides requires verification of the full reachability set, rather than the computation of a single collision-free trajectory. Our approach to speeding this step up is to use an abstraction of the (concrete) system, which is suitably discretized to obtain a mixed-integer programming problem. We deduce the solution of the original verification problem (VP) from that of the abstraction-based VP by proving an approximate simulation relation between the abstract and concrete systems. The resulting supervisor provably guarantees safety of the concrete system. We also evaluate the approximation error of the supervisor due to the use of an abstraction. Computer simulations show that the supervisor exhibits computationally better performances than other existing controllers applicable to realistic intersection scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the event-triggered stabilization for continuous-time stochastic systems. Due to stochastic effects, the system state is hard to predict and dominate, and the system behavior would vary with every trial (i.e., sample path) even for the same initial condition. This gives rise to substantial challenges, especially, in determining the execution/sampling times and assessing the closed-loop performance, which urges us to develop powerful and sophisticated tools/methods for the analysis and design of stochastic event-triggered control. In this article, basic theorems, particularly a stochastic convergence theorem, are first proposed for stochastic event-triggered controlled systems. Then, a framework of event-triggered stabilization is established for the stochastic systems without applying the well-known Lyapunov theorems. Specifically, we present conditions under which event-triggered stabilization is feasible for the systems. Accordingly, static and dynamic event-triggering mechanisms are proposed with enforcing a fixed positive lower bound for the interexecution times. While avoiding infinitely fast execution/sampling, both asymptotic stabilization and exponential stabilization are achieved for the systems by the proposed stochastic convergence theorem. The involved analysis is helpful to form a pattern for stochastic event-triggered controlled systems. As the direct application of the established framework, the constructive design of event-triggered controller is realized, respectively, for two representative classes of stochastic systems.},

  abstract     = {A model matching and passivating control architecture for multi-input/multi-output linear systems, comprising dynamic feedback and feedforward, is proposed. The approach-essentially without any restriction on the relative degree and the zeros of the underlying system and by relying only on input/output measurements-provides a closed-loop system, the transfer matrix of which matches any desired matrix of rational functions. An alternative implementation of the above design allows to achieve an arbitrary approximation accuracy of a desired transfer matrix while also preserving structural properties-in particular observability-of the overall interconnected system. Such a construction can be then specialized to provide input/output decoupling or a system that is passive from a novel control input to a modified output. The result is achieved by arbitrarily assigning the relative degree and location of the poles and zeros on the complex plane of the interconnected system in a systematic way. It is also shown that similar ideas can be employed to enforce a desired, arbitrarily small, L 2 -gain from an unknown disturbance input to a modified output, while preserving the corresponding gain from the control input to the same output. The article is concluded with applications and further discussions on the results.},

  abstract     = {We develop a new computational framework to solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the flow of the joint probability density functions (PDFs) in continuous-time stochastic nonlinear systems. The need for computing the transient joint PDFs subject to prior dynamics arises in uncertainty propagation, nonlinear filtering, and stochastic control. Our methodology breaks away from the traditional approach of spatial discretization or function approximation-both of which, in general, suffer from the “curse-of-dimensionality.” In the proposed framework, we discretize time but not the state space. We solve infinite dimensional proximal recursions in the manifold of joint PDFs, which in the small time-step limit, is theoretically equivalent to solving the underlying transport PDEs. The resulting computation has the geometric interpretation of gradient flow of certain free energy functional with respect to the Wasserstein metric arising from the theory of optimal mass transport. We show that dualization along with an entropic regularization, leads to a cone-preserving fixed point recursion that is proved to be contractive in Thompson metric. A block co-ordinate iteration scheme is proposed to solve the resulting nonlinear recursions with guaranteed convergence. This approach enables remarkably fast computation for nonparametric transient joint PDF propagation. Numerical examples and various extensions are provided to illustrate the scope and efficacy of the proposed approach.},

The system matrix defining the network dynamics is a pattern matrix, in which a priori given entries are equal to zero, while the remaining entries take nonzero values. These nonzero entries correspond to edges in the network graph. The network is called strongly structurally controllable if for all choices of real values for the nonzero entries in the pattern matrix, the system is controllable in the classical sense. The novelty of this article is that we consider the situation that prespecified nonzero entries in the system&#39;s pattern matrix are constrained to take identical (nonzero) values. These constraints can be caused by symmetry properties or physical constraints on the network. Restricting the system matrices to those satisfying these constraints yields a new notion of strong structural controllability. The aim of this article is to establish graph-theoretic conditions for this more general property of strong structural controllability.},

Second, by considering the SETC and NCSs into a unified framework, the studied system is transferred into a time-delay system. Then, under the constraint of the number of maximum allowable data dropouts induced by DoS attacks, a stability criterion and a stabilization criterion are derived, which can be used to estimate the event-triggered communication parameters and obtain the security controller gain simultaneously. Moreover, the derived stabilization criterion can also provide a tradeoff to balance communication efficiency and H ∞ control performance.

For this, the overall network (not the individual local observer) is assumed to have redundant sensors and assumed to be connected. The proposed scheme is based on a novel design of a distributed median solver, which approximately recovers the median value of local estimates.},

And the conditions for any actuator attack to have a specific level of stealthiness are derived. Additionally, we characterize the upper bound of the performance degradation induced by attacks with a given extent of stealthiness that produces independent and identically distributed Gaussian innovations, and design the attack, which achieves the stated upper bound for right-invertible systems.

In this context, two attack design problems are studied, considering both location-fixed attacks and location-switching attacks based on measurable generator bus frequencies. They are further modeled as switched control problems, for which closed-form solutions can be attained. Leveraging the maximum principle, the diagonal partial feedback matrix is optimized by solving a convex optimization problem. The convexified switching variables describing the switching behavior are solved in a quadratic optimization problem and a fractional optimization problem, respectively. As a result, optimal switching conditions to select the best attack locations are obtained, along with optimal partial feedback attack matrices. Case studies on the IEEE 9-bus test system validate the practical merits of theory and numerical effectiveness of the proposed attack schemes.},

Instead, a centralized detector has a model of the entire dynamical system. We characterize the performance of the two detectors and show that, depending on the system and attack parameters, each of the detectors can outperform the other. Hence, it may be possible for the decentralized detector to outperform its centralized counterpart, despite having less information about the system dynamics, and this property is due to the nature of the considered attack detection problem (that is, a simple vs. composite hypothesis testing problem).

We assume a communication topology captured by an arbitrary strongly connected digraph, in which certain nodes (components) might be curious but not malicious (i.e., they execute the distributed protocol correctly, but try to identify the initial values of other nodes). We first develop a variation of the so-called ratio consensus algorithm that operates exclusively on integer values and can be used by the nodes to asymptotically obtain the average of their initial (integer) values, by taking the ratio of two integer values they maintain and iteratively update. Assuming the presence of a trusted node (i.e., a node that is not curious and can be trusted to set up a cryptosystem and not reveal any decrypted values of messages it receives), we describe how this algorithm can be adjusted using homomorphic encryption to allow the nodes to obtain the average of their initial values while ensuring their privacy (i.e., without having to reveal their initial value). We also extend the algorithm to handle situations where multiple nodes set up cryptosystems and privacy is preserved as long as one of these nodes can be trusted (i.e., the ratio of trusted nodes over the nodes that set up cryptosystems decreases).},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the stability problem for a class of Lipschitz-type nonlinear systems in networked environments, which are suffered from random and impulsive deception attacks. The attack is modeled as a randomly destabilizing impulsive sequence, whose impulsive instants and impulsive gains are both random with only the expectations available. Almost sure stability is ensured based on Doob&#39;s Martingale Convergence Theorem. Sufficient conditions are derived for the solution of the nonlinear system to be almost surely stable. An example is given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results. It is shown that the random attack will be able to destroy the stability, therefore, a large feedback gain may be necessary.},

  abstract     = {As a quantitative criterion for privacy of “mechanisms” in the form of data-generating processes, the concept of differential privacy was first proposed in computer science and has later been applied to linear dynamical systems. However, differential privacy has not been studied in depth together with other properties of dynamical systems, and it has not been fully utilized for controller design. In this article, first we clarify that a classical concept in systems and control, input observability (sometimes referred to as left invertibility) has a strong connection with differential privacy. In particular, we show that the Gaussian mechanism can be made highly differentially private by adding small noise, if the corresponding system is less input observable. Next, enabled by our new insight into privacy, we develop a method to design dynamic controllers for the classic tracking control problem while addressing privacy concerns. We call the obtained controller through our design method the privacy-preserving controller. The usage of such controllers is further illustrated by an example of tracking the prescribed power supply in a dc microgrid installed with smart meters while keeping the electricity consumers&#39; tracking errors private.},

  abstract     = {This article studies novel attack and defense strategies, based on a class of stealthy attacks, namely the zero-dynamics attack (ZDA), for multiagent control systems. ZDA poses a formidable security challenge since its attack signal is hidden in the null space of the state-space representation of the control system and hence it can evade conventional detection methods. An intuitive defense strategy builds on changing the aforementioned representation via switching through a set of carefully crafted topologies. In this article, we propose realistic ZDA variations where the attacker is aware of this topology-switching strategy, and hence employs the following policies to avoid detection: first, pause, update, and resume ZDA according to the knowledge of switching topologies; and second, cooperate with a concurrent stealthy topology attack that alters network topology at switching times, such that the original ZDA is feasible under the corrupted topology. We first systematically study the proposed ZDA variations, and then develop defense strategies against them under the realistic assumption that the defender has no knowledge of attack starting, pausing, and resuming times and the number of misbehaving agents. Particularly, we characterize conditions for detectability of the proposed ZDA variations, in terms of the network topologies to be maintained, the set of agents to be monitored, and the measurements of the monitored agents that should be extracted, while simultaneously preserving the privacy of the states of the nonmonitored agents. We then propose an attack detection algorithm based on the Luenberger observer, using the characterized detectability conditions. We provide numerical simulation results to demonstrate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the security issue of remote state estimation in cyber-physical systems (CPS) for a two-hop relay network is investigated. As the system performance depends on communication topology and communication environment over each channel, we explore the channel selection problem to maximize the attack effect, from the perspective of the jammer. Furthermore, for an energy-constrained jammer, there exists the optimal strategy to decide the attack number and the dropout rate, since the amount of attack number decreases and the dropout rate increases when the energy launched at each attack time becomes larger. For this consideration, the problem of energy dispatch, aiming to derive the optimal tradeoff between the attack number and the energy launched at each attack time, is studied along with the channel selection problem. We first formulate this problem as a mixed integer programming problem to derive the optimal attack schedule including the channel selection, the attack number, and the corresponding energy dispatch. Then, using the optimality equations based on the Markov decision process allows us to present the characteristics of the optimal energy dispatch policy for a given attack number, and further propose the dynamic energy dispatch algorithm with low complexity to approximate the optimal schedule. Besides, for the constant dispatch (CD) case, the optimum solution in an analytical form for the channel selection problem can be obtained, and we thus present a CD algorithm to acquire the optimal schedule. Last, numerical results are given to validate the theoretical findings and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

We derive a method for computing the index in small-scale systems and show that the index can potentially be increased by placing additional sensors. The difficulties that appear once the system is of a large-scale are then outlined: The index is NP-hard to compute, sensitive with respect to system variations, and based on the assumption that the attacker knows the entire system model. To overcome these difficulties, a robust security index is introduced. The robust index can characterize actuators vulnerable in any system realization, can be calculated in polynomial time, and can be related to limited model knowledge attackers. Additionally, we analyze two sensor placement problems with the objective to increase the robust indices. We show that the problems have submodular structures, so their suboptimal solutions with performance guarantees can be computed in polynomial time. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical developments through examples.},

The proposed architecture relies on a Luenberger observer together with a bank of unknown-input observers at each subsystem, providing attack detection capabilities. We describe the architecture and analyze conditions under which attacks are guaranteed to be detected, and, conversely, when they are stealthy. Our analysis shows that some classes of attacks cannot be detected using either module independently; rather, by exploiting both modules simultaneously, we are able to improve the detection properties of the diagnostic tool as a whole. Theoretical results are backed up by simulations, where our method is applied to a realistic model of a low-voltage DC microgrid under attack.},

Given the distributed and unattended nature of wireless sensor networks, it is imperative to enhance the resilience of pulse-based synchronization against malicious attacks. However, most existing results on resilient PCO synchronization are obtained for all-to-all networks. We propose a new pulse-based synchronization mechanism to improve the resilience of PCO synchronization that is applicable under general connected topologies. Under the proposed synchronization mechanism, we rigorously characterize the condition for stealthy Byzantine attacks and prove that perfect synchronization of legitimate oscillators can be guaranteed in the presence of multiple stealthy Byzantine attackers, irrespective of whether the attackers collude with each other or not. The new mechanism can guarantee resilient synchronization even when the initial phases of legitimate oscillators are widely distributed in a half circle, which is in distinct difference from most existing attack-resilient synchronization algorithms (including the seminal paper from Lamport and Melliar-Smith 1985) that require a priori (almost) synchronization among legitimate oscillators. Numerical simulation results are given to confirm the theoretical results.},

In particular, DAG ledgers with stochastic attachment mechanisms potentially offer many advantages over blockchain, including scalability and faster transaction speeds. However, the random nature of the attachment mechanism coupled with the requirement of protection against double-spending transactions might result in an unstable system in which not all transactions get eventually validated. Such transactions are said to be orphaned, and will never be validated. Our principal contribution is to propose a simple modification to the attachment mechanism for the Tangle (the IOTA DAG architecture). This modification ensures that all transactions are validated in finite time, and preserves essential features of the popular Monte Carlo selection algorithm. In order to demonstrate these results, we derive a fluid approximation for the Tangle (in the limit of infinite arrival rate) and prove that this fluid model exhibits the desired behavior. We also present simulations that validate the results for finite arrival rates.},

As opposed to fault-free networks, reaching agreement in the presence of Byzantine agents is far from trivial. In this article, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that is provably robust to Byzantine agents. At each iteration of the algorithm, a good agent performs a gradient descent update based on noisy local measurements, exchanges its update with other agents in its neighborhood, and robustly aggregates the received messages using coordinate-wise trimmed means. Under mild technical assumptions, we establish that good agents learn the true parameter asymptotically in almost sure sense.

The existence of a Lyapunov function with convex level sets is proved for the continuous-time closed-loop system. Then, the global asymptotic Lyapunov stability of the unperturbed discrete-time closed-loop system is proved. The convergence to the origin in a finite number of steps is proved also in the unperturbed case. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the implicit method with respect to an explicit discretization with significant chattering reduction.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the passivity-based control problem is addressed for hidden Markov jump systems with singular perturbations and partially unknown probabilities. The hidden Markov model (HMM) with partially unknown probabilities is introduced, where the partially unknown probabilities may exist in either the transition probability matrix of Markov chain, the observation probability matrix of observed signal, or in both of them. Thus, the underlying HMM is more general than the one in some existing works. By using this HMM, some passivity analysis criteria are established for Markov jump singularly perturbed systems with partial unknown probabilities. Based on these criteria, a unified method is presented for the design of controllers to ensure the passivity of the system. A numerical example and an armature controlled dc motor model are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

The communication network is to guarantee the information transmission among the plant, the reference system, and the controller. The communication network also brings about some undesired issues, which lead to nonvanishing network-induced errors and affect the tracking performance. As a result, we first develop a hybrid system model for NQCSs under the network-induced issues. Based on the Lyapunov approach, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the tracking performance with respect to the nonvanishing network-induced errors. The obtained conditions lead to a tradeoff between the maximally allowable transmission interval and the maximally allowable delay. Furthermore, the existence of Lyapunov functions satisfying the obtained conditions is studied. For specific time-scheduling protocols and quantizers, Lyapunov functions are constructed explicitly. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the developed theory.},

In particular, constraint satisfaction is guaranteed by taking advantage of set invariance properties, whereas asymptotic convergence is achieved by implementing a nonconservative navigation field, which is devoid of undesired stagnation points.

  abstract     = {An online reinforcement learning algorithm called renewal Monte Carlo (RMC) is presented. RMC works for infinite horizon Markov decision processes with a designated start state. RMC is a Monte Carlo algorithm that retains the key advantages of Monte Carlo-viz., simplicity, ease of implementation, and low bias-while circumventing the main drawbacks of Monte Carlo- viz., high variance and delayed updates. Given a parameterized policy πθ , the algorithm consists of three parts: estimating the expected discounted reward R θ and the expected discounted time T θ over a regenerative cycle; estimating the derivatives Δ θ R θ and Δ θ T θ ; and updating the policy parameters using stochastic approximation to find the roots of R θ Δ θ T θ - T θ Δ θ R θ . It is shown that under mild technical conditions, RMC converges to a locally optimal policy. It is also shown that RMC works for postdecision state models as well. An approximate version of RMC is proposed where a regenerative cycle is defined as successive visits to a prespecified “renewal set”. It is shown that if the value function of the system is locally Lipschitz on the renewal set, then RMC converges to an approximate locally optimal policy. Three numerical experiments are presented to illustrate RMC and compare it with other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms.},

It is proved that, in averaged sense, the design of periodic controller can be recast as designing a 2-DOF LTI controller for an equivalent LTI plant. The conditions for which this equivalent plant becomes minimum phase are also obtained. When this plant is minimum phase and has no more inputs than outputs, the synthesis of the above-mentioned LTI controller is carried out using an linear matrix inequality-based $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ /loop transfer recovery (LTR) approach to achieve linear quadratic regulator (LQR) loop behavior asymptotically. The design method being based on LTR, the reference-input-to-output transfer function of the averaged compensated system becomes same as that using LQR. The periodic controller is shown to exhibit negligible ripples in the plant output, but $O(1)$ ripples in control input. Suitable examples are considered to show the superiority of the proposed control.},

  abstract     = {A class of event-triggered stabilization technique works with a small-gain theorem, when the controlled system has a certain input-to-state stability (ISS) property from the measurement (sensor) disturbance to state. However, such an ISS property is not always achievable for nonlinear systems. In particular, early research suggests that global internal stabilizability does not imply global external stabilizability even for small sensor disturbances. This note proposes a new event-triggered stabilization technique that requires a milder condition that the controlled system has a certain ISS property from the input (actuator) disturbance to state. The technique is further applied to explicitly construct an event-triggered controller for the output regulation problem of a class of nonlinear systems. With the design, Zeno behavior is avoided.},

  abstract     = {In order to control a discrete-event system (DES), the supervisory controller observes event sequences. Observability, together with controllability, is required for obtaining the exact specification language via supervisory control. By extending observability, relative observability was recently investigated. In this article, relative network observability, which accommodates observation incompleteness and delay in relative observability, is defined. An algorithm is proposed to transform relative network observability to network observability. This leverages existing solutions to problems concerning network observability to solve problems concerning relative network observability. In particular, we propose techniques for checking relative network observability and calculating supremal controllable and relatively network observable sublanguage.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the formation problem for a group of mobile agents in a plane, in which the agents are required to maintain a distribution pattern, as well as to rotate around or remain static relative to a static/moving target. The prescribed distribution pattern is a class of general formations where the distances between neighboring agents or the distances between each agent and the target do not need to be equal. Each agent is modeled as a double integrator and can merely perceive the relative information of the target and its neighbors, and the acceleration of the target. In order to solve the formation problem, a limit-cycle-based controller design is delivered. We divide the overall control objective into two subobjectives, where the first is target circling that each agent keeps its own desired distance to the static/moving target as well as rotating around or remaining static relative to the target as expected, and the second is distribution adjustment that each agent maintains the desired distance to its neighbors. Then, we propose a controller comprised of two parts, where a limit cycle oscillator named a converging part is designed to deal with the first subobjective, while a layout part is introduced to address the second subobjective. One key merit of the controller is that it can be implemented by each agent in its local frame so that only local information is utilized without knowing global information. Theoretical analysis of the convergence to the desired formation, of which the agents are required to be evenly distributed on a circle around the target, is provided for the multiagent system under the proposed controller. Numerical simulations are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the cases of general formations, and to show that no collision between agents ever takes place throughout the system&#39;s evolution.},

In particular, the triggering mechanism is suitable for plants with no centralized sensory node as the triggering mechanism can be evaluated locally at each individual sensor. From a geometrical viewpoint, the mechanism is a sequence of hyperrectangles surrounding the optimal state trajectory such that robust recursive feasibility and robust stability are guaranteed. The design of the triggering mechanism is cast as a constrained parametric-in-set optimization problem with the volume of the set as the objective function. Reparameterized in terms of the set vertices, we show that the problem admits a finite tractable convex program reformulation and a linear program relaxation.

Our customized algorithms exploit problem structure and allow handling statistical modeling, as well as sensor and actuator selection, for substantially larger scales than what is amenable to current general-purpose solvers.

Lately, this mindset has become the driving force to design new optimization methods. Inspired by the recent dynamical system viewpoint of Nesterov&#39;s fast method, we propose two classes of fast methods, formulated as hybrid control systems, to obtain prespecified exponential convergence rate. Alternative to the existing fast methods, which are parametric-in-time second-order differential equations, we dynamically synthesize feedback controls in a state-dependent manner. Namely, in the first class, the damping term is viewed as the control input, while in the second class the amplitude with which the gradient of the objective function impacts the dynamics serves as the controller. The objective function requires to satisfy the so-called Polyak-Łojasiewicz inequality, which effectively implies no local optima and a certain gradient-domination property. Moreover, we establish that both hybrid structures possess Zeno-free solution trajectories. We finally provide a mechanism to determine the discretization step size to attain an exponential convergence rate.},

However, the heterogeneous HK model is difficult to analyze-even the most basic property of convergence is still open to prove. For the first time, this article takes into consideration heterogeneous HK models with environment or communication noise. Under environment noise, it has been revealed that the heterogeneous HK model with or without global information has a phase transition for the upper limit of the maximum opinion difference and has a critical noise amplitude depending on the minimal confidence threshold for quasi-synchronization. In addition, the convergence time to quasi-synchronization is bounded by a negative exponential distribution. The heterogeneous HK model with global information and communication noise is also analyzed. Finally, for the basic HK model with communication noise, we show that the heterogeneous case exhibits a different behavior regarding quasi-synchronization from the homogenous case. Interestingly, raising the confidence thresholds of constituent agents may break quasi-synchronization. Our results reveal that the heterogeneity of individuals is harmful to synchronization, which may be the reason why the synchronization of opinions is hard to reach in reality, even within that of a small group.},

Chain stability analysis tells us how vehicles under bilateral control will act in traffic when mixed with cars driven by human drivers. It shows that self-driving cars using bilateral control can reduce traffic flow instabilities in mixed traffic. Indeed, chains of BCM vehicles become perturbation-consuming dampers when inserted in traffic, since they split chains of human-driven vehicles and prevent perturbations from being transmitted from one chain of car-following cars to the next. Thus, today&#39;s traffic can be improved greatly by the insertion of BCM vehicles. The simulation results validate the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid systems subject to delayed jumps form a class of dynamical systems with broad applications. This article develops sufficient conditions for robust asymptotic stability of hybrid systems in the presence of delayed jumps. More precisely, given a delay-free hybrid system, we introduce a higher order delayed system parametrized by the length of delays. We show that when the delay parameter is set to zero, the higher order model captures the solutions of the delay-free system. Under mild conditions, it is shown that when the delay-free system has an asymptotically stable compact set, for small enough delays, solutions of the delayed system converge to a neighborhood of a set of interest related to the aforementioned compact set. Then, Lyapunov functions for the delay-free system are used to develop sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability in the presence of delays. Unlike prior work in the literature, the results pertaining to these notions of stability hold for systems possessing Zeno solutions, with time-varying delays. Importantly, the required conditions are expressed in finite-dimensional space, and depend primarily on the data of the delay-free system. The practical stability result is validated numerically through the hybrid system model of a controlled boost converter circuit with state-triggered switches and Zeno solutions. The higher order model and the derived Lyapunov conditions are utilized to obtain quantitative bounds on maximum allowable delays for switched systems and sampled-data control.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the problem of decentralized goal assignment and trajectory generation for multirobot networks when only local communication is available and proposes an approach based on methods related to switched systems and set invariance. A family of Lyapunov-like functions is employed to encode the (local) decision making among candidate goal assignments, under which a group of connected agents chooses the assignment that results in the shortest total distance to the goals. An additional family of Lyapunov-like barrier functions is activated in the case when the optimal assignment may lead to colliding trajectories, maintaining thus system safety while preserving the convergence guarantees. The proposed switching strategies give rise to feedback control policies that are computationally efficient and scalable with the number of agents and, therefore, suitable for applications, including first-response deployment of robotic networks under limited information sharing. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated via simulation results and experiments with six ground robots.},

Edit functions alter the output of the system by erasing or inserting events in order to obfuscate the outside intruder, whose goal is to infer the secrets of the system from its observation. We synthesize edit functions to solve the opacity enforcement problem in a modular setting, which significantly reduces the computational complexity compared with the monolithic approach. Two abstraction methods called opaque observation equivalence and opaque bisimulation are first employed to abstract the individual components of the modular system and their observers. Subsequently, we propose a method to transform the synthesis of edit functions to the calculation of modular supremal nonblocking supervisors. We show that the edit functions synthesized in this manner correctly solve the opacity enforcement problem.},

Both dynamic state and output feedback control strategies are studied. Recognizing the difficulty of controlling time-delay systems via static feedback, we develop a systematic method, by taking advantage of dynamic feedback, for the design of delay-free, dynamic state and output feedback compensators that achieve global state regulation with stability. The controlled plants under consideration not only cover time-delay nonlinear systems in the normal form, but also include a class of time-delay cascade systems beyond the normal form. In the case of state feedback, the zero dynamics are not required to be “minimum phase” but satisfy certain regularity conditions. In the output feedback case, appropriate conditions are characterized for the zero dynamics so that the existence of a dynamic output controller is ensured. A key feature of the proposed control strategies is the utilization of dynamic gains to counteract the effect of time-delay nonlinearities and unstable zero dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We consider a class of dynamic collective choice models with social interactions, whereby a large number of nonuniform agents have to individually settle on one of multiple discrete alternative choices, with the relevance of their would-be choices continuously impacted by noise and the unfolding group behavior. This class of problems is modeled here as a so-called min-LQG game, i.e., a linear quadratic Gaussian dynamic and noncooperative game, with an additional combinatorial aspect in that it includes a final choice-related minimization in its terminal cost. The presence of this minimization term is key to enforcing some specific discrete choice by each individual agent. The theory of mean field games is invoked to generate a class of decentralized agent feedback control strategies, which are then shown to converge to an exact Nash equilibrium of the game as the number of players increases to infinity. A key building block in our approach is an explicit solution to the problem of computing the best response of a generic agent to some arbitrarily posited smooth mean field trajectory. Ultimately, an agent is shown to face a continuously revised discrete choice problem, where greedy choices dictated by current conditions must be constantly balanced against the risk of the future process noise upsetting the wisdom of such decisions. We show that any Nash equilibrium of the game is defined by an a priori computable probability matrix, which describes the distribution of the players&#39; choices over the alternatives. The results are illustrated through simulations.},

Theoretical tools, which require computing the extended generator and deriving Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation for Markov jump DAEs, are developed. These fundamental results lead to pure feedback optimal strategies to compute the Nash equilibrium in noncooperative setting. In case of quadratic cost and linear dynamics, these strategies are obtained by solving coupled Riccati-like differential equations. Under an appropriate stabilizability assumption on system dynamics, these differential equations reduce to coupled algebraic Riccati equations when the cost functionals are considered over infinite horizon. As a first case-study, the application of our results is studied in the context of an economic system where different suppliers aim to maximize their profits subject to the market demands and fluctuations in operating conditions. The second case-study refers to the conventional problem of robust control for randomly switching linear DAEs, which can be formulated as a two-player zero sum game and is solved using the results developed in this article.},

  abstract     = {Accurately estimating the parameters of a gray-box linear time-invariant state-space representation is still a challenging problem especially if the number of unknowns exceeds ten. The standard nonlinear optimization-based procedures often fail because the initial guesses are not in the domain of attraction of the user-defined cost function global minimum. Herein, a new solution is developed to give access to estimated parameters which are accurate estimates of the unknown parameters directly or, at worst, good initial guesses for any standard nonlinear optimization-based method. By assuming that 1) the gray-box model to identify is minimal and structurally identifiable, 2) the parameter dependency is affine, and 3) the available datasets have been transformed into a reliable and accurate black-box state-space model, our procedure consists in determining the unique similarity transformation between the black-box and gray-box representations of the system to identify. More specifically, we introduce a technique which first extracts a system of equations linear in terms of the similarity transformation; second, it solves this system by using standard linear algebra tools; finally, completes this two-step procedure by a numerical optimization solution (dedicated now to a very small number of unknowns) if the second step does not give access to all the similarity transformation parameters effectively. In this contribution, we first describe our new procedure, prove its capabilities of giving accurate estimates under specific practical constraints, and finally demonstrates its effectiveness with simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are an important class of control problems that are ubiquitous in a wide range of fields. Unfortunately, these problems are generally intractable, so, in general, we must be satisfied with suboptimal policies. But how do we evaluate the quality of these policies? This question has been addressed in recent years in the Markov decision process (MDP) literature through the use of information-relaxation-based duality, where the nonanticipativity constraints are relaxed, but a penalty is imposed for violations of these constraints. In this paper, we extend the information relaxation approach to POMDPs. It is of course well known that the belief-state formulation of a POMDP is an MDP, and therefore, the previously developed results for MDPs also apply to POMDPs. Under the belief-state formulation, we use recently developed change-of-measure arguments to solve the so-called inner problems, and we use standard filtering arguments to identify the appropriate Radon-Nikodym derivatives. We also show, however, that dual bounds can also be constructed without resorting to the belief-state formulation. In this case, change-of-measure arguments are required for the evaluation of the so-called dual feasible penalties rather than for the solution of the inner problems. We compare dual bounds for both formulations and argue that, in general, the belief-state formulation provides tighter bounds. The second main contribution of this paper is to show that several value function approximations for POMDPs are in fact supersolutions. This is of interest because it can be particularly advantageous to construct penalties from supersolutions, since absolute continuity (of the change of measure) is no longer required, and therefore, significant variance reduction can be achieved when estimating the duality gap directly. Dual bounds constructed from supersolution-based penalties are also guaranteed to provide tighter bounds than the bounds provided by the supersolutions themselves. We use applications from robotic navigation and telecommunication to demonstrate our results.},

The constructive design of the optimal solution revolves around the interesting fact that the property of optimality of the closed-loop underlying system is shown to be locally equivalent to the property that an input-affine system possesses an L 2 -gain less than one from a virtual disturbance signal. The global version of the statement requires a technical condition on the graph of the storage function of the latter auxiliary plant, and hence leads to the new notion of graphical storage function.

Using the all-pass factorization, necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of a solution of an equation with RMs where the unknown RM has its poles in the left closed complex half plane and it can be improper are presented, as well as all solutions. As an application of the latter result, the notion of almost disturbance decoupling, i.e., when the infimum of the H ∞ norm of the transfer matrix from the disturbance input to the controlled output over the stabilizing controllers is zero, is generalized. The generalization is such that instead of the whole frequency axis, the frequency axis with excluded intervals of small lengths, is considered. The controller consists of output feedback plus disturbance feedforward designed independently. A necessary and sufficient solvability condition is presented, which is expressed in terms of the given data. The three main results are illustrated by an example.},

The spectral structure of quantum linear systems is explored, which indicates that a quantum linear system is both controllable and observable provided that it is Hurwitz stable. A new parameterization method for quantum linear systems is proposed. This parameterization is designed for the Kalman canonical form directly. Consequently, the parameters involved are in a blockwise form in correspondence with the blockwise structure of the Kalman canonical form. This parameter structure can be used to simplify various quantum control design problems. For example, necessary and sufficient conditions for the realization of quantum back-action evading (BAE) measurements are given in terms of these new parameters. Due to their blockwise nature, a small number of parameters are required for realizing quantum BAE measurements.},

  abstract     = {This article considers a nonlinear filtering method for handling outliers. The presence of outliers that are gross observation errors can greatly reduce the accuracy of filtering methods that assume Gaussian distributed errors. There are some existing methods that assume a Gaussian observation error, and estimate the error covariance matrix at each time step to avoid overfitting to the outliers. However, the estimates of the covariance matrix under such methods can become unstable. This results in underfitting or overfitting to observations when filtering. This paper presents a new method for handling outliers in nonlinear filtering problems by extending the unscented Kalman filter. In this method, two Gaussian observation error models with distinct covariance matrices are used: one for observations with regular errors, and another with a larger variance specified by a scale parameter for outliers. In addition to the system state, this method estimates an indicator variable that switches between the two models and the scale parameter for outliers. With the inclusion of the indicator variable and scale parameter, the estimated error covariance matrix can handle both regular observations and outliers appropriately at each time step. Furthermore, by estimating the scale parameter, the proposed method can be applied to a dataset without additional tuning to account for outlier characteristics. Through numerical experiments, we find that our method can estimate the system state better than existing methods for both datasets with and without outliers.},

The state feedback controller design for this system is based on a Fredholm backstepping transformation mapping the closed-loop system into a stable PDE-PDE-PDE target system. With this, a minimum control time is achieved for the hyperbolic subsystem in the target dynamics. Then, this approach is extended to the design of a state observer for delayed measurements to obtain an observer-based output feedback controller. Exponential stability of the resulting closed-loop system is verified. Furthermore, it is shown that the Fredholm and backstepping transformations related to the hyperbolic subsystems are attainable in closed form.

Different from existing work, which limits at most once switching during an interevent interval, we adopt the average dwell time approach without limiting the minimum dwell time of each subsystem, and thus frequent switching is allowed to happen in an interevent interval. Since the difficulty in acquiring the full information of system states, the dynamic output feedback controller is taken into account to stabilize the switched system. By employing a controller-mode-dependent Lyapunov functional, stability criterion is proposed for the resulting closed-loop system, based on which the dynamic output feedback controller together with the mode-dependent event-triggered mechanism is codesigned. Besides, the existence of the lower bound on interevent intervals is attentively discussed, which gets rid of the Zeno behavior. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This note introduces a new concept of cooperative and adversarial multigroup system, which consists of cooperative leaders and followers, as well as adversaries. For example, cooperation of multiple military vehicles operate in complex dynamic networked environments with unknown enemies and hidden malicious attackers. The lack of global situational awareness in distributed settings makes autonomous vehicles prone to cyberattacks and infiltration. Each agent is unaware of the motives of its neighbors and may receive information/data from both the teammates and the adversaries. Secure and resilient control protocols are essential for the networked multigroup systems to prevent the adversaries&#39; attacks from propagating across the network, which may influence the system performance and even overall stability. To counter sensor faults and attacks from the adversaries, a distributed resilient control architecture is proposed, which guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical system. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

Using this, and by incorporating a continuous-time version of the so-called push-sum algorithm, we relax the graph-theoretic conditions under which the first component of the trajectories of this modified class of saddle-point dynamical systems is asymptotically convergent to the set of optimizers. In particular, we prove that strong connectivity is sufficient under this modified dynamics, relaxing the known weight-balanced assumption. As a by product, we also show that the saddle-point distributed optimization dynamics can be extended to time-varying weight-balanced graphs, which satisfy a persistency condition on the minimum-cut, of the sequence of Laplacian matrices.},

It is shown that the stochastic system is 2pth-moment exponentially stable if and only if the SDE is mean-square exponentially stable or the ODE is exponentially stable. Subsequently, combining the quasi-periodic homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov function methods with the proposed techniques, a series of nonconservative stability criteria are established for linear impulsive, sampled-data, and switched stochastic systems under dwell-time constraints.

To determine the state feedback controller, the kernel equations are derived, which results in a set of coupled PDEs for a time dependent and spatially varying kernel. For this, the method of successive approximations is extended from the time-invariant case to the present problem.

In contrast to preceding results, this article allows stochastic noise to be active globally in the state space. Deriving pathwise bounds of stochastic processes is the original key idea and it leads to new techniques to unify Lyapunov-type characterization of iISS with that of input-to-state stability (ISS). The ISS test becomes a special case of the iISS test completely, which forms a stochastic counterpart of the popular iISS/ISS framework for deterministic nonlinear systems analysis and design. The usefulness of the developed iISS/ISS characterizations is substantiated by utilizing them to consolidate stochastic versions of small-gain criteria to establish stability of interconnected systems without restricting noise effects to bounded domains. The framework of integral noise-to-state stability is also made useful by allowing the global stochastic noise.},

  abstract     = {The issue of synchronization in the power grid is receiving renewed attention, as new energy sources with different dynamics enter the picture. Global metrics have been proposed to evaluate performance and calculated under highly simplified assumptions. In this article, we extend this approach to more realistic network scenarios and more closely connect it with metrics used in power engineering practice. In particular, our analysis covers networks with generators of heterogeneous ratings and richer dynamic models of machines. Under a suitable proportionality assumption in the parameters, we show that the step response of bus frequencies can be decomposed in two components. The first component is a system-wide frequency that captures the aggregate grid behavior, and the residual component represents the individual bus frequency deviations from the aggregate. Using this decomposition, we define-and compute in closed form-several metrics that capture dynamic behaviors that are of relevance for power engineers. In particular, using the system frequency, we define industry-style metrics (Nadir, RoCoF) that are evaluated through a representative machine. We further use the norm of the residual component to define a synchronization cost that can appropriately quantify interarea oscillations. Finally, we employ robustness analysis tools to evaluate deviations from our proportionality assumption. We show that the system frequency still captures the grid steady-state deviation, and becomes an accurate reduced-order model of the grid as the network connectivity grows. Simulation studies with practically relevant data are included to validate the theory and further illustrate the impact of network structure and parameters on synchronization. Our analysis gives conclusions of practical interest, sometimes challenging the conventional wisdom in the field.},

That is, given an observer designed with a specific stability property in the absence of communication constraints, we implement it over a network, and we provide sufficient conditions on the latter to preserve the stability property of the observer. In particular, we provide a bound on the maximum allowable transmission interval (MATI) that guarantees an input-to-state stability (ISS) property for the corresponding estimation error system. The stability analysis is trajectory-based, utilizes small-gain arguments, and exploits a persistently exciting property of the scheduling protocols. This property is key in our analysis and allows us to obtain significantly larger MATI bounds in comparison to the ones found in the literature. Our results hold for a general class of NCSs; however, we show that these results are also applicable to NCSs implemented over a specific physical network called WirelessHART (WH). The latter is mainly characterized by its multihop structure, slotted communication cycles, and the possibility to simultaneously transmit over different frequencies. We show that our results can be further improved by taking into account the intrinsic structure of the WH-NCS model. That is, we explicitly exploit the model structure in our analysis to obtain an even tighter MATI bound that guarantees the same ISS property for the estimation error system. Finally, to illustrate our results, we present analysis and numerical simulations for a class of Lipschitz nonlinear systems and high-gain observers.},

By the second law of thermodynamics, the minimum amount of work needed for the transition from one equilibrium state to another is the difference between the Helmholtz free energy of the two states and can only be achieved by a reversible (infinitely slow) process. The minimal gap between the work needed in a finite-time transition and the work during a reversible one, turns out to equal the square of the optimal mass transport (Wasserstein-2) distance between the two end-point distributions times the inverse of the duration needed for the transition. This result, in fact, relates nonequilibrium optimal control strategies (protocols) to gradient flows of entropy functionals via the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto scheme. The purpose of this paper is to introduce ideas and results from the emerging field of stochastic thermodynamics in the setting of the classical regulator theory, and to draw connections and derive such fundamental relations from a control perspective in a multivariable setting.},

It is then natural to ask whether the existence of multiple Lyapunov densities for a nonlinear switched system implies almost global stability, in the same way as the existence of multiple Lyapunov functions implies global stability for nonlinear switched systems. In this paper, the answer to this question is shown to be affirmative as long as switchings satisfy a dwell time constraint with an arbitrarily small dwell time. Specifically, as the main result, we show that a nonlinear switched system with a minimum dwell time is almost globally stable if there exist multiple Lyapunov densities that satisfy some compatibility conditions depending on the value of the minimum dwell time. This result can also be used to obtain a minimum dwell time estimate to ensure almost global stability of a nonlinear switched systems. In particular, the existence of a common Lyapunov density implies almost global stability for any arbitrary small minimum dwell time. The results obtained for continuous-time switched systems are based on some sufficient conditions for the almost global stability of discrete-time nonautonomous systems. These conditions are obtained using the duality between Frobenius-Perron operator and Koopman operator.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing prevalence of variable-supply electricity production, dynamic market structures, including time-varying prices and/or peak demand charges are becoming more common for electricity consumers. This framework requires consumers to consider both the time-varying amount of electricity (i.e., energy) consumed throughout the day as well as the maximum rate of electricity purchase (i.e., power) over a given period, typically a month. Because of this complexity, online optimization techniques such as economic model predictive control (MPC) are a natural tool for consumers to use to minimize cost. However, while closed-loop optimization of these pricing structures is already being proposed for various applications, little has been established about stability or performance properties of the closed-loop system. Due in particular to the peak penalty (which violates the principle of optimality if naively included in the objective function), this theoretical gap leaves the potential for pathological closed-loop behavior despite high-quality open-loop solutions. In this paper, we derive asymptotic performance and stability results for general time-varying economic MPC. We then present a novel extended-state formulation to convert peak demand charges into a time-varying stage cost that can be optimized using economic MPC. In addition, we give a terminal cost and constraint for the augmented system that avoids reducing the feasible set in the original space. Finally, we demonstrate these structures and the closed-loop properties that they satisfy via two illustrative examples.},

Finding the explicit solution to the backstepping kernels, we derive an explicit sufficient condition depending on the plant coefficients. This stability condition is compared to an existing stability result based on a Lyapunov analysis. Both the proposed and existing sufficient conditions are then contrasted in some examples to a (computationally expensive) numerical approximation of a necessary and sufficient condition for exponential stability to illustrate their conservatism.},

Centralized control is implemented in each group while distributed control is implemented at the coordination level of the groups. Besides restoring nominal frequency with a minimal control cost, MLPIAC can improve the transient performance of the system through an accelerated convergence of the control inputs without oscillations. At the coordination level of the control groups, because the number of the groups is smaller than that of nodes, MLPIAC is more effective to obtain the minimized control cost than the purely distributed control law. At the level of the control in each group, because the number of nodes is much smaller than the total number of nodes in the whole network, the overheads in the communications and the computations are reduced compared to the pure centralized control. The asymptotic stability of MLPIAC is proven using the Lyapunov method and the performance is evaluated through simulations.},

It has been proved that this is possible if the drift and diffusion coefficients of the given hybrid SDE satisfy the linear growth condition. However, many hybrid SDEs in the real world do not satisfy this condition (namely, they are highly nonlinear) and there is no answer to the question, yet if the given SDE is highly nonlinear. The aim of this paper is to tackle the stabilization problem for a class of highly nonlinear hybrid SDEs. Under some reasonable conditions on the drift and diffusion coefficients, we show how to design the feedback control function and give an explicit bound on τ (the time duration between two consecutive state observations), whence the new theory established in this paper is implementable.},

  abstract     = {Open, irreversible, dynamically routed, zone-controlled guidepath-based transport systems model the operation of many automated unit-load material handling systems that are used in various production and distribution facilities. An important requirement for these systems is to preserve the system liveness-i.e., the ability of each system agent to reach any location of the underlying guidepath network-by blocking those traffic states that will result in deadlock and/or livelock. The remaining set of traffic states are characterized as “live.” The worst-case computational complexity of the decision problem of assessing the state liveness in the considered class of transport systems is an open issue. As a first contribution of this paper, we identify an extensive subclass of these traffic states, defined through the topology of an abstracting graphical representation of the “traffic state” concept, for which the corresponding problem of liveness assessment admits a polynomial solution, and we present the relevant algorithm for this assessment. But the development of the aforementioned results has also led to a new methodological framework for representing and analyzing the qualitative dynamics of the considered transport systems with respect to the reachability and the liveness problems that are the focus of this paper. This framework can enable an effective and efficient (but maybe not polynomial-complexity) resolution of the state liveness even for those traffic states that do not belong in the primary state class that is considered in this paper; we highlight this additional possibility in the closing part of this paper.},

The extension is achieved by using a novel batch least-squares identifier (BaLSI), which is activated at the time of the events. BaLSI guarantees the finite-time asymptotic constancy of the parameter estimates and the fact that the trajectories of the closed-loop system follow the trajectories of the nominal closed-loop system (nominal in the sense of the asymptotic parameter estimate, not in the sense of the true unknown parameter). Thus, if the nominal feedback guarantees global asymptotic stability and local exponential stability, then unlike conventional adaptive control, the newly proposed event-triggered adaptive scheme guarantees global asymptotic regulation with a uniform exponential convergence rate. The developed adaptive scheme is tested to a well known control problem-the state regulation of the wing-rock model. Comparisons with other adaptive schemes are also provided for this particular problem.},

Stochastic semistability is the property whereby the solutions of a stochastic dynamical system almost surely converge to Lyapunov stable in probability equilibrium points determined by the system initial conditions. In this article, we extend the theories of semistability and finite-time semistability for deterministic dynamical systems to develop a rigorous framework for stochastic semistability and stochastic finite-time semistability. Specifically, Lyapunov and converse Lyapunov theorems for stochastic semistability are developed for dynamical systems driven by Markov diffusion processes. These results are then used to develop a general framework for designing semistable consensus protocols for dynamical networks in the face of stochastic communication uncertainty for achieving multiagent coordination tasks in finite time. The proposed controller architectures involve the exchange of generalized charge or energy state information between agents guaranteeing that the closed-loop dynamical network is stochastically semistable to an equipartitioned equilibrium representing a state of almost sure consensus consistent with basic thermodynamic principles.},

This paper considers the case of nested information in repeated zero-sum games and studies the computation of strategies for both the informed and uninformed players for finite-horizon and discounted infinite-horizon nested information games. For finite-horizon settings, we exploit that for both players, the security strategy, and also the opponent&#39;s corresponding best response, depend only on the informed player&#39;s history of actions. Using this property, we formulate an linear program (LP) computation of player strategies that is linear in the size of the uninformed player&#39;s action set. For the infinite-horizon discounted game, we construct LP formulations to compute the approximated security strategies for both players, and show that the worst-case performance difference between the approximated security strategies and the security strategies converges to zero exponentially. Finally, we illustrate the results on a network interdiction game between an informed system administrator and an uniformed intruder.},

Most of the existing work in this area focuses on developing distributed algorithms in a synchronous setting under the presence of a central clock, where the agents need to wait for the slowest one to finish the update, before proceeding to the next iterate. Asynchronous distributed algorithms remove the need for a central coordinator, reduce the synchronization wait, and allow some agents to compute faster and execute more iterations. In the asynchronous setting, the only known algorithms for solving this problem could achieve an either linear or sublinear rate of convergence. In this paper, we build upon the existing literature to develop and analyze an asynchronous Newton-based method to solve a penalized version of the problem. We show that this algorithm guarantees almost sure convergence with a global linear and local quadratic rate in expectation. Numerical studies confirm the superior performance of our algorithm against other asynchronous methods.},

  abstract     = {Modern applications of robotics typically involve a robot control system with an inner proportional-integral (PI) or proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control loop and an outer user-specified control loop for specifying the velocity (or position) command. Most existing outer loop controllers, however, do not take into consideration the dynamic effects of robots and their effectiveness relies on the ad hoc assumption that the inner PI or PID control loop is fast enough, and other torque-based controllers cannot be implemented in robots with closed architecture. This paper investigates the adaptive control of robotic systems with an inner/outer loop structure, taking into account the effects of the dynamics and uncertainties, and both the task-space control and joint-space control are considered. We propose a dynamic modularity approach to resolve this issue, and a class of adaptive outer loop control schemes is proposed and their role is to dynamically generate the joint velocity (or position) command for the low-level joint servoing loop. Without relying on the ad hoc assumption that the joint servoing loop is fast enough or modification of the low-level joint controller structure, we show that the proposed outer loop controllers can ensure stability and convergence of the closed-loop system. The formulated dynamic modularity approach is validated by the experimental results using different generations of the UR10 robots.},

It gives a general presentation and a new formulation for the design of the observers considered by Darouach in 2000. By introducing the controllability and stabilizability notions, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these observers are revised and proved, and they complete those presented in the article by Darouach. We show that these concepts are important in the proof of the necessity condition for the existence of these observers. We also present a functional observer design algorithm for the general case. The parametrization of all functional observers is also given. Both continuous and discrete time cases are considered. Two numerical examples are given; the first one shows how the results in this article can be applied to design the observer, whereas the results in the article by Darouach cannot be used directly to design the observer. It concerns an unstabilizable system. The second example concerns an autonomous system.},

We give necessary and sufficient controllability conditions for the global system, with respect to the controllability of the nodes and to the properties of the network graph. The conditions are expressed in terms of an auxiliary graph that has the same size as the network graph, but takes into account important features of the node graphs. Besides its interest in terms of insight in the controllability of networks with dynamical nodes, this approach is also much more efficient computationally than a direct checking of the controllability of the global system.},

In the proof, we exploit an important property that Dreyfus&#39;s formulation readily adapts to an efficient second-order backpropagation that evaluates the Hessian matrix (as well as the gradient vector) in a stagewise fashion. After the proof, we also discuss the issues of practical Newton methods for solving a linear-quadratic problem with a globalization strategy.},

Recent work on this problem uses gradient tracking to achieve linear convergence to the exact global minimizer. However, a connection among different approaches has been unclear. In this paper, we first show that many of the existing first-order algorithms are related with a simple state transformation, at the heart of which lies a recently introduced algorithm known as AB. We then present distributed heavy-ball, denoted as ABm, that combines AB with a momentum term and uses nonidentical local step-sizes. By simultaneously implementing both rowand column-stochastic weights, ABm removes the conservatism in the related work due to doubly stochastic weights or eigenvector estimation. ABm thus naturally leads to optimization and average consensus over both undirected and directed graphs. We show that ABm has a global R-linear rate when the largest step-size and momentum parameter are positive and sufficiently small. We numerically show that ABm achieves acceleration, particularly when the objective functions are ill-conditioned.},

It is well known that for a linear hyperbolic system, a stabilizing output feedback control may become unstable when the observation has a time delay. For the fixed time delay in observation, the problem for one-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) has been solved by the observer-based feedback in the time interval where the observation is available and the predictor where the observation is not available. However, the generalization to multidimensional PDE systems has been a long-standing unsolved problem. In this paper, we investigate the problem from operator point of view for abstract first-order equation setting of infinite-dimensional systems. We formulate the problem in the framework of the well-posed and regular linear systems and solve it in the operator form. The result is then applied to the stabilization of a multidimensional Schrödinger equation.},

The key idea is to identify the linear (infinite dimensional) Koopman operator in the lifted space of observables, instead of identifying the nonlinear system in the state space, a process which results in a linear method for nonlinear systems identification. The proposed lifting technique is an indirect method that does not require to compute time derivatives and is therefore well-suited to low-sampling rate data sets. Considering different finite-dimensional subspaces to approximate and identify the Koopman operator, we propose two numerical schemes: a main method and a dual method. The main method is a parametric identification technique that can accurately reconstruct the vector field of a broad class of systems. The dual method provides estimates of the vector field at the data points and is well-suited to identify high-dimensional systems with small datasets. This paper describes the two methods, provides theoretical convergence results, and illustrates the lifting techniques with several examples.},

When the underlying digraph is strongly connected, the periodic orbits of the associated CBN have been completely understood, one-to-one corresponding to binary necklaces of a certain length given by the loop number of the graph. We characterize in the paper the periodic orbits of CBNs over arbitrary weakly connected digraphs. We establish, among other things, a new method to investigate their asymptotic behavior. Specifically, we introduce a graphical approach, termed system reduction, which turns the underlying digraph into a special weakly connected digraph, whose strongly connected components are all cycles. We show that the reduced system uniquely determines the asymptotic behavior of the original system. Moreover, we provide a constructive method for computing the periodic orbit of the reduced system, which the system will enter for a given, but arbitrary initial condition.},

A significant modeling and analysis challenge posed by both, artificial and natural systems, is the existence of uncertain parameters. Flexible Nets (FNs) is a novel modeling formalism, inspired by Petri nets, that can handle different types of uncertain parameters in a natural way. This paper develops an efficient method to analyse the evolution of a system modeled by an FN in the long run. More precisely, the method focuses on the computation of steady state bounds for an objective function of interest. The method makes use of a set of constraints, expressed as linear inequalities, that the state variables must satisfy in the steady state. In order to account for systems that do not reach a constant steady state, the developed constraints allow the system state to switch among different values, i.e., the steady state variables are not forced to be constant.},

Specifically, each node of a strongly connected digraph does not wait for updates from other nodes but simply starts a new update within any bounded time interval by using local information available from its in-neighbors. “Exact” means that every node of the AsySPA can asymptotically converge to the same optimal solution, even under different update rates among nodes and bounded communication delays. To address uneven update rates, we design a simple mechanism to adaptively adjust stepsizes per update in each node, which is substantially different from the existing works. Then, we construct a delay-free augmented system to address asynchrony and delays, and study its convergence by proposing a generalized subgradient algorithm, which clearly has its own significance and helps us to explicitly evaluate the convergence rate of the AsySPA. Finally, we demonstrate advantages of the AsySPA in both theory and simulation.},

The criteria considered are (i) a strong and (ii) a weak form of almost sure stability of the estimation error as well as (ii) asymptotic quadratic stability in expectation. For all three objectives, we derive lower bounds on the smallest channel capacity C 0 above which the objective can be achieved with an arbitrarily small error. We first obtain bounds through a dynamical systems approach by constructing an infinite-dimensional dynamical system and relating the capacity with the topological and the metric entropy of this system. We also consider information-theoretic and probability-theoretic approaches to address the different criteria. Finally, we prove that a memoryless noisy channel in general constitutes no obstruction to asymptotic almost sure state estimation with arbitrarily small errors, when there is no noise in the system. The results provide new solution methods for the criteria introduced (e.g., standard information-theoretic bounds cannot be applied for some of the criteria) and establish further connections between dynamical systems, networked control, and information theory, especially in the context of nonlinear stochastic systems.},

In the latter case, these are the first second-order algorithms to incorporate DPs. We show that the gradient and/or Hessian estimates in the resulting algorithms with DPs are asymptotically unbiased, so that the algorithms are provably convergent. Furthermore, we derive convergence rates to establish the superiority of the first-order and second-order algorithms, for the special case of a convex and quadratic optimization problem, respectively. Numerical experiments are used to validate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Prior work on automatic control synthesis for cyber-physical systems under logical constraints has primarily focused on environmental disturbances or modeling uncertainties, however, the impact of deliberate and malicious attacks has been less studied. In this paper, we consider a discrete-time dynamical system with a linear temporal logic (LTL) constraint in the presence of an adversary, which is modeled as a stochastic game. We assume that the adversary observes the control policy before choosing an attack strategy. We investigate two problems. In the first problem, we synthesize a robust control policy for the stochastic game that maximizes the probability of satisfying the LTL constraint. A value iteration based algorithm is proposed to compute the optimal control policy. In the second problem, we focus on a subclass of LTL constraints, which consist of an arbitrary LTL formula and an invariant constraint. We then investigate the problem of computing a control policy that minimizes the expected number of invariant constraint violations while maximizing the probability of satisfying the arbitrary LTL constraint. We characterize the optimality condition for the desired control policy. A policy iteration based algorithm is proposed to compute the control policy. We illustrate the proposed approaches using two numerical case studies.},

Two main difficulties are addressed. First, we tackle the presence of Euler singularities by introducing a representation of the configuration manifold in appropriate local charts. In these local coordinates, not only the problem is free from Euler singularities but also it can be recast as an optimal control problem with only pure control constraints. The second issue concerns the initialization of the shooting method. We introduce a strategy that combines indirect methods with homotopies, thus providing high accuracy. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach by numerical simulations on missile interception problems under challenging scenarios.},

  abstract     = {We consider discrete-time dynamics for cascading failure in DC networks whose map is a composition of failure rule with control actions. Supply-demand at the nodes is monotonically nonincreasing under admissible control. Under the failure rule, a link is removed permanently if its flow exceeds capacity. We consider finite horizon optimal control to steer the network from an arbitrary initial state, defined in terms of active link set and supply-demand at the nodes, to a feasible state, i.e., a state which is invariant under the failure rule. There is no running cost and the reward associated with a feasible terminal state is the associated cumulative supply-demand. We propose two approaches for computing optimal control. The first approach, geared toward tree reducible networks, decomposes the global problem into a system of coupled local problems, which can be solved to optimality in two iterations. When restricted to the class of one-shot control actions, the optimal solutions to the local problems possess a piecewise affine property, which facilitates analytical solutions. The second approach computes optimal control by searching over the reachable set, which is shown to admit an equivalent finite representation by aggregation of control actions leading to the same reachable active link set. An algorithmic procedure to construct this representation is provided by leveraging and extending tools for arrangement of hyperplanes and polytopes. Illustrative simulations, including showing the effectiveness of projection-based approximation algorithms, are also presented.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses robustness to external disturbances of switched discrete and continuous systems with multiple equilibria. First, we prove that if each subsystem of the switched system is input-to-state stable (ISS), then under switching signals that satisfy an average dwell-time bound, the solutions are ultimately bounded within a compact set. The size of this set varies monotonically with the supremum norm of the disturbance signal. These results generalize existing ones in the common equilibrium case to accommodate multiple equilibria. Then, we relax the (global) ISS conditions to consider equilibria that are locally exponentially stable (LES), and we establish practical stability for such switched systems under disturbances. Our motivation for studying this class of switched systems arises from certain motion planning problems in robotics, where primitive movements, each corresponding to an equilibrium point of a dynamical system, must be composed to obtain more complex motions. As a concrete example, we consider the problem of realizing safe adaptive locomotion of a three-dimensional biped under persistent external force by switching among motion primitives characterized by LES limit cycles. The results of this paper, however, are relevant to a much broader class of applications, in which composition of different modes of behavior is required.},

In the linear case, the Kalman filter seamlessly handles such constraints, which result in the state being in an affine subspace. Yet, in the nonlinear case, the EKF poorly handles such type of constraints. As a remedy, we propose a novel general methodology of EKF based on an (arbitrary) nonlinear error e. And we prove that under compatibility of the error e with the constraints, the EKF based on e seamlessly handles the constraints. Furthermore, when the state space is a Lie group, we prove the EKF based on invariant errors is exactly the invariant EKF (IEKF), and we prove further properties. The theory is applied to the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping, where the IEKF is shown to perfectly handle some partial deterministic information about the map. As a byproduct, the theory is also shown to readily allow devising EKFs on state spaces defined by a class of equality constraints.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the robust optimal filtering design over unreliable networks, where the data packet dropouts occur during the signal transmission from the sensor side to the filter. The designed filter is expected, under communication data loss, to provide a guaranteed robustness against disturbance/model uncertainty while achieving the minimized variance of the estimation error under Gaussian white noises and the worst case of the disturbance. The Nash game approach is adopted to deal with such a multiobjective filtering problem. Based on the concept of the mean-square stability, Nash equilibrium strategies are analytically applied in terms of two cross-coupled modified algebraic Riccati equations. The presented design method provides a systematic way to achieve a tradeoff of the estimation performance in the H 2 and H ∞ senses in the presence of data loss.},

Reversibility of the chain is not imposed, so the system cannot be recast as standard Markov jump linear systems (MJLS), demanding for a specific study. We develop the operator-based approach, which is elaborate in view of possible multiplicity of solutions for the second moment variable, as detailed in this note. We also study the optimal quadratic control problem based on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and standard dynamic programming. The control solution is given in terms of a coupled Riccati equation that is harmonious with filtering of MJLS, which allows us to generalize the classic control-filtering duality for linear time varying systems.},

Under a mild assumption on initial states of the agents, we design control laws by exploiting the concept of barrier Lyapunov function in conjunction with bounded phase potential functions. We show that the agents asymptotically stabilize to a desired phase arrangement and their trajectories remain bounded during stabilization. We obtain bounds on the different quantities of interest in the postdesign analysis and show that these bounds depend on the initial conditions and can be altered by adjusting the controller gains.

We analyze the convergence properties of the dynamic ADMM and show that, under several standard technical assumptions, the iterations of the dynamic ADMM converge linearly to some neighborhoods of the time-varying optimal points. The sizes of these neighborhoods depend on the drifts of the dynamic objective functions: the more drastically the dynamic objective function evolves across time, the larger the sizes of these neighborhoods. We also upper bound the limiting optimality gaps of the dynamic ADMM explicitly, and analyze its regret and constraint violation.

This problem is solved for a general setup, where polynomial and trigonometric reference inputs and disturbances are taken into account by employing a nondiagonalizable signal model. The regulator design is based on the internal model principle, which amounts to stabilize an ODE-PDE cascade, which consists of a finite-dimensional internal model driven by coupled parabolic PIDEs. For this, a systematic backstepping approach is developed and it is shown that the stabilizability depends on the plant transfer behavior. A simple proof of robust output regulation is given, which does not rely on solving the extended regulator equations. The results of the paper are illustrated by means of an unstable parabolic system described by three coupled parabolic PIDEs with two outputs. The robustness of the proposed state feedback regulator is verified by comparing it with a nonrobust feedforward regulator.},

A new feature is that a quasi-linear inherent nonsmooth control law could be constructed straightforwardly from the system information, which is essentially detached from the determination of a series of virtual controllers. Moreover, by proposing a less ambitious semiglobal tracking control objective, the synthesis procedure can be achieved without restrictive nonlinear growth constraints.

Second, the asynchronous filter is synthesized for MJSs with certain transition probability. Moreover, one so-called homogeneous polynomial method is developed to design the asynchronous filter in the case of uncertain transition probabilities. During the analysis, a homogeneous polynomial matrix is introduced in the parameter-dependent Lyapunov function that can reduce the conservatism of the results. Finally, a numerical example is given to support the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed theory.},

  abstract     = {For the behavior analysis of cooperative-antagonistic networks (CANs), the structural balance theory has been adopted widely since it can be developed to accommodate the simultaneous existence of competitive interactions. This advantage of structural balance is further explored in this paper by aiming at the local nodes instead of the global CAN, and a notion of structurally balanced nodes is proposed. It is shown that structurally balanced nodes play a dominant role in determining the dynamic behaviors of CANs. Furthermore, such an extension of structural balance is applied to distinguish the roles of all nodes to create a hierarchical structure decomposition of CANs. Particularly, regarding interval bipartite consensus of quasi-strongly connected CANs, the impact index of root nodes can be calculated directly through counting the number of structurally balanced nodes.},

Using the notion of limiting behaviors of the state, output, and switching signals, the concept of a limiting zeroing-output solution is introduced. This leads to a definition of weak zero-state detectability (WZSD) that can be used to check UGAS, (uniformly for a set of switched signals). En route to establish this, a number of new stability results are derived. For example, under appropriate conditions, it is feasible to decide UGAS even when the switching signal does not satisfy an averaged dwell-time condition. It is also shown that WZSD of the original switched system can be verified by detectability conditions of much simpler auxiliary systems. Moreover, UGAS can be guaranteed without requiring that in each allowable system (without switching), the trivial solution is attractive. The effectiveness of the proposed concept is illustrated by a few examples including a switched semi-quasi-Z-source inverter.},

The nonlinear dc gain is a function of the amplitude of the input and can be used to evaluate the importance of each state variable. In fact, the nonlinear dc gain is directly related to the infinity-induced norm of the system as well as a notion of output reachability. Given the dc gain, model reduction is performed by either truncating not-so-important state variables or aggregating state variables having similar importance. Under such truncation and clustering, monotonicity and boundedness of the nonlinear dc gain are preserved; moreover, these two operations can be approximately performed based on simulation or experimental data alone. This empirical model reduction approach is illustrated by an example of a gene regulatory network.},

Though this class of systems is useful while modeling a variety of physical systems undergoing contact, the construction of a numerical method for their optimal control has proven challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the state-dependent switching and the potential discontinuities that arise during switches. This paper constructs a convex relaxation-based approach to solve this optimal control problem by formulating the problem in the space of relaxed controls, which gives rise to a linear program whose solution is proven to compute the globally optimal controller. This conceptual program is solved using a sequence of semidefinite programs whose solutions are proven to converge from below to the true solution of the original optimal control problem. Finally, a method to synthesize the optimal controller is developed. Using an array of examples, the performance of the proposed method is validated on problems with known solutions and also compared to a commercial solver.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the Kalman filter (KF)-based state estimation in the multisensor networked control systems. The sensors communicate plant state observations to a remote state estimator over a multiantenna random access network, resulting in random fading in measurements and rank-deficient observation updates in KF. In contrast to the conventional literature where average state estimation mean-square-error (MSE) is adopted as the estimation performance measure, we analyze the state estimation MSE tail distribution which guarantees fine-grained characterizations of the MSE sample path. We developed various sufficient conditions for the well behaved tail distribution of the MSE. Specifically, we propose the observable and unobservable cone decomposition of the transformed coordinate system induced by the singular value decomposition of the measurement matrix, which enables us to overcome the limitation of MSE analysis with rank deficient measurement matrix. In the noiseless plant case, we establish the sufficient condition such that the state estimation MSE is a supermartingale in high SNR regime. Via martingale convergence theorems, we show that the state estimation MSE is almost surely stable, which results in outlier-free MSE sample path. In the noisy plant case, we show that the state estimation MSE is uniformly upper bounded by a Markov chain in high SNR regime. We establish a sufficient condition for the existence of the steady-state distribution of the Markov chain. Via analyzing the stochastic fixed point equation associated with the stationary distribution of the Markov chain, we provide the closed-form expression for the MSE tail probability. We further established a power law that provides closed-form characterizations of the tradeoff between the communication resource and the MSE tail decay rate, where more communication resource consumption leads to faster exponential decaying MSE tail. We also recover the results in the existing literature when applying our developed theory to the scalar systems.},

We analyze the input-output performance of the continuous-time saddle-point method applied to linearly constrained quadratic programs, providing explicit expressions for the saddle-point $\mathcal {H}_2$ norm under a relevant input-output configuration. We then proceed to derive analogous results for regularized and augmented versions of the saddle-point algorithm. We observe some rather peculiar effects-a modest amount of regularization significantly improves the transient performance, while augmentation does not necessarily offer improvement. We then propose a distributed dual version of the algorithm, which overcomes some of the performance limitations imposed by augmentation. Finally, we apply our results to a resource allocation problem to compare the input-output performance of various centralized and distributed saddle-point implementations and show that distributed algorithms may perform as well as their centralized counterparts.},

A receiver observes the channel output and the channel state and estimates the source realization. The receiver also feeds back the channel state and an acknowledgment for successful reception to the transmitter. We consider two models for the source-finite state Markov chains and first-order autoregressive processes. For the first model, using ideas from team theory, we establish the structure of optimal transmission and estimation strategies and identify a dynamic program to determine optimal strategies with that structure. For the second model, we assume that the noise process has unimodal and symmetric distribution. Using ideas from majorization theory, we show that the optimal transmission strategy is symmetric and monotonic and the optimal estimation strategy is like Kalman filter. Consequently, when there are a finite number of power levels, the optimal transmission strategy may be described using thresholds that depend on the channel state.

An authorized user estimates the state of an unstable linear plant, based on the packets received from a sensor, while the packets may also be intercepted by the eavesdropper. Our goal is to design a coding scheme at the sensor, which encodes the state information, in order to impair the eavesdropper&#39;s estimation performance while enabling the user to successfully decode the sent messages. We introduce a novel class of codes, termed State-Secrecy Codes, which use acknowledgment signals from the user and apply linear time-varying transformations to the current and previously received states. By exploiting the properties of the system&#39;s process noise, the channel physical model, and the dynamics, these codes manage to be fast, efficient, and suitable for real-time dynamical systems. We prove that under minimal conditions, State-Secrecy Codes achieve perfect secrecy, namely the eavesdropper&#39;s minimum mean square error (mmse) grows unbounded almost surely, whereas the user&#39;s estimation performance is optimal. These conditions only require that at least once, the user receives the corresponding packet while the eavesdropper fails to intercept it. Even one occurrence of this event renders the eavesdropper&#39;s mmse unbounded with asymptotically optimal rate of increase. State-Secrecy Codes are provided and studied for two cases, first, when direct state measurements are available and second, when we only have output measurements.

For small sampling periods, however, this nonlinearity is not severe, so that controller design can rely on the same techniques conventionally adopted for the linear systems. When a linear controller designed by these techniques is applied to the originally nonlinear system, it may not perform adequately at higher sampling periods. In particular, it may fail to stabilize the closed-loop system as predicted for a linear approximation of the original system. This paper introduces a class of nonlinear feedback laws outperforming their existing linear counterparts in terms of stability and transient response. The control laws in this class are nonlinearly modified forms of the linear quadratic (LQ) regulators and yield a closed-loop behavior similar to that of a linear system under a LQ regulator. As a result, the closed-loop dynamics is locally stable in essence, and will be globally stable under additional assumptions. As a case study, an inverted pendulum on a cart is stabilized using the proposed nonlinear control law. The superior performance of this control law over its linear counterparts is shown by numerical simulations.},

In that perspective, we devise a hybrid control strategy, to guarantee the exponential convergence of the output tracking error to a prespecified neighborhood of the origin, with a predefined minimum convergence rate. Furthermore, the origin of the uncertain nonlinear error system is rendered globally asymptotically stable, while preserving the boundedness of all signals in the closed loop. Attention is paid to maintain the complexity of the resulted control solution at low levels. The developed switching logic prevents the appearance of Zeno behavior and guarantees the termination of switchings in finite time. Illustrative simulations clarify and verify the approach.},

It is assumed that the so-called total disturbance (which is composed of internal possibly nonlinear uncertainty and external disturbance) the equation is subject to is on one part of the boundary, and that the control is applied on the rest of the boundary. Using only partial boundary measurement, we first propose an extended state observer to estimate both system state and the total disturbance. This allows us to design a servomechanism and then an output feedback controller.Under the condition that both the reference signal and the disturbance vanish or belong to spaces H 1 (0, ∞; L 1 (Γ 1 )) and L 2 (0, ∞; L 2 (Γ 0 )), respectively. We show that the over-all control strategy achieves three objectives on the system performance: first, exponentially output tracking for arbitrary given reference signal; second, uniformly boundedness of all internal signals; and, third, the internal asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. In addition, the control strategy turns out to be robust to the measurement noise. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

A graph-theoretic approach is employed to study the interactions of the agents with limited sensing capabilities, such that distributed control policies are obtained for every agent. Furthermore, the minimization of performance indices associated with the goals of the agents is guaranteed. Nash equilibrium among the players is obtained by means of optimal policies that use the solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations of the game. Minmax strategies are also proposed to guarantee a security-level performance when the solutions of the HJI equations for Nash equilibrium do not exist. Scenarios for finite-time capture and for asymptotic rendezvous are analyzed, and emergent behaviors are obtained by means of modifications of the proposed general-case performance indices. The containment control results are shown to be special cases of the solutions of the MPE games.},

Two different versions of the hybrid controller are presented: one which allows for discontinuities of the plant input and a second one that removes the discontinuities via dynamic extension. By taking an exosystem approach, we provide a general construction of a hybrid controller that guarantees global asymptotic stability of the zero tracking error set. The proposed construction relies on the existence of proper indicators and a transport map-like function for the given manifold. We provide a construction of these functions for the case where each chart in a smooth atlas for the manifold maps its domain onto the Euclidean space. We also provide conditions for exponential convergence to the zero tracking error set. To illustrate these properties, the proposed controller is exercised on three different compact manifolds-the two-dimensional sphere, the unit-quaternion group, and the special orthogonal group of order three-and further applied to the problems of obstacle avoidance in the plane and global synchronization on the circle.},

Such constraints can be encoded in the consensus dynamics by saturating the values that an agent transmits to its neighboring nodes. We show in the paper that when the intersection of the intervals imposed by the agents is nonempty, the resulting constrained consensus problem must converge to a common value inside that intersection. In our algorithm, convergence happens in a fully distributed manner, and without need of sharing any information on the individual constraining intervals. When the intersection of the intervals is an empty set, the intrinsic nonlinearity of the network dynamics raises new challenges in understanding the node state evolution. Using Brouwer fixed-point theorem we prove that in that case there exists at least one equilibrium, and in fact the possible equilibria are locally stable if the constraints are satisfied or dissatisfied at the same time among all nodes. For graphs with sufficient sparsity it is further proven that there is a unique equilibrium that is globally attractive if the constraint intervals are pairwise disjoint.},

This research is motivated by the observation that in many practical applications and operational domains involving large-scale networks, such as environmental monitoring or traffic load balancing, agents may be required to collect only information concerning other agents located sufficiently close to them, that is agents topologically at most k-hop away. In this setting, distributed observers available at the state of art, which typically estimates the full network state, may be inadequate due to scalability issues. Differently, we propose a distributed finite-time observer which allows each agent to estimate the state of its k-hop neighbors by interacting only with the agents belonging to its 1-hop neighborhood. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for feedback control strategies based on k-hop neighborhood information, which are input-to-state stable, the proposed distributed finite-time observer can be effectively used to design stable large-scale networked control strategies.

The cost function is a summation of local cost functions which are convex but nonsmooth. Each of the local cost functions consists of a twice differentiable (smooth) convex function and two lower semi-continuous (nonsmooth) convex functions. We call these problems as single-smooth plus double-nonsmooth (SSDN) problems. Under mild conditions, we propose a distributed double proximal primal-dual optimization algorithm. Double proximal splitting is designed to deal with the difficulty caused by the unproximable property of the summation of those two nonsmooth functions. Besides, it can also guarantee that the proposed algorithm is locally Lipschitz continuous. An auxiliary variable in the double proximal splitting is introduced to estimate the subgradient of the second nonsmooth function. Theoretically, we conduct the convergence analysis by employing Lyapunov stability theory. It shows that the proposed algorithm can make the states achieve consensus at the optimal point. In the end, nontrivial simulations are presented and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the distributed set-membership filtering problem for a class of general discrete-time nonlinear systems under event-triggered communication protocols over sensor networks. To mitigate the communication burden, each intelligent sensing node broadcasts its measurement to the neighboring nodes only when a predetermined event-based media-access condition is satisfied. According to the interval mathematics theory, a recursive distributed set-membership scheme is designed to obtain an ellipsoid set containing the target states of interest via adequately fusing the measurements from neighboring nodes, where both the accurate estimate on Lagrange remainder and the event-based media-access condition are skillfully utilized to improve the filter performance. Furthermore, such a scheme is only dependent on neighbor information and local adjacency weights, thereby fulfilling the scalability requirement of sensor networks. In addition, an optimization algorithm is developed to minimize the trace of the estimated ellipsoid set, and the effect from the adopted event-triggered threshold is thoroughly discussed as well. Finally, a simulation example is utilized to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed distributed set-membership filtering scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper devotes to establishing a bridge between asymptotical stability of a probabilistic Boolean network (PBN) and a solution to its induced equations, which are induced from the PBN&#39;s transition matrix. By utilizing the semitensor product technique routinely, the dynamics of a PBN with coincident state delays can be equivalently converted into that of a higher dimensional PBN without delays. Subsequently, several novel stability criteria are derived from the standpoint of equations&#39; solution. The most significant finding is that a PBN is globally asymptotically stable at a predesignated one-point distribution if and only if a vector, obtained by adding 1 at the bottom of this distribution, is the unique nonnegative solution to PBN&#39;s induced equations. Moreover, the influence of coincident state delays on PBN&#39;s asymptotical stability is explicitly analyzed without consideration of the convergence rate. Consequently, such bounded state delays are verified to have no impact on PBN&#39;s stability, albeit delays are time-varying. Based on this worthwhile observation, the time computational complexity of the aforementioned approach can be reduced by removing delays directly. Furthermore, this universal procedure is summarized to reduce the time complexity of some previous results in the literature to a certain extent. Two examples are employed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.},

The local gradients are locally Lipschitz and the local convexity constants are unknown. A control law is proposed to drive the states of all agents to the optimal coordination that minimizes a global objective function. By exploring certain features of the invariant projection of the Laplacian matrix, the global asymptotic convergence is guaranteed utilizing only local interaction. The proposed control law is then extended with event-triggered communication schemes, which removes the requirement for continuous communications. Under the event-triggered control law, it is proved that no Zeno behavior is exhibited and the global asymptotic convergence is preserved. The proposed control laws are fully distributed, in the sense that the control design only uses the information in the connected neighborhood. Furthermore, to achieve the DOC for linear multiagent systems with unmeasurable states, an observer-based event-triggered control law is proposed. A simulation example is given to validate the proposed control laws.},

In leader-follower consensus problems, however, the objective is for normally behaving agents to track a reference state that may take on values outside of this convex hull.

  abstract     = {This paper studies input-to-state stability (ISS) of general nonlinear time-delay systems subject to delay-dependent impulse effects. Sufficient conditions for ISS are constructed by using the method of Lyapunov functionals. It is shown that, when the continuous dynamics are ISS but the discrete dynamics governing the delay-dependent impulses are not, the impulsive system as a whole is ISS provided the destabilizing impulses do not occur too frequently. On the contrary, when the discrete dynamics are ISS but the continuous dynamics are not, the delayed impulses must occur frequently enough to overcome the destabilizing effects of the continuous dynamics so that the ISS can be achieved for the impulsive system. Particularly, when the discrete dynamics are ISS and the continuous dynamics are also ISS or just stable for the zero input, the impulsive system is ISS for arbitrary impulse time sequences. Compared with the existing results on impulsive time-delay systems, the obtained ISS criteria are more general in the sense that these results are applicable to systems with delay dependent impulses while the existing ones are not. Moreover, when consider time-delay systems with delay-free impulses, our result for systems with unstable continuous dynamics and stabilizing impulses is less conservative than the existing ones, as a weaker condition on the upper bound of impulsive intervals is obtained. To demonstrate the theoretical results, we provide two examples with numerical simulations, in which distributed delays and discrete delays in the impulses are considered, respectively.},

This condition can be defined in various forms and varies depending on the system properties and design problem. This paper proposes a framework to design the TC while keeping L p performance within desired limits. Our general framework captures several existing state-based triggering rules as a special case, and it can achieve the performance objectives while reducing transmissions. Indeed, this general structure is shown to enlarge the minimum interevent time by a specified amount, for a desired period of time. Numerical examples suggest that the proposed mechanism effectively enlarges the average sampling time.},

By restricting attention to a subset of these multipliers, a set of pure linear matrix inequality conditions is obtained which requires no initial parameterization by the user. A useful byproduct of using externally positive systems is that the results are applicable to nonodd slope restricted nonlinearities, which is not the case for all classes of Zames-Falb multipliers.},

  abstract     = {Despite the correct-by-construction property, one of the major drawbacks of supervisory control synthesis is state-space explosion. Several approaches have been proposed to overcome this computational difficulty, such as modular, hierarchical, decentralized, and multilevel supervisory control synthesis. Unfortunately, the modeler needs to provide additional information about the system&#39;s structure or controller&#39;s structure as input for most of these nonmonolithic synthesis procedures. Multilevel synthesis assumes that the system is provided in a tree-structured format, which may resemble a system decomposition. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to transform a set of plant models and a set of requirement models provided as extended finite automata into a tree-structured multilevel discrete-event system to which multilevel supervisory control synthesis can be applied. By analyzing the dependencies between the plants and the requirements using dependence structure matrix techniques, a multilevel clustering can be calculated. With the modeling framework of extended finite automata, plant models and requirements depend on each other when they share events or variables. We report on experimental results of applying the algorithm&#39;s implementation on several models available in the literature to assess the applicability of the proposed method. The benefit of multilevel synthesis based on the calculated clustering is significant for most large-scale systems.},

As an important application and our primary motivation to study the POD method to FKE, we solve the nonlinear filtering (NLF) problems with a real-time algorithm proposed by Yau and Yau combined with the POD method. This algorithm is referred as POD algorithm in this paper. Our POD algorithm consists of offline and online stages. In the offline stage, we construct a small number of POD basis functions that capture the dynamics of the system and compute propagation of the POD basis functions under the FKE operator. In the online stage, we synchronize the coming observations in a real-time manner. Its convergence analysis has also been discussed. Some numerical experiments of the NLF problems are performed to illustrate the feasibility of our algorithm and to verify the convergence rate. Our numerical results show that the POD algorithm provides considerable computational savings over existing numerical methods.},

Such a network has only finite bit rate and suffers from transmission delay which is characterized by both lower and upper delay bounds. The concerned system implements event-triggering strategies, i.e., only when certain events are triggered, the system samples and transmits feedback signals. This paper first derives some lower bounds on the feedback bit rate required to achieve the input-to-state stability under arbitrary event-triggering strategies. Then this paper proposes some constructive methods to design the event-triggering strategy and the controller, and can achieve the input-to-state stability at a bit rate being arbitrarily close to these obtained lower bit rate bounds. Moreover, this paper proves that the stabilizing bit rates under the proposed event-triggering strategies can be strictly lower than the stabilizing bit rate required by any time-triggering strategy. This bit rate superiority comes from the fact that under event triggering, the state information can be freely extracted from the receive time instants of feedback packets without consuming any bit rate. Simulations are done to demonstrate the bit rate superiority of the proposed event-triggering strategies.},

We recast the problem as that of finding a zero of a sum of monotone operators through primal-dual analysis. To distribute the problem, we doubly augment variables, so that each player has local decision estimates and local copies of Lagrangian multipliers. We introduce a single-layer algorithm, fully distributed with respect to both primal and dual variables. We show its convergence to a variational GNE with fixed step sizes, by reformulating it as a forward-backward iteration for a pair of doubly-augmented monotone operators.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, data have played an increasingly important role in the economy as a good in its own right. In many settings, data aggregators cannot directly verify the quality of the data they purchase, nor the effort exerted by data sources when creating the data. Recent work has explored mechanisms to ensure that the data sources share high-quality data with a single data aggregator, addressing the issue of moral hazard. Oftentimes, there is a unique, socially efficient solution. In this paper, we consider data markets where there is more than one data aggregator. Since data can be cheaply reproduced and transmitted once created, data sources may share the same data with more than one aggregator, leading to free-riding between data aggregators. This coupling can lead to nonuniqueness of equilibria and social inefficiency. We examine a particular class of mechanisms that have received study recently in the literature, and we characterize all the generalized Nash (GN) equilibria of the resulting data market. We show that, in contrast to the single-aggregator case, there is either infinitely many GN equilibria or none. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for all equilibria to be socially inefficient. In our analysis, we identify the components of these mechanisms that give rise to these undesirable outcomes, showing the need for research into mechanisms for competitive settings with multiple data purchasers and sellers.},

The existing BLA framework is limited to systems with additive (colored) noise at the output. Such a noise framework is a simplified representation of reality. Process noise can play an important role in many real-life applications.This paper generalizes the best linear approximation framework to account also for the process noise, both for the open-loop and the closed-loop setting, and shows that the most important properties of the existing BLA framework remain valid. The impact of the process noise contributions on the robust BLA estimation method is also analyzed.},

Each agent can attend to no more than one target at a given time, thus agents must move between targets to control the collective state, implying that the states of each of the individual targets are only controlled intermittently. We assume that the state dynamics of each of the targets are given by a linear, time-invariant, controllable system, and develop conditions on the visiting schedules of the agents to ensure that the property of controllability is maintained in the face of the intermittent control. We then introduce constraints on the magnitude of the control input and a bounded disturbance into the target dynamics and develop a method to evaluate system performance under this scenario. Finally, we use this method to determine how the amount of time the agents spend at a given target, before switching to the next in its sequence, influences the control of the states of the entire collection of targets.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a convex programming based method to address a long-standing problem of inner-approximating backward reachable sets of state-constrained polynomial systems subject to time-varying uncertainties. The backward reachable set is a set of states, from which all trajectories starting will surely enter a target region at the end of a given time horizon without violating a set of state constraints in spite of the actions of uncertainties. It is equal to the zero sublevel set of the unique Lipschitz viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation (HJE). We show that inner approximations of the backward reachable set can be formed by zero sublevel sets of its viscosity supersolutions. Consequently, we reduce the inner-approximation problem to a problem of synthesizing polynomial viscosity supersolutions to this HJE. Such a polynomial solution in our method is synthesized by solving a single semidefinite program. We also prove that polynomial solutions to the formulated semidefinite program exist and can produce a convergent sequence of inner approximations to the interior of the backward reachable set in measure under appropriate assumptions. This is the main contribution of this paper. Several illustrative examples demonstrate the merits of our approach.},

In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithmic framework to solve this class of optimization problems in a peer-to-peer network with no coordinator and with limited computation and communication capabilities. At each communication round, agents locally solve a small linear program, generate suitable cutting planes, and communicate a fixed number of active constraints. Within the distributed framework, we first propose an algorithm that, under the assumption of integer-valued optimal cost, guarantees finite-time convergence to an optimal solution. Second, we propose an algorithm for general problems that provides a suboptimal solution up to a given tolerance in a finite number of communication rounds. Both algorithms work under asynchronous, directed, unreliable networks. Finally, through numerical computations, we analyze the algorithm scalability in terms of the network size. Moreover, for a multi-agent multi-task assignment problem, we show, consistently with the theory, its robustness to packet loss.},

Necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure that a secret specification is k-ISO are established in terms of sets of reachable states. We also show how to adapt techniques for computing underapproximations and overapproximations of the set of reachable states of dynamical systems in order to soundly approximate k-ISO. Furthermore, we provide a condition for output controllability, if k-ISO holds, and show that the converse holds under an additional assumption. We extend the theory of opacity for single-adversary systems to the case of multiple adversaries and develop several notions of decentralized opacity. We study the following scenarios: first, the presence or lack of a centralized coordinator, and, second, the presence or absence of collusion among adversaries. In the case of colluding adversaries, we derive a condition for nonopacity that depends on the structure of the directed graph representing the communication between adversaries. Finally, we relax the condition that the outputs be indistinguishable and define a notion of ϵ-opacity, and also provide an extension to the case of nonlinear systems.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the problem of synthesizing dynamic masks that preserve the infinite-step opacity in the context of discrete-event systems. Dynamic mask is an information acquisition mechanism that controls the observability of the system&#39;s events dynamically online, e.g., by turning sensors on/off. A system equipped with a dynamic mask is said to be infinite-step opaque if an outside intruder that can access all acquired information can never infer that the system was at some secret state for any specific previous instant. Existing works on the dynamic mask synthesis problem can only preserve the current-state opacity. However, synthesizing dynamic masks for the infinite-step opacity, which is stronger than the current-state opacity, is much more challenging. The main reason is that the delayed information is involved in this problem and whether or not a current secret can be revealed depends on sensing decisions to be synthesized in the future. In this paper, a new type of information state is proposed to capture all the delayed information in the infinite-step opacity synthesis problem. An effective algorithm is then presented to solve the synthesis problem, which extends existing dynamic mask synthesis techniques from the current-state opacity to infinite-step opacity. Additionally, an information-state-reduction-based approach is proposed to further mitigate the computational complexity of the synthesis procedure. Finally, we discuss how to generalize our results to a class properties with delayed information including infinite-step K-anonymity and infinite-step indistinguishability.},

In this paper, at first, we cast the CA as a nonlinear convex programming problem which depicts the desired objective function subject to three-axis moment demands and the limits of effectors&#39; movement; then we develop a computationally tractable method for real-time application on the CA of the aircraft flight control system. The method can analytically and deterministically give one optimal solution for the CA and prove this optimal solution to be guaranteed within a certainly maximal computation time. Numerical testing results based on Boeing C-17 transport aircraft and Lockheed-Martin tailless fighter models demonstrate that the method is effective in terms of its computational efficiency, accuracy, and reliability.},

  abstract     = {Mean field game theory has been developed largely following two routes. One of them, called the direct approach, starts by solving a large-scale game and next derives a set of limiting equations as the population size tends to infinity. The second route is to apply mean field approximations and formalize a fixed point problem by analyzing the best response of a representative player. This paper addresses the connection and difference of the two approaches in a linear quadratic (LQ) setting. We first introduce an asymptotic solvability notion for the direct approach, which means for all sufficiently large population sizes, the corresponding game has a set of feedback Nash strategies in addition to a mild regularity requirement. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic solvability and show that in this case the solution converges to a mean field limit. This is accomplished by developing a re-scaling method to derive a low-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, where a non-symmetric Riccati ODE has a central role. We next compare with the fixed point approach which determines a two-point boundary value (TPBV) problem, and show that asymptotic solvability implies feasibility of the fixed point approach, but the converse is not true. We further address non-uniqueness in the fixed point approach and examine the long time behavior of the non-symmetric Riccati ODE in the asymptotic solvability problem.},

The associated system Lagrangian can then be discretized and used to develop low-order variational integration schemes that inherit the advantageous features of their conservative counterparts. The properties of a lossless spring-inerter based transmission system are analyzed in detail, with the resulting variational integration schemes shown to have excellent numerical properties.

It is proved that the event-triggered control system is the Zeno-free and the newly proposed control strategy ensures the global finite-time stability of the closed-loop systems via Lyapunov analyses and finite-time stability theory, which improves the existing results of only boundedness or asymptotic stability. Finally, two examples are performed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {In this note, constant reference tracking using integral control for negative-imaginary (NI) systems preceded by hysteresis nonlinearity is addressed. The hysteresis nonlinearity is considered to be slope-restricted, though no specific modeling framework is exploited. It is effectively shown that integral tracking controllers are guaranteed to exist when a stable NI system with sign-definite dc-gain is preceded by sauch hysteresis nonlinearities. When the dc-gain is negative-definite, under positive feedback configuration with positive slope-restricted hysteresis, it is established that the integral controller gain can be any positive diagonal matrix. The development of the proposed model-independent inversion-free scheme is carried out in general state-space setting and is applicable for multiple-input multiple-output systems with decoupled hysteresis nonlinearities. Effectiveness of the results is illustrated with examples.},

In particular, we find a model set describing the subsystems such that the performance improvement of the feedback system is achieved. To this end, we introduce the parameter-integrated passivity to accurately describe each passive subsystem and their feedback system. A model set describing passive systems is characterized by the two matrix parameters. The matrix parameters enable to evaluate the L 2 -gain “of the model set”, which is defined as the L 2 -gain of the worst-case system in the model set. With the parameter-integrated passivity, the quantitative analysis of a feedback system composed of two passive subsystems is provided as the parameter transition. Then, we find conditions on the matrix parameters to achieve the performance improvement such that the L 2 -gain of the model set describing the feedback system is strictly less than that describing the subsystems. Subsequently, the performance improvement of the feedback system is extended to that of an iterative feedback system, which is a network system constructed by the feedback connection of multiple subsystems in a step-by-step manner. Then, we find conditions on the passivity parameters describing the baseline subsystem to achieve a gradual performance improvement with the subsystem connection.},

We first present an intermittent stochastic system with random disturbance. We then propose an almost sure stability condition for the underlying system. The stability results are then used to stabilize the memristive Lorenz system. Numerical simulations are also given to validate the effectiveness of the theoretic results obtained.},

For preventing data collisions and mitigating communication burden, the round-robin protocol and the weighted try-once-discard protocol are, respectively, introduced to regulate the data transmission order from sensors to the filter. Then, by employing two kinds of data-holding strategies (i.e., zero-order holder and zero input) for those nodes without transmission privilege, two novel protocol-based measurement models are formulated. Subsequently, by resorting to the sigma point approximation method, two resource-saving UKF algorithms are developed, where the impact from the underlying protocols on the filter design is explicitly quantified. Finally, compared with the protocol-based extended Kalman filtering algorithms, a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol-based UKF algorithms.},

If stochastic noises account for a small proportion of the tracking error, the learning gain matrix remains constant with a high probability. If stochastic noises dominate the tracking error, the learning gain matrix is decreasing. Therefore, the new ILC algorithm converges more quickly than existing SA-based algorithms. In addition, the classic P-type ILC law for noise-free systems is a special case of the new ILC algorithm. The behaviors of the proposed ILC algorithm are demonstrated through examples.},

Meanwhile, there may exist randomly occurring uncertainties and peak-bounded external disturbances. A suitable sliding mode controller is designed such that state trajectories are driven onto the specified sliding surface during a given finite-time (possibly short) interval. By introducing a partitioning strategy, the stochastic finite-time boundedness over the reaching phase and the sliding motion phase is analyzed, respectively. A key feature is that a set of mode-dependent sufficiently small scalars are introduced into some coupled Lyapunov inequalities such that the feasible solutions are easily obtained for the stochastic finite-time boundedness of the closed-loop systems.

While efficient methods for establishing ISS properties for distributed parameter systems with respect to distributed disturbances have been developed during the last decades, establishing ISS properties with respect to boundary disturbances remains challenging. One of the well-known methods for well-posedness analysis of systems with boundary inputs is the use of a lifting operator for transferring the boundary disturbance to a distributed one. However, the resulting distributed disturbance involves time derivatives of the boundary perturbation. Thus, the subsequent ISS estimate depends on its amplitude, and may not be expressed in the strict form of ISS properties. To solve this problem, we show for a clamped-free damped string equation that the projection of the original system trajectories in an adequate Riesz basis can be used to establish the desired EISS property.},

A reorthogonalization procedure that iteratively refines the QR factors provides numerical robustness for the described primal active-set method, which solves a system of linear equations in each of its iterations via recursive updates. The performance of the proposed BVLS solver, which is implemented in C without external software libraries, is compared in terms of computational efficiency against state-of-the-art quadratic programming solvers for small- to medium-sized random BVLS problems and a typical example of embedded linear MPC application.

This note presents a new framework for opacity and considers the problem of enforcing opacity in CPSs modeled as linear time-invariant systems. The confidential information involves the CPS&#39; interference attenuation capacity (IAC), called the secret. A system is opaque if the intruder never infers the secret IAC from an observation mapping of system output. To guarantee the confidentiality requirement, an effective algorithm is proposed for synthesizing opacity-enforcing controllers by using a new approximation-based Q-learning. A main advantage of this method is that it does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics matrices. A simulation example is presented to sustain the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This note is concerned with a suboptimal version of the distributed linear quadratic optimal control problem for multiagent systems. Given a multiagent system with identical agent dynamics and an associated global quadratic cost functional, our objective is to design distributed control laws that achieve consensus and whose cost is smaller than an a priori given upper bound, for all initial states of the network that are bounded in norm by a given radius. A centralized design method is provided to compute such suboptimal controllers, involving the solution of a single Riccati inequality of dimension equal to the dimension of the agent dynamics, and the smallest nonzero and the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. Furthermore, we relax the requirement of exact knowledge of the smallest nonzero and largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix by using only lower and upper bounds on these eigenvalues. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate our design method.},

We assume that the Markov chain parameter is not available, and instead, there is a detector, which emits signals providing information on this parameter. It is desired to derive a feedback linear control using the information provided by this detector in order to stochastically stabilize the closed-loop system, satisfy the constraints whenever the initial conditions belong to an invariant set, and minimize an upper bound for the quadratic cost. We show that a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem can be formulated in order to obtain a solution for this problem. Two other related problems, one for minimizing the guaranteed quadratic cost considering fixed initial conditions and the other for maximizing an estimate of the domain of an invariant set, can also be formulated using our LMI approach.

However, the invariant zeros constrain the pole placement and consequently the state estimation error convergence rate, especially, when the zeros dynamics are slow. In the proposed UIO, the exact decoupling condition is relaxed by the introduction of the asymptotic decoupling notion which allows to act on the invariant zeros and then enhance the convergence rate of the state estimation error.

We prove several properties of sub-Riemannian problems with the given structure. We derive the explicit optimal control for the case of three level quantum systems where the desired operation is on the lowest two energy levels (A-systems).

The cascaded two-port connections arise when signals in the NCS are transmitted through bidirectional communication channels separated by a sequence of relays. Distortions and interferences occurring in communications are taken into account. We consider H ∞ -norm bounded uncertainties in the transmission matrices of the two-port channels, and the gap-type uncertainties in the plant and controller models. A necessary and sufficient condition for the robust stability of the NCS is presented in the form of an “arcsine” inequality, which states that the NCS is stable whenever the uncertainties quantified by the aforementioned metrics are well bounded and satisfy the “arcsine” inequality. A stability margin related to the Gang of Four transfer matrix is obtained, based on which the controller synthesis problem can be solved through a special H ∞ optimization with favorable properties. Furthermore, a generalized stability condition is studied in terms of frequency-wise bounded uncertainties, and the corresponding controller synthesis problem is proposed and solved.stability.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of minimizing the global energy cost for multiagent systems to achieve consensus over undirected network topologies. Conventional optimization problems so defined require all-to-all network topologies for interagent communications, which precludes the use of distributed control or otherwise demands that the network be complete. To circumvent this difficulty, we introduce a network approximation (NA) scheme in the optimization criterion, which tends to render the optimization problem to one seemingly over a complete graph network, thus removing the all-to-all communication requirement. With the NA cost, we show that a distributed optimal consensus algorithm always exists for any given connected network topology, which can be determined by solving a single-agent-level parametric algebraic Ricatti equation (PARE). We also investigate the performance of the optimal consensus algorithm, focusing on the minimal energy cost required to achieve consensus optimally, and the speed at which consensus is achieved. Furthermore, for certain more special yet worthy cases, such as single-integrator, double-integrator, and first-order unstable agents, we derive explicit expressions for the energy cost and the consensus speed. It can be seen from these results that the energy cost can be made arbitrarily small for single-integrator and double-integrator systems under the optimal distributed control. On the other hand, for the first-order unstable agents, the energy cost increases and consensus speed decreases monotonically with the value of the agent&#39;s real unstable pole.},

By achieving consensus and conservation through agent-agent communications in the same cluster and aggregator-aggregator communications among different clusters, respectively, distributed algorithms are devised for agents to cooperatively achieve a solution to the overall linear equation. These algorithms outperform existing algorithms, including but not limited to the following aspects-first, each agent does not have to know as much as a complete row or column of the overall equation; second, each agent only needs to control as few as two scalar states when the number of clusters and the number of agents are sufficiently large; third, the dimensions of agents&#39; states in the proposed algorithms do not have to be the same (while in contrast, algorithms based on the idea of standard consensus inherently require all agents&#39; states to be of the same dimension).

The study we present here is significant in that it addresses the problem of efficiently controlling general stochastic epidemic systems without relying on mean-field approximation, which is an important issue in the theory of stochastic epidemic processes. This enables us to provide rigorous convergence guarantees on the stochastic epidemic model itself, improving over the mean-field type convergence results of most prior work. There are two primary technical difficulties addressed in treating this problem: 1) constructing a means of tractably approximating the evolution of the process so that the designed approximation is robust to the modeling error introduced by the applied moment closure and 2) guaranteeing that the designed controller causes the closed-loop system to drive the SEIV process to extinction quickly. As an application, we use the developed framework for optimizing the use of quarantines in containing an SEIV epidemic outbreak.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a feedback controller designed to realize reachability is investigated in a class of nonlinear systems. Different from stability, reachability defines that there exists an input such that a closed-loop system can reach the desired states from any other initial states within finite time. In other words, the state errors can converge to zero in finite time if reachability can be realized. In order to realize reachability, it is proved that the state and all derivatives of the state must simultaneously satisfy a group of functions, called triple constraints. Then, it can be derived that the best approximation to realize the triple constraints is to guarantee the value of the highest order derivatives of the state. As a result, the controller can be obtained by solving a group of algebraic equations described by the highest order derivatives and the input. However, the solution will be difficult to obtain if the system is subjected to unknown parameters and disturbance. An online parameter estimation algorithm is proposed and the highest order derivatives are updated according to the current state to handle the uncertainties. With this newly developed online estimation algorithm and a scheme for updating the highest order derivatives online, reachability can be approximately realized for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertainties. To further illustrate the implementation and effectiveness of the proposed controller based on reachability, numerical simulations are conducted on a two-link robot arm. The results show the proposed controller outperforms conventional controllers such as computed-torque proportional-derivative (PD) control, sliding mode control, and finite-time controller.},

  abstract     = {We propose a distributed model predictive control scheme for linear time-invariant constrained systems that admit a separable structure. To exploit the merits of distributed computation algorithms, the terminal cost and invariant terminal set of the optimal control problem need to respect the coupling structure of the system. Existing methods to address this issue typically separate the synthesis of terminal controllers and costs from the one of terminal sets, and do not explicitly consider the effect of the current and predicted system states on this synthesis process. These limitations can adversely affect performance due to small or even empty terminal sets. Here, we present a unified framework to encapsulate the synthesis of both the stabilizing terminal controller and invariant terminal set into the same optimization problem. Conditions for Lyapunov stability and invariance are imposed in the synthesis problem in a way that allows the terminal cost and invariant terminal set to admit the desired distributed structure. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of efficiently and securely controlling cyber-physical systems that are operating in uncertain, and adversarial environments. To mitigate sensor, actuator attacks, and performance loss due to such attacks, we formulate a secure control algorithm that consists of a proactive and a reactive defense mechanism. The proactive mechanism, which is based on the principles of moving target defense, utilizes a stochastic switching structure to dynamically and continuously alter the parameters of the system, while hindering the attacker&#39;s ability to conduct successful reconnaissance to the system. The unpredictability of the current actuator and sensor is optimized using an information entropy measure, which is induced by probabilistic switching. The reactive mechanism on the other side, detects potentially attacked components, namely sensors and actuators, by leveraging online data to compute an integral Bellman error. A rigorous mathematical framework is presented to guarantee the stability of the equilibrium point of the closed-loop system, and provide a quantified bound on the performance loss when utilizing both reactive and proactive mechanisms. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed approaches on a benchmark aircraft model.},

The main result is an algorithm that consistently learns the network structure using only second-order statistics of the data. The methodology is robust with respect to the presence of unmeasured (latent) nodes: the algorithm detects the exact number and location of the latent nodes, when they satisfy specific degree conditions in the actual network graph. It is shown that the same degree conditions are also necessary for a consistent reconstruction. Thus, the proposed reconstruction algorithm achieves the fundamental limitations in learning the structure of a polyforest network of linear dynamic systems in the presence of latent nodes. This paper overcomes the limitations of previous results that only addressed single-rooted trees, tackling the problem in an efficient way since the computational complexity of the derived algorithm is proven to be polynomial in the number of observed nodes.},

  abstract     = {Fluid models are a popular formalism in the quantitative modeling of biochemical systems and analytical performance models. The main idea is to approximate a large-scale Markov chain by a compact set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Even though it is often crucial for a fluid model under study to satisfy some given properties, a formal verification is usually challenging. This is because parameters are often not known precisely due to finite-precision measurements and stochastic noise. In this paper, we present a novel technique that allows one to efficiently compute formal bounds on the reachable set of time-varying nonlinear ODE systems that are subject to uncertainty. To this end, we, first, relate the reachable set of a nonlinear fluid model to a family of inhomogeneous continuous time Markov decision processes and, second, provide optimal and suboptimal solutions for the family by relying on optimal control theory. The proposed technique is efficient and can be expected to provide tight bounds. We demonstrate its potential by comparing it with a state-of-the-art over-approximation approach.},

We recast the problem as minimization of the sum of convex functions over a constraint set defined as the set of fixed-value points of a random operator derived from weighted matrices of random graphs. We show that the derived random operator has nonexpansivity property; therefore, this formulation does not need the distribution of random communication topologies. Hence, it includes random networks with/without asynchronous protocols. As an extension of the problem, we define a novel optimization problem, namely minimization of a convex function over the fixed-value point set of a nonexpansive random operator. We propose a discrete-time algorithm using diminishing step size for converging almost surely and in mean square to the global solution of the optimization problem under suitable assumptions. Consequently, as a special case, it reduces to a totally asynchronous algorithm for the distributed optimization problem. We show that fixed-value point is a bridge from deterministic analysis to random analysis of the algorithm. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the convergence of the proposed algorithm.},

Second, based on the adaptive sliding-mode algorithm and the fault compensation algorithm, a comprehensive control law is synthesized not only to overcome the boundary restrictions of actuator loss effectiveness and external disturbances, but also to ensure the properties of stochastic stability and the reachability of the sliding-mode dynamics. Third, an improved stochastically stability criterion, in the case of Markov jump system with uncertain transition probability, is derived based on the homogeneous polynomial matrix technique.

He showed that any solution of a TPDS satisfies a sign variation diminishing property with respect to the standard number of sign variations. It has been recently shown that several important results on entrainment [stability] in time-varying [time-invariant] nonlinear tridiagonal cooperative systems follow from the fact that the variational equation associated with these nonlinear systems is a TPDS. Thus, the number of sign variations in the vector of derivatives can be used as an integer-valued Lyapunov function. Here we develop the theory of linear cyclic variation diminishing differential systems (CVDDSs). These are systems whose transition matrix satisfies a variation diminishing property with respect to the cyclic number of sign variations. Thus, the cyclic number of sign variations can be used as an integer-valued Lyapunov function for any vector solution of a CVDDS. We show that several known classes of nonlinear cooperative dynamical systems have a variational equation, which is a CVDDS.},

On one hand, the timing of event triggering carries implicit information about the state of the plant. On the other hand, the delay in the communication channel causes information loss, as it makes the state information available at the controller out of date. Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition behavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given event-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing information carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can be stabilized with any positive rate. When the delay exceeds a critical threshold, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization, and the required rate grows. When the delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the plant, the implicit information carried by the triggering events perfectly compensates the loss of information due to the communication delay, and we recover the rate requirement prescribed by the data-rate theorem. We also provide an explicit construction yielding a sufficient rate for stabilization, as well as results for vector systems. Our results do not rely on any a priori probabilistic model for the delay or the initial conditions.},

  abstract     = {A motion continuous control scheme for fully damped mechanical systems with constrained inputs is proposed. It gives the freedom to choose among finite-time and (local) exponential convergence through a simple design parameter. The control objective is achieved from any initial conditions, for desired trajectories that can be physically tracked avoiding actuator saturation and loss of motion error dissipation, globally induced through the aid of the natural damping terms explicitly considered in the open-loop dynamics. The stability analysis is based on a strict Lyapunov function and is formally developed within an appropriate analytical framework that takes into account the time-varying character naturally adopted by the closed loop. Simulation tests are further included.},

Mathematics analysis and theoretical proof verify that the VP-CDNN can obtain the least-squares solution with a super exponential convergence rate. In addition, it is also proved that VP-CDNN can restrain the noise efficiently. Simulations among the VP-CDNN, gradient-based recurrent neural network and zeroing neural network verify that the VP-CDNN has faster speed, higher accuracy, and stronger robustness. At last, applications to data fitting and system identification further verify the high effectiveness and efficiency of the VP-CDNN.},

This test can be applied to nonlinear systems described by meromorphic vector fields (whose components are fractions of analytic functions). The test consists in checking the rank of a certain finite matrix (which extends to a nonlinear case the classical “controllability matrix” of linear systems theory) and, unlike the classical accessibility test, always terminates giving an exhaustive answer (yes/no) within a fixed number of steps. Further, a generic feature of accessibility is proven: the accessibility from a point p of the system analyticity domain implies the accessibility from almost every point of the domain (generic strong accessibility). The paper provides two simple examples, which illustrate the proposed analytic test and its advantages with respect to the existing results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of disturbance attenuation with internal stability for nonlinear, input-affine systems via measurement feedback. The solution to the above-mentioned problem has been provided, three decades ago, in terms of the solution to a system of coupled nonlinear, first-order partial differential equations (PDEs). As a consequence, despite the rather elegant characterisation of the solution, the presence of PDEs renders the control design synthesis almost infeasible in practice. Therefore, to circumvent such a computational bottle-neck, in this paper we provide a novel characterisation of the exact solution to the problem that does not hinge upon the explicit computation of the solution to any PDE. The result is achieved by considering the immersion of the nonlinear dynamics into an extended system for which locally positive definite functions solving the required PDEs may be directly provided in closed form by relying only on the solutions to Riccati-like, state-dependent, algebraic matrix equations.},

With the idling mechanism, each node i, at each iteration k, is active-updates its solution estimate and exchanges messages with its network neighborhood-with probability p k , and it stays idle with probability 1 - p k , while the activations are independent both across nodes and across iterations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the idling mechanism can be successfully incorporated in distributed second-order methods also. Specifically, we apply the idling mechanism to the recently proposed distributed quasi-Newton (DQN) method. We show that, when p k grows to one across iterations geometrically, DQN with idling exhibits very similar theoretical convergence and convergence rates properties as the standard DQN method, thus achieving the same order of convergence rate (R-linear) as the standard DQN, but with significantly cheaper updates.},

As a consequence, the robustness and reliability for consensus of networked rigid spacecraft systems can be greatly improved. By establishing a series of technical lemmas, it is shown that leader-following attitude consensus of switched networked rigid spacecraft systems can be achieved.

Due to the rigidity preservation property, the proposed controller guarantees almost global convergence to a formation satisfying predefined angle constraints. Moreover, we give a definition of “sign” for strongly nondegenerate triangulated frameworks. By implementing the proposed control strategy, the target formation shape is guaranteed to be stable provided its sign is identical to that of the initial formation.

We show that the convergence can be ensured provided that the event-triggering threshold bound is square summable, and the stepsize satisfies specific conditions that are characterized by the Lipschitz constant of the gradient and the spectrum of the mixing matrix associated with the network topology. Stronger convergence results are derived for the strongly convex case, i.e., the local estimate of the minimizer linearly converges to the minimizer until reaching an error floor whose magnitude is shown to be proportional to the stepsize if the triggering threshold bound linearly converges. Comprehensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the correctness of the theoretical results and advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing ones.},

The effects of the network-induced error and sensor faults are compressed by introducing some auxiliary filters and a bound estimation approach. Additionally, by introducing some differentiable auxiliary functions and high-order Lyapunov functions, we successfully circumvent the obstacle caused by unknown control direction and completely avoid Zeno phenomenon. The proposed scheme is able to ensure that all closed-loop signals are globally uniformly bounded and the tracking error converges to a residual set.

  abstract     = {When using standard learning techniques for uncertainty approximation, persistently exciting inputs are necessary in order to achieve good parameter estimation. It has been shown in recent years that, through concurrent learning (CL), it is possible to achieve better learning without requiring persistency of excitation. We define good learning here by how well an uncertainty can be reconstructed given the estimated parameters. Most studies concerning CL have however been done in the continuous-time (CT) framework. While working with discrete-time (DT) structured uncertainties, we have shown in an earlier study that the concept of CL could be used to solve the parameter identification problem granted, much like in the CT domain, a less restrictive condition compared to that of persistency of excitation is verified. This paper furthers our fundamental study of CL in the DT framework while drawing comparisons with the traditional but fundamental gradient descent technique. As a main contribution, via formal derivations, we present a generalized gradient-based CL motivated DT algorithm for online approximation of both DT structured and unstructured uncertainties. Numerical simulations are provided to show how well the designed algorithm leverages memory usage to achieve better learning.},

This is the alternative to the traditionally used Riccati recursion and it yields the so-called fast implementations known as the Morf-Sidhu-Kailath-Sayed KF algorithms. They are proved to be computationally cheap because of propagating the matrices of a smaller size than n × n error covariance matrix in the Riccati recursion. The problem of deriving the Chandrasekhar-type recursion within the MCC estimation methodology has never been raised yet in engineering literature. In this technical note, we do the first step and derive the Chandrasekhar MCC-KF estimators for the case of adaptive kernel size selection strategy, which implies a constant scalar adjusting weight. Numerical examples substantiate a practical feasibility of the newly suggested MCC-KF implementations and correctness of the presented theoretical derivations.},

First, the properties of this class of pathways are investigated through a network model, which consists of a chain of enzymatically catalyzed intermediate reactions coupled with an autocatalytic component. We explicitly derive a hard limit on the minimum achievable L 2 -gain disturbance attenuation and a hard limit on its minimum required output energy.

  abstract     = {Integrated cyber-physical systems, such as the smart-grid, are increasingly becoming the underpinning technology for major industries. A major concern regarding such systems are the seemingly unexpected large scale failures, which are often attributed to a small initial shock getting escalated due to intricate dependencies within and across the individual (e.g., cyber and physical) counterparts of the system. In this paper, we develop a novel interdependent system model to capture this phenomenon, also known as cascading failures. Our framework consists of two networks that have inherently different characteristics governing their intradependence: first, a cyber-network where a node is deemed to be functional as long as it belongs to the largest connected (i.e., giant) component; and, second, a physical network where nodes are given an initial flow and a capacity, and failure of a node results with redistribution of its flow to the remaining nodes, upon which further failures might take place due to overloading (i.e., the flow of a node exceeding its capacity). Furthermore, it is assumed that these two networks are interdependent. For simplicity, we consider a one-to-one interdependence model where every node in the cyber-network is dependent upon and supports a single node in the physical network, and vice versa. We provide a thorough analysis of the dynamics of cascading failures in this interdependent system initiated with a random attack. The system robustness is quantified as the surviving fraction of nodes at the end of cascading failures, and is derived in terms of all network parameters involved (e.g., degree distribution, load/capacity distribution, failure size, etc.). Analytic results are supported through an extensive numerical study. Among other things, these results demonstrate the ability of our model to capture the unexpected nature of large-scale failures, and provide insights on improving system robustness.},

Existing model-based control methodologies can handle only a subset of the above-mentioned complexities, and hence, become insufficient to accurately track the desired trajectory. In this paper, a prediction-based adaptive robust control framework is proposed for high performance control of dynamical systems subject to the above-mentioned complexities, which involves the following. First, prediction-based projection-type adaptation laws with model compensation to reduce the effect of parameter uncertainties under delay and time-varying disturbances. Second, a robust prediction scheme that factors in both unknown parameters and disturbance uncertainties under delay to handle the resulting unmatched disturbances. Third, prediction-based continuous robust feedback to attenuate the cumulative effect of disturbance terms due to uncertain prediction. The controller guarantees semiglobal, exponential convergence of the tracking error with an ultimate error bound proportional to delay, disturbance, and controller gain. The controller effectiveness is demonstrated with an illustrative flight control example and compared with the baseline adaptive robust controller.},

The proposed algorithm extends the widely studied polling systems analysis to the case involving customers subject to second-order differential constraints. We provide provable guarantees on 1) safety, no collisions occur surely, and 2) performance, rigorous bounds on the expected delay.

The key difference of the proposed algorithm from the existing ones consists in the expanding truncations (so it is called the DSAAWET), by which the boundedness of the estimates can be guaranteed without imposing the growth-rate constraints on the local functions. The estimates generated by the DSAAWET are shown to converge almost surely to a consensus set, which belongs to a connected subset of the root set of the sum function. In comparison with the existing results, we impose weaker conditions on the local functions and on the observation noise. We then apply the proposed algorithm to two applications, one from signal processing and the other one from distributed optimization, and establish the almost sure convergence.

The proposed control algorithm is based on parametrization and splitting of the underlying optimization problem into one global coordination problem and a set of local optimization problems pertaining to individual subsystems. The local optimization problems are solved offline, via parametric optimization, while the coordination problem is solved online. The properties of the local parametric solutions are utilized to solve the coordination problem very efficiently. In particular, it is shown that, for a fixed number of coupling constraints, the coordination problem can be solved with a linear-time algorithm in a finite number of iterations if all subsystems have one-dimensional coordination parameters.},

However, RL struggles to provide hard guarantees on the behavior of the resulting control scheme. In contrast, nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and economic NMPC (ENMPC) are standard tools for the closed-loop optimal control of complex systems with constraints and limitations, and benefit from a rich theory to assess their closed-loop behavior. Unfortunately, the performance of (E)NMPC hinges on the quality of the model underlying the control scheme. In this paper, we show that an (E)NMPC scheme can be tuned to deliver the optimal policy of the real system even when using a wrong model. This result also holds for real systems having stochastic dynamics. This entails that ENMPC can be used as a new type of function approximator within RL. Furthermore, we investigate our results in the context of ENMPC and formally connect them to the concept of dissipativity, which is central for the ENMPC stability. Finally, we detail how these results can be used to deploy classic RL tools for tuning (E)NMPC schemes. We apply these tools on both, a classical linear MPC setting and a standard nonlinear example, from the ENMPC literature.},

In PETC, transmissions over the communication channel are triggered by an event generator, which depends solely on the available plant and controller data and is only evaluated at given sampling instants to enable its digital implementation. In this paper, we consider the general scenario, where the controller communicates with the plant via multiple decoupled networks. Each network may contain multiple nodes, in which case a dedicated protocol is used to schedule transmissions among these nodes. The transmission instants over the networks are asynchronous and generated by local event generators. At given sampling instants, the local event generator evaluates a rule, which only involves the measurements and the control inputs available locally, to decide whether a transmission is needed over the considered network. Following the emulation approach, we show how to design local triggering generators to ensure input-to-state stability and $\mathcal {L}_p$ stability for the overall system based on a continuous-time output-feedback controller that robustly stabilizes the network-free system. The method is applied to a class of Lipschitz nonlinear systems, for which we formulate the design conditions as linear matrix inequalities. The effectiveness of the scheme is illustrated via simulations of a nonlinear example.},

The objective of this paper is to synthesize an optimal-event generator and controller pair such that the state trajectory of the event-triggered system mimics that of the feedback system with arbitrary precision. The optimality is in the sense that the least number of state measurements are sent to the controller in order to compute the control signal. The results of this paper show that such an optimal event-triggered controller retains the linear structure when the continuous feedback controller is linear; and the optimal event generator follows a threshold-based policy, where the event generator decides to send the state measurement to the controller every time a certain signal exceeds that threshold. Finally, the similar framework was extended for a controller synthesis of infinite horizon.The structural properties of the optimal event-triggered controller and event generator remain unchanged when extended to an infinite horizon.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider dynamic channel allocation for remote state estimation of multiagent systems. For each subsystem, a sensor measures its state and transmits the data via a packet-dropping channel, which is dynamically allocated by the remote estimator. We first formulate the problem as a Markov decision process. Given the difficulty of obtaining an optimal policy of large-scale problems, we develop a suboptimal heuristic policy based on the Whittle index for the restless multiarmed bandit (RMAB) problem. The performance of the Whittle index policy is evaluated from both theoretical and practical aspects. The strong performance of Whittle index policy is illustrated by the numerical examples.},

The proposed algorithms give rise to rational approximations with real coefficients to transfer functions. Owing to the modified maximal selection principles, the algorithms achieve a fast convergence rate O(n -1/2 ).

As the first application of this new Lyapunov criterion, we look at the product of any random sequence of stochastic matrices, including those with zero diagonal entries, and obtain sufficient conditions to ensure the product almost surely converges to a matrix with identical rows; we also show that the rate of convergence can be exponential under additional conditions.

The quality of the approximation improves as length of the noise vector grows and the class of problems for which the approximation is asymptotically not exact approaches a set of measure zero. We show that if the optimal strategies for problems with log-concave noise converge pointwise, they do so to the (linear) optimal strategy for the problem with Gaussian noise.

The highlight of this method is that the markings set consistent with a given observation can be determined by a linear algebraic system based on the so-called slow-bound marking and fast-bound marking pairs. An algorithm to compute an online estimator is provided, and an example is given. By this method, the exhaustive construction of the full state space including the state class graph is avoided.

This paper tries to further close this performance gap for reachability analysis of linear systems. Reachability analysis can capture the whole set of possible solutions of a dynamic system and is thus used to prove that unsafe states are never reached; this requires full consideration of arbitrarily varying uncertain inputs, since sensor noise or disturbances usually do not follow any patterns. We use Krylov methods in this paper to compute reachable sets for large-scale linear systems. While Krylov methods have been used before in reachability analysis, we overcome the previous limitation that inputs must be (piecewise) constant. As a result, we can compute reachable sets of systems with several thousand state variables for bounded, but arbitrarily varying inputs.},

A modified σ-error mean square stability (σ-MSS) is proposed by considering the weight of expected operation time in each actual system mode. Based on the new σ-MSS, together with a class of Lyapunov functions depending on both the system modes and the corresponding observed ones, numerically checkable conditions on the existence of the OMD filter are presented such that the estimation error system is σ-MSS with a prescribed H ∞ disturbance attenuation level.

The dynamic regret is employed to measure performance of the algorithm. Under mild conditions on the graph, it is shown that if the increasing rate of minimizer sequence&#39;s deviation is within a certain range, then the bound of each dynamic regret function grows sublinearly. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the impact of reset attacks in cyber-physical systems. Two types of attack models, basic and advanced reset attacks, are considered in this paper. For the basic attack, which only injects a constant to the state estimate without knowing the system parameters, we provide a sufficient and necessary condition under which the adversary cannot destabilize the systems. On the other hand, advanced reset attacks, which can inject a predesigned sequence with full knowledge of system parameters, can be more devastating to cyber-physical systems. Depending on the goals of the adversary, we further categorize advanced reset attacks into Type-I advanced reset attack, where the adversary aims to drive the system estimation error to infinity, and Type-II advanced reset attack, where the goal of the adversary is to drive the system state to some other target states. A sufficient and necessary condition is presented for the existence of Type-I advanced reset attack. A closed-form optimal Type-II advanced reset attack is obtained by dynamic programing. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of both advanced reset attacks.},

It is well known that a synchronizing controller can be constructed when a common reference model is available to (some of) the agents. In this note, we show that synchronization can also be achieved without any access to such reference, by letting the agents cooperatively learn a suitable common model, which we refer to as group model. We show that there exists a group model that has the same structure as the oscillators and that the agents can learn its parameters and synchronize to it, by using a combination of consensus dynamics and adaptive regulation. This learning is even possible if the agents do not know their own dynamics, by using adaptive state observers. The distinguishing feature of this approach is making the agents collectively self-organize to their natural group model, instead of making them synchronize to an external reference.},

  abstract     = {Based on the P-type composition of Petri nets (PNs) defined in this paper, a framework for a structural control of discrete event systems (DESs) is constructed such that a closed-loop PN is obtained by composing a plant PN and a controller. As for a disjunction or conjunctive normal form (CNF) of linear constraints, a new approach is proposed to design a structural controller in this framework. First, a switching-net is defined for a disjunction of constraints, and an extended plant is obtained through the P-type composition of a plant PN and switching-net. Second, the disjunction of bounded constraints is transformed into a conjunction of switching-constraints on the extended plant. Third, a controller is synthesized by designing monitors for conjunctive switching-constraints according to a supervision-based-on-place-invariant method. Fourth, in a similar manner, a controller is also designed for a CNF of bounded constraints. The resulting controller is maximally permissive if each disjunction of constraints meets the jump-free condition, and its size grows polynomially with the number of constraints. Another advantage is that the closed-loop system is still a PN for many real DES since a CNF can describe not only convex but also nonconvex state regions.},

Based upon the presented model, the filtering problem has been investigated, while the system dynamics have been represented. As the model output is the entropy of the estimation error, the optimal nonlinear filter is obtained based on the Lyapunov design, which makes the model output minimum. Moreover, the entropy assignment problem has been discussed as an extension of the presented approach. To verify the presented design procedure, a numerical example is given, which illustrates the effectiveness of the presented algorithm. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: 1) an output entropy model is presented using a neural network; 2) a nonlinear filter design algorithm is developed as the main result; and 3) a solution of the entropy assignment problem is obtained, which is an extension of the presented framework.},

Our attention is to design sliding mode control law to attenuate the influences of uncertainty and nonlinear term. First, by the use of the Lyapunov function, a set of sufficient conditions are developed such that the closed-loop sliding mode dynamics are stochastically admissible.

We show that deciding critical observability is: 1) NL-complete for finite automata, i.e., it is efficiently verifiable on parallel computers; 2) PSPACE-complete for networks of finite automata, i.e., it is very unlikely solvable in polynomial time; and 3) undecidable for labeled Petri nets, but becoming decidable if the set of critical states (markings) is finite or cofinite, in which case the problem is as hard as the nonreachability problem for Petri nets.},

Random gradient-free oracle instead of the true gradient information is built locally such that the estimated gradient information is utilized in guiding the update of decision variables. Thus, the algorithm requires no explicit expressions but only local measurements of the cost functions. The row-stochastic and column-stochastic matrices are used as the weighting matrices during the communication with neighbors, making the algorithm convenient to implement in directed graphs as compared with the doubly stochastic weighting matrix. Without the true gradient information, we establish asymptotic convergence to the approximated optimal solution, where the optimality gap can be set arbitrarily small. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed algorithm achieves the same rate of convergence O(ln t/√t) as the state-of-the-art gradient-based methods with similar settings, but having the advantages of less required information and more practical communication topologies.},

We further show that when the vector field is polynomial, the Lyapunov inequalities on both the rational function and its derivative have sum of squares certificates and, hence, such a Lyapunov function can always be found by semidefinite programming. This generalizes the classical fact that an asymptotically stable linear system admits a quadratic Lyapunov function, which satisfies a certain linear matrix inequality. In addition to homogeneous vector fields, the result can be useful for showing local asymptotic stability of nonhomogeneous systems by proving asymptotic stability of their lowest order homogeneous component. This paper also includes some negative results: We show that in absence of homogeneity, globally asymptotically stable polynomial vector fields may fail to admit a global rational Lyapunov function, and in presence of homogeneity, the degree of the numerator of a rational Lyapunov function may need to be arbitrarily high (even for vector fields of fixed degree and dimension). On the other hand, we also give a family of homogeneous polynomial vector fields that admit a low-degree rational Lyapunov function but necessitate polynomial Lyapunov functions of arbitrarily high degree. This shows the potential benefits of working with rational Lyapunov functions, particularly as the ones whose existence we guarantee have structured denominators and are not more expensive to search for than polynomial ones.},

To solve this problem, we design a set of event-triggering conditions, which is updated for each triggering. At the same time, the input-to-state stable assumption is not needed. It is shown that the proposed control schemes guarantee that all the closed-loop signals are globally bounded and the stabilization error converges to the origin asymptotically. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of our scheme.},

Accordingly, we decompose the supervisor into a set of partial-observation local controllers one for each prohibitible event, as well as a set of partial-observation local preemptors one for each forcible event. We prove that these local controllers and preemptors collectively achieve the same controlled behavior as the partial-observation monolithic supervisor does.

Generally speaking, when the output of the system contains UIs, the reduced-order observer design will become much more challenging. In order to overcome the difficulty brought by the UIs in the output, first, by introducing a new UI vector, a new equivalent system is obtained, which does not contain UIs in the corresponding output any more. Then, for the purpose of reduced-order observer design, the observer matching condition (OMC) and the minimal phase condition (MPC) are discussed, and it is shown that the new general system maintains both the OMC and the MPC. Subsequently, based on the discussions on the existence conditions, a reduced-order unknown input observer is developed to asymptotically estimate the state of the original system. Finally, an electronic circuit example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Then, a numerically verifiable consensus criterion in terms of the feasibility of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is proposed. Furthermore, analytic sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for mean square consensusability are provided for general MASs. The case with nonidentical packet loss is studied subsequently. The necessary and sufficient consensus condition and a sufficient consensus condition in terms of LMIs are proposed. In the end, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the derived results.},

To be lossless, the device must be passive (i.e., not requiring a power supply) and nondissipative. To be adjustable, a parameter of the device should be freely variable in real time as a control input. For the simplest lossless one-ports, the spring and inerter, the question is whether the stiffness and inertance may be varied freely in a lossless manner. We will show that the typical laws which have been proposed for adjustable springs and inerters are necessarily active, and that it is not straightforward to modify them to achieve losslessness, or indeed, passivity. By means of a physical construction using a lever with moveable fulcrum, we will derive device laws for adjustable springs and inerters which satisfy a formal definition of losslessness. We further provide a construction method which does not require a power supply for physically realizable translational and rotary springs and inerters. The analogous questions for lossless adjustable electrical devices are examined.},

Such a graph is called partial modified state class graph (PMSCG) and is derived from another graph recently presented in the literature.

We prove that each agent can learn its state by combining a local Bayesian classifier with a (centralized) Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator of the parameter-hyperparameter. To overcome the intractability of the ML problem, we provide two relaxed probabilistic models that lead to distributed estimation schemes with affordable complexity.

These bounds provide additional information which may help solve R&amp;S problems. In this paper, a new method of objective function estimation is proposed using both bound information and simulation outputs. This new estimation method is demonstrated to be particularly effective. To solve R&amp;S problems, several asymptotic optimal allocation rules are also derived. Using these allocation rules, a BSBA procedure is proposed to achieve high efficiency in identifying the best design. Numerical experiments are provided to examine the performance of the proposed BSBA procedure. The computational results show that BSBA outperforms three compared allocation procedures, especially when bounds are tight or the simulation budget is small.},

In this formulation, each agent is influenced by only a subset of the entries of a global parameter vector or model, and is subject to convex constraints that are only known locally. Problems of this type arise in several applications, most notably in disease propagation models, minimum-cost flow problems, distributed control formulations, and distributed power system monitoring. This paper focuses on stochastic settings, where a stochastic risk function is associated with each agent and the objective is to seek the minimizer of the aggregate sum of all risks subject to a set of constraints. Agents are not aware of the statistical distribution of the data and, therefore, can only rely on stochastic approximations in their learning strategies. We derive an effective distributed learning strategy that is able to track drifts in the underlying parameter model. A detailed performance and stability analysis is carried out showing that the resulting coupled diffusion strategy converges at a linear rate to an O(μ) neighborhood of the true penalized optimizer.},

The systems under consideration is more general, which not only relaxes the conventional hypothesis on S-MJLSs that all the ST-PDFs and TPs are completely known but also covers systems with completely known and completely unknown ST-PDFs or TPs as special cases. By introducing the upper bound of sojourn time for each system mode, numerically testable stability criteria are established for S-MJLSs with incompletely available ST-PDFs and/or TPs in the sense of mean-square stability (MSS), and the existence conditions of desired stabilizing controller are developed to guarantee the MSS of closed-loop S-MJLSs.

  abstract     = {We study both the value function and Q-function formulation of the linear programming approach to approximate dynamic programming. The approach is model based and optimizes over a restricted function space to approximate the value function or Q-function. Working in the discrete time, continuous space setting, we provide guarantees for the fitting error and online performance of the policy. In particular, the online performance guarantee is obtained by analyzing an iterated version of the greedy policy, and the fitting error guarantee by analyzing an iterated version of the Bellman inequality. These guarantees complement the existing bounds that appear in the literature. The Q-function formulation offers benefits, for example, in the decentralized controller design, however, it can lead to computationally demanding optimization problems. To alleviate this drawback, we provide a condition that simplifies the formulation, resulting in improved computational times.},

  abstract     = {We consider finite model approximations of discrete-time partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) under the discounted cost criterion. After converting the original partially observed stochastic control problem to a fully observed one on the belief space, the finite models are obtained through the uniform quantization of the state and action spaces of the belief space Markov decision process (MDP). Under mild assumptions on the components of the original model, it is established that the policies obtained from these finite models are nearly optimal for the belief space MDP, and so, for the original partially observed problem. The assumptions essentially require that the belief space MDP satisfies a mild weak continuity condition. We provide an example and introduce explicit approximation procedures for the quantization of the set of probability measures on the state space of POMDP (i.e., belief space).},

The “empirical” nature comes from each iteration being done empirically from samples available from simulations of the next state. This makes the Bellman operator a random operator. A parametric and a nonparametric method for function approximation using a parametric function space and a reproducing kernel Hilbert space respectively are then combined with EVL. Both function spaces have the universal function approximation property. Basis functions are picked randomly. Convergence analysis is performed using a random operator framework with techniques from the theory of stochastic dominance. Finite time sample complexity bounds are derived for both universal approximate dynamic programming algorithms. Numerical experiments support the versatility and computational tractability of this approach.},

  abstract     = {The death spiral hypothesis in electric utility represents a positive feedback phenomenon in which a regulated utility is driven to financial instability by rising prices and declining demand. We establish conditions for the existence of death spiral and conditions of stable adoption of distributed energy resources. We show in particular that linear tariffs always induce death spiral when the fixed operating cost of the utility rises beyond a certain threshold. For two-part tariffs with connection and volumetric charges, the Ramsey pricing, which myopically optimizes social welfare subject to the revenue adequacy constraint, induces a stable equilibrium. The Ramsey pricing, however, inhibits renewable adoption with a high connection charge. In contrast, a two-part tariff with a small connection charge results in a stable adoption process with a higher level of renewable adoption and greater long-term total consumer surplus. Market data are used to illustrate various solar adoption scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Periodic orbits often describe desired state trajectories of dynamical systems in various engineering applications. Stability analysis of periodic solutions lays a foundation for control design to achieve convergence to a prescribed orbit. Here we consider a class of perturbed nonlinear systems with fast and slow dynamics and develop a novel averaging method for analyzing the local exponential orbital stability of a periodic solution. A framework is then proposed for feedback control design to stabilize a natural oscillation of an uncertain nonlinear system using a synchronous adaptive oscillator. The idea is applied to linear mechanical systems and a design theory is established. In particular, we propose a controller based on the Andronov-Hopf oscillator with additional adaptation mechanisms for estimating the unknown natural frequency and damping parameters. We prove that, with sufficiently slow adaptation, the estimated parameters locally converge to their true values and entrainment to the natural oscillation is achieved as part of an orbitally stable limit cycle. Numerical examples demonstrate that adaptation and convergence can in fact be fast.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by robotic surveillance applications, this paper studies the novel problem of maximizing the return time entropy of a Markov chain, subject to a graph topology with travel times and stationary distribution. The return time entropy is the weighted average, over all graph nodes, of the entropy of the first return times of the Markov chain; this objective function is a function series that does not admit, in general, a closed form. This paper features theoretical and computational contributions. First, we obtain a discrete-time delayed linear system for the return time probability distribution and establish its convergence properties. We show that the objective function is continuous over a compact set and therefore admits a global maximum. We then establish upper and lower bounds between the return time entropy and the well-known entropy rate of the Markov chain. To compute the optimal Markov chain numerically, we establish the asymptotic equality between entropy, conditional entropy, and truncated entropy, and propose an iteration to compute the gradient of the truncated entropy. Finally, we apply these results to the robotic surveillance problem. Our numerical results show that for a model of rational intruder over prototypical graph topologies and test cases, the maximum return time entropy Markov chain outperforms several pre-existing Markov chains.},

Adaptive partial-state feedback control designs are developed for relative-degree-one plants and for general plants. Both adaptive control designs ensure closed-loop system stability and asymptotic output tracking. New results are presented for plant-model matching, error model, adaptive law, and stability analysis. New features of partial-state feedback MRAC are addressed, including its design flexibility.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate a distributed estimation problem for multiagent systems with state equality constraints (SEC). First, under a time-based consensus communication protocol, applying a modified projection operator and the covariance intersection fusion method, we propose a distributed Kalman filter with guaranteed consistency and satisfied SEC. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between consensus step, SEC, and estimation error covariance in dynamic and steady processes, respectively. Employing a space decomposition method, we show that the error covariance in the constraint set can be arbitrarily small by setting a sufficiently large consensus step. Besides, we propose an extended collective observability (ECO) condition based on SEC, which is milder than existing observability conditions. Under the ECO condition, through utilizing a technique of matrix approximation, we prove the boundedness of error covariance and the exponentially asymptotic unbiasedness of state estimate, respectively. Moreover, under the ECO condition for linear time-invariant systems with SEC, we provide a novel event-triggered communication protocol by employing the consistency, and give an offline design principle of triggering thresholds with guaranteed boundedness of error covariance. More importantly, we quantify and analyze the communication rate for the proposed event-triggered distributed Kalman filter, and provide optimization based methods to obtain the minimal (maximal) successive nontriggering (triggering) times. Two simulations are provided to demonstrate the developed theoretical results and the effectiveness of the filters.},

  abstract     = {The explicit reference governor (ERG) is a simple and systematic approach that provides constraint handling capabilities to prestabilized systems. The basic idea behind this approach is to translate state and input constraints into an upper-bound on the value of the Lyapunov function, which is then enforced by suitably manipulating the derivative of the applied reference. When designing the ERG, one of the main challenges is the determination of an upper-bound on the value of the Lyapunov function that ensures constraints satisfaction. This paper proposes a systematic approach for estimating online the optimal upper-bound for systems subject to the intersection of concave constraints. To do this, the Barrier function method is used. The effect of the estimation error caused by the time-varying nature of the auxiliary reference on the constraint satisfaction capability of the ERG is studied analytically. A procedure is proposed to modify the estimated upper-bound to avoid constraints violation in the presence of estimation errors. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through a simulation study on an overhead gantry crane system.},
