  abstract     = {The substantial growth of online learning, and in particular, through massively open online courses (MOOCs), supports research into nontraditional learning contexts. Learners&#39; confusion is one of the identified aspects which impact the overall learning process, and ultimately, course attrition. Confusion for a learner is an individual state of bewilderment and uncertainty as to how to move forward. The majority of recent works in MOOCs neglects the individual factor and measure the influence of community-related aspects (e.g., votes, views) for confusion classification. While these are useful measures, these models neglect the personalized context, such as an individual&#39;s affect or emotions. Toward this, and within the MOOC context, we propose machine learning models based solely on language and discourse features extracted from learners&#39; discussion posts. With over 83% F1-score in all domains, it is evident that linguistic-only features are highly effective in confusion classification, with our models outperforming previous models developed for confusion classification. In this article, we also obtain good performance for cross-domain confusion classification between 70.7% and 84.5% F1-score for all domain pairs (i.e., training on one domain and testing on another domain). Primarily, this article contributes through the development of a novel linguistic feature set that is predictive for effective confusion classification.},

  abstract     = {The recent focus on learning analytics (LA) to analyze temporal dimensions of learning holds the promise of providing insights into latent constructs, such as learning strategy, self-regulated learning (SRL), and metacognition. These methods seek to provide an enriched view of learner behaviors beyond the scope of commonly used correlational or cross-sectional methods. In this article, we present a methodological sequence of techniques that comprises: 1) the strategic clustering of learner types; 2) the use of microlevel processing to transform raw trace data into SRL processes; and 3) the use of a novel process mining algorithm to explore the generated SRL processes. We call this the “Trace-SRL” framework. Through this framework, we explored the use of microlevel process analysis and process mining (PM) techniques to identify optimal and suboptimal traits of SRL. We analyzed trace data collected from online activities of a sample of nearly 300 computer engineering undergraduate students enrolled on a course that followed a flipped class-room pedagogy. We found that using a theory-driven approach to PM, a detailed account of SRL processes emerged, which could not be obtained from frequency measures alone. PM, as a means of learner pattern discovery, promises a more temporally nuanced analysis of SRL. Moreover, the results showed that more successful students regularly engage in a higher number of SRL behaviors than their less successful counterparts. This suggests that not all students are sufficiently able to regulate their learning, which is an important finding for both theory and LA, and future technologies that support SRL.},

  abstract     = {Research on instructional design provides inconsistent results on the use of game elements in cognitive tasks or learning. Cognitive load theory suggests that game elements increase extraneous cognitive load and, thus, may distract the users. In contrast, from an emotional design perspective, the use of game elements is argued to increase performance by providing a more interesting and motivating task environment. To contribute to this debate, the current study investigated the effect of game elements on behavioral performance, attention, and motivation. We designed two versions of the number line estimation task-one with game elements and one without. Participants completed both versions of the task while their eye-fixation behavior was recorded. Results indicated that participants paid attention to game elements, that is, they fixated them, although they were not necessary to complete the task. However, no difference in estimation accuracy was observed between the two task versions. Moreover, the task version with game elements was rated to be more attractive, stimulating, and novel, and participants reported experiencing greater flow. In sum, these data indicate that game elements seem to capture attention but also increase motivational aspects of learning tasks rather than decreasing performance.},

In this article, we investigate the benefits of the feedback-enriched simulation environment (FENIkS) for learning fundamental UI design principles toward designing the functional aspects of a UI. FENIkS is a model-driven educational environment making use of simulation as learning support by generating a UI and the underlying application starting from conceptual domain and presentation models. The generated application and UI contain feedback elements for the learners. This feedback shows if the generated prototype is compliant with certain key design principles and why the principles are considered to be well applied or not. We conducted an experiment using bachelor-level courses to observe the effects of FENIkS on the learning of UI design principles by novice UI designers. The effectiveness of FENIkS was measured by comparing the results of students on a test performed without and with the use of FENIkS, using statistical methods. The findings show an improvement in student&#39;s learning of UI design principles when using the FENIkS approach.},

  abstract     = {Accurately tracing the state of learner knowledge contributes to providing high-quality intelligent support for computer-supported programming learning. However, knowledge tracing is difficult when learners have only had a few practice opportunities, which is often common in block-based programming. This article proposed two knowledge tracing models that can exploit the problem-solving process data generated by learners from a single programming task. A novel metric, the approaching index, was developed using the tree edit distance in abstract syntax trees to measure the similarities between the learners&#39; intermediate solutions and the optimal solution. The proposed method allows for each learner&#39;s programming path to be represented as a raw approaching index sequence (AISeq) or as a single variable (AIScore) by averaging the AISeq. A logistic regression model was first designed to predict the learners&#39; performances using their AIScore, the number of attempts, and their current performance. A second model, a recurrent neural network model, was also developed to directly use the AISeq and to make predictions. To verify the effectiveness of these models, a series of statistical analyses and experiments were conducted on two existing large-scale block-based programming datasets, the results from which revealed that the proposed models were competitive with four state-of-the-art models on multiple metrics, such as the precision-recall curve, accuracy, specificity, and Cohen&#39;s Kappa. Especially, the proposed models were found to be more robust than the compared models in predicting who would fail to complete the tasks.},

Games have been shown to possess powerful motivators that fuel a person&#39;s desire to engage in unattractive activities, such as learning theoretical material. However, to design an educational game that is capable of providing motivated engagement is a challenging task. Previous research has proposed various game motivators and game design principles to alleviate this, but a comprehensive synthesis has yet to appear. In this article, we conducted a systematic literature review that yielded two major contributions: 1) a taxonomy of 56 game motivators in 14 classes; and 2) a taxonomy of 54 educational game design principles in 13 classes, with linkages to the identified game motivators. As a minor contribution, we have also presented a classification of gamification-related terms and proposed different strategies for applying gamification. The results of this article are available for educational game designers and researchers to use as a practical toolkit for the creation and evaluation of motivating educational games that keep players engaged. Moreover, this article is the first step toward the creation of a unified gamification framework.},

This, in turn, results in latency. In addition, existing data models are inefficient in storing computed results, which are often required for follow-up analysis. These follow-up analyses depend largely on stakeholder objectives, which often impose constraints to the analysis process. In this article, we propose a context-based data model that addresses two challenges associated with learning analytics: the increased processing time due to multiple data granularities required from various stakeholder objectives, and the lack of support for archiving and updating of new information that exist during iterative analysis. We demonstrate how the proposed model can help support analysis and visualization via the XuetangX and ASSISTments datasets. Results show that although our proposed data model requires preprocessing, it requires less time to process queries associated with learning-activity attributes of various granularities compared to existing data models.},

  abstract     = {The concept of privacy in online social networks (OSNs) is a challenge, especially for teenagers. Previous works deal with teaching about privacy using educational online content, and media literacy. However, these tools do not necessarily promote less risky behaviors, and do not allow the assessment of users&#39; behavior after the learning period. Moreover, few research studies about the effects of social gamification have been performed for this population segment (i.e., teenagers). To address this problem in this article, we propose the use of gamification in an OSN called Pesedia to facilitate the teaching/learning process, and assess its effectiveness in promoting suitable privacy behaviors. We tested our proposal comparing teenagers&#39; performance in two editions of a course about social networks, and privacy (with, and without gamification) for one month. We measured the impact of gamification in the participants&#39; behaviors toward privacy concepts as a consequence of the privacy teaching/learning process, and the participants&#39; engagement in the educational process. The results show that there are significant differences in participants&#39; behavior regarding privacy, and engagement in the gamified social network. Moreover, there is also a significant difference in participants&#39; engagement for the gamified male participants. The gamified social network proposed in this article may be relevant, and useful for educators who wish to develop, and enhance teenagers&#39; privacy skills, or for a broader base of aspects related to the development of digital competences, and technology in education.},

We use the control value theory (CVT) as the theoretical base of measuring emotions. Using this theory, learner emotions are directly tied to their achievements. We develop two fuzzy inference systems, one to measure academic self-efficacy (ASE), that we call ASEMEL, and another to measure task value, TAVAMEL. These two factors, according to the CVT, can identify the prospective outcome emotions in a learning environment. We conducted our experiment in an LMS with a sample of 30 students and validated the performance of our nonsurvey-based systems by comparing the results with the measures of an equivalent survey-based method. Finally, by linking our ASEMEL and TAVAMEL results, our system anticipated “hopelessness,” “anticipated relief” and “no emotion” with 97% accuracy, “hope/anxiety” with 77% accuracy, and “anticipatory joy” with 87% accuracy compared with the self-reports of the students.},

  abstract     = {With the wide availability of mobile devices and the growing interest in social media, numerous applications have emerged to support student engagement in the classroom. There is conflicting evidence, however, on whether the engagement benefits of such applications outweigh their potential cost as a source of disaffection. To investigate these issues, this article presents a case study on the usage of a social media app (SpeakUp) during a semester-long face-to-face university course, and its relations with the context and the learning outcomes. In this mixed-methods study, we gathered data from multiple sources (video recordings of the lessons, SpeakUp logs and messages, student questionnaires, and course assessments) in order to extract self-reported and observable behavioral and emotional indicators. Our findings reveal that simple measures of behavioral engagement were insufficient to predict academic performance. Nevertheless, our models significantly improved using relatively simple and unobtrusive indicators of both behavioral and emotional engagement and disaffection. This article also indicates that the mere introduction of social media in educational settings does not guarantee a positive impact on learning. To promote an effective use of social media in the classroom (raising engagement while avoiding disaffection), teachers need to design the learning activities aligning the use of social media with the learning goals.},

  abstract     = {Increasing school dropout rates are a problem in many educational systems, with student disengagement being one significant factor. Learning analytics is a new field with a key role in educational institutions in the coming years. It may help make strategic decisions to reduce student disengagement. The use of technology in educational environments has grown significantly and, with it, awareness of the importance of student engagement. We exploit tracking and wearable technologies to increase user engagement in learning processes, exploring also the area of multimodal learning analytics (MMLA). We use wearables and Internet of Things for education, an interactive and collaborative system designed to improve motivation and learning. This article presents the results obtained in different experiments conducted in a secondary school in a long-term participatory learning context. The captured data were analyzed and used to identify different students&#39; behavior patterns, showing their progress and motivation. Subsequently, from the captured data and aiming at a decision-making phase, we used machine learning techniques and MMLA methodologies to construct models able to “explain” when student engagement is present, so this knowledge can later be exploited. In particular, we chose decision trees and rule systems based on a set of variables with proven relevance to the problem. The evaluation of this novel engagement classification system confirms the high performance of these variables. The rules obtained, which can be easily interpreted by a nonexpert, help the teacher to observe, analyze, and make decisions with the purpose of fostering engagement.},

  abstract     = {Investigating and explaining the patterns of learners&#39; engagement in adaptive learning conditions is a core issue towards improving the quality of personalized learning services. This article collects learner data from multiple sources during an adaptive learning activity, and employs a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) approach to shed light to learners&#39; engagement patterns, with respect to their learning performance. Specifically, this article measures and codes learners&#39; engagement by fusing and compiling clickstreams (e.g., response time), physiological data (e.g., eye-tracking, electroencephalography, electrodermal activity), and survey data (e.g., goal-orientation) to determine what configurations of those data explain when learners can attain high or medium/low learning performance. For the evaluation of the approach, an empirical study with 32 undergraduates was conducted. The analysis revealed six configurations that explain learners&#39; high performance and three that explain learners&#39; medium/low performance, driven by engagement measures coming from the multimodal data. Since fsQCA explains the outcome of interest itself, rather than its variance, these findings advance our understanding on the combined effect of the multiple indicators of engagement on learners&#39; performance. Limitations and potential implications of the findings are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Recent research shows that learners who are able to self-regulate their learning show greater levels of engagement with massive open online course (MOOC) content. To improve support for learners in their self-regulatory processes, researchers have proposed technological solutions to transform recorded MOOC data into actionable knowledge. However, studies providing empirical evidence on how these solutions impact learners&#39; engagement with the course and their self-regulatory behavior remain scarce. In this article, we present the results of an observational case study in which NoteMyProgress (NMP), a web-based tool designed to support learners&#39; self-regulation in MOOCs, is applied as an intervention in two MOOCs. The main aim of this article is to provide insights into how the support of learners&#39; self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies correlates with course engagement. We performed the evaluation using a sample of 263 learners and utilized distinct data sources in order to propose indicators for learners&#39; engagement with the course and NMP. Results show a positive correlation between learners&#39; final grades with NMP functionalities that support goal setting, organization (note taking), and self-reflection (social comparison) SRL strategies. Furthermore, we found no significant behavioral differences in how learners with low SRL and high SRL profiles engage with the course or NMP. Finally, we discuss how these results relate to prior work and the implications for future technological solutions that seek to promote engagement in MOOCs.},

Depending on the behaviors and needs of students that emerge in real educational situations, educators may need to orchestrate activity adaptations on the fly. These adaptations may range from the provision of additional scaffolding by the educator (e.g., the educator&#39;s participation in a group discussion) to a change in the planned pedagogical scenario (e.g., the duration). This article aims to contribute to the orchestration of technology-mediated collaborative learning sessions in a classroom context. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a teacher-facing dashboard that supports teachers in orchestrating scripted collaboration.

  abstract     = {Learning games have great potential to become an integral part of new classrooms of the future. One of the key reported benefits is the capacity to keep students deeply engaged during their learning process. Therefore, it is necessary to develop models that can measure quantitatively how learners are engaging with learning games to inform game designers and educators, and to find ways to maximize learner engagement. In this article, we present our proposal to multidimensionally measure engagement in a learning game over four dimensions: general activity, social, exploration, and quests. We apply metrics from these dimensions to data from The Radix Endeavor, an inquiry-based online game for STEM learning that has been tested in K-12 classrooms as part of a pilot study across numerous schools. Based on these dimensions, we apply clustering and report four different engagement profiles that we define as “integrally engaged,” “lone achiever,” “social explorer,” and “nonengaged.” We also use three variables (account type, class grade, and gender) to perform a cross-sectional analysis finding interesting, statistically significant differences in engagement. For example, in-school students and accounts registered to males engaged socially much more than out-of-school learners or accounts registered to females, and that older students have better performance metrics than younger ones.},

  abstract     = {Learning technologies enable interventions in the learning process aiming to improve learning. Learning analytics provides such interventions based on analysis of learner data, which are believed to have beneficial effects on both learning and the learning environment. Literature reporting on the effects of learning analytics interventions on learning allows us to assess in what way learning analytics improves learning. No standard set of operational definitions for learning affected by learning analytics interventions is available. We performed a systematic literature review of 1932 search hits, which yielded 62 key studies. We analyzed how affected learning was operationalized in these key studies and classified operational definitions into three categories: 1) learning environment; 2) learning process; and 3) learning outcome. A deepening analysis yielded a refined classification scheme with 11 subcategories. Most of the analyzed studies relate to either learning outcome or learning process. Only nine of the key studies relate to more than one category. Given the complex nature of applying learning analytics interventions in practice, measuring the effects on a wider spectrum of aspects can give more insight into the workings of learning analytics interventions on the different actors, processes, and outcomes involved. Based on the results of our review, we recommend making deliberate decisions on the (multiple) aspects of learning one tries to improve by applying learning analytics. Our refined classification with examples of operational definitions may help both academics and practitioners doing so, as it allows for a more structured, grounded, and comparable positioning of learning analytics benefits.},

Here, we report on differences observed among second language learners&#39; preferences for both conversational strategies according to their initial level of willingness to communicate and on variations of their willingness with respect to such differences. Although we found that most students generally preferred a combination of both strategies, learners&#39; preferences and the effects of the support provided by these strategies varied according to their level of willingness to communicate. Learners with lower willingness to communicate tended to prefer affective backchannels, whereas those with higher willingness to communicate seemed to favor communication strategies. These results were consistent with post-test results, which showed that learners&#39; expected willingness to communicate tended to be higher after interacting with systems embedding their preferred strategies. In sum, these results are preliminary evidence of the meaningfulness of accounting for such learners&#39; preferences in adaptively using and fading the strategies employed by conversational agents to motivate second language learners to communicate in the target language.},

Embodied learning can occur by watching an individual&#39;s body movement and also via human–computer interactions, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). In this article, we designed and implemented a novel virtual body-ownership AR/VR tool for human anatomy—the human muscular arm avatar (HMAA). HMAA utilizes embodiment-based body ownership to explore the human hand/forearm musculature. The HMAA was trialed with medical students to explore the extent to which it could be used to aid student learning. The key findings of the usability study suggest that 98% ( N = 100) of students found the tool extremely useful; 83% reported that the tool allowed them to engage with the learning materials, peers, and content effectively. Also, 10% of students mentioned that the HMAA fostered an embodied learning experience. This triggered an intentional exploration of instances suggesting embodiment in the data. HMAA is believed to have allowed individuals to visualize and conceptualize abstract ideas that would have been otherwise challenging using static models. The outcomes of this article indicate the significant potential of body-ownership-based self-learning tools for anatomy. However, further studies using learning outcomes are needed to investigate the potential advantages of body-ownership-based tools compared to current learning techniques.},

Their use increased, especially with the proliferation of nonconventional large-scale and online modes of teaching and learning, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). A well-designed peer-review system is expected to produce valid and reliable assessments of the artifacts created by participants. These systems notably vary in designs, particularly in the structure of the peer-review networks, i.e., how participants are linked to each other as creators and reviewers. To date, little research has been done on how different network structures impact a system&#39;s ability to accurately assess the quality of the evaluated artifacts. We begin to address this gap, using a simulation approach to demonstrate that two network characteristics-dispersion and reciprocity-may indeed affect assessment fidelity in peer-review systems in conjunction with other design choices, such as evaluation scale and aggregation method. We also outline directions for further investigations of peer-review systems design.},

In order to adaptively recommend reading comprehension materials to students engaged in computerized testing, the information in an item bank (a collection of test items stored in a dataset) must be effectively indexed. Familiarity with the topics present in the documents influences students&#39; reading performance. As different question types require different skills, we tag documents with topics and questions with their corresponding types to measure the students&#39; abilities and subsequently recommend relevant materials to them. However, automatic tagging has not been extensively studied in this field. In this article, we propose a document extraction attention network (DEAN) to accomplish the two aforementioned tasks. For topic tagging, DEAN utilizes questions to increase the sample size of documents implicitly through multitask learning. For type tagging, DEAN leverages the information gathered from documents, which aids in the task of prediction. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our mutual use of information obtained from documents and questions. Results indicate that DEAN outperforms commonly used text classification methods when tested on a reading comprehension dataset.},

  abstract     = {The creation of a process model is primarily a formalization task that faces the challenge of constructing a syntactically correct entity, which accurately reflects the semantics of reality, and is understandable to the model reader. This article proposes a framework called Model Judge, focused toward the two main actors in the process of learning process model creation: novice modelers and instructors. For modelers, the platform enables the automatic validation of the process models created from a textual description, providing explanations about quality issues in the model. Model Judge can provide diagnostics regarding model structure, writing style, and semantics by aligning annotated textual descriptions to models. For instructors, the platform facilitates the creation of modeling exercises by providing an editor to annotate the main parts of a textual description, which is empowered with natural language processing capabilities so that the annotation effort is minimized. So far around 300 students in process modeling courses of five different universities around the world have used the platform. The feedback gathered from some of these courses shows good potential in helping students to improve their learning experience, which might, in turn, impact process model quality and understandability. Moreover, our results show that instructors can benefit from getting insights into the evolution of modeling processes, including arising quality issues of single students, but also discovering tendencies in groups of students. Although the framework has been applied to process model creation, it could be extrapolated to other contexts where the creation of models based on a textual description plays an important role.},

  abstract     = {The use of learning management systems (LMSs) for learning and knowledge sharing has accelerated quickly both in education and corporate worlds. Despite the benefits brought by LMSs, the current systems still face significant challenges, including the lack of automation in generating quiz questions and managing courses. Over the past decade, more attention has been accorded to analyzing the rich learning data captured by the systems and developing tools that support contemporary learning modes. This article considers a popular LMS, Moodle, and showcases four innovative projects that aim to extend the system&#39;s capabilities and address the abovementioned problems: 1) the Quiz Making Language markup system; 2) an approach to learning analytics using ad-hoc reports and artificial intelligence enabled visualization; 3) automating course administration tasks; and 4) a 4-in-1 learning application for flipped learning. These projects target all main users of the system, including instructors, learners, and administrators. It is illustrated from this study that the innovative use of web technologies and learning analytics has great potentials in improving LMS user productivity, and supporting and informing learning.},

Authentic contexts contain rich resources wherein students can use authentic objects as aid in advanced educational technology-assisted mathematics learning. We designed Ubiquitous-Fraction (U-Fraction), a mobile application that helps students to learn fraction in authentic contexts and that integrates fraction concepts into daily contexts. This mixed study involved 80 fifth-grade Taiwanese students. We compared the learning achievements of students who used U-Fraction (experimental group) with those of students who used web-based tool and the traditional learning mode (control groups). We studied the students&#39; behaviors toward the use of U-Fraction in their learning activities and analyzed the relationship of students&#39; learning behavior with their learning achievements. Furthermore, we collected students&#39; perception of U-Fraction. Results demonstrated that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control groups in terms of learning achievements. In terms of learning behaviors, fraction concept/comparison learning with authentic photo taking and fraction addition/subtraction learning with authentic photo taking were most significantly correlated with learning achievement. It indicated that fraction can be learned better in an authentic environment. Furthermore, regression analysis showed that the assignment scores could significantly predict learning achievements. We found that most participants had positive perception toward U-Fraction and that they enjoyed using the photo-taking feature to solve fraction problems in their surroundings. Therefore, we suggest that fraction learning activities should be designed in a way that students are encouraged to apply through photo taking in authentic environments and the knowledge they have learned.},

However, only little technological support is tailored specifically toward CoPs and their particular strengths and challenges. Even worse, CoPs often do not possess the resources to host or develop a software ecosystem to support their activities. In this contribution, we describe a decentralized learning infrastructure for community knowledge building. It takes into account the constant change of these communities by providing a lightweight and scalable infrastructure, without the need for central coordination or facilitation. As a real use case, we implement a question-based dialog application for inquiry-based learning and ignorance modeling with our infrastructure. Additionally, we explore the possibility of using social bots to connect the services provided by the decentralized infrastructure to communication tools already present in most communities (e.g., chat platforms). Following a design science approach, we describe a multistep evaluation of both the infrastructure and application, together with the improvements made to the resulting artifacts of each step. Our results indicate the relevance of our approach, which may serve as an example of how decentralized learning infrastructures for learning outside of formal settings can be applied by CoPs for knowledge building.},

In this article, we introduce a data-driven probabilistic student flow approach to characterize prerequisite networks and study the distribution of graduation time based on the network topology and on the completion rate of the courses. We also present a method to identify courses that have a significant impact on graduation time. Our student flow approach is also capable of simulating the effects of policy changes and modifications of the network.

Despite being recognized as one of New Zealand&#39;s official languages, recent censuses have shown that fluent NZSL signers have been steadily decreasing. There is a cultural responsibility to preserve such languages, yet the combination of barriers to acquisition and the limited availability of effective teaching methods are standing in the way. In light of this, this article proposes a computer-assisted sign language learning system that incorporates virtual reality and validation-based feedback as tools to implement the experiential learning model. An implementation in the form of virtual reality NZSL is presented, targeting the set of NZSL alphabet. Results show that a vision-based classification method, using the Leap Motion controller, is a scalable, accurate, and usable solution for feedback-assisted manual language learning. A formative usability evaluation of n=10 participants showed promising results for engagement, confidence, and memory retention. The results indicate that virtual reality technology is uniquely situated as an innovative medium for the self-directed acquisition of manual languages. It is hoped this article inspires technology researchers to pursue collaborations with the deaf/Deaf community to design and develop pedagogical technology solutions for manual communication.},

  abstract     = {Social networking-based learning (SN-learning) is one of the most promising innovations to promote learning via a social network, and thus, providing a more interactive, student-centered, cooperative, and on-demand environment. In such an environment, group formation plays an important role to the effectiveness of learning process. Adequate groups foster student interactions and increase learning outcomes. However, group formation is a complex task and requires automatic approaches to produce the optimal results in short time. To this direction, this paper presents a novel genetic algorithm for student grouping in an SN-learning system. Its innovations pertain to the attributes used for the composition of groups and genetic operators applied. In particular, student attributes refer to the three main dimensions of learning in an SN-learning environment: academic, cognitive, and social. Regarding genetic operators, the algorithm performs two crossover operators: a modification of two-point crossover and a new approach, called one-point per group crossover. Evaluating the proposed algorithm performance, the results show that it is more efficient than simple genetic algorithm approach, and considers a larger number of parameters than usual. Moreover, from the pedagogical perspective, a positive students&#39; attitude and high acceptance toward our group formation method is indicated.},

A key component of such systems is wireless-enabled edge devices augmented with various types of sensors to represent the state of physical things and their context. This article presents a novel generic architecture for context-aware ubiquitous learning systems based on the Internet of Things (IoT) computing paradigm. A commonly used IoT edge device was used to implement four variants of the proposed architecture. The variants were based on advanced message queuing protocol, constrained application protocol (CoAP), message queue telemetry transport, and extensible messaging and presence protocol. All variants provided more than adequate performance for implementing ubiquitous learning scenarios. As expected, CoAP was generally more resource-efficient. However, practical differences in performance were so small that the choice of which architectural variant to use may depend on nonfunctional requirements such as reliability, security, maximum payload size, and ease of implementation.},

Learner-system discussion, editing or other interaction about the learner model can allow users to contribute more directly to the modeling process to increase its accuracy, while at the same time, further facilitating reflection as they justify their viewpoints to themselves and the system. Social learning can be supported by opening learner models to peers, helping learners to gauge their relative progress, and effectively seek collaborators.

Sim-Evolution focuses on high school students, so its interface was designed to be joyful, helping to engage them. Although it was designed based on the concept of population genetics, knowing it is not a requirement for exploring TENS. Sim-Evolution models the population of a hypothetic bird species in two possible vegetations: forest or veld. Individuals of this bird species vary over two characteristics (color and beak type), with three possible phenotypes for each one. The user can choose individuals to form an initial population and monitor variation through successive generations. Birds breed independently of their phenotype, and natural selection (based on the fitness of each trait) was the only driven factor of population variation. Sim-Evolution was evaluated with high school students during a biology class. Students were able to describe and analyze the simulation process from a scientific perspective, observing the phenomenon associated with TENS. They correctly associated the bird&#39;s evolution with different survivor rates associated with the different traits and identified evolution by natural selection as a population and not an individual/organism process. Our proposal opens the possibility that TENS simulator does not obligatorily require users to be familiar with population genetics concepts, which is especially interestingly for high school pedagogical uses.},

  abstract     = {A smart campus provides students who are geographically scattered with online tools to get access to learning resources and laboratories. Although these remote laboratories have the potential and capabilities to implement different learning experiments, most of them are configured in a static fashion, being able to serve only one experiment for a given period of time. This lack of adaptability and flexibility causes long waiting queues of students in certain overloaded remote laboratories, while others are underused. To overcome this limitation, a smart campus can incorporate new techniques and paradigms such as Network function virtualization (NFV) and Software-defined networking (SDN), which are rapidly modifying current cloud services and applications to provide autonomous and adaptive solutions. In this context, the main contribution of this paper is an SDN/NFV-based architecture with autonomic capabilities to adapt to the remote laboratories configuration according to the end-user demand. The proposed architecture will be able to optimize computing resources to ensure the users&#39; quality of service in a smart campus with remote laboratories. A use case with a remote laboratory, based on the control of a servo motor, shows how our solution can dynamically change the lab service under specific circumstances. Finally, experiments using diverse configurations and service descriptions show the performance and suitability of the proposal.},

  abstract     = {Learning computer programming is a challenging process. Among the current approaches for overcoming this challenge, visual programming languages (VPLs), such as Scratch, have shown very promising results for beginners. Interestingly, some higher education institutions have started to use VPLs to introduce basic programming concepts, mainly in CS1 courses. However, an important issue regarding Scratchs usage in higher education environments is that students may feel unmotivated being confronted by programming exercises that do not fulfill their individual expectations. To try and overcome this barrier, we propose CARAMBA, a Scratch extension including an exercise recommender system. Based on features, such as taste and complexity, CARAMBA is able to personalize student learning with Scratch by suitably suggesting exercises for students. An in-depth evaluation was conducted about the effects of our proposal on both the learning of basic concepts of CS1 and the overall performance of students. We adopted an equivalent pretest-posttest design with 88 college students at an Ecuadorian university. Results confirm that recommending exercises in Scratch had a positive effect on students programming learning abilities in terms of pass rates. In totality, the pass rate achieved by our proposal was over 52%, which is 8% higher than the rate achieved during a previous experience using only Scratch (without recommendation) and 21% higher than the historical results of traditional teaching (without Scratch). Furthermore, we analyzed the degree of exploitation of CARAMBA by students to portray two facts: students actually used CARAMBA and there was a significant, positive correlation between the utilization of CARAMBA and the scores obtained by the students.},

  abstract     = {Recommending educational resources to groups of students is a common task in collaborative learning contexts. However, differences in within-group motivational factors might lead to conflicts in students&#39; intention to use the resources. Previous methods fail to achieve high goodness of recommendation for the majority of students in heterogeneous groups. This study demonstrates a game-theoretic solution for recommending educational resources to homogeneous and heterogeneous groups. The group members are the players, the resources comprise the set of possible actions, and selecting those items that will maximize all students&#39; motivation in the collaborative activity is a problem of finding the Nash Equilibrium (NE). In case the NE is Pareto efficient, none of the players can get more payoff (motivation) without decreasing the payoff of any other player, indicating an optimal benefit for the group as a whole. The suggested approach was empirically evaluated in a controlled experiment with a real dataset. The relevance of each delivered item to its corresponding students was explored both from the perspective of the group and its the individual students. The accuracy of the predicted group/individual motivation, the goodness of the ranked list of recommendations, and the problem-solving performance for the treatment group were significantly higher compared to the control groups. Limitations of the approach, as well as future work plans conclude the paper.},

  abstract     = {Recently, ultrasound has been increasingly used in emergency departments (EDs) due to its promising noninvasive and portable characteristics. Traditional ultrasound training is a complex process that requires knowledge gain, development of psychomotor skills, and visual perception. However, it usually takes a long time for a novice sonographer to finish an ultrasound training program, and the training may target on limited applications. The e-learning, information, and communication technology on digital devices to support learning may overcome the limitations of the traditional ultrasound training. In this article, we design and implement a mobile e-learning platform for ultrasound training, namely MEUS, to address the abovementioned issues. The MEUS provides an interactive learning environment for teachers and learners. Teachers and learners can access MEUS and receive real-time feedback anywhere and anytime through a mobile device or desktop. We implement a multistage learning process. To evaluate the learning performance of using the platform, we add the MEUS platform as a part of the emergency ultrasound training course with the Post Graduate Year (PGY) program in the ED at the National Taiwan University Hospital. Our study shows that the MEUS platform can significantly increase the learning efficacy of the PGY students.},

  abstract     = {The extensive use of simulation-based serious games (SSGs) has made a revolution in educational techniques. As a potentially significant feature for SSG design and evaluation, the term fidelity (the similarity between an SSG and its real reference) emerges and attracts increasing attention. The study of fidelity not only benefits the design, development, and analysis of an SSG with the consideration of improving the learning effect but also contributes to the investment reduction of an SSG. However, the term fidelity is used inconsistently in the current literature. The introduction of new technologies (e.g., virtual reality) and the blend of multiform SSGs also facilitate the extension of fidelity with new connotations. All lead to confusing concepts and vague measure metrics. Besides, the relationship between fidelity and learning effect is still uncertain. A new vision and a comprehensive conceptual framework of fidelity for more general applications are in need. In this paper, further exploration and discussion of these issues in relation to fidelity of SSGs are presented through a systematic review. A general conceptual framework considering both aspects of the SSG system itself and the learners is developed and applied to analyze fidelity in SSGs. Based on that, a discussion on fidelity-related issues of SSG design and development is presented.},

This feedback allows students to learn visualization conventions and to learn new content knowledge. This paper presents a design-based research approach to develop visual tools for an educational technology for chemistry. In this research, three design tradeoffs emerged: (1) Which aspects of the drawing task should visual tools constrain? (2) How should visual tools account for variability in students&#39; prior experiences? (3) How should the design of multiple visual tools be aligned so that students can easily transition between them? Our design-based research approach comprises three studies that address each of these design challenges in the context of chemistry visualizations.

  abstract     = {A distinctive feature of game-based learning environments is their capacity for enabling stealth assessment. Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students&#39; competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models&#39; predictive performance for inferring students&#39; knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naïve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models&#39; early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures.},

This paradigm tends to address current challenges such as reusing, goal-oriented remixing, revising, and redistributing OER. This paper proposes a system to automatically remix, which is a step towards automatic course generation. This system uses an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach to profile OER and simulate the process of selecting and linking the appropriate ones. Each resource profile provides us with metadata that shows its domain and is completed using an appropriate ontology before agents&#39; interactions. ABM enables cooperation between OER to satisfy requirements of the input syllabus. Using the interaction ability, the most compatible agents, which cover the concepts of the input syllabus, can be linked. The efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated through applying the implemented system on two datasets: ARIADNE and SlideShare. In our experimental results on OER related to the domain of e-learning, we report on the system precision and user satisfaction. Our approach is generic; it can be used with any OER repository and any content management system with a free reuse and remix license.},

Augmented immersive reality (AIR) technologies enhance users&#39; perception of reality by augmenting it with computer-generated components such as audio, video, 2/3-D graphics, GPS data, etc. The AIR introduces new dimensions of learning experience that ensure better attention, focus, and entertainment, thereby boosting students&#39; motivation and attainment. This work presents an award winning AIR-based educational mobile system, code-named AIR-EDUTECH, that was developed to help high school students learn chemistry. The AIR-EDUTECH introduced new AIR features to help students better understand and learn basic concepts of molecular chemistry. It offers immersive 3D visualization and visual interaction with the examined structures that provides a broader and more retentive knowledge and improves intuition around forming basic chemical reactions. The system was introduced and tested in a field study with 45 students in the 11 th grade chemistry class, and its impact was evaluated by the formal assessment quiz along with the feedback from survey conducted after the trial. Collected data have been subjected to an in-depth multi-modal quantitative analysis that revealed that AIR-EDUTECH stimulated significant improvements in understanding and retention of the taught content as well as turned learning chemistry into a fun, interesting and interactive experience. It also uncovered a hidden structure of taught knowledge dependencies and highlighted the role that AIR technology could play in reinforcing the retention of critical knowledge that may otherwise widen student knowledge gaps.},

The ability of working in teams is crucial in educating professionals. The literature proves that social relations influence the performance of teams. For instance, the team cohesion is directly related with its performance. In this paper, we have developed an agent-based tool for assisting teachers in simulating their teaching strategies to estimate their influence on the group sociometrics like cohesion, coherence of reciprocal relations, dissociation, and density of relations. The experiments with nine scenarios in disciplines of computer science, electronic, psychology, business, tourism, and renewal energies with 239 students and 6 teachers including experienced and novice ones show that its underlying agent-based framework can adapt to different disciplines obtaining similar outcomes to the real ones. We learned that the tool was especially reliable in predicting the density of relations and the cohesion, being the latter one probably the most relevant due to its known relation with academic performance. In addition, we also learned that it was difficult to assess the prediction quality of the dissociation in higher education, due to the usual low amounts or absence of reciprocal rejections in the students&#39; groups in this educational stage. The presented agent-based tool is publicly distributed as open source for facilitating other researchers in following this research line.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of learning analytics dashboards (LADs) research that reports empirical findings to assess the impact on learning and teaching. Several previous literature reviews identified self-regulated learning as a primary focus of LADs. However, there has been much less understanding how learning analytics are grounded in the literature on self-regulated learning and how self-regulated learning is supported. To address this limitation, this review analyzed the existing empirical studies on LADs based on the well-known model of self-regulated learning proposed by Winne and Hadwin. The results show that existing LADs are rarely grounded in learning theory, cannot be suggested to support metacognition, do not offer any information about effective learning tactics and strategies, and have significant limitations in how their evaluation is conducted and reported. Based on the findings of the study and through the synthesis of the literature, the paper proposes that future research and development should not make any a priori design decisions about representation of data and analytic results in learning analytics systems such as LADs. To formalize this proposal, the paper defines the model for user-centered learning analytics systems (MULAS). The MULAS consists of the four dimensions that are cyclically and recursively interconnected including: theory, design, feedback, and evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Our educational project has three primary goals. First, we want to provide a robust vision of how hardware and software interplay, by integrating the design of an instruction set (through microprogramming) and using that instruction set for assembly programming. Second, we wish to offer a versatile and interactive tool where the previous integrated vision could be tested. The tool we have developed to achieve this is called WepSIM and it provides the view of an elemental processor together with a microprogrammed subset of the MIPS instruction set. In addition, WepSIM is flexible enough to be adapted to other instruction sets or hardware components (e.g., ARM or x86). Third, we want to extend the activities of our university courses, labs, and lectures (fixed hours in a fixed place), so that students may learn by using their mobile device at any location, and at any time during the day. This paper presents how WepSIM has improved the teaching of Computer Architecture courses by empowering students with a more dynamic and guided learning process. In this paper, we show the results obtained during the experience of using the simulator in the Computer Structure course of the Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering, University Carlos III of Madrid.},

  abstract     = {Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are characterized by deficits in social communication, partly attributed to the inability to pick up cues from social partners using joint attention (JA) skill. These deficits have cascading adverse effects on language acquisition and the development of cognitive skills. Therapist-mediated JA interventions are labor intensive. Robot-facilitated skill training is expensive, need specialized knowledge to operate, etc. In contrast, computer-based JA skill training platforms are affordable, offers flexibility to the designer, but lack individualization. Individualization is critical for effective skill training. To bridge this gap, we have developed virtual reality based JA task platform augmented with hierarchical prompt protocol (using eye, head turn, finger pointing, and sparkling cues). It was adaptive to individualized performance and autonomously increased level of prompting on demand. Results of a study with 20 pairs of age-matched ASD and typically developing (TD) participants indicate the potential of our system to identify JA skill deficits. Participants with ASD showed impairment in following eye cue. However, their ability to pick up finger pointing was the best, with some of them being able to pick up only the sparkling cue. However, all TD participants were able to pick up eye cue with none requiring other cues.},

With the irruption of always-on communications technology, the problem, now termed cyberbullying, is no longer restricted to school premises and hours. There are many different approaches to address cyberbullying, such as school buddies, educational videos, or involving police in counseling; however, awareness continues to be insufficient. We have developed Conectado, a serious game to be used in the classroom to increase awareness on bullying and cyberbullying in schools. While playing the game, students gain a first-hand immersive experience of the problem and the associated emotions, fostering awareness and empathy with victims.

  abstract     = {Intelligent learning environments can be designed to support the development of learners&#39; cognitive skills, strategies, and metacognitive processes as they work on complex decision-making and problem-solving tasks. However, the complexity of the tasks may impede the progress of novice learners. Providing adaptive feedback to learners who face difficulties requires learner modeling approaches that can identify learners&#39; proficiencies and the difficulties they face in executing required skills, strategies, and metacognitive processes. This paper discusses a multilevel hierarchical learner modeling scheme that analyzes and captures learners&#39; cognitive processes and problem-solving strategies along with their performance on assigned tasks in a game-based environment called UrbanSim that requires complex decision making for dealing with counterinsurgency scenarios. As the scenario evolves in a turn-by-turn fashion, UrbanSim evaluates the learners&#39; moves using a number of performance measures. Our learner modeling scheme interprets the reported performance values by analyzing the learners&#39; activities captured in log files to derive learners&#39; proficiencies in associated cognitive skills and strategies, and updates the learner model. We discuss the details of the learner modeling algorithms in this paper, and then demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting results from a study we conducted at Vanderbilt University.},

We propose a new method to infer engagement patterns of users in such self-directed environments. We view engagement as a continuous process in time, measured along chosen axes that are derived from student data in the system using unsupervised learning (Principal Component Analysis). We construct a trajectory of user activity by projecting the user&#39;s scores along the selected PCs at regular time intervals. This approach is applied to a popular e-learning software for K12 math education that is used by thousands of students worldwide. We identify cohorts of users according to the way their trajectory changes over time (e.g., monotone up, monotone down, and constant). Each of the cohorts exhibits distinct behavioral dynamics and differed substantially in the amount of time users spent in the e-learning system. Specifically, one cohort included students that dropped out of the system after choosing very difficult problems that they were not able to complete, while another cohort included students users that chose more diverse problems and stayed longer in the system. In future work, these results can be used by teachers or intelligent tutors to track students&#39; engagement in the system and decide whether and how to intervene.},

Students in a MOOC are required to self-regulate their learning to properly self-monitor their learning process and effectiveness of the adopted learning strategies. This paper presents the results of a study among 279 students enrolled in a MOOC that was enriched with a set of scaffolding interventions for social mirroring. The mirroring interventions supported social awareness and social embeddedness of learners. Associations between the use of the interventions and microlevel self-regulated learning processes were measured and analyzed. The extent to which those associations are affected by learner demographics and motivational characteristics was also investigated. Findings show that interventions that provide students, throughout the course, with learning updates and progress of peers are associated with the students&#39; engagement with learning tasks and applying changes in strategies for completing those tasks. Social awareness scaffold influenced more students low in need for cognition, with a higher education degree, high in performance-approach orientation and low in grit, to engage with their learning tasks, while its effect on the change in learning strategies was higher with those early and towards the end of their careers and high in performance-approach strategy. The social comparison scaffold affected more students low in mastery goal orientation and high in grit to work on their learning tasks.},

However, it is generally unknown how to select learning activities adaptively in ITSs to maximize learning. In the previous work of A. Shareghi Najar and A. Mitrovic, alternating worked examples with problem solving (AEP) was found to be superior to learning only from worked examples or only from problem solving. In our first study, we investigated whether the addition of erroneous examples further improves learning in comparison to AEP. The results indicated that erroneous examples prepared students better for problem solving in comparison to worked examples. Explaining and correcting erroneous examples also led to improved debugging and problem-solving skills. In the second study, we introduced a novel strategy that adaptively decided what learning activity (a worked example, a 1-error erroneous example, a 2-error erroneous example, or a problem to be solved) is appropriate for a student based on his/her performance. We found the adaptive strategy resulted in comparative learning improvement in comparison to the fixed sequence of worked/erroneous examples and problem solving, but with a significantly lower number of learning activities.},

Understanding factors affecting student engagement can help in designing better courses and improving student retention. The large number of participants in massive open online courses (MOOCs) and data collected from their interactions on the MOOC open up avenues for studying student engagement at scale. In this work, we develop an interpretable statistical relational learning model for understanding student engagement in online courses using a complex combination of behavioral, linguistic, structural, and temporal cues. We show how to abstract student engagement types of active, passive, and disengagement as meaningful latent variables using logical rules in our model connecting student behavioral signals with student success in MOOCs. We demonstrate that the latent formulation for engagement helps in predicting two measures of student success: performance, their final grade in the course, and survival, their continued presence in the course till the end, across seven MOOCs. Furthermore in order to initiate better instructor interventions, we need to be able to predict student success early in the course. We demonstrate that we can predict student success early in the course reliably using the latent model. We also demonstrate the utility of our models in predicting student success in new courses, by training our models on one course and testing on another course. We show that the latent abstractions are helpful in predicting student success and engagement reliably in new MOOCs that have not yet gathered student interaction data. We then perform a closer quantitative analysis of different features derived from student interactions on the MOOC and identify student activities that are good indicators of student success at different points in the course. Through a qualitative analysis of the latent engagement variable values, we demonstrate their utility in understanding students&#39; engagement levels at various points in the course and movement of students across different types of engagement.},

When the number of learners increases, peer assessment is often conducted by dividing learners into multiple groups to reduce the learner&#39;s assessment workload. However, in such cases, the peer assessment accuracy depends on the method of forming groups. To resolve that difficulty, this study proposes a group formation method to maximize peer assessment accuracy using item response theory and integer programming. Experimental results, however, have demonstrated that the method does not present sufficiently higher accuracy than a random group formation method does. Therefore, this study further proposes an external rater assignment method that assigns a few outside-group raters to each learner after groups are formed using the proposed group formation method. Through results of simulation and actual data experiments, this study demonstrates that the proposed external rater assignment can substantially improve peer assessment accuracy.},

A comparative study over different features and regression models toward short-answer grading has been performed with respect to evaluation metrics used in evaluating ASAG. Apart from traditional text similarity based features like WordNet similarity, latent semantic analysis, and others, we have introduced novel features like topic models suited for short text, relevance feedback based features. An ensemble-based model has been built using a combination of different regression models with an approach based on stacked regression. The proposed ASAG has been tested on the University of North Texas dataset for the regression task, whereas in case of classification task, the student response analysis (SRA) based ScientsBank and Beetle corpus have been used for evaluation. The grading performance in case of ensemble-based ASAG is highly boosted from that exhibited by an individual regression model. Extensive experimentation has revealed that feature selection, introduction of novel features, and regressor stacking have been instrumental in achieving considerable improvement in performance over the existing methods in ASAG domain.},

  abstract     = {In most cultural heritage courses, students physically visit several renowned heritage sites for educational purposes. However, because of time and manpower limitations, many teachers use traditional outdoor instruction methods to transmit vital information regarding these sites and buildings. This approach could result in students merely memorizing knowledge for test-taking purposes, rather than engaging in active thinking. Therefore, this study proposed using a ubiquitous guide-learning system to enhance students&#39; performance and active participation in cultural heritage courses. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a trial experiment was conducted to visit eight heritage sites featured in the cultural heritage course offered by a local university. In total, 62 students were randomly assigned to either an experimental group testing the proposed system or a control group using traditional outdoor instruction methods. The experimental results indicated that our ubiquitous guide-learning system significantly improved students&#39; learning achievements. The outcome of the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey questionnaire indicated that the experimental group participants were motivated to learn and interested in using the proposed system. Moreover, the two groups had statistically significant results for the attention, confidence, and satisfaction factors. Therefore, implementing our proposed system in conjunction with cultural heritage education courses may yield a significant learning advantage for students by improving overall learning performance and motivation.},

  abstract     = {Learning in computer-mediated setting represents a complex, multidimensional process. This complexity calls for a comprehensive analytical approach that would allow for understanding of various dimensions of learner generated discourse and the structure of the underlying social interactions. Current research, however, primarily focuses on manual or, more recently, supervised methods for discourse analysis. Moreover, discourse and social structures are typically analyzed separately without the use of computational methods that can offer a holistic perspective. This paper proposes an approach that addresses these two challenges, first, by using an unsupervised machine learning approach to extract speech acts as representations of knowledge construction processes and finds transition probabilities between speech acts across different messages, and second, by integrating the use of discovered speech acts to explain the formation of social ties and predicting course outcomes. We extracted six categories of speech acts from messages exchanged in discussion forums of two MOOCs and each category corresponded to knowledge construction processes from well-established theoretical models. We further showed how measures derived from discourse analysis explained the ways how social ties were created that framed emerging social networks. Multiple regression models showed that the combined use of measures derived from discourse analysis and social ties predicted learning outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive e-learning can be used to personalize learning environment for students to meet their individual demands. Individual differences depend on the students&#39; personality traits. Numerous studies have indicated that understanding the role of personality in the learning process can facilitate learning. Hence, personality identification in e-learning is a critical issue in education. In this study, we propose the enhanced extended nearest neighbor (EENN) algorithm to automatically identify two of the Big Five personality traits from students&#39; behavior in online learning: openness to experience and extraversion. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using a fivefold cross-validation approach on data from 662 senior high school students. The experimental results indicate that the EENN method can automatically recognize personality at an average accuracy of 0.758. The optimized method that combines EENN with particle swarm optimization significantly improves the identification, resulting in an average accuracy of 0.976. The results can benefit students by increasing the accuracy of personalization based on their personality traits, while simultaneously allowing them to be better understood and possibly allowing their instructors to provide more appropriate learning interventions.},

  abstract     = {Automatic multiple choice question (MCQ) generation from a text is a popular research area. MCQs are widely accepted for large-scale assessment in various domains and applications. However, manual generation of MCQs is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, researchers have been attracted toward automatic MCQ generation since the late 90&#39;s. Since then, many systems have been developed for MCQ generation. We perform a systematic review of those systems. This paper presents our findings on the review. We outline a generic workflow for an automatic MCQ generation system. The workflow consists of six phases. For each of these phases, we find and discuss the list of techniques adopted in the literature. We also study the evaluation techniques for assessing the quality of the system generated MCQs. Finally, we identify the areas where the current research focus should be directed toward enriching the literature.},

  abstract     = {We present a system that automatically generates deictic gestures for animated pedagogical agents (APAs). The system takes audio and text as input, which define what the APA has to say, and generates animated gestures based on a set of rules. The automatically generated gestures point to the exact locations of elements on a whiteboard nearby the APA, which are calculated by searching for keywords mentioned in the speech. We conducted a study with 100 subjects, in which we compared lecture videos containing gestures automatically-scripted by the system to videos of the same lecture containing manually-scripted gestures. The study results show that the manually-scripted and automatically-scripted lectures had comparable number of gestures, and that the gestures were timed equally well.},
