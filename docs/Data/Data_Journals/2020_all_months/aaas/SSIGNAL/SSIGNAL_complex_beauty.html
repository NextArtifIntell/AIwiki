  abstract     = {Postsynaptic organizational protein complexes play central roles both in orchestrating synapse formation and in defining the functional properties of synaptic transmission that together shape the flow of information through neuronal networks. A key component of these organizational protein complexes is the family of synaptic adhesion proteins called neuroligins. Neuroligins form transsynaptic bridges with presynaptic neurexins to regulate various aspects of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Neuroligin-2 (NLGN2) is the only member that acts exclusively at GABAergic inhibitory synapses. Altered expression and mutations in NLGN2 and several of its interacting partners are linked to cognitive and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, and anxiety. Research on NLGN2 has fundamentally shaped our understanding of the molecular architecture of inhibitory synapses. Here, we discuss the current knowledge on the molecular and cellular functions of mammalian NLGN2 and its role in the neuronal circuitry that regulates behavior in rodents and humans.},

  abstract     = {Progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons characterizes Parkinson’s disease (PD). This neuronal loss occurs through diverse mechanisms, including a form of programmed cell death dependent on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) called parthanatos. Deficient activity of the kinase Akt1 and aggregation of the protein α-synuclein are also implicated in disease pathogenesis. Here, we found that Akt1 suppressed parthanatos in dopaminergic neurons through a transcriptional mechanism. Overexpressing constitutively active Akt1 in SH-SY5Y cells or culturing cells with chlorogenic acid (a polyphenol found in coffee that activates Akt1) stimulated the CREB-dependent transcriptional activation of the gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146. RNF146 inhibited PARP1 not through its E3 ligase function but rather by binding to and sequestering PAR, which enhanced the survival of cultured cells exposed to the dopaminergic neuronal toxin 6-OHDA or α-synuclein aggregation. In mice, intraperitoneal administration of chlorogenic acid activated the Akt1-CREB-RNF146 pathway in the brain and provided neuroprotection against both 6-OHDA and combinatorial α-synucleinopathy in an RNF146-dependent manner. Furthermore, dysregulation of the Akt1-CREB pathway was observed in postmortem brain samples from patients with PD. The findings suggest that therapeutic restoration of RNF146 expression, such as by activating the Akt1-CREB pathway, might halt neurodegeneration in PD.},

  abstract     = {The prevalence, presentation, and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) differ between men and women, although β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition is a pathological hallmark of AD in both sexes. Aβ-induced activation of the neuronal glutamate receptor mGluR5 is linked to AD progression. However, we found that mGluR5 exhibits distinct sex-dependent profiles. Specifically, mGluR5 isolated from male mouse cortical and hippocampal tissues bound with high affinity to Aβ oligomers, whereas mGluR5 from female mice exhibited no such affinity. This sex-selective Aβ-mGluR5 interaction did not appear to depend on estrogen, but rather Aβ interaction with cellular prion protein (PrP C ), which was detected only in male mouse brain homogenates. The ternary complex between mGluR5, Aβ oligomers, and PrP C was essential to elicit mGluR5-dependent pathological suppression of autophagy in primary neuronal cultures. Pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 reactivated autophagy, mitigated Aβ pathology, and reversed cognitive decline in male APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice, but not in their female counterparts. Aβ oligomers also bound with high affinity to human mGluR5 isolated from postmortem donor male cortical brain tissue, but not that from female samples, suggesting that this mechanism may be relevant to patients. Our findings indicate that mGluR5 does not contribute to Aβ pathology in females, highlighting the complexity of mGluR5 pharmacology and Aβ signaling that supports the need for sex-specific stratification in clinical trials assessing AD therapeutics.},

The dysregulation of TGF-β signaling causes diseases such as cancer and fibrosis, and therefore, understanding the biochemical basis of TGF-β signal transduction is important for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms in these diseases. SMAD proteins are transcription factors that mediate TGF-β signaling–dependent gene expression. The transcriptional coactivator CBP directly interacts with the MH2 domains of SMAD2 to activate SMAD complex–dependent gene expression. Here, we report the structural basis for CBP recognition by SMAD2. The crystal structures of the SMAD2 MH2 domain in complex with the SMAD2-binding region of CBP showed that CBP forms an amphiphilic helix on the hydrophobic surface of SMAD2. The expression of a mutated CBP peptide that showed increased SMAD2 binding repressed SMAD2-dependent gene expression in response to TGF-β signaling in cultured cells. Disrupting the interaction between SMAD2 and CBP may therefore be a promising strategy for suppressing SMAD-dependent gene expression.},

Despite the clinical importance of T reg cells, there is a dearth of druggable molecular targets capable of increasing their numbers in vivo. We found that inhibiting the function of the TRPM7 chanzyme (ion channel and enzyme) potentiated the thymic development of T reg cells in mice and led to a substantially higher frequency of functional T reg cells in the periphery. In addition, TRPM7-deficient mice were resistant to T cell–driven hepatitis. Deletion of Trpm7 and inhibition of TRPM7 channel activity by the FDA-approved drug FTY720 increased the sensitivity of T cells to the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) through a positive feed-forward loop involving increased expression of the IL-2 receptor α-subunit and activation of the transcriptional regulator STAT5. Enhanced IL-2 signaling increased the expression of Foxp3 in thymocytes and promoted thymic T reg (tT reg ) cell development. Thus, these data indicate that inhibiting TRPM7 activity increases T reg cell numbers, suggesting that it may be a therapeutic target to promote immune tolerance.},

Therapeutic activation of TNFR2, thereby expanding T reg cells and suppressing immune activity, may be beneficial to patients with various inflammatory diseases. Here, we characterized a new human TNFR2-directed antibody agonist isolated from mice. We found that the antibody agonist expanded the number of T reg cells within cultures of primary human CD4 + T cells from healthy donors and patients with type 1 diabetes or Sézary syndrome. These T reg cells had increased metabolic gene expression and intracellular itaconate concentrations, characteristics associated with maximally suppressive, anti-inflammatory T reg cells. Furthermore, antibody-expanded T reg cells repressed the activity of primary human CD8 + effector T cells (T eff cells). Epitope mapping suggested that the antibody bound to TNFR2 through a natural cross-linking surface and that T reg cell expansion was independent of the antibody Fc region. In addition, T reg cell expansion was not increased by adding either supplemental TNF ligand or a cross-linking reagent, suggesting that the antibody agonist by itself can elicit maximal activity, a notion that was confirmed by increased secretion of soluble TNFR2. Pending in vivo tests, these features indicate that this TNFR2 antibody agonist has the potential to safely and effectively treat various inflammatory disorders.},

Here, we showed that a small, persistent increase in the abundance of the innate pathogen sensor NOD1 precipitated large changes in the transcriptional state of monocytes. A ~1.2- to 1.3-fold increase in NOD1 protein abundance resulting from loss of regulation by the microRNA cluster miR-15b/16 lowered the threshold for ligand-induced activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and the MAPK p38. An additional sustained increase in NOD1 abundance to 1.5-fold over basal amounts bypassed this low ligand concentration requirement, resulting in robust ligand-independent induction of proinflammatory genes and oncogenes. These findings reveal that tight regulation of NOD1 abundance prevents this sensor from exceeding a physiological switching checkpoint that promotes persistent inflammation and oncogene expression. Furthermore, our data provide insight into how a quantitatively small change in protein abundance can produce marked changes in cell state that can serve as the initiator of disease.},

In mammals, STING is activated by the cyclic dinucleotide 2′3′-cGAMP produced by cGAS, which acts as a receptor for cytosolic DNA. Here, we showed that injection of flies with 2′3′-cGAMP induced the expression of dSTING-regulated genes. Coinjection of 2′3′-cGAMP with a panel of RNA or DNA viruses resulted in substantially reduced viral replication. This 2′3′-cGAMP–mediated protection was still observed in flies with mutations in Atg7 and AGO2 , genes that encode key components of the autophagy and small interfering RNA pathways, respectively. By contrast, this protection was abrogated in flies with mutations in the gene encoding the NF-κB transcription factor Relish. Transcriptomic analysis of 2′3′-cGAMP–injected flies revealed a complex response pattern in which genes were rapidly induced, induced after a delay, or induced in a sustained manner. Our results reveal that dSTING regulates an NF-κB–dependent antiviral program that predates the emergence of interferons in vertebrates.},

  abstract     = {LGR4 and LGR5 encode two homologous receptors with critical, yet distinct, roles in organ development and adult stem cell survival. Both receptors are coexpressed in intestinal crypt stem cells, bind to R-spondins (RSPOs) with high affinity, and potentiate Wnt–β-catenin signaling, presumably by the same mechanism: forming RSPO-bridged complexes with the E3 ligases RNF43 and ZNRF3 to inhibit ubiquitylation of Wnt receptors. However, direct evidence for RSPO-bound, full-length LGR5 interacting with these E3 ligases in whole cells has not been reported, and only LGR4 is essential for the self-renewal of intestinal stem cells. Here, we examined the mechanisms of action of LGR4 and LGR5 in parallel using coimmunoprecipitation, proximity ligation, competition binding, and time-resolved FRET assays in whole cells. Full-length LGR4 formed a tight complex with ZNRF3 and RNF43 even without RSPO, whereas LGR5 did not interact with either E3 ligase with or without RSPO. Domain-swapping experiments with LGR4 and LGR5 revealed that the seven-transmembrane domain of LGR4 conferred interaction with the E3 ligases. Native LGR4 and LGR5 existed as dimers on the cell surface, and LGR5 interacted with both FZD and LRP6 of the Wnt signalosome to enhance LRP6 phosphorylation and potentiate Wnt–β-catenin signaling.

  abstract     = {Impaired glucose tolerance associated with obesity causes postprandial hyperglycemia and can lead to type 2 diabetes. To study the differences in liver metabolism in healthy and obese states, we constructed and analyzed transomics glucose-responsive metabolic networks with layers for metabolites, expression data for metabolic enzyme genes, transcription factors, and insulin signaling proteins from the livers of healthy and obese mice. We integrated multiomics time course data from wild-type and leptin-deficient obese ( ob / ob ) mice after orally administered glucose. In wild-type mice, metabolic reactions were rapidly regulated within 10 min of oral glucose administration by glucose-responsive metabolites, which functioned as allosteric regulators and substrates of metabolic enzymes, and by Akt-induced changes in the expression of glucose-responsive genes encoding metabolic enzymes. In ob / ob mice, the majority of rapid regulation by glucose-responsive metabolites was absent. Instead, glucose administration produced slow changes in the expression of carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolic enzyme–encoding genes to alter metabolic reactions on a time scale of hours. Few regulatory events occurred in both healthy and obese mice. Thus, our transomics network analysis revealed that regulation of glucose-responsive liver metabolism is mediated through different mechanisms in healthy and obese states. Rapid changes in allosteric regulators and substrates and in gene expression dominate the healthy state, whereas slow changes in gene expression dominate the obese state.},

An interaction between the coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the primary determinant of tissue and host specificity; however, viral entry is a complex process requiring the concerted action of multiple cellular elements. Here, we found that the protease kallikrein 13 (KLK13) was required for the infection of human respiratory epithelial cells and was sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 into nonpermissive RD cells. We also demonstrated the cleavage of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, suggesting that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Together, these data suggest that protease distribution and specificity determine the tissue and cell specificity of the virus and may also regulate interspecies transmission.},

Bronchodilators that do not target β2-adrenoceptors represent a critical unmet need for asthma management. Here, we characterize the utility of osthole, a coumarin derived from a traditional Chinese medicine, in preclinical models of asthma. In mouse precision-cut lung slices, osthole relaxed preconstricted airways, irrespective of β2-adrenoceptor desensitization. Osthole administered in murine asthma models attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness, a hallmark of asthma. Osthole inhibited phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) activity to amplify autocrine prostaglandin E 2 signaling in airway smooth muscle cells that eventually triggered cAMP/PKA-dependent relaxation of airways. The crystal structure of the PDE4D complexed with osthole revealed that osthole bound to the catalytic site to prevent cAMP binding and hydrolysis. Together, our studies elucidate a specific molecular target and mechanism by which osthole induces airway relaxation. Identification of osthole binding sites on PDE4D will guide further development of bronchodilators that are not subject to tachyphylaxis and would thus avoid β2-adrenoceptor agonist resistance.},

  abstract     = {Targeted therapeutics for cancer generally exploit “oncogene addiction, ” a phenomenon in which the growth and survival of tumor cells depend on the activity of a particular protein. However, the efficacy of oncogene-targeted therapies varies substantially. For instance, targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is effective in some non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but not in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), although these cancers show a similar degree of increase in EGFR activity. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 genetic knockout screen, we found that the Elongator (ELP) complex mediates insensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in TNBC cells by promoting the synthesis of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. Depleting ELP proteins promoted apoptotic cell death in an EGFR inhibition–dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of Mcl-1 synergized with EGFR inhibition in a panel of genetically diverse TNBC cells. The findings indicate that TNBC “addiction” to EGFR signaling is masked by the ELP complex and that resistance to EGFR inhibitors in TNBC might be overcome by cotargeting Mcl-1.},

  abstract     = {Although inflammation is necessary during the early phases of tissue repair, persistent inflammation contributes to fibrosis. Acute tendon injuries often heal through a fibrotic mechanism, which impedes regeneration and functional recovery. Because inflammation mediated by nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling is implicated in this process, we examined the spatial, temporal, and cell type–specific activation profile of canonical NF-κB signaling during tendon healing. NF-κB signaling was maintained through all phases of tendon healing in mice, including the remodeling phase, and tenocytes and myofibroblasts from the Scleraxis ( Scx ) lineage were the predominant populations that retained NF-κB activation into the late stages of repair. We confirmed persistent NF-κB activation in myofibroblasts in human tendon scar tissue. Deleting the canonical NF-κB kinase, IKKβ, in Scx -lineage cells in mice increased apoptosis and the deposition of the matrix protein periostin during the late stages of tendon repair, suggesting that persistent NF-κB signaling may facilitate myofibroblast survival and fibrotic progression. Consistent with this, myofibroblasts in human tendon scar samples displayed enhanced prosurvival signaling compared to control tissue. Together, these data suggest that NF-κB may contribute to fibrotic tendon healing through both inflammation-dependent and inflammation-independent functions, such as NF-κB–mediated cell survival.},

The receptors inhibit or stimulate CheA kinase activity depending on the presence of attractants or repellants, respectively. We engineered chemoreceptor cytoplasmic regions to assume a trimer of receptor dimers configuration that formed well-defined complexes with CheA and CheW and promoted a CheA kinase-off state. These mimics of core signaling units were assembled to homogeneity and investigated by site-directed spin-labeling with pulse-dipolar electron-spin resonance spectroscopy (PDS), small-angle x-ray scattering, targeted protein cross-linking, and cryo–electron microscopy. The kinase-off state was especially stable, had relatively low domain mobility, and associated the histidine substrate and docking domains with the kinase core, thus preventing catalytic activity. Together, these data provide an experimentally restrained model for the inhibited state of the core signaling unit and suggest that chemoreceptors indirectly sequester the kinase and substrate domains to limit histidine autophosphorylation.},

We investigated how DKK1 expression is induced in HCC and found that activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) promoted parallel MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathway signaling that converged to epigenetically stimulate DKK1 transcription. In HCC cell lines stimulated with EGF, EGFR-activated ERK phosphorylated the kinase PKM2 at Ser 37 , which promoted its nuclear translocation. Also in these cells, EGFR-activated Akt phosphorylated the acetyltransferase p300 at Ser 1834 . Subsequently, PKM2 and p300 mediated the phosphorylation and acetylation, respectively, of histone H3 at the DKK1 promoter, which synergistically enhanced DKK1 transcription. The mechanism was supported with mutational analyses in cells and in a chemically induced HCC model in rats. The findings suggest that dual inhibition of the MEK and PI3K pathways might suppress the expression of DKK1 and, consequently, tumor metastasis in patients with HCC.},

We generated mice with point mutations that prevent Gβγ binding to p110γ (RK552DD) or to p101 (VVKR777AAAA) and investigated the effects of these mutations in primary neutrophils and in mouse models of neutrophilic inflammation. Loss of Gβγ binding to p110γ substantially reduced the activation of both p101/p110γ and p84/p110γ in neutrophils by various GPCR agonists. Loss of Gβγ binding to p101 caused more variable effects, depending on both the agonist and cellular response, with the biggest reductions seen in PIP 3 production by primary neutrophils in response to LTB4 and MIP-2 and in the migration of neutrophils during thioglycolate-induced peritonitis or MIP2-induced ear pouch inflammation. We also observed that p101 VVKR777AAAA neutrophils showed enhanced p84-dependent ROS responses to f MLP and C5a, suggesting that competition may exist between p101/p110γ and p84/p110γ for Gβγ subunits downstream of GPCR activation. GPCRs did not activate p110γ in neutrophils from mice lacking both the p101 and p84 regulatory subunits, indicating that RAS binding to p110γ is insufficient to support GPCR activation in this cell type. These findings define a direct role for Gβγ subunits in activating both of the endogenous PI3Kγ complexes and indicate that the regulatory PI3Kγ subunit biases activation toward different GPCRs.},

  abstract     = {Genetic mutations are a primary driving force behind the adaptive evolution of bacterial pathogens. Multiple clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , an important human pathogen, have naturally evolved one or more missense mutations in bfmS , which encodes the sensor histidine kinase of the BfmRS two-component system (TCS). A mutant BfmS protein containing both the L181P and E376Q substitutions increased the phosphorylation and thus the transcriptional regulatory activity of its cognate downstream response regulator, BfmR. This reduced acute virulence and enhanced biofilm formation, both of which are phenotypic changes associated with a chronic infection state. The increased phosphorylation of BfmR was due, at least in part, to the cross-phosphorylation of BfmR by GtrS, a noncognate sensor kinase. Other spontaneous missense mutations in bfmS , such as A42E/G347D, T242R, and R393H, also caused a similar remodeling of the BfmRS TCS in P. aeruginosa . This study highlights the plasticity of TCSs mediated by spontaneous mutations and suggests that mutation-induced activation of BfmRS may contribute to host adaptation by P. aeruginosa during chronic infections.},

  abstract     = {Angiomotins are a family of molecular scaffolding proteins that function to organize contact points (called tight junctions in vertebrates) between adjacent cells. Some angiomotin isoforms bind to the actin cytoskeleton and are part of signaling pathways that influence cell morphology and migration. Others cooperate with components of the Hippo signaling pathway and the associated networks to control organ growth. The 130-kDa isoform, AMOT-p130, has critical roles in neural stem cell differentiation, dendritic patterning, and synaptic maturation—attributes that are essential for normal brain development and are consistent with its association with autism. Here, we review and discuss the evidence that supports a role for AMOT-p130 in neuronal development in the central nervous system.},

Starving Dictyostelium cells secrete cAMP, which is the key extracellular signaling molecule that promotes the aggregation process required for their long-term survival. Here, we investigated the influence of environmental inhomogeneities on the signaling and pattern formation of Dictyostelium cells. We present experimental data and numerical simulations on the pattern formation of signaling Dictyostelium cells in the presence of periodic arrays of millimeter-sized pillars. We observed concentric cAMP waves that initiated almost synchronously at the pillars and propagated outward. In response to these circular waves, the Dictyostelium cells streamed toward the pillars, forming aggregates arranged in patterns that reflected the periodicity of the lattice of pillars. Our results suggest that, in nature, the excitability threshold and synchronization level of the cells are two key parameters that control the nature of the interaction between cells and spatial heterogeneities in their environment.},

To understand how these compounds alter T cell function, we assessed their therapeutic activity in a mouse model of T cell–mediated autoimmunity that mimics multiple sclerosis (MS). T H 17 cells are believed to orchestrate MS pathology, in part, through the production of two proinflammatory cytokines: interleukin-17 (IL-17) and GM-CSF. We found that both TEPP-46 and DASA-58 suppressed the development of IL-17–producing T H 17 cells but increased the generation of those producing GM-CSF. This switch redirected disease pathology from the spinal cord to the brain. In addition, we found that activation of PKM2 interfered with TGF-β1 signaling, which is necessary for the development of T H 17 and regulatory T cells. Collectively, our data clarify the therapeutic potential of PKM2 activators in MS-like disease and how these agents alter T cell function.},

  abstract     = {At the heart of protein ubiquitination cascades, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) form reactive ubiquitin-thioester intermediates to enable efficient transfer of ubiquitin to cellular substrates. The precise regulation of E2s is thus crucial for cellular homeostasis, and their deregulation is frequently associated with tumorigenesis. In addition to driving substrate ubiquitination together with ubiquitin ligases (E3s), many E2s can also autoubiquitinate, thereby promoting their own proteasomal turnover. To investigate the mechanisms that balance these disparate activities, we dissected the regulatory dynamics of UBE2S, a human APC/C-associated E2 that ensures the faithful ubiquitination of cell cycle regulators during mitosis. We uncovered a dimeric state of UBE2S that confers autoinhibition by blocking a catalytically critical ubiquitin binding site. Dimerization is stimulated by the lysine-rich carboxyl-terminal extension of UBE2S that is also required for the recruitment of this E2 to the APC/C and is autoubiquitinated as substrate abundance becomes limiting. Consistent with this mechanism, we found that dimerization-deficient UBE2S turned over more rapidly in cells and did not promote mitotic slippage during prolonged drug-induced mitotic arrest. We propose that dimerization attenuates the autoubiquitination-induced turnover of UBE2S when the APC/C is not fully active. More broadly, our data illustrate how the use of mutually exclusive macromolecular interfaces enables modulation of both the activities and the abundance of E2s in cells to facilitate precise ubiquitin signaling.},

The transcriptional regulator SMAR1 suppresses CSC expansion in colorectal cancer, and increased abundance of SMAR1 is associated with better prognosis. Here, we found in breast tumors that the expression of SMAR1 was decreased in CSCs through the cooperative interaction of the pluripotency factors Oct4 and Sox2 with the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Overexpressing SMAR1 sensitized CSCs to chemotherapy through SMAR1-dependent recruitment of HDAC2 to the promoter of the gene encoding the drug efflux pump ABCG2. Treating cultured CSCs or 4T1 tumor-bearing mice with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin restored SMAR1 expression and ABCG2 repression and enhanced tumor sensitivity to doxorubicin. Our findings reveal transcriptional mechanisms regulating SMAR1 that also regulate cancer stemness and chemoresistance and suggest that, by restoring SMAR1 expression, aspirin might enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy in patients with stem-like tumors.},

  abstract     = {Membrane trafficking processes regulate G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) activity. Although class A GPCRs are capable of activating G proteins in a monomeric form, they can also potentially assemble into functional GPCR heteromers. Here, we showed that the class A serotonin 5-HT 2A receptors (5-HT 2A Rs) affected the localization and trafficking of class C metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) through a mechanism that required their assembly as heteromers in mammalian cells. In the absence of agonists, 5-HT 2A R was primarily localized within intracellular compartments, and coexpression of 5-HT 2A R with mGluR2 increased the intracellular distribution of the otherwise plasma membrane–localized mGluR2. Agonists for either 5-HT 2A R or mGluR2 differentially affected trafficking through Rab5-positive endosomes in cells expressing each component of the 5-HT 2A R–mGluR2 heterocomplex alone, or together. In addition, overnight pharmacological 5-HT 2A R blockade with clozapine, but not with M100907, decreased mGluR2 density through a mechanism that involved heteromerization between 5-HT 2A R and mGluR2. Using TAT-tagged peptides and chimeric constructs that are unable to form the interclass 5-HT 2A R–mGluR2 complex, we demonstrated that heteromerization was necessary for the 5-HT 2A R–dependent effects on mGluR2 subcellular distribution. The expression of 5-HT 2A R also augmented intracellular localization of mGluR2 in mouse frontal cortex pyramidal neurons. Together, our data suggest that GPCR heteromerization may itself represent a mechanism of receptor trafficking and sorting.},

In this study, we showed that the ion channel TRPV4 modulated the endocytosis of albumin and low–molecular weight proteins in the proximal tubule. TRPV4 was found at the basolateral side of proximal tubule cells, and its mechanical activation by cell stretching induced Ca 2+ entry into the cytosol, which promoted endocytosis. Trpv4 −/− mice presented with mild proximal tubule dysfunction under basal conditions. To challenge endocytic function, the permeability of the glomerular filter was altered by systemic delivery of angiotensin II. The proteinuria induced by this treatment was more severe in Trpv4 −/− than in Trpv4 +/+ mice. Injecting antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane to induce glomerulonephritis is a more pathophysiologically relevant method of impairing glomerular filter permeability. Albuminuria was more severe in mice that lacked TRPV4 specifically in the proximal tubule than in control mice. These results emphasize the importance of TRPV4 in sensing pressure in the proximal tubule in response to variations in the amount of ultrafiltrate and unveil a mechanism that controls protein reabsorption.},

Effectors are defined by a folded RAS-association (RA) domain that binds exclusively to GTP-loaded (activated) RAS, but the binding specificities of most RA domains toward more than 160 RAS superfamily GTPases have not been characterized. Ten RA domain family (RASSF) proteins comprise the largest group of related effectors and are proposed to couple RAS to the proapoptotic Hippo pathway. Here, we showed that RASSF1-6 formed complexes with the Hippo kinase ortholog MST1, whereas RASSF7-10 formed oligomers with the p53-regulating effectors ASPP1 and ASPP2. Moreover, only RASSF5 bound directly to activated HRAS and KRAS, and RASSFs did not augment apoptotic induction downstream of RAS oncoproteins. Structural modeling revealed that expansion of the RASSF effector family in vertebrates included amino acid substitutions to key residues that direct GTPase-binding specificity. We demonstrated that the tumor suppressor RASSF1A formed complexes with the RAS-related GTPases GEM, REM1, REM2, and the enigmatic RASL12. Furthermore, interactions between RASSFs and RAS GTPases blocked YAP1 nuclear localization. Thus, these simple scaffolds link the activation of diverse RAS family small G proteins to Hippo or p53 regulation.},

Whereas few PGRA-overexpressing mice developed reproductive tract tumors, all PGRB-overexpressing mice developed ovarian neoplasms that were derived from ovarian luteal cells. Transcriptomic analyses of the ovarian tumors from PGRB-overexpressing mice revealed enhanced AKT signaling and a gene expression signature similar to those of human ovarian and endometrial cancers. Treating PGRB-overexpressing mice with the PGR antagonist RU486 stalled tumor growth and decreased the expression of cell cycle–associated genes, indicating that tumor growth and cell proliferation were hormone dependent in addition to being isoform dependent. Analysis of the PGRB cistrome identified binding events at genes encoding proteins that are critical regulators of mitotic phase entry.

  abstract     = {Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can exist in pro- and anti-inflammatory states. Anti-inflammatory TAMs (also referred to as M2-polarized) generally suppress antitumor immune responses and enhance the metastatic progression of cancer. To explore the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we isolated macrophages from mice and humans, polarized them ex vivo, and examined their functional interaction with breast cancer cells in culture and in mice. We found that anti-inflammatory TAMs promoted a metabolic state in breast cancer cells that supported various protumorigenic phenotypes. Anti-inflammatory TAMs secreted the cytokine TGF-β that, upon engagement of its receptors in breast cancer cells, suppressed the abundance of the transcription factor STAT1 and, consequently, decreased that of the metabolic enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in the tumor cells. The decrease in SDH levels in tumor cells resulted in an accumulation of succinate, which enhanced the stability of the transcription factor HIF1α and reprogrammed cell metabolism to a glycolytic state. TAM depletion-repletion experiments in a 4T1 mouse model additionally revealed that anti-inflammatory macrophages promoted HIF-associated vascularization and expression of the immunosuppressive protein PD-L1 in tumors. The findings suggest that anti-inflammatory TAMs promote tumor-associated angiogenesis and immunosuppression by altering metabolism in breast cancer cells.},

  abstract     = {There are currently no antiviral therapies specific for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the global pandemic disease COVID-19. To facilitate structure-based drug design, we conducted an x-ray crystallographic study of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp16-nsp10 2′- O -methyltransferase complex, which methylates Cap-0 viral mRNAs to improve viral protein translation and to avoid host immune detection. We determined the structures for nsp16-nsp10 heterodimers bound to the methyl donor S -adenosylmethionine (SAM), the reaction product S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), or the SAH analog sinefungin (SFG). We also solved structures for nsp16-nsp10 in complex with the methylated Cap-0 analog m 7 GpppA and either SAM or SAH. Comparative analyses between these structures and published structures for nsp16 from other betacoronaviruses revealed flexible loops in open and closed conformations at the m 7 GpppA-binding pocket. Bound sulfates in several of the structures suggested the location of the ribonucleic acid backbone phosphates in the ribonucleotide-binding groove. Additional nucleotide-binding sites were found on the face of the protein opposite the active site. These various sites and the conserved dimer interface could be exploited for the development of antiviral inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {T cells must migrate to encounter antigen-presenting cells and perform their roles in host defense. Here, we found that autocrine stimulation of the purinergic receptor P2Y11 regulates the migration of human CD4 T cells. P2Y11 receptors redistributed from the front to the back of polarized cells where they triggered intracellular cAMP/PKA signals that attenuated mitochondrial metabolism at the back. The absence of P2Y11 receptors at the front of cells resulted in hotspots of mitochondrial metabolism and localized ATP production that stimulated P2X4 receptors, Ca 2+ influx, and pseudopod protrusion at the front. This regulatory function of P2Y11 receptors depended on their subcellular redistribution and autocrine stimulation by cellular ATP release and was perturbed by indiscriminate global stimulation. We conclude that excessive extracellular ATP—such as in response to inflammation, sepsis, and cancer—disrupts this autocrine feedback mechanism, which results in defective T cell migration, impaired T cell function, and loss of host immune defense.},

Deficits in synaptic transmission and in microglial function are commonly found in human alcohol abusers and in animal models of alcohol intoxication. Here, we found that a protocol simulating chronic binge drinking in male mice resulted in aberrant synaptic pruning and substantial loss of excitatory synapses in the prefrontal cortex, which resulted in increased anxiety-like behavior. Mechanistically, alcohol intake increased the engulfment capacity of microglia in a manner dependent on the kinase Src, the subsequent activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, and the consequent production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF. Pharmacological blockade of Src activation or of TNF production in microglia, genetic ablation of Tnf , or conditional ablation of microglia attenuated aberrant synaptic pruning, thereby preventing the neuronal and behavioral effects of the alcohol. Our data suggest that aberrant pruning of excitatory synapses by microglia may disrupt synaptic transmission in response to alcohol abuse.},

We investigated the molecular features underlying the impaired transcriptional response of this mutant (ERα-Q375H) and four other missense mutations at this position designed to query alternative mechanisms. The identity of residue 375 greatly affected the sensitivity of the receptor to agonists without changing the ligand binding affinity. Instead, the mutations caused changes in the affinity of coactivator binding and alterations in the balance of coactivator and corepressor recruitment. Comparisons among the transcriptional regulatory responses of these six ERα genotypes to a set of ER agonists showed that both steric and electrostatic factors contributed to the functional deficits in gene regulatory activity of the mutant ERα proteins. ERα–coregulator peptide binding in vitro and RIME (rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous) analysis in cells showed that the degree of functional impairment paralleled changes in receptor-coregulator binding interactions. These findings uncover coupling between ligand binding and coregulator recruitment that affects the potency rather than the efficacy of the receptor response without substantially altering ligand binding affinity. This highlights a molecular mechanism for estrogen insensitivity syndrome involving mutations that perturb a bidirectional allosteric coupling between ligand binding and coregulator binding that determines receptor transcriptional output.},

  abstract     = {Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a dimeric cytokine with both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory activities; however, IL-10–based therapies have shown only marginal clinical benefits. Here, we explored whether the stability of the IL-10 receptor complex contributes to the immunomodulatory potency of IL-10. We generated an IL-10 mutant with enhanced affinity for its IL-10Rβ receptor using yeast surface display. Compared to the wild-type cytokine, the affinity-enhanced IL-10 variants recruited IL-10Rβ more efficiently into active cell surface signaling complexes and triggered greater STAT1 and STAT3 activation in human monocytes and CD8 + T cells. These effects, in turn, led to more robust induction of IL-10–mediated gene expression programs at low ligand concentrations in both human cell subsets. IL-10–regulated genes are involved in monocyte energy homeostasis, migration, and trafficking and in CD8 + T cell exhaustion. At nonsaturating doses, IL-10 did not induce key components of its gene expression program, which may explain its lack of efficacy in clinical settings. Our engineered IL-10 variant showed a more robust bioactivity profile than that of wild-type IL-10 at low doses in monocytes and CD8 + T cells. Moreover, CAR-modified T cells expanded with the engineered IL-10 variant displayed superior cytolytic activity than those expanded with wild-type IL-10. Our study provides insights into how IL-10 receptor complex stability fine-tunes IL-10 biology and opens new opportunities to revitalize failed IL-10 therapies.},

Selected chemical and genetic perturbations in this screening platform, including rapamycin treatment and genetic ablation of the Ragulator subunit LAMTOR4, revealed the known core mTORC1 regulatory signaling complexes and the intimate interplay of the mTORC1 pathway with lysosomal function, validating the approach. In addition, we identified a differential requirement for LAMTOR4 and LAMTOR5 in regulating the mTORC1 pathway under fed and starved conditions. Furthermore, we uncovered a previously unknown “synthetic-sick” interaction between the tumor suppressor folliculin and LAMTOR4, which may have therapeutic implications in cancer treatment. Together, our study demonstrates the use of iterative “perturb and observe” genetic screens to uncover regulatory mechanisms driving complex mammalian signaling networks.},

To find cellular defects triggered by tumor exposure and associated PD-1 signaling, we established an ex vivo imaging approach to investigate the response of antigen-specific, activated effector CD8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) after interaction with target tumor cells. Although TIL–tumor cell couples readily formed, couple stability deteriorated within minutes. This was associated with impaired F-actin clearing from the center of the cellular interface, reduced Ca 2+ signaling, increased TIL locomotion, and impaired tumor cell killing. The interaction of CD8 + T lymphocytes with tumor cell spheroids in vitro induced a similar phenotype, supporting a critical role of direct T cell–tumor cell contact. Diminished engagement of PD-1 within the tumor, but not acute ex vivo blockade, partially restored cell couple maintenance and killing. PD-1 thus contributes to the suppression of TIL function by inducing a state of impaired subcellular organization.},

In mice, these beneficial effects are partly mediated by the lowering of core body temperature that occurs during CR. Conversely, the favorable effects of CR on health span are mitigated by elevating ambient temperature to thermoneutrality (30°C), a condition in which hypothermia is blunted. In this study, we compared the global metabolic response to CR of mice housed at 22°C (the standard housing temperature) or at 30°C and found that thermoneutrality reverted 39 and 78\% of total systemic or hypothalamic metabolic variations caused by CR, respectively. Systemic changes included pathways that control fuel use and energy expenditure during CR. Cognitive computing-assisted analysis of these metabolomics results helped to prioritize potential active metabolites that modulated the hypothermic response to CR. Last, we demonstrated with pharmacological approaches that nitric oxide (NO) produced through the citrulline-NO pathway promotes CR-triggered hypothermia and that leucine enkephalin directly controls core body temperature when exogenously injected into the hypothalamus. Because thermoneutrality counteracts CR-enhanced health span, the multiple metabolites and pathways altered by thermoneutrality may represent targets for mimicking CR-associated effects.},

  abstract     = {The reciprocal regulation of phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPPs) by protein kinases is essential to cell cycle progression and control, particularly during mitosis for which the role of kinases has been extensively studied. PPPs perform much of the serine/threonine dephosphorylation in eukaryotic cells and achieve substrate selectivity and specificity through the interaction of distinct regulatory subunits with conserved catalytic subunits in holoenzyme complexes. Using a mass spectrometry–based chemical proteomics approach to enrich, identify, and quantify endogenous PPP holoenzyme complexes combined with kinase profiling, we investigated the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of PPP holoenzymes in mitotic cells. We found that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylated a threonine residue on the catalytic subunit of the phosphatase PP2A, which disrupted its holoenzyme formation with the regulatory subunit B55. The consequent decrease in the dephosphorylation of PP2A-B55 substrates promoted mitotic entry. This direct phosphorylation by CDK1 was in addition to a previously reported indirect mechanism, thus adding a layer to the interaction between CDK1 and PP2A in regulating mitotic entry.},

  abstract     = {The Hanahan and Weinberg “hallmarks of cancer” papers provide a useful structure for considering the various mechanisms driving cancer progression, and the same might be useful for wound healing. In this Review, we highlight how tissue repair and cancer share cellular and molecular processes that are regulated in a wound but misregulated in cancer. From sustained proliferative signaling and the activation of invasion and angiogenesis to the promoting role of inflammation, there are many obvious parallels through which one process can inform the other. For some hallmarks, the parallels are more obscure. We propose some new prospective hallmarks that might apply to both cancer and wound healing and discuss how wounding, as in biopsy and surgery, might positively or negatively influence cancer in the clinic.},

  abstract     = {C3G is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that regulates cell adhesion and migration by activating the GTPase Rap1. The GEF activity of C3G is stimulated by the adaptor proteins Crk and CrkL and by tyrosine phosphorylation. Here, we uncovered mechanisms of C3G autoinhibition and activation. Specifically, we found that two intramolecular interactions regulate the activity of C3G. First, an autoinhibitory region (AIR) within the central domain of C3G binds to and blocks the catalytic Cdc25H domain. Second, the binding of the protein’s N-terminal domain to its Ras exchanger motif (REM) is required for its GEF activity. CrkL activated C3G by displacing the AIR/Cdc25HD interaction. Two missense mutations in the AIR found in non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, Y554H and M555K, disrupted the autoinhibitory mechanism. Expression of C3G-Y554H or C3G-M555K in Ba/F3 pro–B cells caused constitutive activation of Rap1 and, consequently, the integrin LFA-1. Our findings suggest that sustained Rap1 activation by deregulated C3G might promote progression of lymphomas and that designing therapeutics to target C3G might treat these malignancies.},

We investigated the previously reported correlations between AAS and the endogenous μ-opioid system in the rewarding properties of AAS in mice. We found that a single injection of a supraphysiological dose of natural or synthetic AAS strengthened excitatory synaptic transmission in putative ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons. This effect was associated with the activation of μ-opioid receptors (MORs) and an increase in β-endorphins released into the VTA and the plasma. Irreversible blockade of MORs in the VTA counteracted two drug-seeking behaviors, locomotor activity and place preference. These data suggest that AAS indirectly stimulate a dopaminergic reward center of the brain through activation of endogenous opioid signaling and that this mechanism mediates the addictive effects of AAS.},

  abstract     = {The cardiac membrane protein phospholamban (PLN) is targeted by protein kinase A (PKA) at Ser 16 and by Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at Thr 17 . β-Adrenergic stimulation and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ser 16 acutely stimulate the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) by relieving its inhibition by PLN. CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation may lead to longer-lasting SERCA stimulation and may sustain maladaptive Ca 2+ handling. Here, we demonstrated that phosphorylation at either Ser 16 or Thr 17 converted PLN into a target for the phosphoadaptor protein 14-3-3 with different affinities. 14-3-3 proteins were localized within nanometers of PLN and endogenous 14-3-3 coimmunoprecipitated with pentameric PLN from cardiac membranes. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted different molecular contacts for peptides phosphorylated at Ser 16 or Thr 17 with the binding groove of 14-3-3, resulting in varied binding affinities. 14-3-3 binding protected either PLN phosphosite from dephosphorylation. β-Adrenergic stimulation of isolated adult cardiomyocytes resulted in the membrane recruitment of endogenous 14-3-3. The exogenous addition of 14-3-3 to β-adrenergic–stimulated cardiomyocytes led to prolonged SERCA activation, presumably because 14-3-3 protected PLN pentamers from dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Ser 16 was disrupted by the cardiomyopathy-associated ∆Arg 14 mutation, implying that phosphorylation of Thr 17 by CaMKII may become crucial for 14-3-3 recruitment to ∆Arg 14 PLN. Consistent with PLN acting as a dynamic hub in the control of Ca 2+ handling, our results identify 14-3-3 binding to PLN as a contractility-augmenting mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Embryo implantation involves a sterile inflammatory reaction that is required for the invasion of the blastocyst into the decidua. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released from stressed or injured cells acts as an important signaling molecule to regulate many key physiological events, including sterile inflammation. We found that the amount of ATP in the uterine luminal fluid of mice increased during the peri-implantation period, and this depended on the presence of an embryo. We further showed that the release of ATP from receptive epithelial cells was likely stimulated by lactate released from the blastocyst through connexin hemichannels. The ATP receptor P2y2 was present on uterine epithelial cells during the preimplantation period and increased in the stromal cells during the time at which decidualization began. Pharmacological inhibition of P2y2 compromised decidualization and implantation. ATP-P2y2 signaling stimulated the phosphorylation of Stat3 in uterine luminal epithelial cells and the expression of early growth response 1 ( Egr1 ) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 ( Ptgs2, also known as Cox-2 ), all of which are required for decidualization and/or implantation, in stromal cells. Short exposure to high concentrations of ATP promoted decidualization of primary stromal cells, but longer exposures or lower ATP concentrations did not. The expression of genes encoding ATP-degrading ectonucleotidases increased in the decidua during the peri-implantation period, suggesting that they may limit the duration of the ATP signal. Together, our results indicate that the blastocyst-induced release of ATP from uterine epithelial cells during the peri-implantation period may be important for the initiation of stromal cell decidualization.},

MKP5 has been suggested as a potential target for the treatment of dystrophic muscle disease. Here, we identified an inhibitor of MKP5 using a p38α MAPK–derived, phosphopeptide-based small-molecule screen. We solved the structure of MKP5 in complex with this inhibitor, which revealed a previously undescribed allosteric binding pocket. Binding of the inhibitor to this pocket collapsed the MKP5 active site and was predicted to limit MAPK binding. Treatment with the inhibitor recapitulated the phenotype of MKP5 deficiency, resulting in activation of p38 MAPK and JNK. We demonstrated that MKP5 was required for TGF-β1 signaling in muscle and that the inhibitor blocked TGF-β1–mediated Smad2 phosphorylation. TGF-β1 pathway antagonism has been proposed for the treatment of dystrophic muscle disease. Thus, allosteric inhibition of MKP5 represents a therapeutic strategy against dystrophic muscle disease.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic lethality between poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition and BRCA deficiency is exploited to treat breast and ovarian tumors. However, resistance to PARP inhibitors (PARPis) is common. To identify potential resistance mechanisms, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in BRCA2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells and validation in KB2P1.21 mouse mammary tumor cells. We found that resistance to multiple PARPi emerged with reduced expression of TET2 (ten-eleven translocation), which promotes DNA demethylation by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5hmC) and other products. TET2 knockdown in BRCA2-deficient cells protected stalled replication forks (RFs). Increasing 5hmC abundance induced the degradation of stalled RFs in KB2P1.21 and human cancer cells by recruiting the base excision repair–associated apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease APE1, independent of the BRCA2 status. TET2 loss did not affect the recruitment of the repair protein RAD51 to sites of double-strand breaks (DSBs) or the abundance of proteins associated with RF integrity. The loss of TET2, of its product 5hmC, and of APE1 recruitment to stalled RFs promoted resistance to the chemotherapeutic cisplatin. Our findings reveal a previously unknown role for the epigenetic mark 5hmC in maintaining the integrity of stalled RFs and a potential resistance mechanism to PARPi and cisplatin.},

Here, we demonstrated that GULP1 was a KEAP1-binding protein that maintained actin cytoskeleton architecture and helped KEAP1 to sequester NRF2 in the cytoplasm. In urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), silencing of GULP1 facilitated the nuclear accumulation of NRF2, led to constitutive activation of NRF2 signaling, and conferred resistance to the platinum drug cisplatin. Knockdown of GULP1 in UCB cells promoted tumor cell proliferation in vitro and enhanced tumor growth in vivo. In primary UCB, GULP1 silencing was more prevalent in muscle-invasive UCB compared to nonmuscle-invasive UCB. GULP1 knockdown cells showed resistance to cisplatin treatment. In parallel with decreased GULP1 expression, we observed increased expression of NRF2 , HMOX1 , and other candidate antioxidant genes in cisplatin-resistant cells. Furthermore, low or no expression of GULP1 was observed in most cisplatin nonresponder cases. Silencing of GULP1 was associated with GULP1 promoter hypermethylation in cell lines and primary tumors, and a high frequency of GULP1 promoter methylation was observed in multiple sets of primary clinical UCB samples. Together, our findings demonstrate that GULP1 is a KEAP1-binding protein that regulates KEAP1-NRF2 signaling in UCB and that promoter hypermethylation of GULP1 is a potential mechanism of GULP1 silencing.},

  abstract     = {In responses to activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), crucial cell fate decisions depend on the duration and dynamics of ERK signaling. In PC12 cells, epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces transient ERK activation that leads to cell proliferation, whereas nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes sustained ERK activation and cell differentiation. These differences have typically been assumed to reflect distinct feedback mechanisms in the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling network, with the receptors themselves acting as simple upstream inputs. We failed to confirm the expected differences in feedback type when investigating transient versus sustained signaling downstream of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and NGF receptor (TrkA). Instead, we found that ERK signaling faithfully followed RTK dynamics when receptor signaling was modulated in different ways. EGFR activation kinetics, and consequently ERK signaling dynamics, were switched from transient to sustained when receptor internalization was inhibited with drugs or mutations, or when cells expressed a chimeric receptor likely to have impaired dimerization. In addition, EGFR and ERK signaling both became more sustained when substoichiometric levels of erlotinib were added to reduce duration of EGFR kinase activation. Our results argue that RTK activation kinetics play a crucial role in determining MAP kinase cascade signaling dynamics and cell fate decisions, and that signaling outcome can be modified by activating a given RTK in different ways.},

  abstract     = {Chronic activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), notably the branch comprising the kinase PERK and the translation initiation factor eIF2α, is a pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding. Partial reduction of UPR signaling at the level of phosphorylated eIF2α is neuroprotective and avoids the pancreatic toxicity caused by full inhibition of PERK kinase activity. However, other stress pathways besides the UPR converge on phosphorylated eIF2α in the integrated stress response (ISR), which is critical to normal cellular function. We explored whether partial inhibition of PERK signaling may be a better therapeutic option. PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α requires its binding to the insert loop within PERK’s kinase domain, which is, itself, phosphorylated at multiple sites. We found that, as expected, Akt mediates the phosphorylation of Thr 799 in PERK. This phosphorylation event reduced eIF2α binding to PERK and selectively attenuated downstream signaling independently of PERK activity and the broader ISR. Induction of Thr 799 phosphorylation with a small-molecule activator of Akt similarly reduced PERK signaling and increased both neuronal and animal survival without measurable pancreatic toxicity in a mouse model of prion disease. Thus, promoting PERK phosphorylation at Thr 799 to partially down-regulate PERK-eIF2α signaling while avoiding widespread ISR inhibition may be a safe therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative disease.},

  abstract     = {The oxidation of tyrosine residues to generate o, o ′-dityrosine cross-links in extracellular proteins is necessary for the proper function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in various contexts in invertebrates. Tyrosine oxidation is also required for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone in vertebrates, and there is evidence for oxidative cross-linking reactions occurring in extracellular proteins secreted by myofibroblasts. The ECM protein fibronectin circulates in the blood as a globular protein that dimerizes through disulfide bridges generated by cysteine oxidation. We found that cellular (fibrillar) fibronectin on the surface of transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1)–activated human myofibroblasts underwent multimerization by o, o′ -dityrosine cross-linking under reducing conditions that disrupt disulfide bridges, but soluble fibronectin did not. This reaction on tyrosine residues required both the TGF-β1–dependent production of hydrogen peroxide and the presence of myeloperoxidase (MPO) derived from inflammatory cells, which are active participants in wound healing and fibrogenic processes. Oxidative cross-linking of matrix fibronectin attenuated both epithelial and fibroblast migration and conferred resistance to proteolysis by multiple proteases. The abundance of circulating o, o′ -dityrosine–modified fibronectin was increased in a murine model of lung fibrosis and in human subjects with interstitial lung disease compared to that in control healthy subjects. These studies indicate that tyrosine can undergo stable, covalent linkages in fibrillar fibronectin under inflammatory conditions and that this modification affects the migratory behavior of cells on such modified matrices, suggesting that this modification may play a role in both physiologic and pathophysiologic tissue repair.},

  abstract     = {Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition in the brain parenchyma are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We previously reported that platelets contribute to Aβ aggregation in cerebral vessels by secreting the factor clusterin upon binding of Aβ40 to the fibrinogen receptor integrin α IIb β 3 . Here, we investigated the contribution of the collagen receptor GPVI (glycoprotein VI) in platelet-induced amyloid aggregation. Using platelets isolated from GPVI–wild type and GPVI-deficient human donors and mice, we found that Aβ40 bound to GPVI, which induced the release of ATP and fibrinogen, resulting in platelet aggregation. Binding of Aβ40 to integrin α IIb β 3 , fibrinogen, and GPVI collectively contributed to the formation of amyloid clusters at the platelet surface. Consequently, blockade of α IIb β 3 or genetic loss of GPVI reduced amyloid fibril formation in cultured platelets and decreased the adhesion of Aβ-activated platelets to injured carotid arteries in mice. Application of losartan to inhibit collagen binding to GPVI resulted in decreased Aβ40-stimulated platelet activation, factor secretion, and platelet aggregation. Furthermore, the application of GPVI- or integrin-blocking antibodies reduced the formation of platelet-associated amyloid aggregates. Our findings indicate that Aβ40 promotes platelet-mediated amyloid aggregation by binding to both GPVI and integrin α IIb β 3 . Blocking these pathways may therapeutically reduce amyloid plaque formation in cerebral vessels and the brain parenchyma of patients.},

  abstract     = {Two-component systems (TCSs), which consist of a histidine kinase (HK) sensor and a response regulator (RR), are important for bacteria to quickly sense and respond to various environmental signals. HKs and RRs typically function as a cognate pair, interacting only with one another to transduce signaling. Precise signal transduction in a TCS depends on the specific interactions between the receiver domain (RD) of the RR and the dimerization and histidine phosphorylation domain (DHp) of the HK. Here, we determined the complex structure of KdpDE, a TCS consisting of the HK KdpD and the RR KdpE, which is responsible for K + homeostasis. Both the RD and the DNA binding domain (DBD) of KdpE interacted with KdpD. Although the RD of KdpE and the DHp of KdpD contributed to binding specificity, the DBD mediated a distinct interaction with the catalytic ATP-binding (CA) domain of KdpD that was indispensable for KdpDE-mediated signal transduction. Moreover, the DBD-CA interface largely overlapped with that of the DBD-DNA complex, leading to competition between KdpD and its target promoter in a KdpE phosphorylation–dependent manner. In addition, the extended C-terminal tail of the CA domain was critical for stabilizing the interaction with KdpDE and for signal transduction. Together, these data provide a molecular basis for specific KdpD and KdpE interactions that play key roles in efficient signal transduction and transcriptional regulation by this TCS.},

  abstract     = {Anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy resistance is a major clinical challenge in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), due, in part, to insufficient understanding of disease-site, protein-level mechanisms. Although proteomics data from IBD mouse models exist, data and phenotype discrepancies contribute to confounding translation from preclinical animal models of disease to clinical cohorts. We developed an approach called translatable components regression (TransComp-R) to overcome interspecies and trans-omic discrepancies between mouse models and human subjects. TransComp-R combines mouse proteomic data with patient pretreatment transcriptomic data to identify molecular features discernable in the mouse data that are predictive of patient response to therapy. Interrogating the TransComp-R models revealed activated integrin pathway signaling in patients with anti–TNF-resistant colonic Crohn’s disease (cCD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). As a step toward validation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on biopsies from a patient with cCD and analyzed publicly available immune cell proteomics data to characterize the immune and intestinal cell types contributing to anti-TNF resistance. We found that ITGA1 was expressed in T cells and that interactions between these cells and intestinal cell types were associated with resistance to anti-TNF therapy. We experimentally showed that the α 1 integrin subunit mediated the effectiveness of anti-TNF therapy in human immune cells. Thus, TransComp-R identified an integrin signaling mechanism with potential therapeutic implications for overcoming anti-TNF therapy resistance. We suggest that TransComp-R is a generalizable framework for addressing species, molecular, and phenotypic discrepancies between model systems and patients to translationally deliver relevant biological insights.},

The spatiotemporal and strain-specific changes of the brain peptidome correlated with the composition of the gut microbiome. The hippocampus exhibited the most sensitive response to probiotic treatment. The administration of heat-killed probiotics altered the hippocampus peptidome but did not substantially change the gut microbiome. We developed a literature-mining algorithm to link the neuropeptides altered by probiotics with potential functional roles. We validated the probiotic-regulated role of corticotropin-releasing hormone by monitoring the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the prenatal stress–induced hyperactivity of which was attenuated by probiotics treatment.

Here, we showed that the mitochondrial FUN14 domain–containing protein-1 (FUNDC1), an effector of Parkin-independent mitophagy, also participates in cellular plasticity by sustaining oxidative bioenergetics, buffering ROS production, and supporting cell proliferation. Targeting this pathway in cancer cells suppressed tumor growth but rendered transformed cells more motile and invasive in a manner dependent on ROS-mediated mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial repositioning to the cortical cytoskeleton. Global metabolomics and proteomics profiling identified a FUNDC1 interactome at the mitochondrial inner membrane, comprising the AAA+ protease, LonP1, and subunits of oxidative phosphorylation, complex V (ATP synthase). Independently of its previously identified role in mitophagy, FUNDC1 enabled LonP1 proteostasis, which in turn preserved complex V function and decreased ROS generation. Therefore, mitochondrial reprogramming by a FUNDC1-LonP1 axis controls tumor cell plasticity by switching between proliferative and invasive states in cancer.},

Our previously reported finding that protein cysteine oxidation is increased during mitosis relative to other cell cycle phases suggests that redox modifications could play prominent roles in regulating mitotic processes. The Aurora family of kinases and their downstream targets are key components of the cellular machinery that ensures the proper execution of mitosis and the accurate segregation of chromosomes to daughter cells. In this study, x-ray crystal structures of the Aurora A kinase domain delineate redox-sensitive cysteine residues that, upon covalent modification, can allosterically regulate kinase activity and oligomerization state. We showed in both Xenopus laevis egg extracts and mammalian cells that a conserved cysteine residue within the Aurora A activation loop is crucial for Aurora A activation by autophosphorylation. We further showed that covalent disulfide adducts of this residue promote autophosphorylation of the Aurora A kinase domain. These findings reveal a potential mechanistic link between Aurora A activation and changes in the intracellular redox state during mitosis and provide insights into how novel small-molecule inhibitors may be developed to target specific subpopulations of Aurora A.},

  abstract     = {Fusobacterium nucleatum is implicated in accelerating colorectal cancer (CRC) and is found within metastatic CRC cells in patient biopsies. Here, we found that bacterial invasion of CRC cells and cocultured immune cells induced a differential cytokine secretion that may contribute to CRC metastasis. We used a modified galactose kinase markerless gene deletion approach and found that F. nucleatum invaded cultured HCT116 CRC cells through the bacterial surface adhesin Fap2. In turn, Fap2-dependent invasion induced the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and CXCL1, which are associated with CRC progression and promoted HCT116 cell migration. Conditioned medium from F. nucleatum –infected HCT116 cells caused naïve cells to migrate, which was blocked by depleting CXCL1 and IL-8 from the conditioned medium. Cytokine secretion from HCT116 cells and cellular migration were attenuated by inhibiting F. nucleatum host-cell binding and entry using galactose sugars, l -arginine, neutralizing membrane protein antibodies, or fap2 deletion. F. nucleatum also induces the mobilization of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. However, in neutrophils and macrophages, the bacterial-induced secretion of cytokines was Fap2 independent. Thus, our findings show that F. nucleatum both directly and indirectly modulates immune and cancer cell signaling and migration. Because increased IL-8 and CXCL1 production in tumors is associated with increased metastatic potential and cell seeding, poor prognosis, and enhanced recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages and fibroblasts, we propose that inhibition of host-cell binding and invasion, potentially through vaccination or novel galactoside compounds, could be an effective strategy for reducing F. nucleatum –associated CRC metastasis.},

  abstract     = {Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a central role in Ca 2+ signaling throughout the body. In the hippocampus, CaMKII is required for learning and memory. Vertebrate genomes encode four CaMKII homologs: CaMKIIα, CaMKIIβ, CaMKIIγ, and CaMKIIδ. All CaMKIIs consist of a kinase domain, a regulatory segment, a variable linker region, and a hub domain, which is responsible for oligomerization. The four proteins differ primarily in linker length and composition because of extensive alternative splicing. Here, we report the heterogeneity of CaMKII transcripts in three complex samples of human hippocampus using deep sequencing. We showed that hippocampal cells contain a diverse collection of over 70 CaMKII transcripts from all four CaMKII-encoding genes. We characterized the Ca 2+ /CaM sensitivity of hippocampal CaMKII variants spanning a broad range of linker lengths and compositions. The effect of the variable linker on Ca 2+ /CaM sensitivity depended on the kinase and hub domains. Moreover, we revealed a previously uncharacterized role for the hub domain as an allosteric regulator of kinase activity, which may provide a pharmacological target for modulating CaMKII activity. Using small-angle x-ray scattering and single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we present evidence for extensive interactions between the kinase and the hub domains, even in the presence of a 30-residue linker. Together, these data suggest that Ca 2+ /CaM sensitivity in CaMKII is homolog dependent and includes substantial contributions from the hub domain. Our sequencing approach, combined with biochemistry, provides insights into understanding the complex pool of endogenous CaMKII splice variants.},

  abstract     = {Plants defend against herbivores and nematodes by rapidly sending signals from the wounded sites to the whole plant. We investigated how plants generate and transduce these rapidly moving, long-distance signals referred to as systemic wound signals. We developed a system for measuring systemic responses to root wounding in Arabidopsis thaliana . We found that root wounding or the application of glutamate to wounded roots was sufficient to trigger root-to-shoot Ca 2+ waves and slow wave potentials (SWPs). Both of these systemic signals were inhibited by either disruption of both GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 , which encode glutamate receptor–like proteins (GLRs), or constitutive activation of the P-type H + -ATPase AHA1. We further showed that GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 displayed Ca 2+ -permeable channel activities gated by both glutamate and extracellular pH. Together, these results support the hypothesis that wounding inhibits P-type H + -ATPase activity, leading to apoplastic alkalization. This, together with glutamate released from damaged phloem, activates GLRs, resulting in depolarization of membranes in the form of SWPs and the generation of cytosolic Ca 2+ increases to propagate systemic wound signaling.},

  abstract     = {Because of their prominent roles in development, cancer, and HIV, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 have been the subject of numerous structural and functional studies, but the determinants of ligand binding, selectivity, and signaling are still poorly understood. Here, building on our latest structural model, we used a systematic mutagenesis strategy to dissect the functional anatomy of the CXCR4-CXCL12 complex. Key charge swap mutagenesis experiments provided evidence for pairwise interactions between oppositely charged residues in the receptor and chemokine, confirming the accuracy of the predicted orientation of the chemokine relative to the receptor and providing insight into ligand selectivity. Progressive deletion of N-terminal residues revealed an unexpected contribution of the receptor N terminus to chemokine signaling. This finding challenges a longstanding “two-site” hypothesis about the essential features of the receptor-chemokine interaction in which the N terminus contributes only to binding affinity. Our results suggest that although the interaction of the chemokine N terminus with the receptor-binding pocket is the key driver of signaling, the signaling amplitude depends on the extent to which the receptor N terminus binds the chemokine. Together with systematic characterization of other epitopes, these data enable us to propose an experimentally consistent structural model for how CXCL12 binds CXCR4 and initiates signal transmission through the receptor transmembrane domain.},

  abstract     = {Spontaneous Ca 2+ signaling from the InsP 3 R intracellular Ca 2+ release channel to mitochondria is essential for optimal oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and ATP production. In cells with defective OXPHOS, reductive carboxylation replaces oxidative metabolism to maintain amounts of reducing equivalents and metabolic precursors. To investigate the role of mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake in regulating bioenergetics in these cells, we used OXPHOS-competent and OXPHOS-defective cells. Inhibition of InsP 3 R activity or mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake increased α-ketoglutarate (αKG) abundance and the NAD + /NADH ratio, indicating that constitutive endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–to–mitochondria Ca 2+ transfer promoted optimal αKG dehydrogenase (αKGDH) activity. Reducing mitochondrial Ca 2+ inhibited αKGDH activity and increased NAD + , which induced SIRT1-dependent autophagy in both OXPHOS-competent and OXPHOS-defective cells. Whereas autophagic flux in OXPHOS-competent cells promoted cell survival, it was impaired in OXPHOS-defective cells because of inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Inhibition of αKGDH and impaired autophagic flux in OXPHOS-defective cells resulted in pronounced cell death in response to interruption of constitutive flux of Ca 2+ from ER to mitochondria. These results demonstrate that mitochondria play a fundamental role in maintaining bioenergetic homeostasis of both OXPHOS-competent and OXPHOS-defective cells, with Ca 2+ regulation of αKGDH activity playing a pivotal role. Inhibition of ER-to-mitochondria Ca 2+ transfer may represent a general therapeutic strategy against cancer cells regardless of their OXPHOS status.},

  abstract     = {Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1) is an important metalloproteinase that synchronizes growth factor activation with extracellular matrix assembly during morphogenesis and tissue repair. The mechanisms by which BMP-1 exerts these effects are highly context dependent. Because BMP-1 overexpression induces marked phenotypic changes in two human cell lines (HT1080 and 293-EBNA cells), we investigated how BMP-1 simultaneously affects cell-matrix interactions and growth factor activity in these cells. Increasing BMP-1 led to a loss of cell adhesion that depended on the matricellular glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). BMP-1 cleaved TSP-1 between the VWFC/procollagen-like domain and the type 1 repeats that mediate several key TSP-1 functions. This cleavage induced the release of TSP-1 C-terminal domains from the extracellular matrix and abolished its previously described multisite cooperative interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and CD36 on HT1080 cells. In addition, BMP-1–dependent proteolysis potentiated the TSP-1–mediated activation of latent transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β), leading to increased signaling through the canonical SMAD pathway. In primary human corneal stromal cells (keratocytes), endogenous BMP-1 cleaved TSP-1, and the addition of exogenous BMP-1 enhanced cleavage, but this had no substantial effect on cell adhesion. Instead, processed TSP-1 promoted the differentiation of keratocytes into myofibroblasts and stimulated production of the myofibroblast marker α-SMA, consistent with the presence of processed TSP-1 in human corneal scars. Our results indicate that BMP-1 can both trigger the disruption of cell adhesion and stimulate TGF-β signaling in TSP-1–rich microenvironments, which has important potential consequences for wound healing and tumor progression.},

  abstract     = {Aberrant regulation of metabolic kinases by altered redox homeostasis substantially contributes to aging and various diseases, such as diabetes. We found that the catalytic activity of a conserved family of fructosamine-3-kinases (FN3Ks), which are evolutionarily related to eukaryotic protein kinases, is regulated by redox-sensitive cysteine residues in the kinase domain. The crystal structure of the FN3K homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that it forms an unexpected strand-exchange dimer in which the ATP-binding P-loop and adjoining β strands are swapped between two chains in the dimer. This dimeric configuration is characterized by strained interchain disulfide bonds that stabilize the P-loop in an extended conformation. Mutational analysis and solution studies confirmed that the strained disulfides function as redox “switches” to reversibly regulate the activity and dimerization of FN3K. Human FN3K, which contains an equivalent P-loop Cys, was also redox sensitive, whereas ancestral bacterial FN3K homologs, which lack a P-loop Cys, were not. Furthermore, CRISPR-mediated knockout of FN3K in human liver cancer cells altered the abundance of redox metabolites, including an increase in glutathione. We propose that redox regulation evolved in FN3K homologs in response to changing cellular redox conditions. Our findings provide insights into the origin and evolution of redox regulation in the protein kinase superfamily and may open new avenues for targeting human FN3K in diabetic complications.},

  abstract     = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are physiological mediators of cellular signaling and play potentially damaging roles in human diseases. In this study, we found that the catalytic activity of the Ser/Thr kinase Aurora A was inhibited by the oxidation of a conserved cysteine residue (Cys 290 ) that lies adjacent to Thr 288 , a critical phosphorylation site in the activation segment. Cys is present at the equivalent position in ~100 human Ser/Thr kinases, a residue that we found was important not only for the activity of human Aurora A but also for that of fission yeast MAPK-activated kinase (Srk1) and PKA (Pka1). Moreover, the presence of this conserved Cys predicted biochemical redox sensitivity among a cohort of human CAMK, AGC, and AGC-like kinases. Thus, we predict that redox modulation of the conserved Cys 290 of Aurora A may be an underappreciated regulatory mechanism that is widespread in eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinases. Given the key biological roles of these enzymes, these findings have implications for understanding physiological and pathological responses to ROS and highlight the importance of protein kinase regulation through multivalent modification of the activation segment.},

An example is the abundant ER lectin calnexin, which interacts with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA). We found that calnexin stimulated the ATPase activity of SERCA by maintaining its redox state. This function enabled calnexin to control how much ER Ca 2+ was available for mitochondria, a key determinant for mitochondrial bioenergetics. Calnexin-deficient cells compensated for the loss of this function by partially shifting energy generation to the glycolytic pathway. These cells also showed closer apposition between the ER and mitochondria. Calnexin therefore controls the cellular energy balance between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis.},

  abstract     = {N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors (NMDARs) containing GluN2B subunits are prevalent early after birth in most brain regions in rodents. Upon synapse maturation, GluN2B is progressively removed from synapses, which affects NMDAR function and synaptic plasticity. Aberrant recruitment of GluN2B into mature synapses has been implicated in several neuropathologies that afflict adults. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b was enriched in the spinal cord dorsal horn neurons of mice and rats and suppressed GluN2B abundance during development and inflammatory pain. Cbl-b abundance increased from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P14, a critical time period for synapse maturation. Through its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain, Cbl-b interacted with GluN2B. Ubiquitination of GluN2B by Cbl-b decreased the synaptic transmission mediated by GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Knocking down Cbl-b in vivo during P1 to P14 led to sustained retention of GluN2B at dorsal horn synapses, suggesting that Cbl-b limits the synaptic abundance of GluN2B in adult mice. However, peripheral inflammation induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant resulted in the dephosphorylation of Cbl-b at Tyr 363 , which impaired its binding to and ubiquitylation of GluN2B, enabling the reappearance of GluN2B-containing NMDARs at synapses. Expression of a phosphomimic Cbl-b mutant in the dorsal horn suppressed both GluN2B-mediated synaptic currents and manifestations of pain induced by inflammation. The findings indicate a ubiquitin-mediated developmental switch in NMDAR subunit composition that is dysregulated by inflammation, which can enhance nociception.},

  abstract     = {Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are often overexpressed or mutated in cancers and drive tumor growth and metastasis. In the current model of RTK signaling, including that of MET, downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) mediates both cell proliferation and cell migration, whereas the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rac1 mediates cell migration. However, in cultured NIH3T3 and glioblastoma cells, we found that class I PI3K mediated oncogenic MET–induced cell migration but not anchorage-independent growth. In contrast, Rac1 regulated both processes in distinct ways. Downstream of PI3K, Rac1 mediated cell migration through its GTPase activity, whereas independently of PI3K, Rac1 mediated anchorage-independent growth in a GTPase-independent manner through an adaptor function. Through its RKR motif, Rac1 formed a complex with the kinase mTOR to promote its translocation to the plasma membrane, where its activity promoted anchorage-independent growth of the cell cultures. Inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin suppressed the growth of subcutaneous MET-mutant cell grafts in mice, including that of MET inhibitor–resistant cells. These findings reveal a GTPase-independent role for Rac1 in mediating a PI3K-independent MET-to-mTOR pathway and suggest alternative or combined strategies that might overcome resistance to RTK inhibitors in patients with cancer.},

  abstract     = {TRPML1 (transient receptor potential mucolipin 1) is a Ca 2+ -permeable, nonselective cation channel localized to the membranes of endosomes and lysosomes and is not present or functional on the plasma membrane. Ca 2+ released from endosomes and lysosomes into the cytosol through TRPML1 channels is vital for trafficking, acidification, and other basic functions of these organelles. Here, we investigated the function of TRPML1 channels in fully differentiated contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In live-cell confocal imaging studies, we found that most endosomes and lysosomes in freshly isolated SMCs from cerebral arteries were essentially immobile. Using nanoscale super-resolution microscopy, we found that TRPML1 channels present in late endosomes and lysosomes formed stable complexes with type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Spontaneous Ca 2+ signals resulting from the release of SR Ca 2+ through RyR2s (“Ca 2+ sparks”) and corresponding Ca 2+ -activated K + channel activity are critically important for balancing vasoconstriction. We found that these signals were essentially absent in SMCs from TRPML1-knockout ( Mcoln1 −/− ) mice. Using ex vivo pressure myography, we found that loss of this critical signaling cascade exaggerated the vasoconstrictor responses of cerebral and mesenteric resistance arteries. In vivo radiotelemetry studies showed that Mcoln1 −/− mice were spontaneously hypertensive. We conclude that TRPML1 is crucial for the initiation of Ca 2+ sparks in SMCs and the regulation of vascular contractility and blood pressure.},

  abstract     = {Structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1 (SMCHD1) is an epigenetic regulator in which polymorphisms cause the human developmental disorder, Bosma arhinia micropthalmia syndrome, and the degenerative disease, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. SMCHD1 is considered a noncanonical SMC family member because its hinge domain is C-terminal, because it homodimerizes rather than heterodimerizes, and because SMCHD1 contains a GHKL-type, rather than an ABC-type ATPase domain at its N terminus. The hinge domain has been previously implicated in chromatin association; however, the underlying mechanism involved and the basis for SMCHD1 homodimerization are unclear. Here, we used x-ray crystallography to solve the three-dimensional structure of the Smchd1 hinge domain. Together with structure-guided mutagenesis, we defined structural features of the hinge domain that participated in homodimerization and nucleic acid binding, and we identified a functional hotspot required for chromatin localization in cells. This structure provides a template for interpreting the mechanism by which patient polymorphisms within the SMCHD1 hinge domain could compromise function and lead to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.},

  abstract     = {Despite decades of effort, the sensitivity of patient tumors to individual drugs is often not predictable on the basis of molecular markers alone. Therefore, unbiased, high-throughput approaches to match patient tumors to effective drugs, without requiring a priori molecular hypotheses, are critically needed. Here, we improved upon a method that we previously reported and developed called high-throughput dynamic BH3 profiling (HT-DBP). HT-DBP is a microscopy-based, single-cell resolution assay that enables chemical screens of hundreds to thousands of candidate drugs on freshly isolated tumor cells. The method identifies chemical inducers of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling, a mechanism of cell death. HT-DBP requires only 24 hours of ex vivo culture, which enables a more immediate study of fresh primary tumor cells and minimizes adaptive changes that occur with prolonged ex vivo culture. Effective compounds identified by HT-DBP induced tumor regression in genetically engineered and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of breast cancer. We additionally found that chemical vulnerabilities changed as cancer cells expanded ex vivo. Furthermore, using PDX models of colon cancer and resected tumors from colon cancer patients, our data demonstrated that HT-DBP could be used to generate personalized pharmacotypes. Thus, HT-DBP appears to be an ex vivo functional method with sufficient scale to simultaneously function as a companion diagnostic, therapeutic personalization, and discovery tool.},

  abstract     = {Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a cellular transdifferentiation program in which endothelial cells partially lose their endothelial identity and acquire mesenchymal-like features. Renal capillary endothelial cells can undergo EndMT in association with persistent damage of the renal parenchyma. The functional consequence(s) of EndMT in kidney fibrosis remains unexplored. Here, we studied the effect of Twist or Snail deficiency in endothelial cells on EndMT in kidney fibrosis. Conditional deletion of Twist1 (which encodes Twist) or Snai1 (which encodes Snail) in VE-cadherin + or Tie1 + endothelial cells inhibited the emergence of EndMT and improved kidney fibrosis in two different kidney injury/fibrosis mouse models. Suppression of EndMT limited peritubular vascular leakage, reduced tissue hypoxia, and preserved tubular epithelial health and function. Hypoxia, which was exacerbated by EndMT, resulted in increased Myc abundance in tubular epithelial cells, enhanced glycolysis, and suppression of fatty acid oxidation. Pharmacological suppression or epithelial-specific genetic ablation of Myc in tubular epithelial cells ameliorated fibrosis and restored renal parenchymal function and metabolic homeostasis. Together, these findings demonstrate a functional role for EndMT in the response to kidney capillary endothelial injury and highlight the contribution of endothelial-epithelial cross-talk in the development of kidney fibrosis with a potential for therapeutic intervention.},

Experiments with animal models and in vitro systems have substantially contributed to our understanding of the pathophysiology of ZIKV infection. Here, to investigate the molecular basis of CZS in humans, we used a systems biology approach to integrate transcriptomic, proteomic, and genomic data from the postmortem brains of neonates with CZS. We observed that collagens were greatly reduced in expression in CZS brains at both the RNA and protein levels and that neonates with CZS had several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in collagen-encoding genes that are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta and arthrogryposis. These findings were validated by immunohistochemistry and comparative analysis of collagen abundance in ZIKV-infected and uninfected samples. In addition, we showed a ZIKV-dependent increase in the expression of cell adhesion factors that are essential for neurite outgrowth and axon guidance, findings that are consistent with the neuronal migration defects observed in CZS. Together, these findings provide insights into the underlying molecular alterations in the ZIKV-infected brain and reveal host genes associated with CZS susceptibility.},

Here, we used selective small-molecule inhibitors to assess the regulatory roles of interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)–associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) in these pathways. The inhibition of IRAK4 repressed SLE immune complex– and TLR7-mediated activation of human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Correspondingly, the expression of interferon (IFN)–responsive genes (IRGs) in cells and in mice was positively regulated by the kinase activity of IRAK4. Both IRAK4 and BTK inhibition reduced the TLR7-mediated differentiation of human memory B cells into plasmablasts. TLR7-dependent inflammatory responses were differentially regulated by IRAK4 and BTK by cell type: In pDCs, IRAK4 positively regulated NF-κB and MAPK signaling, whereas in B cells, NF-κB and MAPK pathways were regulated by both BTK and IRAK4. In the pristane-induced lupus mouse model, inhibition of IRAK4 reduced the expression of IRGs during disease onset. Mice engineered to express kinase-deficient IRAK4 were protected from both chemical (pristane-induced) and genetic (NZB/W_F1 hybrid) models of lupus development. Our findings suggest that kinase inhibitors of IRAK4 might be a therapeutic in patients with SLE.},

  abstract     = {Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of tissue injury and is believed to initiate the development of vascular diseases. Sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor-1 (S1P 1 ) plays fundamental physiological roles in endothelial function and lymphocyte homing. Currently available clinical molecules that target this receptor are desensitizing and are essentially S1P 1 functional antagonists that cause lymphopenia. They are clinically beneficial in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In patients, several side effects of S1P 1 desensitization have been attributed to endothelial damage, suggesting that drugs with the opposite effect, namely, the ability to activate S1P 1, could help to restore endothelial homeostasis. We found and characterized a biased agonist of S1P 1 , SAR247799, which preferentially activated downstream G protein signaling to a greater extent than β-arrestin and internalization signaling pathways. SAR247799 activated S1P 1 on endothelium without causing receptor desensitization and potently activated protection pathways in human endothelial cells. In a pig model of coronary endothelial damage, SAR247799 improved the microvascular hyperemic response without reducing lymphocyte numbers. Similarly, in a rat model of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury, SAR247799 preserved renal structure and function at doses that did not induce S1P 1 -desensitizing effects, such as lymphopenia and lung vascular leakage. In contrast, a clinically used S1P 1 functional antagonist, siponimod, conferred minimal renal protection and desensitized S1P 1 . These findings demonstrate that sustained S1P 1 activation can occur pharmacologically without compromising the immune response, providing a new approach to treat diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction and vascular hyperpermeability.},

  abstract     = {Although insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling promotes tumor growth and cancer progression, therapies that target the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) have shown poor clinical efficacy. To address IGF-1R activity in cancer cells and how it differs from that of the closely related insulin receptor (IR), we focused on two tyrosines in the IGF-1R C-terminal tail that are not present in the IR and are essential for IGF-1–mediated cancer cell survival, migration, and tumorigenic growth. We found that Tyr 1250 and Tyr 1251 (Tyr 1250/1251 ) were autophosphorylated in a cell adhesion–dependent manner. To investigate the consequences of this phosphorylation, we generated phosphomimetic Y1250E/Y1251E (EE) and nonphosphorylatable Y1250F/Y1251F (FF) mutant forms of IGF-1R. Although fully competent in kinase activity and signaling, the EE mutant was more rapidly internalized and degraded than either the wild-type or FF receptor. IGF-1 promoted the accumulation of wild-type and EE IGF-1R within the Golgi apparatus, whereas the FF mutant remained at the plasma membrane. Golgi-associated IGF-1R signaling was a feature of migratory cancer cells, and Golgi disruption impaired IGF-1–induced signaling and cell migration. Upon the formation of new cell adhesions, IGF-1R transiently relocalized to the plasma membrane from the Golgi. Thus, phosphorylation at Tyr 1250/1251 promoted IGF-1R translocation to and signaling from the Golgi to support an aggressive cancer phenotype. This process distinguishes IGF-1R from IR signaling and could contribute to the poor clinical efficacy of antibodies that target IGF-1R on the cell surface.},

  abstract     = {The suppression of bone formation is a hallmark of multiple myeloma. Myeloma cells inhibit osteoblastogenesis from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can also differentiate into adipocytes. We investigated myeloma-MSC interactions and the effects of such interactions on the differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes or osteoblasts using single-cell RNA sequencing, in vitro coculture, and subcutaneous injection of MSCs and myeloma cells into mice. Our results revealed that the α 4 integrin subunit on myeloma cells stimulated vascular cell adhesion molecule–1 (VCAM1) on MSCs, leading to the activation of protein kinase C β1 (PKCβ1) signaling and repression of the muscle ring-finger protein-1 (MURF1)–mediated ubiquitylation of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2). Stabilized PPARγ2 proteins enhanced adipogenesis and consequently reduced osteoblastogenesis from MSCs, thus suppressing bone formation in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal that suppressed bone formation is a direct consequence of myeloma-MSC contact that promotes the differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes at the expense of osteoblasts. Thus, this study provides a potential strategy for treating bone resorption in patients with myeloma by counteracting tumor-MSC interactions.},

Using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed how the cellular memory of stress adaptation is encoded in single yeast cells. We found that cellular memory was biphasic. Short-lived memory was mediated by trehalose synthase and trehalose metabolism. Long-lived memory was mediated by PKA-regulated stress-responsive transcription factors and cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules. Short- and long-lived memory could be selectively induced by different priming input dynamics. Computational modeling revealed how the PKA-mediated regulatory network could encode previous stimuli into memories with distinct dynamics. This biphasic memory-encoding scheme might represent a general strategy to prepare for future challenges in rapidly changing environments.},

Within these generally sessile biofilms, a subset of cells continues to express motility genes. We found that this subpopulation enabled Bacillus subtilis biofilms to expand on high-friction surfaces. The extracellular matrix (ECM) protein TasA was required for the expression of flagellar genes. In addition to its structural role as an adhesive fiber for cell attachment, TasA acted as a developmental signal stimulating a subset of biofilm cells to revert to a motile phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TasA stimulated the expression of a specific subset of genes whose products promote motility and repress ECM production. Spontaneous suppressor mutations that restored motility in the absence of TasA revealed that activation of the biofilm-motility switch by the two-component system CssR/CssS antagonized the TasA-mediated reversion to motility in biofilm cells. Our results suggest that although mostly sessile, biofilms retain a degree of motility by actively maintaining a motile subpopulation.},

Here, we report that CD2 costimulation plays a critical role in target cell killing by freshly isolated human CD8 + T cells, which represent a challenging but valuable model to gain insight into CTL biology. We found that CD2 stimulation critically enhanced signaling by the T cell receptor in the formation of functional immune synapses by promoting the polarization of lytic granules toward the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). To gain insight into the underlying mechanism, we explored the CD2 signaling network by phosphoproteomics, which revealed 616 CD2-regulated phosphorylation events in 373 proteins implicated in the regulation of vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, autophagy, and metabolism. Signaling by the master metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was a critical node in the CD2 network, which promoted granule polarization toward the MTOC in CD8 + T cells. Granule trafficking was driven by active AMPK enriched on adjacent lysosomes, revealing previously uncharacterized signaling cross-talk between vesicular compartments in CD8 + T cells. Our results thus establish CD2 signaling as key for mediating cytotoxic killing and granule polarization in freshly isolated CD8 + T cells and strengthen the rationale to choose CD2 and AMPK as therapeutic targets to enhance CTL activity.},

  abstract     = {Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that dictates whether cells survive or die in response to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other inflammatory stimuli. The activity of RIPK1 is tightly controlled by multiple posttranslational modification mechanisms, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Here, we report that sensitivity to TNF-induced, RIPK1-dependent cell death was tunable by the pH environment. We found that an acidic extracellular pH, which led to a concomitant decrease in intracellular pH, impaired the kinase activation of RIPK1 and autophosphorylation at Ser 166 . Consequently, formation of the cytosolic death-inducing complex II and subsequent RIPK1-dependent necroptosis and apoptosis were inhibited. By contrast, low pH did not affect the formation of membrane-anchored TNFR1-containing signaling complex (complex I), RIPK1 ubiquitination, and NF-κB activation. TNF-induced cell death in Ripk1 −/− cells was not sensitive to pH changes. Furthermore, mutation of the conserved His 151 abolished the pH dependence of RIPK1 activation, suggesting that this histidine residue functions as a proton acceptor to modulate RIPK1 activity in response to pH changes. These results revealed an unexpected environmental factor that controls the death-inducing activity of RIPK1.},

Here, we found that inhibiting Hsp90 specifically in the spinal cord enhanced the antinociceptive effects of morphine in mice. Intrathecal, but not systemic, administration of the Hsp90 inhibitors 17-AAG or KU-32 amplified the effects of morphine in suppressing sensitivity to both thermal and mechanical stimuli in mice. Hsp90 inhibition enabled opioid-induced phosphorylation of the kinase ERK and increased abundance of the kinase RSK in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord, which are heavily populated with primary afferent sensory neurons. The additive effects of Hsp90 inhibition were abolished upon intrathecal inhibition of ERK, RSK, or protein synthesis. This mechanism downstream of MOR, localized to the spinal cord and repressed by Hsp90, may potentially be used to enhance the efficacy and presumably decrease the side effects of opioid therapy.},

Maintenance of high glycolytic rates depends on the lactate dehydrogenase–catalyzed regeneration of NAD + from GAPDH-generated NADH because an increased NADH:NAD + ratio inhibits GAPDH. Here, using human breast cancer cell models, we identified a pathway in which changes in the extramitochondrial-free NADH:NAD + ratio signaled through the CtBP family of NADH-sensitive transcriptional regulators to control the abundance and activity of p53. NADH-free forms of CtBPs cooperated with the p53-binding partner HDM2 to suppress p53 function, and loss of these forms in highly glycolytic cells resulted in p53 accumulation. We propose that this pathway represents a “glycolytic stress response” in which the initiation of a protective p53 response by an increased NADH:NAD + ratio enables cells to avoid cellular damage caused by mismatches between metabolic supply and demand.},

These neurons also express the Ca 2+ -permeable channel and noxious heat sensor TRPV1, which can activate ANO1. Here, we revealed an intricate mechanism of TRPV1-ANO1 channel coupling in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Simultaneous optical monitoring of CaCC activity and Ca 2+ dynamics revealed that the TRPV1 ligand capsaicin activated CaCCs. However, depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2+ stores reduced capsaicin-induced Ca 2+ increases and CaCC activation, suggesting that ER Ca 2+ release contributed to TRPV1-induced CaCC activation. ER store depletion by plasma membrane–localized TRPV1 channels was demonstrated with an ER-localized Ca 2+ sensor in neurons exposed to a cell-impermeable TRPV1 ligand. Proximity ligation assays established that ANO1, TRPV1, and the IP 3 receptor IP 3 R1 were often found in close proximity to each other. Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) confirmed the close association between all three channels in DRG neurons. Together, our data reveal the existence of ANO1-containing multichannel nanodomains in DRG neurons and suggest that coupling between TRPV1 and ANO1 requires ER Ca 2+ release, which may be necessary to enhance ANO1 activation.},

  abstract     = {The DNA polymerase Polκ plays a key role in translesion synthesis, an error-prone replication mechanism. Polκ is overexpressed in various tumor types. Here, we found that melanoma and lung and breast cancer cells experiencing stress from oncogene inhibition up-regulated the expression of Polκ and shifted its localization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This effect was phenocopied by inhibition of the kinase mTOR, by induction of ER stress, or by glucose deprivation. In unstressed cells, Polκ is continually transported out of the nucleus by exportin-1. Inhibiting exportin-1 or overexpressing Polκ increased the abundance of nuclear-localized Polκ, particularly in response to the BRAF V600E -targeted inhibitor vemurafenib, which decreased the cytotoxicity of the drug in BRAF V600E melanoma cells. These observations were analogous to how Escherichia coli encountering cell stress and nutrient deprivation can up-regulate and activate DinB/pol IV, the bacterial ortholog of Polκ, to induce mutagenesis that enables stress tolerance or escape. However, we found that the increased expression of Polκ was not excessively mutagenic, indicating that noncatalytic or other functions of Polκ could mediate its role in stress responses in mammalian cells. Repressing the expression or nuclear localization of Polκ might prevent drug resistance in some cancer cells.},

  abstract     = {The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle converts the end products of glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation into the reducing equivalents NADH and FADH 2 . Although mitochondrial matrix uptake of Ca 2+ enhances ATP production, it remains unclear whether deprivation of mitochondrial TCA substrates alters mitochondrial Ca 2+ flux. We investigated the effect of TCA cycle substrates on MCU-mediated mitochondrial matrix uptake of Ca 2+ , mitochondrial bioenergetics, and autophagic flux. Inhibition of glycolysis, mitochondrial pyruvate transport, or mitochondrial fatty acid transport triggered expression of the MCU gatekeeper MICU1 but not the MCU core subunit. Knockdown of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) isoforms or expression of the dominant negative mutant MPC1 R97W resulted in increased MICU1 protein abundance and inhibition of MCU-mediated mitochondrial matrix uptake of Ca 2+ . We also found that genetic ablation of MPC1 in hepatocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in reduced resting matrix Ca 2+ , likely because of increased MICU1 expression, but resulted in changes in mitochondrial morphology. TCA cycle substrate–dependent MICU1 expression was mediated by the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR1). Blocking mitochondrial pyruvate or fatty acid flux was linked to increased autophagy marker abundance. These studies reveal a mechanism that controls the MCU-mediated Ca 2+ flux machinery and that depends on TCA cycle substrate availability. This mechanism generates a metabolic homeostatic circuit that protects cells from bioenergetic crisis and mitochondrial Ca 2+ overload during periods of nutrient stress.},

  abstract     = {The Salmonella enterica PhoP/PhoQ two-component signaling system coordinates the spatiotemporal expression of key virulence factors that confer pathogenic traits. Through biochemical and structural analyses, we found that the sensor histidine kinase PhoQ acted as a receptor for long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFAs), which induced a conformational change in the periplasmic domain of the PhoQ protein. This resulted in the repression of PhoQ autokinase activity, leading to inhibition of the expression of PhoP/PhoQ-dependent genes. Recognition of the LCUFA linoleic acid (LA) by PhoQ was not stereospecific because positional and geometrical isomers of LA equally inhibited PhoQ autophosphorylation, which was conserved in multiple S. enterica serovars. Because orally acquired Salmonella encounters conjugated LA (CLA), a product of the metabolic conversion of LA by microbiota, in the human intestine, we tested how short-term oral administration of CLA affected gut colonization and systemic dissemination in a mouse model of Salmonella -induced colitis. Compared to untreated mice, CLA-treated mice showed increased gut colonization by wild-type Salmonella , as well as increased dissemination to the spleen. In contrast, the inability of the phoP strain to disseminate systemically remained unchanged by CLA treatment. Together, our results reveal that, by inhibiting PhoQ, environmental LCUFAs fine-tune the fate of Salmonella during infection. These findings may aid in the design of new anti- Salmonella therapies.},

  abstract     = {Breast and mammary epithelial cells experience different local environments during tissue development and tumorigenesis. Microenvironmental heterogeneity gives rise to distinct cell regulatory states whose identity and importance are just beginning to be appreciated. Cellular states diversify when clonal three-dimensional (3D) spheroids are cultured in basement membrane, and one such state is associated with stress tolerance and poor response to anticancer therapeutics. Here, we found that this state was jointly coordinated by the NRF2 and p53 pathways, which were costabilized by spontaneous oxidative stress within 3D cultures. Inhibition of NRF2 or p53 individually disrupted some of the transcripts defining the regulatory state but did not yield a notable phenotype in nontransformed breast epithelial cells. In contrast, combined perturbation prevented 3D growth in an oxidative stress–dependent manner. By integrating systems models of NRF2 and p53 signaling in a single oxidative stress network, we recapitulated these observations and made predictions about oxidative stress profiles during 3D growth. NRF2 and p53 signaling were similarly coordinated in normal breast epithelial tissue and hormone-negative ductal carcinoma in situ lesions but were uncoupled in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype in which p53 is usually mutated. Using the integrated model, we correlated the extent of this uncoupling in TNBC cell lines with the importance of NRF2 in the 3D growth of these cell lines and their predicted handling of oxidative stress. Our results point to an oxidative stress tolerance network that is important for single cells during glandular development and the early stages of breast cancer.},

Here, we showed that DGKζ promotes lymphocyte function–associated antigen 1 (LFA-1)–mediated adhesion and F-actin generation at the immune synapse of B cells with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), mostly in a PA-dependent manner. Measurement of single-cell mechanical force generation indicated that DGKζ-deficient B cells exerted lower forces at the immune synapse than did wild-type B cells. Nonmuscle myosin activation and translocation of the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) to the immune synapse were also impaired in DGKζ-deficient B cells. These functional defects correlated with the decreased ability of B cells to present antigen and activate T cells in vitro. The in vivo germinal center response of DGKζ-deficient B cells was also reduced compared with that of wild-type B cells, indicating that loss of DGKζ in B cells impaired T cell help. Together, our data suggest that DGKζ shapes B cell responses by regulating actin remodeling, force generation, and antigen uptake–related events at the immune synapse. Hence, an appropriate balance in the amounts of DAG and PA is required for optimal B cell function.},

IFN-κ efficiently suppressed the replication of various influenza viruses in cultured human lung cells, and chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 6 (CHD6) was the major effector for the antiviral activity of IFN-κ, but not for that of IFN-α or IFN-β. The induction of CHD6 required both of the type I IFN receptor subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38, and the transcription factor c-Fos but was independent of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) activity.

  abstract     = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintains a stable brain microenvironment. Breakdown of BBB integrity during cerebral ischemia initiates a devastating cascade of events that eventually leads to neuronal loss. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that suppress protein expression, and we previously showed that the miR-15a/16-1 cluster is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury. Here, we demonstrated that when subjected to experimentally induced stroke, mice with an endothelial cell (EC)–selective deletion of miR-15a/16-1 had smaller brain infarcts, reduced BBB leakage, and decreased infiltration of peripheral immune cells. These mice also showed reduced infiltration of proinflammatory M1-type microglia/macrophage in the peri-infarct area without changes in the number of resolving M2-type cells. Stroke decreases claudin-5 abundance, and we found that EC-selective miR-15a/16-1 deletion enhanced claudin-5 mRNA and protein abundance in ischemic mouse brains. In cultured mouse brain microvascular ECs (mBMECs), the miR-15a/16-1 cluster directly bound to the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of Claudin-5 , and lentivirus-mediated ablation of miR-15a/16-1 diminished oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)–induced down-regulation of claudin-5 mRNA and protein abundance and endothelial barrier dysfunction. These findings suggest that genetic deletion of endothelial miR-15a/16-1 suppresses BBB pathologies after ischemic stroke. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of miR-15a/16-1–mediated BBB dysfunction may enable the discovery of new therapies for ischemic stroke.},

  abstract     = {Biased agonism at G protein–coupled receptors describes the phenomenon whereby some drugs can activate some downstream signaling activities to the relative exclusion of others. Descriptions of biased agonism focusing on the differential engagement of G proteins versus β-arrestins are commonly limited by the small response windows obtained in pathways that are not amplified or are less effectively coupled to receptor engagement, such as β-arrestin recruitment. At the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), G protein–biased ligands have been proposed to induce less constipation and respiratory depressant side effects than opioids commonly used to treat pain. However, it is unclear whether these improved safety profiles are due to a reduction in β-arrestin–mediated signaling or, alternatively, to their low intrinsic efficacy in all signaling pathways. Here, we systematically evaluated the most recent and promising MOR-biased ligands and assessed their pharmacological profile against existing opioid analgesics in assays not confounded by limited signal windows. We found that oliceridine, PZM21, and SR-17018 had low intrinsic efficacy. We also demonstrated a strong correlation between measures of efficacy for receptor activation, G protein coupling, and β-arrestin recruitment for all tested ligands. By measuring the antinociceptive and respiratory depressant effects of these ligands, we showed that the low intrinsic efficacy of opioid ligands can explain an improved side effect profile. Our results suggest a possible alternative mechanism underlying the improved therapeutic windows described for new opioid ligands, which should be taken into account for future descriptions of ligand action at this important therapeutic target.},

Here, we determined a crystal structure, which was supported by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), that revealed the sequestration of the prenyl moiety of KRAS4b in the hydrophobic pocket of the C-terminal lobe of Ca 2+ -bound CaM. Our engineered fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)–based biosensor probes (CaMeRAS) showed that, upon stimulation of Ca 2+ influx by extracellular ligands, KRAS4b reversibly translocated in a Ca 2+ -CaM–dependent manner from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm in live HeLa and HEK293 cells. These results reveal a mechanism underlying the inhibition of KRAS4b activity by Ca 2+ signaling pathways.},

  abstract     = {Clinical response to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is correlated with CAR T cell persistence, especially for CAR T cells that target CD19 + hematologic malignancies. 4-1BB–costimulated CAR (BBζ) T cells exhibit longer persistence after adoptive transfer than do CD28-costimulated CAR (28ζ) T cells. 4-1BB signaling improves T cell persistence even in the context of 28ζ CAR activation, which indicates distinct prosurvival signals mediated by the 4-1BB cytoplasmic domain. To specifically study signal transduction by CARs, we developed a cell-free, ligand-based activation and ex vivo culture system for CD19-specific CAR T cells. We observed greater ex vivo survival and subsequent expansion of BBζ CAR T cells when compared to 28ζ CAR T cells. We showed that only BBζ CARs activated noncanonical nuclear factor κB (ncNF-κB) signaling in T cells basally and that the anti-CD19 BBζ CAR further enhanced ncNF-κB signaling after ligand engagement. Reducing ncNF-κB signaling reduced the expansion and survival of anti-CD19 BBζ T cells and was associated with a substantial increase in the abundance of the most pro-apoptotic isoforms of Bim. Although our findings do not exclude the importance of other signaling differences between BBζ and 28ζ CARs, they demonstrate the necessary and nonredundant role of ncNF-κB signaling in promoting the survival of BBζ CAR T cells, which likely underlies the engraftment persistence observed with this CAR design.},

  abstract     = {Oncogenic RAS proteins, which are mutated in approximately 24\% of all human cancers, have earned a well-deserved reputation as being “undruggable.” However, several studies have challenged that reputation. With the first small molecules that directly target one oncogenic RAS mutant (G12C) undergoing clinical evaluation, there have been substantial advances in finding anti-RAS therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, new insights have come from the growing appreciation that neither all RAS proteins (HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS4A/KRAS4B) nor all oncogenic RAS mutations (such as at residues Gly 12 , Gly 13 , and Gln 61 ) have the same impact on RAS signaling and function. The role of the nonmutated, wild-type RAS proteins in the context of mutant RAS is increasingly considered to be targetable, with reports of strategies that directly disrupt either the RAS interaction with activating guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) or receptor tyrosine kinase–mediated and GEF-dependent RAS activation (such as by targeting the scaffolding phosphatase SHP2). Last, the development of agents that target downstream effectors of RAS signaling has advanced substantially. In this review, we highlight some important trends in the targeting of RAS proteins in cancer.},

  abstract     = {The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced endocytosis of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an essential step in the production of interferon-β (IFN-β), which activates the transcription of antiviral response genes by STAT1 phosphorylated at Tyr 701 . Here, we showed that STAT1 regulated proinflammatory cytokine production downstream of TLR4 endocytosis independently of IFN-β signaling and the key proinflammatory regulator NF-κB. In human macrophages, TLR4 endocytosis activated a noncanonical phosphorylation of STAT1 at Thr 749 , which subsequently promoted the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-12p40 through distinct mechanisms. STAT1 phosphorylated at Thr 749 activated the expression of the gene encoding ARID5A, which stabilizes IL6 mRNA. Moreover, STAT1 phosphorylated at Thr 749 directly enhanced transcription of the gene encoding IL-12p40 ( IL12B ). Instead of affecting STAT1 nuclear translocation, phosphorylation of Thr 749 facilitated the binding of STAT1 to a noncanonical DNA motif (5′-TTTGANNC-3′) in the promoter regions of ARID5A and IL12B . The endocytosis of TLR4 induced the formation of a complex between the kinases TBK1 and IKKβ, which mediated the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Thr 749 . Our data suggest that noncanonical phosphorylation in response to LPS confers STAT1 with distinct DNA binding and gene-regulatory properties that promote both IL12B expression and IL6 mRNA stabilization. Thus, our study provides a potential mechanism for how TLR4 endocytosis might regulate proinflammatory cytokine production.},

The membrane is also highly vulnerable to many types of perturbation, including heat, force, osmotic pressure, lipid shortage, and starvation. To determine whether the structural changes in the plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae brought about by nutrient stress can be communicated to regulatory networks within the cell, we identified proteins that interact with stress granules (SGs), subcellular structures composed of proteins, and nontranslated RNAs that form when cells are stressed. We found that SG proteins interacted with components of eisosomes, which are subcortical membrane structures with a distinct lipid and protein composition. In response to starvation-triggered phosphorylation of eisosome proteins, eisosomes clustered and recruited SG components, including active Pkc1. The absence of eisosomes impaired SG formation, resulting in delayed recovery from nutrient deprivation. Thus, eisosome clustering is an example of interdomain communication in response to stress and identifies a previously unknown mechanism of SG regulation.},

Despite the development of various γ-secretase regulators, their clinical use is limited by coincident disruption of other γ-secretase–regulated substrates, such as Notch. Using a genome-wide functional screen of γ-secretase activity in cells and a complementary DNA expression library, we found that SERP1 is a previously unknown γ-secretase activator that stimulates Aβ generation in cells experiencing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, such as is seen with diabetes. SERP1 interacted with a subcomplex of γ-secretase (APH1A/NCT) through its carboxyl terminus to enhance the assembly and, consequently, the activity of the γ-secretase holoenzyme complex. In response to ER stress, SERP1 preferentially recruited APP rather than Notch into the γ-secretase complex and enhanced the subcellular localization of the complex into lipid rafts, increasing Aβ production. Moreover, SERP1 abundance, γ-secretase assembly, and Aβ production were increased both in cells exposed to high amounts of glucose and in diabetic AD model mice. Conversely, Aβ production was decreased by knocking down SERP1 in cells or in the hippocampi of mice. Compared to postmortem samples from control individuals, those from patients with AD showed increased SERP1 expression in the hippocampus and parietal lobe. Together, our findings suggest that SERP1 is an APP-biased regulator of γ-secretase function in the context of cell stress, providing a possible molecular explanation for the link between diabetes and sporadic AD.},

The phosphorylation of PTPN22 at Ser 751 prolonged its half-life by inhibiting K48-linked ubiquitination and impairing recruitment of the phosphatase to the plasma membrane, which is necessary to inhibit proximal TCR signaling. Additionally, the phosphorylation of PTPN22 at Ser 751 enhanced the interaction of PTPN22 with the carboxyl-terminal Src kinase (CSK), an interaction that is impaired by the PTPN22 R620W variant associated with autoimmune disease. The phosphorylation of Ser 751 did not affect the recruitment of PTPN22 R620W to the plasma membrane but protected this mutant from degradation. Together, out data indicate that phosphorylation at Ser 751 mediates a reciprocal regulation of PTPN22 stability versus translocation to TCR signaling complexes by CSK-dependent and CSK-independent mechanisms.},

ASK1–3 form oligomeric complexes known as ASK signalosomes that initiate signaling cascades in response to diverse stress stimuli. Here, we demonstrated that oligomerization of ASK proteins is driven by previously uncharacterized sterile-alpha motif (SAM) domains that reside at the carboxy-terminus of each ASK protein. SAM domains from ASK1–3 exhibited distinct behaviors, with the SAM domain of ASK1 forming unstable oligomers, that of ASK2 remaining predominantly monomeric, and that of ASK3 forming a stable oligomer even at a low concentration. In contrast to their behavior in isolation, the ASK1 and ASK2 SAM domains preferentially formed a stable heterocomplex. The crystal structure of the ASK3 SAM domain, small-angle x-ray scattering, and mutagenesis suggested that ASK3 oligomers and ASK1-ASK2 complexes formed discrete, quasi-helical rings through interactions between the mid-loop of one molecule and the end helix of another molecule. Preferential ASK1-ASK2 binding was consistent with mass spectrometry showing that full-length ASK1 formed hetero-oligomeric complexes incorporating large amounts of ASK2. Accordingly, disrupting the association between SAM domains impaired ASK activity in the context of electrophilic stress induced by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). These findings provide a structural template for how ASK proteins assemble foci that drive inflammatory signaling and reinforce the notion that strategies to target ASK proteins should consider the concerted actions of multiple ASK family members.},

  abstract     = {Mortalin [also known as heat shock protein family A (HSP70) member 9 (HSPA9) or glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75)] is a mitochondrial molecular chaperone that is often up-regulated and mislocalized in tumors with abnormal activation of the kinases MEK and ERK. Here, we found that mortalin depletion was selectively lethal to tumor and immortalized normal cells expressing the mutant kinase B-Raf V600E or the chimeric protein ΔRaf-1:ER and that MEK-ERK–sensitive regulation of the peptide-binding domain in mortalin was critical to cell survival or death. Proteomics screening identified adenine nucleotide translocase 3 (ANT3) as a previously unknown mortalin substrate and cell survival/death effector. Mechanistically, increased MEK-ERK signaling activity and mortalin function converged opposingly on the regulation of mitochondrial permeability. Specifically, whereas MEK-ERK activity increased mitochondrial permeability by promoting the interaction between ANT3 and the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin D (CypD), mortalin decreased mitochondrial permeability by inhibiting this interaction. Hence, mortalin depletion increased mitochondrial permeability in MEK-ERK–deregulated cells to an extent that triggered cell death. HSP70 inhibitor derivatives that effectively inhibited mortalin suppressed the proliferation of B-Raf V600E tumor cells in culture and in vivo, including their B-Raf inhibitor–resistant progenies. These findings suggest that targeting mortalin has potential as a selective therapeutic strategy in B-Raf–mutant or MEK-ERK–driven tumors.},

Mesothelium-produced FGF9 is principally responsible for mesenchymal growth, whereas epithelium-produced FGF9 and mesenchyme-produced FGF10 guide lung epithelial development, and loss of either of these ligands affects epithelial branching. Because FGF9 and FGF10 activate distinct FGF receptors (FGFRs), we hypothesized that they would control distinct developmental processes. Here, we found that FGF9 signaled through epithelial FGFR3 to directly promote distal epithelial fate specification and inhibit epithelial differentiation. By contrast, FGF10 signaled through epithelial FGFR2b to promote epithelial proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, FGF9-FGFR3 signaling functionally opposed FGF10-FGFR2b signaling, and FGFR3 preferentially used downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, whereas FGFR2b relied on downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. These data demonstrate that, within lung epithelial cells, different FGFRs function independently; they bind receptor-specific ligands and direct distinct developmental functions through the activation of distinct downstream signaling pathways.},

  abstract     = {Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is often characterized by mutually exclusive mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or the guanosine triphosphatase KRAS. We hypothesized that blocking EGFR palmitoylation, previously shown to inhibit EGFR activity, might alter downstream signaling in the KRAS-mutant setting. Here, we found that blocking EGFR palmitoylation, by either knocking down the palmitoyltransferase DHHC20 or expressing a palmitoylation-resistant EGFR mutant, reduced activation of the kinase PI3K, the abundance of the transcription factor MYC, and the proliferation of cells in culture, as well as reduced tumor growth in a mouse model of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Knocking down DHHC20 reduced the growth of existing tumors derived from human KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells and increased the sensitivity of these cells to a PI3K inhibitor. Palmitoylated EGFR interacted with the PI3K regulatory subunit PIK3R1 (p85) and increased the recruitment of the PI3K heterodimer to the plasma membrane. Alternatively, blocking palmitoylation increased the association of EGFR with the MAPK adaptor Grb2 and decreased that with p85. This binary switching between MAPK and PI3K signaling, modulated by EGFR palmitoylation, was only observed in the presence of oncogenic KRAS. These findings suggest a mechanism whereby oncogenic KRAS saturates signaling through unpalmitoylated EGFR, reducing formation of the PI3K signaling complex. Future development of DHHC20 inhibitors to reduce EGFR-PI3K signaling could be beneficial to patients with KRAS-mutant tumors.},

Both integrins, which mediate interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as fibronectin, and cadherins, which mediate interactions between cells, are implicated in the determination of spindle orientation. We found that both cadherin- and integrin-based adhesion resulted in cell divisions parallel to the attachment plane and elicited identical spindle responses to spatial adhesive cues. This suggests that adhesion topology provides purely mechanical spatial cues that are independent of the molecular nature of the interaction or signaling from adhesion complexes. We also demonstrated that cortical integrin activation was indispensable for correct spindle orientation on both cadherin and fibronectin substrates. These data suggest that spindle orientation responses to adhesion topology are primarily a result of force anisotropy on the cell cortex and show that integrins play a central role in this process that is distinct from their role in cell-ECM interactions.},

  abstract     = {The complex signaling dynamics of transcription factors can encode both qualitative and quantitative information about the extracellular environment, which increases the information transfer capacity and potentially supports accurate cellular decision-making. An important question is how these signaling dynamics patterns are translated into functionally appropriate gene regulation programs. To address this question for transcription factors of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) family, we profiled the single-cell dynamics of two major NF-κB subunits, RelA and c-Rel, induced by a panel of pathogen-derived stimuli in immune and nonimmune cellular contexts. Diverse NF-κB–activating ligands produced different patterns of RelA and c-Rel signaling dynamic features, such as variations in duration or time-integrated activity. Analysis of nascent transcripts delineated putative direct targets of NF-κB as compared to genes controlled by other transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms and showed that the transcription of more than half of the induced genes was tightly linked to specific dynamic features of NF-κB signaling. Fibroblast and macrophage cell lines shared a cluster of such “NF-κB dynamics–decoding” genes, as well as cell type–specific decoding genes. Dissecting the subunit specificity of dynamics-decoding genes suggested that target genes were most often linked to both RelA and c-Rel or to RelA alone. Thus, our analysis reveals the cell type–specific interpretation of pathogenic information through the signaling dynamics of NF-κB.},

Primary enamel cells and an enamel cell line (LS8) exposed to fluoride showed decreased internal Ca 2+ stores and store-operated Ca 2+ entry (SOCE). RNA-sequencing analysis revealed changes in gene expression suggestive of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in fluoride-treated LS8 cells. Fluoride exposure did not alter Ca 2+ homeostasis or increase the expression of ER stress–associated genes in HEK-293 cells. In enamel cells, fluoride exposure affected the functioning of the ER-localized Ca 2+ channel IP 3 R and the activity of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA) pump during Ca 2+ refilling of the ER. Fluoride negatively affected mitochondrial respiration, elicited mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and disrupted mitochondrial morphology. Together, these data provide a potential mechanism underlying dental fluorosis.},

  abstract     = {New therapeutic approaches for chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis are needed because current treatments are often suboptimal in terms of both efficacy and the risks of serious adverse events. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are E3 ubiquitin ligases that inhibit cell death pathways and are themselves inhibited by second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC). SMAC mimetics (SMs), small-molecule antagonists of IAPs, are being evaluated as cancer therapies in clinical trials. IAPs are also crucial regulators of inflammatory pathways because they influence both the activation of inflammatory genes and the induction of cell death through the receptor-interacting serine-threonine protein kinases (RIPKs), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)–inducing kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Furthermore, there is an increasing interest in specifically targeting the substrates of IAP-mediated ubiquitylation, especially RIPK1, RIPK2, and RIPK3, as druggable nodes in inflammation control. Several studies have revealed an anti-inflammatory potential of RIPK inhibitors that either block inflammatory signaling or block the form of inflammatory cell death known as necroptosis. Expanding research on innate immune signaling through pattern recognition receptors that stimulate proinflammatory NF-κB and MAPK signaling may further contribute to uncovering the complex molecular roles used by IAPs and downstream RIPKs in inflammatory signaling. This may benefit and guide the development of SMs or selective RIPK inhibitors as anti-inflammatory therapeutics for various chronic inflammatory conditions.},

Using multiplexed inhibitor beads and mass spectrometry, we mapped the kinome landscape of HGSOC tumors from patients and patient-derived xenograft models. The data revealed a prevalent signature consisting of established HGSOC driver kinases, as well as several kinases previously unexplored in HGSOC. Loss-of-function analysis of these kinases in HGSOC cells indicated MRCKA (also known as CDC42BPA) as a putative therapeutic target. Characterization of the effects of MRCKA knockdown in established HGSOC cell lines demonstrated that MRCKA was integral to signaling that regulated the cell cycle checkpoint, focal adhesion, and actin remodeling, as well as cell migration, proliferation, and survival. Moreover, inhibition of MRCKA using the small-molecule BDP9066 decreased cell proliferation and spheroid formation and induced apoptosis in HGSOC cells, suggesting that MRCKA may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of HGSOC.},

By combining ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and Western blotting analyses, we found that human and mouse amnion membranes during labor were subject to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mediated, in part, by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway responding to oxidative stress. Primary human amnion epithelial cell cultures established from amnion membranes from nonlaboring, cesarean section deliveries exhibited EMT after exposure to oxidative stress, and the pregnancy maintenance hormone progesterone (P4) reversed this process. Oxidative stress or transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) stimulated EMT in a manner that depended on TGF-β–activated kinase 1 binding protein 1 (TAB1) and p38 MAPK. P4 stimulated the reverse transition, MET, in primary human amnion mesenchymal cells (AMCs) through progesterone receptor membrane component 2 (PGRMC2) and c-MYC. Our results indicate that amnion membrane cells dynamically transition between epithelial and mesenchymal states to maintain amnion integrity and repair membrane damage, as well as in response to inflammation and mechanical damage to protect the fetus until parturition. An irreversible EMT and the accumulation of AMCs characterize the amnion membranes at parturition.},

We previously demonstrated that 5-HT 6 R finely controls key neurodevelopmental steps, including neuronal migration and the initiation of neurite growth, through its interaction with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Here, we showed that 5-HT 6 R recruited G protein–regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (GPRIN1) through a G s -dependent mechanism. Interactions between the receptor and either Cdk5 or GPRIN1 occurred sequentially during neuronal differentiation. The 5-HT 6 R–GPRIN1 interaction enhanced agonist-independent, receptor-stimulated cAMP production without altering the agonist-dependent response in NG108-15 neuroblastoma cells. This interaction also promoted neurite extension and branching in NG108-15 cells and primary mouse striatal neurons through a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)–dependent mechanism. This study highlights the complex allosteric modulation of GPCRs by protein partners and demonstrates how dynamic interactions between GPCRs and their protein partners can control the different steps of highly coordinated cellular processes, such as dendritic tree morphogenesis.},

Accordingly, LTCC antagonists have been proposed to be neuroprotective, although this view is disputed, because intentional LTCC activation can also have beneficial effects. LTCC-mediated Ca 2+ influx influences mitochondrial function, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell viability. Hence, we investigated the effect of modulating LTCC-mediated Ca 2+ influx on mitochondrial function in cultured hippocampal neurons. To activate LTCCs, neuronal activity was stimulated by increasing extracellular K + or by application of the GABA A receptor antagonist bicuculline. The activity of LTCCs was altered by application of an agonistic (Bay K8644) or an antagonistic (isradipine) dihydropyridine. Our results demonstrated that activation of LTCC-mediated Ca 2+ influx affected mitochondrial function in a bimodal manner. At moderate stimulation strength, ATP synthase activity was enhanced, an effect that involved Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release from intracellular stores. In contrast, high LTCC-mediated Ca 2+ loads led to a switch in ATP synthase activity to reverse-mode operation. This effect, which required nitric oxide, helped to prevent mitochondrial depolarization and sustained increases in mitochondrial Ca 2+ . Our findings indicate a complex role of LTCC-mediated Ca 2+ influx in the tuning and maintenance of mitochondrial function. Therefore, the use of LTCC inhibitors to protect neurons from neurodegeneration should be reconsidered carefully.},

  abstract     = {The advent of deep-sequencing techniques has revealed that mutations in G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways in cancer are more prominent than was previously appreciated. An emergent theme is that cancer-associated mutations tend to cause enhanced GPCR pathway activation to favor oncogenicity. Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are critical modulators of GPCR signaling that dampen the activity of heterotrimeric G proteins through their GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) activity, which is conferred by a conserved domain dubbed the “RGS-box.” Here, we developed an experimental pipeline to systematically assess the mutational landscape of RGS GAPs in cancer. A pan-cancer bioinformatics analysis of the 20 RGS domains with GAP activity revealed hundreds of low-frequency mutations spread throughout the conserved RGS domain structure with a slight enrichment at positions that interface with G proteins. We empirically tested multiple mutations representing all RGS GAP subfamilies and sampling both G protein interface and noninterface positions with a scalable, yeast-based assay. Last, a subset of mutants was validated using G protein activity biosensors in mammalian cells. Our findings reveal that a sizable fraction of RGS protein mutations leads to a loss of function through various mechanisms, including disruption of the G protein–binding interface, loss of protein stability, or allosteric effects on G protein coupling. Moreover, our results also validate a scalable pipeline for the rapid characterization of cancer-associated mutations in RGS proteins.},

  abstract     = {Signaling bias is the propensity for some agonists to preferentially stimulate G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling through one intracellular pathway versus another. We previously identified a G protein–biased agonist of the D 2 dopamine receptor (D2R) that results in impaired β-arrestin recruitment. This signaling bias was predicted to arise from unique interactions of the ligand with a hydrophobic pocket at the interface of the second extracellular loop and fifth transmembrane segment of the D2R. Here, we showed that residue Phe189 within this pocket (position 5.38 using Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering) functions as a microswitch for regulating receptor interactions with β-arrestin. This residue is relatively conserved among class A GPCRs, and analogous mutations within other GPCRs similarly impaired β-arrestin recruitment while maintaining G protein signaling. To investigate the mechanism of this signaling bias, we used an active-state structure of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β2R) to build β2R-WT and β2R-Y199 5.38 A models in complex with the full β2R agonist BI-167107 for molecular dynamics simulations. These analyses identified conformational rearrangements in β2R-Y199 5.38 A that propagated from the extracellular ligand binding site to the intracellular surface, resulting in a modified orientation of the second intracellular loop in β2R-Y199 5.38 A, which is predicted to affect its interactions with β-arrestin. Our findings provide a structural basis for how ligand binding site alterations can allosterically affect GPCR-transducer interactions and result in biased signaling.},

  abstract     = {The Parkin-coregulated gene ( PACRG ), which encodes a protein of unknown function, shares a bidirectional promoter with Parkin ( PRKN ), which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Because PRKN is important in mitochondrial quality control and protection against stress, we tested whether PACRG also affected these pathways in various cultured human cell lines and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. PACRG did not play a role in mitophagy but did play a role in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling. Similarly to Parkin, PACRG promoted nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation in response to TNF. TNF-induced nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65 and NF-κB–dependent transcription were decreased in PACRG-deficient cells. Defective canonical NF-κB activation in the absence of PACRG was accompanied by a decrease in linear ubiquitylation mediated by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which is composed of the two E3 ubiquitin ligases HOIP and HOIL-1L and the adaptor protein SHARPIN. Upon TNF stimulation, PACRG was recruited to the activated TNF receptor complex and interacted with LUBAC components. PACRG functionally replaced SHARPIN in this context. In SHARPIN-deficient cells, PACRG prevented LUBAC destabilization, restored HOIP-dependent linear ubiquitylation, and protected cells from TNF-induced apoptosis. This function of PACRG in positively regulating TNF signaling may help to explain the association of PACRG and PRKN polymorphisms with an increased susceptibility to intracellular pathogens.},

We tested by Western blotting six antibodies that recognize the c-Myc epitope tag, including monoclonal antibodies 9E10, 4A6, 9B11, and 71D10 and polyclonal antibodies 9106 and A-14. All displayed context-dependent differences in their ability to detect N- or C-terminal Myc-tagged proteins. In particular, clone 9E10, the most cited Myc-tag antibody, displayed high context-dependent detection variability, whereas others, notably 4A6 and 9B11, showed much less context sensitivity in their detection of Myc-tagged proteins. The very high context sensitivity of 9E10 was further substantiated by peptide microarray analyses. We conclude that recently developed, purpose-made monoclonal antibodies specific for Myc have much more uniform reactivity in diverse assays and are much less context sensitive than is the legacy antibody 9E10.},

Here, we tested several PP2A C antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies 1D6, 7A6, G-4, and 52F8 and the polyclonal antibody 2038 for their ability to specifically detect PP2A in its various modified forms, as well as to coprecipitate regulatory subunits. The tested antibodies preferentially recognized the nonmethylated form of the enzyme, and they did not coimmunoprecipitate trimeric holoenzymes containing the regulatory subunits B or B′, an issue that precludes their use to monitor PP2A holoenzyme activity.

The mechanism by which changes in O 2 tension modulate ion channels has remained elusive. Glomus cells express genes encoding HIF2α ( Epas1 ) and atypical mitochondrial subunits at high levels, and mitochondrial NADH and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation during hypoxia provides the signal that regulates ion channels. We report that inactivation of Epas1 in adult mice resulted in selective abolition of glomus cell responsiveness to acute hypoxia and the hypoxic ventilatory response. Epas1 deficiency led to the decreased expression of atypical mitochondrial subunits in the carotid body, and genetic deletion of Cox4i2 mimicked the defective hypoxic responses of Epas1 -null mice.

These ROS then oxidize cysteine residues in proteins to potentiate downstream signaling. Spatial confinement of ROS is an important regulatory mechanism of redox signaling that enables the stimulation of different RTKs to oxidize distinct sets of downstream proteins. To uncover additional mechanisms that specify cysteines that are redox regulated by EGF stimulation, we performed time-resolved quantification of the EGF-dependent oxidation of 4200 cysteine sites in A431 cells. Fifty-one percent of cysteines were statistically significantly oxidized by EGF stimulation. Furthermore, EGF induced three distinct spatiotemporal patterns of cysteine oxidation in functionally organized protein networks, consistent with the spatial confinement model. Unexpectedly, protein crystal structure analysis and molecular dynamics simulations indicated widespread redox regulation of cryptic cysteine residues that are solvent exposed only upon changes in protein conformation. Phosphorylation and increased flux of nucleotide substrates served as two distinct modes by which EGF specified the cryptic cysteine residues that became solvent exposed and redox regulated. Because proteins that are structurally regulated by different RTKs or cellular perturbations are largely unique, these findings suggest that solvent exposure and redox regulation of cryptic cysteine residues contextually delineate redox signaling networks.},

  abstract     = {Cells sense extracellular nucleotides through the P2Y class of purinergic G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), which stimulate integrin activation through signaling events, including intracellular Ca 2+ mobilization. We investigated the relationship between P2Y-stimulated repetitive Ca 2+ waves and fibrinogen binding to the platelet integrin α IIb β 3 (GPIIb/IIIa) through confocal fluorescence imaging of primary rat megakaryocytes. Costimulation of the receptors P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 generated a series of Ca 2+ transients that each induced a rapid, discrete increase in fibrinogen binding. The peak and net increase of individual fibrinogen binding events correlated with the Ca 2+ transient amplitude and frequency, respectively. Using BAPTA loading and selective receptor antagonists, we found that Ca 2+ mobilization downstream of P2Y 1 was essential for ADP-evoked fibrinogen binding, whereas P2Y 12 and the kinase PI3K were also required for α IIb β 3 activation and enhanced the number of Ca 2+ transients. ADP-evoked fibrinogen binding was initially uniform over the cell periphery but subsequently redistributed with a polarity that correlated with the direction of the Ca 2+ waves. Polarization of α IIb β 3 may be mediated by the actin cytoskeleton, because surface-bound fibrinogen is highly immobile, and its motility was enhanced by cytoskeletal disruption. In conclusion, spatial and temporal patterns of Ca 2+ increase enable fine control of α IIb β 3 activation after cellular stimulation. P2Y 1 -stimulated Ca 2+ transients coupled to α IIb β 3 activation only in the context of P2Y 12 coactivation, thereby providing an additional temporal mechanism of synergy between these Gq- and Gi-coupled GPCRs.},

  abstract     = {Ligand-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) activation controls nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling, cell proliferation, programmed cell death, and survival and is crucially involved in inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and cancer progression. Despite the relevance of TNFR1 clustering for signaling, oligomerization of ligand-free and ligand-activated TNFR1 remains controversial. At present, models range from ligand-independent receptor predimerization to ligand-induced oligomerization. Here, we used quantitative, single-molecule superresolution microscopy to study TNFR1 assembly directly in native cellular settings and at physiological cell surface abundance. In the absence of its ligand TNFα, TNFR1 assembled into monomeric and dimeric receptor units. Upon binding of TNFα, TNFR1 clustered predominantly not only into trimers but also into higher-order oligomers. A functional mutation in the preligand assembly domain of TNFR1 resulted in only monomeric TNFR1, which exhibited impaired ligand binding. In contrast, a form of TNFR1 with a mutation in the ligand-binding CRD2 subdomain retained the monomer-to-dimer ratio of the unliganded wild-type TNFR1 but exhibited no ligand binding. These results underscore the importance of ligand-independent TNFR1 dimerization in NF-κB signaling.},

  abstract     = {Multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) toxins are pore-forming bacterial toxins that translocate multiple functionally independent effector domains into a target eukaryotic cell. Vibrio cholerae colonizes intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and uses a MARTX toxin with three effector domains—an actin cross-linking domain (ACD), a Rho inactivation domain (RID), and an α/β hydrolase domain (ABH)—to suppress innate immunity and enhance colonization. We investigated whether these multiple catalytic enzymes delivered from a single toxin functioned in a coordinated manner to suppress intestinal innate immunity. Using cultured human IECs, we demonstrated that ACD-induced cytoskeletal collapse activated extracellular signal–regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to elicit a robust proinflammatory response characterized by the secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8; also called CXCL8) and the expression of CXCL8 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ), and other proinflammatory genes. However, RID and ABH, which are naturally delivered together with ACD, blocked MAPK activation through Rac1 and thus prevented ACD-induced inflammation. RID also abolished IL-8 secretion induced by heat-killed bacteria, TNF, or latrunculin A. Thus, MARTX toxins use enzymatic multifunctionality to silence the host response to bacterial factors and to the damage caused by the toxins. Furthermore, these data show how V. cholerae MARTX toxin suppresses intestinal inflammation and contributes to cholera being classically defined as a noninflammatory diarrheal disease.},

  abstract     = {Specificity in signal transduction is determined by the ability of cells to “encode” and subsequently “decode” different environmental signals. Akin to computer software, this “signaling code” governs context-dependent execution of cellular programs through modulation of signaling dynamics and can be corrupted by disease-causing mutations. Class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is critical for normal growth and development and is dysregulated in human disorders such as benign overgrowth syndromes, cancer, primary immune deficiency, and metabolic syndrome. Despite decades of PI3K research, understanding of context-dependent regulation of the PI3K pathway and of the underlying signaling code remains rudimentary. Here, we review current knowledge on context-specific PI3K signaling and how technological advances now make it possible to move from a qualitative to quantitative understanding of this pathway. Insight into how cellular PI3K signaling is encoded or decoded may open new avenues for rational pharmacological targeting of PI3K-associated diseases. The principles of PI3K context-dependent signal encoding and decoding described here are likely applicable to most, if not all, major cell signaling pathways.},

  abstract     = {Ghrelin is a hormone secreted by the stomach during fasting periods and acts through its receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue 1a (GHSR1a), to promote food intake and prevent hypoglycemia. As such, GHSR1a is an important regulator of energy and glucose homeostasis and a target for the treatment of obesity. Here, we showed that the accessory protein MRAP2 altered GHSR1a signaling by inhibiting its constitutive activity, as well as by enhancing its G protein–dependent signaling and blocking the recruitment and signaling of β-arrestin in response to ghrelin. In addition, the effects of MRAP2 on the Gα q and β-arrestin pathways were independent and involved distinct regions of MRAP2. These findings may have implications for the regulation of ghrelin function in vivo and the role of MRAP2 in energy homeostasis. They also show that accessory proteins can bias signaling downstream of GPCRs in response to their endogenous agonist.},

  abstract     = {Mutations in WASHC5 (also known as KIAA0196 ) cause autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) type SPG8. WASHC5, commonly called strumpellin, is a core component of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homolog (WASH) complex that activates actin nucleation at endosomes. Although various other cellular roles for strumpellin have also been described, none account for how SPG8-associated mutations lead to HSP. Here, we identified protein interactors of the WASH complex by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry and assessed the functions of strumpellin in cultured cells using both overexpression and RNA interference along with cell-spreading assays to investigate cell adhesion. We uncovered a decrease in CAV1 protein abundance as well as endosomal fission defects resulting from pathogenic SPG8 mutations. CAV1, a key component of caveolae, interacted with strumpellin in cells, and strumpellin inhibited the lysosomal degradation of CAV1. SPG8-associated missense mutations in strumpellin did not rescue endosomal tubulation defects, reduction in CAV1 protein abundance, or integrin-mediated cell adhesion in strumpellin-deficient cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the WASH complex maintained CAV1 and integrin protein amounts by inhibiting their lysosomal degradation through its endosomal actin nucleation activity. In addition, the interaction of strumpellin with CAV1 stimulated integrin recycling, thereby promoting cell adhesion. These findings provide a molecular link between WASHC5 mutations and impairment of CAV1- and integrin-mediated cell adhesion, providing insights into the cellular pathogenesis of SPG8.},
