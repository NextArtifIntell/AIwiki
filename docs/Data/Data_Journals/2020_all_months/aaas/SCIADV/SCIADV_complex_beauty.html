  abstract     = {The skin covering the human palm and other specialized tactile organs contains a high density of mechanosensory corpuscles tuned to detect transient pressure and vibration. These corpuscles comprise a sensory afferent neuron surrounded by lamellar cells. The neuronal afferent is thought to be the mechanical sensor, whereas the function of lamellar cells is unknown. We show that lamellar cells within Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles detect tactile stimuli. We develop a preparation of bill skin from tactile-specialist ducks that permits electrophysiological recordings from lamellar cells and demonstrate that they contain mechanically gated ion channels. We show that lamellar cells from Meissner corpuscles generate mechanically evoked action potentials using R-type voltage-gated calcium channels. These findings provide the first evidence for R-type channel-dependent action potentials in non-neuronal cells and demonstrate that lamellar cells actively detect touch. We propose that Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles use neuronal and non-neuronal mechanoreception to detect mechanical signals.},

  abstract     = {Small membrane proteins are difficult targets for structural characterization. Here, we stabilize their folding by restraining their amino and carboxyl termini with associable protein entities, exemplified by the two halves of a superfolder GFP. The termini-restrained proteins are functional and show improved stability during overexpression and purification. The reassembled GFP provides a versatile scaffold for membrane protein crystallization, enables diffraction to atomic resolution, and facilitates crystal identification, phase determination, and density modification. This strategy gives rise to 14 new structures of five vertebrate proteins from distinct functional families, bringing a substantial expansion to the structural database of small membrane proteins. Moreover, a high-resolution structure of bacterial DsbB reveals that this thiol oxidoreductase is activated through a catalytic triad, similar to cysteine proteases. Overall, termini restraining proves exceptionally effective for stabilization and structure determination of small membrane proteins.},

  abstract     = {Almost a century ago, Stiles and Crawford reported that the human eye is more sensitive to light entering through the pupil center than through its periphery (Stiles-Crawford effect). This psychophysical phenomenon, later found to correlate with photoreceptor orientation toward the pupil, was dynamically phototropic, adjustable within days to an eccentrically displaced pupil. For decades, this phototropism has been speculated to involve coordinated movements of the rectilinear photoreceptor outer and inner segments. We report here that, unexpectedly, the murine photoreceptor outer segment has a seemingly light-independent orientation, but the inner segment’s orientation undergoes light-dependent movement, giving rise to nonrectilinear outer and inner segments in adult mice born and reared in darkness. Light during an early critical period (~P0 to P8), however, largely sets the correct photoreceptor orientation permanently afterward. Unexpectedly, abolishing rod and cone phototransductions did not mimic darkness in early life, suggesting photosignaling extrinsic to rods and cones is involved.},

Here, we study the kagome-net magnet YMn 6 Sn 6 by magnetometry, transport, and neutron diffraction measurements combined with first-principles calculations. We identify a number of nontrivial magnetic phases, explain their microscopic nature, and demonstrate that one of them hosts a large topological Hall effect (THE). We propose a previously unidentified fluctuation-driven mechanism, which leads to the THE at elevated temperatures. This interesting physics comes from parametrically frustrated interplanar exchange interactions that trigger strong magnetic fluctuations.

Since its discovery over two decades ago, γTuRC has evaded in vitro reconstitution and thus detailed structure-function studies. Here, we show that a complex of RuvB-like protein 1 (RUVBL1) and RUVBL2 “RUVBL” controls assembly and composition of γTuRC in human cells. Likewise, RUVBL assembles γTuRC from a minimal set of core subunits in a heterologous coexpression system. RUVBL interacts with γTuRC subcomplexes but is not part of fully assembled γTuRC. Purified, reconstituted γTuRC has nucleation activity and resembles native γTuRC as revealed by its cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure at ~4.0-Å resolution. We further use cryo-EM to identify features that determine the intricate, higher-order γTuRC architecture. Our work finds RUVBL as an assembly factor that regulates γTuRC in cells and allows production of recombinant γTuRC for future in-depth mechanistic studies.},

Here, we report on alkoxybutenolides as a bio-based alternative for acrylates and the formation of high-performance coatings. Starting from biomass-derived furfural and an environmentally benign photochemical conversion using visible light and oxygen in a flow reactor provides the alkoxybutenolide monomers. This is followed by radical (co)polymerization, which results in coatings with tunable properties for applications on distinct surfaces like glass or plastic.

Conventional energy delivery transfers energy from heating sources via various media, hence losing efficiency and inducing side reactions. In contrast, microwave (MW) heating is known to be highly energy efficient through dipole interaction with polar media, but how exactly it transmits energy to initiate chemical reactions has been unknown. Here, we report a rigorous determination of energy delivery mechanisms underlying MW-enabled rapid hydrothermal synthesis, by monitoring the structure and temperature of all the involved components as solid-liquid intercalation reaction occurs using in situ synchrotron techniques. We reveal a hitherto unknown direct energy transmission between MW irradiation source and the targeted reactants, leading to greatly reduced energy waste, and so the ultrafast kinetics at low temperature. These findings open up new horizons for designing material synthesis reactions of high efficiency and precision.},

Using complementary experimental models, we discovered RIPK3-dependent IL1B induction in β cells as an instigator of islet inflammation. In cultured β cells, ER stress activated RIPK3, leading to NF-kB–mediated proinflammatory gene expression. In a zebrafish muscle insulin resistance model, overnutrition caused islet inflammation, β cell dysfunction, and loss in an ER stress–, ripk3 -, and il1b -dependent manner. In mouse islets, high-fat diet triggered the IL1B expression in β cells before macrophage recruitment in vivo, and RIPK3 inhibition suppressed palmitate-induced β cell dysfunction and Il1b expression in vitro. Furthermore, in human islets grafted in hyperglycemic mice, a marked increase in ER stress, RIPK3, and NF-kB activation in β cells were accompanied with murine macrophage infiltration. Thus, RIPK3-mediated induction of proinflammatory mediators is a conserved, previously unrecognized β cell response to metabolic stress and a mediator of the ensuing islet inflammation.},

Cellular studies revealed that a decrease in the formaldehyde tolerance underlies a loss of differentiation and proliferation capacity of hematopoietic stem cells. Moreover, Adh5 −/− Aldh2 E506K/E506K double-deficient mice recapitulated key clinical features of AMeDS, showing short life span, dwarfism, and hematopoietic failure.

Removal of external Ca 2+ in wild-type Kv7.1 channels produced a large, voltage-dependent inactivation, which differed from N- or C-type mechanisms. Glu 295 and Asp 317 located, respectively, in the turret and pore entrance are involved in Ca 2+ coordination, allowing Asp 317 to form H-bonding with the pore helix Trp 304 , which stabilizes the selectivity filter and prevents inactivation. Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and Ca 2+ -calmodulin prevented Kv7.1 inactivation triggered by Ca 2+ -free external solutions, where Ser 182 at the S2-S3 linker relays the calmodulin signal from its inner boundary to the external pore to allow proper channel conduction. Thus, we revealed a unique mechanism of inactivation gating in Kv7.1, exquisitely controlled by external Ca 2+ and allosterically coupled by internal PIP2 and Ca 2+ -calmodulin.},

Inducible DCAF1 loss eliminates proliferating, but not quiescent, T cells and MEFs. We identify the ribosome assembly factor PWP1 as a substrate of the CRL4 DCAF1 ligase. DCAF1 loss results in PWP1 accumulation, impairing rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. Knockdown or overexpression of PWP1 can rescue defects or cause similar defects as DCAF1 loss, respectively, in ribosome biogenesis. DCAF1 loss increases free RPL11, resulting in L11-MDM2 association and p53 activation.

  abstract     = {Tropical cyclones (TCs) are extreme storms that form over warm tropical oceans. Along their tracks, TCs mix up cold water, which can further affect their intensity. Because of the adoption of lower-resolution ocean models, previous modeling studies on the TC response to greenhouse warming underestimated such oceanic feedbacks. To address the robustness of TC projections in the presence of mesoscale air-sea interactions and complex coastal topography, we conduct greenhouse warming experiments using an ultrahigh-resolution Earth System Model. We find that a projected weakening of the rising branches of the summer Hadley cells suppresses future TC genesis and TC-generated ocean cooling. The forced response is similar to recent observational trends, indicating a possible emergence of the anthropogenic signal beyond natural variability levels. In the greenhouse warming simulations, landfalling TCs intensify, both in terms of wind speed and associated rainfall. Our modeling results provide relevant information for climate change adaptation efforts.},

In particular, these polar molecules offer scientists unprecedented opportunities to explore chemical reactions in the ultracold regime where quantum effects become profound. However, a key question about how two-body losses depend on quantum correlations in interacting many-body systems remains open so far. Here, we present a number of universal relations that directly connect two-body losses to other physical observables, including the momentum distribution and density correlation functions. These relations, which are valid for arbitrary microscopic parameters, such as the particle number, the temperature, and the interaction strength, unfold the critical role of contacts, a fundamental quantity of dilute quantum systems, in determining the reaction rate of quantum reactive molecules in a many-body environment. Our work opens the door to an unexplored area intertwining quantum chemistry; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; and condensed matter physics.},

Our results highlight a long-term decline in the net carbon sink (0.13 Mg C ha −1 year −1 ) caused by decreasing carbon gains (2.6\% by year) and increasing carbon losses (3.4\% by year). The driest and warmest sites are experiencing the most severe carbon sink decline and have already moved from carbon sinks to carbon sources.

Here, we present an all-optical method for excitation and frequency-, momentum-, and space-resolved detection of gigahertz acoustic waves in a spatially confined model semiconductor. Lamb waves are excited in a bare silicon membrane using femtosecond optical pulses and detected with frequency-domain micro-Brillouin light spectroscopy. The population of photoexcited gigahertz phonons displays a hundredfold enhancement as compared with thermal equilibrium. The phonon spectra reveal Stokes–anti-Stokes asymmetry due to propagation, and strongly asymmetric Fano resonances due to coupling between the electron-hole plasma and the photoexcited phonons.

BY-kinases are regulated by oligomerization-enabled transphosphorylation on a C-terminal tyrosine cluster through a process with sparse mechanistic detail. Using the catalytic domain (CD) of the archetypal BY-kinase, Escherichia coli Wzc, and enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations, isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, we propose a mechanism for its activation and nucleotide exchange. We find that the monomeric Wzc CD preferentially populates states characterized by distortions at its oligomerization interfaces and by catalytic element conformations that allow high-affinity interactions with ADP but not with ATP·Mg 2+ . We propose that oligomer formation stabilizes the intermonomer interfaces and results in catalytic element conformations suitable for optimally engaging ATP·Mg 2+ , facilitating exchange with bound ADP. This sequence of events, oligomerization, i.e., substrate binding, before engaging ATP·Mg 2+ , facilitates optimal autophosphorylation by preventing a futile cycle of ATP hydrolysis.},

Yet, in contrast, few examples have demonstrated the significance of gene reuse in colonization of multiple disparate habitats. By analyzing 343 genomes of the widespread Asian honeybee, Apis cerana , we showed that multiple peripheral subspecies radiated from a central ancestral population and adapted independently to diverse habitats. We found strong evidence of gene reuse in the Leucokinin receptor (Lkr), which was repeatedly selected in almost all peripheral subspecies. Differential expression and RNA interference knockdown revealed the role of Lkr in influencing foraging labor division, suggesting that Lkr facilitates collective tendency for pollen/nectar collection as an adaptation to floral changes. Our results suggest that honeybees may accommodate diverse floral shifts during rapid radiation through fine-tuning individual foraging tendency, a seemingly complex process accomplished by gene reuse.},

Here, we show that 4\% of developers contribute to the code of more than one cryptocurrency and that the market reflects these cross-asset dependencies. In particular, we reveal that the first coding event linking two cryptocurrencies through a common developer leads to the synchronization of their returns. Our results identify a clear link between the collaborative development of cryptocurrencies and their market behavior.

BTA molecules chemically coordinate to the Cu electrode and form an insoluble and polymeric film of [BTA-Cu], suppressing the electrochemical corrosion and reaction between perovskite and the Cu electrode. PSCs with BTA/Cu show excellent air stability, retaining 92.8 ± 1.9\% of initial efficiency after aging for 2500 hours.

Here, we introduce a representation of iceberg fracturing using a breakup scheme based on the “footloose mechanism.” We optimize the parameters of this breakup scheme by forcing the iceberg model with an ocean state estimate and comparing the modeled iceberg trajectories and areas with the Antarctic Iceberg Tracking Database. We show that including large icebergs and a representation of their breakup substantially affects the iceberg meltwater distribution, with implications for the circulation and stratification of the Southern Ocean.},

Here, we present the results of a clinical trial using a previously untried paintable transparent phosphorescent bandage to assess the tissue’s partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2 ). Statistical analysis revealed a strong relationship ( P &lt; 0.0001) between the rates of change of tissue oxygenation measured by the bandage and blood oxygen saturation (\%stO 2 ) readings from a standard-of-care ViOptix near-infrared spectroscopy oximeter. In addition, the oxygen-sensing bandage showed no adverse effects, proved easy handling, and yielded bright images across all skin tones with a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera. This demonstrates the feasibility of using phosphorescent materials to monitor flaps postoperatively and lays the groundwork for future exploration in other tissue oxygen sensing applications.},

Volcanic isotope geochemistry allows us to distinguish a high-μ (HIMU) reservoir [&gt;1 billion years (Ga) old] in the slab-poor south, from a northern EM1/EM2 reservoir, reflecting a more recent voluminous influx of oceanic lithosphere into the mantle transition zone.

  abstract     = {Chaperones are essential for assisting protein folding and for transferring poorly soluble proteins to their functional locations within cells. Hydrophobic interactions drive promiscuous chaperone-client binding, but our understanding of how additional interactions enable client specificity is sparse. Here, we decipher what determines binding of two chaperones (TIM8·13 and TIM9·10) to different integral membrane proteins, the all-transmembrane mitochondrial carrier Ggc1 and Tim23, which has an additional disordered hydrophilic domain. Combining NMR, SAXS, and molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the structures of Tim23/TIM8·13 and Tim23/TIM9·10 complexes. TIM8·13 uses transient salt bridges to interact with the hydrophilic part of its client, but its interactions to the transmembrane part are weaker than in TIM9·10. Consequently, TIM9·10 outcompetes TIM8·13 in binding hydrophobic clients, while TIM8·13 is tuned to few clients with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. Our study exemplifies how chaperones fine-tune the balance of promiscuity versus specificity.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondria drive cellular adaptation to stress by retro-communicating with the nucleus. This process is known as mitochondrial retrograde response (MRR) and is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction. MRR results in the nuclear stabilization of prosurvival transcription factors such as the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). Here, we demonstrate that MRR is facilitated by contact sites between mitochondria and the nucleus. The translocator protein (TSPO) by preventing the mitophagy-mediated segregation o mitochonria is required for this interaction. The complex formed by TSPO with the protein kinase A (PKA), via the A-kinase anchoring protein acyl-CoA binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3), established the tethering. The latter allows for cholesterol redistribution of cholesterol in the nucleus to sustain the prosurvival response by blocking NF-κB deacetylation. This work proposes a previously unidentified paradigm in MRR: the formation of contact sites between mitochondria and nucleus to aid communication.},

Here, we demonstrate a mechanochemical phenomenon wherein adsorbed long-chain organic monolayers disrupt large-strain plastic deformation in metals. Using high-speed in situ imaging and post facto analysis, we show that the monolayers induce a ductile-to-brittle transition. Sinuous flow, characteristic of ductile metals, gives way to quasi-periodic fracture, typical of brittle materials, with 85\% reduction in deformation forces. By independently varying surface energy and molecule chain length via molecular self-assembly, we argue that this “embrittlement” is driven by adsorbate-induced surface stress, as against surface energy reduction. Our observations, backed by modeling and molecular simulations, could provide a basis for explaining diverse mechanochemical phenomena in solids. The results also have implications for manufacturing processes such as machining and comminution, and wear.},

Here, we showed that the molecular motor KIF17 was locally degraded and synthesized in an N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor (NMDAR)–mediated activity–dependent manner. Accompanied by the degradation of KIF17, its transport was temporarily dampened in dendrites. We also observed that activity-dependent local KIF17 synthesis driven by its 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) occurred at dendritic shafts, and the newly synthesized KIF17 moved along the dendrites. Furthermore, hippocampus-specific deletion of Kif17 3′UTR disrupted KIF17 synthesis induced by fear memory retrieval, leading to impairment in extinction of fear memory. These results indicate that the regulation of the KIF17 transport is driven by the single dendrite–restricted cycle of degradation and synthesis that underlies cognitive flexibility.},

Atomic vacancies from missing tungsten (W) sites are made in freestanding (WS 2 ) monolayers by focused ion beam irradiation and characterized using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. WS 2 monolayers with atomic apertures are mechanically sturdy and showed fast helium flow. We propose a simple yet robust method for confirming the formation of atomic apertures over large areas using gas flows, an essential step for pursuing their prospective applications in various domains including molecular separation, single quantum emitters, sensing and monitoring of gases at ultralow concentrations.},

Here, we report that ER remodeling is actively driven by lysosomes, following lysosome repositioning in response to changes in nutritional status: The anchorage of lysosomes to ER growth tips is critical for ER tubule elongation and connection. We validate this causal link via the chemo- and optogenetically driven repositioning of lysosomes, which leads to both a redistribution of the ER tubules and a change of its global morphology. Therefore, lysosomes sense metabolic change in the cell and regulate ER tubule distribution accordingly. Dysfunction in this mechanism during axonal extension may lead to axonal growth defects. Our results demonstrate a critical role of lysosome-regulated ER dynamics and reshaping in nutrient responses and neuronal development.},

We report that the S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolyzing enzyme adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY) cyclically associates to CLOCK-BMAL1 at chromatin sites and promotes circadian transcriptional activity. SAH is a potent feedback inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)–dependent methyltransferases, and timely hydrolysis of SAH by AHCY is critical to sustain methylation reactions. We show that AHCY is essential for cyclic H3K4 trimethylation, genome-wide recruitment of BMAL1 to chromatin, and subsequent circadian transcription. Depletion or targeted pharmacological inhibition of AHCY in mammalian cells markedly decreases the amplitude of circadian gene expression. In mice, pharmacological inhibition of AHCY in the hypothalamus alters circadian locomotor activity and rhythmic transcription within the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results reveal a previously unappreciated connection between cellular metabolism, chromatin dynamics, and circadian regulation.},

Another major challenge comes from nonequilibrium quasiparticles (QPs) that result in qubit relaxation and dephasing. Here, we reveal a previously unexplored decoherence mechanism in the form of a new type of TLS originating from trapped QPs, which can induce qubit relaxation. Using spectral, temporal, thermal, and magnetic field mapping of TLS-induced fluctuations in frequency tunable resonators, we identify a highly coherent subset of the general TLS population with a low reconfiguration temperature ∼300 mK and a nonuniform density of states. These properties can be understood if the TLS are formed by QPs trapped in shallow subgap states formed by spatial fluctutations of the superconducting order parameter. This implies that even very rare QP bursts will affect coherence over exponentially long time scales.},

Accordingly, the dependence of T cells can be partially relieved by replenishing the polyamine pool. In response to the blockage of biosynthesis, T cells can rapidly restore the polyamine pool through a compensatory increase in extracellular polyamine uptake, indicating a layer of metabolic plasticity. Simultaneously blocking synthesis and uptake depletes the intracellular polyamine pool, inhibits T cell proliferation, and suppresses T cell inflammation, indicating the potential therapeutic value of targeting the polyamine pool for managing inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.},

We construct mathematical models for two posttranslational oscillators, using few components that interact only through reversible binding and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions. Our designed oscillators rely on the self-assembly of two protein species into multimeric functional enzymes that respectively inhibit and enhance this self-assembly. We limit our analysis to within experimental constraints, finding (i) significant portions of the restricted parameter space yielding oscillations and (ii) that oscillation periods can be tuned by several orders of magnitude using recent advances in computational protein design.

The microRNAome of glioblastoma is substantially down-regulated in comparison to the normal brain. Here, we find malfunction of the posttranscriptional maturation of the glioblastoma microRNAome and link it to aberrant nuclear localization of DICER, the major enzymatic complex responsible for microRNA maturation. Analysis of DICER’s nuclear interactome reveals the presence of an RNA binding protein, RBM3, and of a circular RNA, circ2082 , within the complex. Targeting of this complex by knockdown of circ2082 results in the restoration of cytosolic localization of DICER and widespread derepression of the microRNAome, leading to transcriptome-wide rearrangements that mitigate the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo with correlation to favorable outcomes in patients with glioblastoma. These findings uncover the mechanistic foundation of microRNAome deregulation in malignant cells.},

  abstract     = {Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are used in the treatment of BRCA-deficient cancers, with treatments currently extending toward other homologous recombination defective tumors. In a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen with olaparib, we identify ALC1 (Amplified in Liver Cancer 1)—a cancer-relevant poly(ADP-ribose)-regulated chromatin remodeling enzyme—as a key modulator of sensitivity to PARP inhibitor. We found that ALC1 can remove inactive PARP1 indirectly through binding to PARylated chromatin. Consequently, ALC1 deficiency enhances trapping of inhibited PARP1, which then impairs the binding of both nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination repair factors to DNA lesions. We also establish that ALC1 overexpression, a common feature in multiple tumor types, reduces the sensitivity of BRCA-deficient cells to PARP inhibitors. Together, we conclude that ALC1-dependent PARP1 mobilization is a key step underlying PARP inhibitor resistance.},

Here, we provide a voxel-level description of the network and hierarchical structure of the directed mouse connectome, unconstrained by regional partitioning. We report a number of previously unappreciated organizational principles in the mammalian brain, including a directional segregation of hub regions into neural sink and sources, and a strategic wiring of neuromodulatory nuclei as connector hubs and critical orchestrators of network communication. We also find that the mouse cortical connectome is hierarchically organized along two superimposed cortical gradients reflecting unimodal-transmodal functional processing and a modality-specific sensorimotor axis, recapitulating a phylogenetically conserved feature of higher mammals.

However, little is known about its ability to endure multiple switching cycles, its capacity for recording high-resolution patterns, nor the optical properties of the crystallized state. Unexpectedly, we show that crystalline Sb 2 S 3 films that are just 20 nm thick can produce substantial birefringent phase retardation. We also report a high-speed rewritable patterning approach at subdiffraction resolutions (&gt;40, 000 dpi) using 780-nm femtosecond laser pulses. Partial reamorphization is demonstrated and then used to write and erase multiple microscale color images with a wide range of colors over a ~120-nm band in the visible spectrum.

Here, we demonstrate that the diffusivity of excitons in monolayer MoS 2 can be improved from 1.5 ± 0.5 to 22.5 ± 2.5 square centimeters per second with the presence of trapped charges. This is manifested by a spatial expansion of photoluminescence when the incident power reaches a threshold value to enable the onset of exciton Mott transition. The trapped charges are estimated to be in a scale of 10 10 per square centimeter and do not affect the emission features and recombination dynamics of the excitons. The result indicates that trapped charges provide an attractive strategy to screen exciton scattering with phonons and impurities/defects.

Here, copper foils are rapidly strained via picosecond laser ablation and probed in situ with femtosecond x-ray free electron (XFEL) pulses. Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) monitors the void distribution evolution, while wide-angle scattering (WAXS) simultaneously determines the strain evolution. The ability to quantifiably characterize the nanoscale during high strain rate failure with ultrafast SAXS, complementing WAXS, represents a broadening in the range of science that can be performed with XFEL.

Here, we present a scheme leveraging universal properties of spontaneous Raman scattering to demonstrate Bell correlations between light and a collective molecular vibration. We measure the decay of these hybrid photon-phonon Bell correlations with sub-picosecond time resolution and find that they survive over several hundred oscillations at ambient conditions.

The common progenitors undergo further bifurcations to restrict them into osteogenic/odontogenic and chondrogenic/fibroblast lineages. Disruption of a patterning domain leads to specific mandible and tooth defects, validating the binary cell fate restriction process.

The microRNA bantam and the chromatin regulator Taranis both function downstream of Yki in promoting ci expression.

  abstract     = {The main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key antiviral drug target. While most M pro inhibitors have a γ-lactam glutamine surrogate at the P1 position, we recently found that several M pro inhibitors have hydrophobic moieties at the P1 site, including calpain inhibitors II and XII, which are also active against human cathepsin L, a host protease that is important for viral entry. In this study, we solved x-ray crystal structures of M pro in complex with calpain inhibitors II and XII and three analogs of GC-376 . The structure of M pro with calpain inhibitor II confirmed that the S1 pocket can accommodate a hydrophobic methionine side chain, challenging the idea that a hydrophilic residue is necessary at this position. The structure of calpain inhibitor XII revealed an unexpected, inverted binding pose. Together, the biochemical, computational, structural, and cellular data presented herein provide new directions for the development of dual inhibitors as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.},

Impacts of the technology would be more far-reaching with finer thermal sensitivity, called noise-equivalent differential temperature (NEDT). Existing efforts to advance NEDT are all focused on improving registration of radiation signals with better cameras, driving the number close to the end of the roadmap at 20 to 40 mK. In this work, we take a distinct approach of sensitizing surface radiation against minute temperature variation of the object. The emissivity of the thermal imaging sensitizer (TIS) rises abruptly at a preprogrammed temperature, driven by a metal-insulator transition in cooperation with photonic resonance in the structure. The NEDT is refined by over 15 times with the TIS to achieve single-digit millikelvin resolution near room temperature, empowering ambient thermography for a broad range of applications such as in operando electronics analysis and early cancer screening.},

How the lymphatic system, which orchestrates the complex sensing of antigen by lymphocytes to mount an adaptive immune response, facilitates this response in the context of malignancy is incompletely understood. To delineate the effects of lymphatic transport and tumor-induced lymphatic and lymph node (LN) remodeling on the elicitation of CD8 + T cell immunity within LNs, we designed a suite of nanoscale biomaterial tools enabling the quantification of antigen access and presentation within the LN and resulting influence on T cell functions. The expansion of antigen-specific stem-like and cytotoxic CD8 + T cell pools was revealed to be sensitive to the mechanism of lymphatic transport to LNs, demonstrating the potential for nanoengineering strategies targeting LNs to optimize cancer immunotherapy in eliciting antitumor CD8 + T cell immunity.},

Although cryo–electron microscopy structures revealed intricate interactions between the KCNQ1 voltage-sensing domain (VSD), CaM, and PIP 2 , the functional consequences of these interactions remain unknown. Here, we show that CaM-VSD interactions act as a state-dependent switch to control KCNQ1 pore opening. Combined electrophysiology and molecular dynamics network analysis suggest that VSD transition into the fully activated state allows PIP 2 to compete with CaM for binding to VSD. This leads to conformational changes that alter VSD-pore coupling to stabilize open states. We identify a motif in the KCNQ1 cytosolic domain, which works downstream of CaM-VSD interactions to facilitate the conformational change. Our findings suggest a gating mechanism that integrates PIP 2 and CaM in KCNQ1 voltage-dependent activation, yielding insights into how KCNQ1 gains the phenotypes critical for its physiological function.},

To understand the properties of the alloy passivation layer, this paper presents the first direct observation of its evolution at elevated temperatures (up to 325°C) by in situ scanning electron microscopy. We found that the morphology of the surface passivation layer was unchanged above the alloy melting point, while the bulk of the material below the surface was melted at the expected melting point, as confirmed by in situ electron backscatter diffraction. In situ heat treatment of Li-based materials could be a key method to improve battery performance.},

We demonstrate that shifts in socialization strategies analogous to political polarization can arise as a locally beneficial response to both rising wealth inequality and economic decline. In many contexts, interaction with diverse out-groups confers benefits from innovation and exploration greater than those that arise from interacting exclusively with a homogeneous in-group. However, when the economic environment favors risk aversion, a strategy of seeking lower-risk in-group interactions can be important to maintaining individual solvency. Our model shows that under conditions of economic decline or increasing inequality, some members of the population benefit from adopting a risk-averse, in-group favoring strategy. Moreover, we show that such in-group polarization can spread rapidly to the whole population and persist even when the conditions that produced it have reversed.},

The glass-forming ability (GFA) of multicomponent systems, such as metallic glasses and phase-change materials, can be enormously changed by slight modifications of the constituted elements and compositions. However, its physical origin remains mostly unknown. Here, by molecular dynamics simulations, we study three model metallic systems with distinct GFA. We find that they have a similar driving force of crystallization, but a different liquid-crystal interface tension, indicating that the latter dominates the GFA. Furthermore, we show that the interface tension is determined by nontrivial coupling between structural and compositional orderings and affects crystal growth. These facts indicate that the classical theories of crystallization need critical modifications by considering local ordering effects. Our findings provide fresh insight into the physical control of GFA of metallic alloys and the switching speed of phase-change materials without relying on experience.},

High-resolution imaging of the moiré lattices and superstructures is critical for understanding the emerging physics. Here, we report the imaging of moiré lattices and superstructures in graphene-based samples under ambient conditions using an ultrahigh-resolution implementation of scanning microwave impedance microscopy. Although the probe tip has a gross radius of ~100 nm, spatial resolution better than 5 nm is achieved, which allows direct visualization of the structural details in moiré lattices and the composite super-moiré.

Modeling shows that this pattern is well explained by enhanced Pacific meridional overturning circulation (PMOC), which brings warm, salty, and nutrient-poor subtropical waters to high latitudes. Enhanced PMOC at the LGM would have lowered atmospheric CO 2 —in part through synergy with the Southern Ocean—and supported an equable regional climate, which may have aided human habitability in Beringia, and migration from Asia to North America.},

  abstract     = {Plate subduction greatly influences the physical and chemical characteristics of Earth’s surface and deep interior, yet the timing of its initiation is debated because of the paucity of exposed rocks from Earth’s early history. We show that the titanium isotopic composition of orthogneisses from the Acasta Gneiss Complex spanning the Hadean to Eoarchean transition falls on two distinct magmatic differentiation trends. Hadean tonalitic gneisses show titanium isotopic compositions comparable to modern evolved tholeiitic magmas, formed by differentiation of dry parental magmas in plume settings. Younger Eoarchean granitoid gneisses have titanium isotopic compositions comparable to modern calc-alkaline magmas produced in convergent arcs. Our data therefore document a shift from tholeiitic- to calc-alkaline–style magmatism between 4.02 and 3.75 billion years (Ga) in the Slave craton.},

Nonetheless, the evolutionary origin of their unprecedented morphological complexity remains largely an enigma. Here, we show that the coevolution of cis-regulatory and coding regions of PIN-FORMED ( PIN ) auxin transporters confined their expression to certain cell types and directed their subcellular localization to particular cell sides, which together enabled dynamic auxin gradients across tissues critical to the complex architecture of flowering plants. Extensive intraspecies and interspecies genetic complementation experiments with PIN s from green alga up to flowering plant lineages showed that PIN genes underwent three subsequent, critical evolutionary innovations and thus acquired a triple function to regulate the development of three essential components of the flowering plant Arabidopsis : shoot/root, inflorescence, and floral organ. Our work highlights the critical role of functional innovations within the PIN gene family as essential prerequisites for the origin of flowering plants.},

An on-demand and truly scalable source of indistinguishable single photons is the essential component enabling high-fidelity photonic quantum operations. A main challenge is to overcome noise and decoherence processes to reach the steep benchmarks on generation efficiency and photon indistinguishability required for scaling up the source. We report on the realization of a deterministic single-photon source featuring near-unity indistinguishability using a quantum dot in an “on-chip” planar nanophotonic waveguide circuit. The device produces long strings of &gt;100 single photons without any observable decrease in the mutual indistinguishability between photons. A total generation rate of 122 million photons per second is achieved, corresponding to an on-chip source efficiency of 84\%. These specifications of the single-photon source are benchmarked for boson sampling and found to enable scaling into the regime of quantum advantage.},

Here, we report a unique application of soft x-ray tomography to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of whole pancreatic β cells at different time points following glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Reconstructions following stimulation showed distinct insulin vesicle distribution patterns reflective of altered vesicle pool sizes as they travel through the secretory pathway. Our results show that glucose stimulation caused rapid changes in biochemical composition and/or density of insulin packing, increased mitochondrial volume, and closer proximity of insulin vesicles to mitochondria. Costimulation with exendin-4 (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist) prolonged these effects and increased insulin packaging efficiency and vesicle maturation. This study provides unique perspectives on the coordinated structural reorganization and interactions of organelles that dictate cell responses.},

In the regions where we observed insulin vesicles, a measurable increase in both the fraction of cellular volume occupied by vesicles and the average size (diameter) of the vesicles was apparent as sampling moved from the area near the nucleus toward the plasma membrane.

Intriguingly, however, here we show that the aberrant processing of late replication intermediates by Mus81-Eme1 is a source of CIN. Upon depletion of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), Mus81-Eme1 cleaves under-replicated DNA engaged in mitotic DNA synthesis, leading to chromosome segregation defects. Supplementing cells with nucleosides allows the completion of mitotic DNA synthesis, restraining Mus81-Eme1–dependent DNA damage in mitosis and the ensuing CIN. We found no correlation between CIN arising from nucleotide shortage in mitosis and cell death, which were selectively linked to DNA damage load in mitosis and S phase, respectively. Our findings imply the possibility of optimizing Chk1-directed therapies by inducing cell death while curtailing CIN, a common side effect of chemotherapy.},

Inhibiting H3K4-specific methyltransferases with the compound WDR5-0103 leads to the substantial recovery of PFC synaptic function and memory-related behaviors in AD mice. Among the up-regulated genes reversed by WDR5-0103 treatment in PFC of AD mice, many have the increased H3K4me3 enrichment at their promoters. One of the identified top-ranking target genes, Sgk1 , which encodes serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1, is also significantly elevated in PFC of patients with AD. Administration of a specific Sgk1 inhibitor reduces hyperphosphorylated tau protein, restores PFC glutamatergic synaptic function, and ameliorates memory deficits in AD mice.

Here, a fully biodegradable, self-electrified, and miniaturized device composed of dissolvable galvanic cells on a biodegradable scaffold is achieved, which can offer both structural guidance and electrical cues for peripheral nerve regeneration. The electroactive device can provide sustained electrical stimuli beyond intraoperative window, which can promote calcium activity, repopulation of Schwann cells, and neurotrophic factors.

All three KCCs adopt a similar overall architecture, a domain-swap dimeric assembly, and an inward-facing conformation. The structural and functional studies reveal that one unexpected N-terminal peptide binds at the cytosolic facing cavity and locks KCC2 and KCC4 at an autoinhibition state. The C-terminal domain (CTD) directly interacts with the N-terminal inhibitory peptide, and the relative motions between the CTD and the transmembrane domain (TMD) suggest that CTD regulates KCCs’ activities by adjusting the autoinhibitory effect. These structures provide the first glimpse of full-length structures of KCCs and an autoinhibition mechanism among the amino acid–polyamine-organocation transporter superfamily.},

In both cases, one of the alternative topologies must be a result of errors in tree reconstruction. Here, using empirical data and simulations, we show that the Ctenophora-first and Nephrozoa topologies (but not Porifera-first and Ambulacraria topologies) are strongly supported by analyses affected by systematic errors. Accommodating this finding suggests that empirical studies supporting Ctenophora-first and Nephrozoa trees are likely to be explained by systematic error.

From 176 patients with stage I to III lung cancer, we inferred that, on average, 0.014\% of a tumor cell’s DNA is shed into the bloodstream per cell death. For annual screening, the model predicts median detection sizes of 2.0 to 2.3 cm representing a ~40\% decrease from the current median detection size of 3.5 cm. For informed monthly cancer relapse testing, the model predicts a median detection size of 0.83 cm and suggests that treatment failure can be detected 140 days earlier than with imaging-based approaches.

We develop a method to measure aortic lymphatic transport of macromolecules and show that it is impaired during atherosclerosis progression, whereas it is ameliorated during lesion regression induced by ezetimibe. Disruption of aortic lymph flow by lymphatic ligation promotes adventitial inflammation and development of atherosclerotic plaque in hypercholesterolemic mice and inhibits ezetimibe-induced atherosclerosis regression. Thus, progression of atherosclerotic plaques may result not only from increased entry of atherogenic factors into the arterial wall but also from reduced lymphatic clearance of these factors as a result of aortic lymph stasis.

  abstract     = {Digital data storage is a growing need for our society and finding alternative solutions than those based on silicon or magnetic tapes is a challenge in the era of “big data.” The recent development of polymers that can store information at the molecular level has opened up new opportunities for ultrahigh density data storage, long-term archival, anticounterfeiting systems, and molecular cryptography. However, synthetic informational polymers are so far only deciphered by tandem mass spectrometry. In comparison, nanopore technology can be faster, cheaper, nondestructive and provide detection at the single-molecule level; moreover, it can be massively parallelized and miniaturized in portable devices. Here, we demonstrate the ability of engineered aerolysin nanopores to accurately read, with single-bit resolution, the digital information encoded in tailored informational polymers alone and in mixed samples, without compromising information density. These findings open promising possibilities to develop writing-reading technologies to process digital data using a biological-inspired platform.},

However, the relevance of CTD S2P in metazoan development is unknown. We show that cdk-12 lesions or a full-length CTD S2A substitution results in an identical phenotype in Caenorhabditis elegans . Embryogenesis occurs in the complete absence of S2P, but the hatched larvae arrest development, mimicking the diapause induced when hatching occurs in the absence of food. Genome-wide analyses indicate that when CTD S2P is inhibited, only a subset of growth-related genes is not properly expressed. These genes correspond to SL2 trans-spliced mRNAs located in position 2 and over within operons. We show that CDK-12 is required for maximal occupancy of cleavage stimulatory factor necessary for SL2 trans-splicing. We propose that CTD S2P functions as a gene-specific signaling mark ensuring the nutritional control of the C. elegans developmental program.},

A key uncertainty is whether planning ahead for future species redistributions imposes high opportunity costs and sharp trade-offs against current ocean plans. Here, we use more than 10, 000 projections for marine animals around North America to test the impact of climate-driven species redistributions on the ability of ocean plans to meet their goals. We show that planning for redistributions can substantially reduce exposure to risks from climate change with little additional area set aside and with few trade-offs against current ocean plan effectiveness. Networks of management areas are a key strategy. While climate change will severely disrupt many human activities, we find a strong benefit to proactively planning for long-term ocean change.},

The fundamental problem of detecting voice signals in noise (VIN) is underinvestigated especially in its temporal dynamic properties. We investigated VIN as a dynamic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) problem to determine the neurocognitive dynamics of subthreshold evidence accrual and near-threshold voice signal detection. Experiment 1 showed that dynamic VIN, including a varying SNR and subthreshold sensory evidence accrual, is superior to similar conditions with nondynamic SNRs or with acoustically matched sounds. Furthermore, voice signals with affective meaning have a detection advantage during VIN. Experiment 2 demonstrated that VIN is driven by an effective neural integration in an auditory cortical-limbic network at and beyond the near-threshold detection point, which is preceded by activity in subcortical auditory nuclei. This demonstrates the superior recognition advantage of communication signals in dynamic noise contexts, especially when carrying socio-affective meaning.},

Here, to improve the efficiency and efficacy of lysosomal enzyme uptake, we exploited the strategy used by diphtheria toxin to enter into the endolysosomal network of cells by creating a chimera between the receptor-binding fragment of diphtheria toxin and the lysosomal hydrolase TPP1. We show that chimeric TPP1 binds with high affinity to target cells and is efficiently delivered into lysosomes. Further, we show superior uptake of chimeric TPP1 over TPP1 alone in brain tissue following intracerebroventricular injection in mice lacking TPP1, demonstrating the potential of this strategy for enhancing lysosomal storage disease therapy.},

Here, we use magnetostratigraphic and radiochronologic dating to revise the chronology of elevation estimates from the Lunpola Basin. The updated ages reconcile previous results and indicate that the elevations of central Tibet were generally low (&lt;2.3 km) at 39.5 Ma and high (3.5 to 4.5 km) at ~26 Ma. This supports the existence in the Eocene of low-elevation longitudinally oriented narrow regions until their uplift in the early Miocene, with potential implications for the growth mechanisms of the Tibetan Plateau, Asian atmospheric circulation, surface processes, and biotic evolution.},

After cytosolic translocation, late endosome–derived cathD juxtaposes actin filaments at the leading edge of lamellipodia. Suppressing cathD expression or blocking its cytosolic translocation impairs the maintenance but not the initiation of lamellipodial extension. Moreover, immature cathD balances the activity of the actin-severing protein cofilin to maintain globular-actin (G-actin) monomer pool for local actin recycling. Our study identifies cathD as a key lysosomal molecule that unconventionally contributes to actin cytoskeleton remodeling via cytosolic translocation during adenosine triphosphate–evoked microglia migration.},

Negative precipitation anomalies occur over the Fennoscandian ice sheet, the North European Plain, and as far south as the Alps. This is consistent with a more southerly and zonal storm track, which is linked to a concomitant southern location of the Polar Frontal Jet Stream, generating cold air outbreaks and enhanced cyclogenesis, especially over the eastern Mediterranean.

Consistently, inhibition of DNMT3B promoted proliferation/migration of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) in response to platelet-derived growth factor–BB (PDGF-BB). In contrast, overexpressing DNMT3B in PASMCs attenuated PDGF-BB–induced proliferation/migration and ameliorated hypoxia-mediated PH and right ventricular hypertrophy in mice. We also showed that DNMT3B transcriptionally regulated inflammatory pathways.

Here, we identify Brahma (Brm), the core adenosine triphosphatase of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, as a new Piwi interactor, and show Brm involvement in activating transcription of Piwi-targeted transposons before silencing. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that Piwi, once bound to target RNAs, reduced the occupancies of SWI/SNF and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) on target loci, abrogating transcription. Artificial piRNA-driven targeting of Piwi to RNA transcripts enhanced repression of Brm-dependent reporters compared with Brm-independent reporters. This was dependent on Piwi cofactors, Gtsf1/Asterix (Gtsf1), Panoramix/Silencio (Panx), and Maelstrom (Mael), but not Eggless/dSetdb (Egg)–mediated H3K9me3 deposition. The λN-box B–mediated tethering of Mael to reporters repressed Brm-dependent genes in the absence of Piwi, Panx, and Gtsf1.

  abstract     = {Developmental enhancers control the expression of genes prefiguring morphological patterns. The activity of an enhancer varies among cells of a tissue, but collectively, expression levels in individual cells constitute a spatial pattern of gene expression. How the spatial and quantitative regulatory information is encoded in an enhancer sequence is elusive. To link spatial pattern and activity levels of an enhancer, we used systematic mutations of the yellow spot enhancer, active in developing Drosophila wings, and tested their effect in a reporter assay. Moreover, we developed an analytic framework based on the comprehensive quantification of spatial reporter activity. We show that the quantitative enhancer activity results from densely packed regulatory information along the sequence, and that a complex interplay between activators and multiple tiers of repressors carves the spatial pattern. Our results shed light on how an enhancer reads and integrates trans-regulatory landscape information to encode a spatial quantitative pattern.},

Slight changes in the characteristics of the fabric and the mechanical properties of the tissues lead to requirements for frequent measurements and corresponding adjustments of the applied pressure. Existing sensors are not sufficiently small, thin, or flexible for practical use in this context, and they also demand cumbersome, hard-wired interfaces for data acquisition. Here, we introduce a flexible, wireless monitoring system for tracking both temperature and pressure at the interface between the skin and the TCGs.

Pharmacological modulation of this pathway results in the inhibition of viral replication. In this study, we tested 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), a chemical chaperone–based potent alleviator of ER stress, for its effects on herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 infection. Through in vitro studies, we observed that application of PBA to HSV-infected cells results in the down-regulation of a proviral, ER-localized host protein CREB3 and a resultant inhibition of viral protein synthesis. PBA treatment caused viral inhibition in cultured human corneas and human skin grafts as well as murine models of ocular and genital HSV infection. Thus, we propose that this drug can provide an alternative to current antivirals to treat both ocular HSV-1 and genital HSV-2 infections and may be a strong candidate for human trials.},

The gold ions’ reduction at the oil-water interface in a double emulsion solvent evaporation process enables a gold–bile salt interaction and the formation of bile salt particles. We demonstrate that composite microparticles release cholate/deoxycholate into solution via a surface erosion process. We illustrate these particles’ capability to lyse adipocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, with minimal side effects, contrary to the Food and Drug Administration–approved salt solution that leads to severe inflammation and ulceration. Overall, particle-based cholate/deoxycholate opens opportunities for localized delivery of these salts, improving efficacy while minimizing side effects associated with oral and subcutaneous use.},

We find that marked, asynchronous reductions of the basic reproductive number occurred throughout the United States in association with social distancing and other control measures. Counterfactual simulations indicate that, had these same measures been implemented 1 to 2 weeks earlier, substantial cases and deaths could have been averted and that delayed responses to future increased incidence will facilitate a stronger rebound of infections and death.

Specifically, we use TROPOMI observations of NO 2 to deduce 10-day moving averages of NO x and CO 2 emissions over China, differentiating emissions by sector and province. Between January and April 2020, China’s CO 2 emissions fell by 11.5\% compared to the same period in 2019, but emissions have since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels before the coronavirus outbreak at the beginning of January 2020 owing to the fast economic recovery in provinces where industrial activity is concentrated.},

The notion that viral particles function as independent propagules has been challenged by recent observations suggesting that viral aggregates show enhanced infectivity and faster spread. However, these observations remain poorly understood. Here, we show that viral replication is a cooperative process, such that entry of multiple viral genome copies into the same cell disproportionately increases short-term viral progeny production. This cooperativity arises from the positive feedback established between replication templates and virus-encoded products involved in replication and should be a general feature of viruses. We develop a simple model that captures this effect, verify that cooperativity also emerges in more complex models for specific human viruses, validate our predictions experimentally using different mammalian viruses, and discuss the implications of cooperative replication for viral fitness.},

For example, small crystal aggregates in products of the 1959 eruption of Kīlauea Iki, Hawaii contain overgrown olivines separated by large, hydrodynamically unfavorable angles. The common occurrence of these aggregates calls for a flow mechanism that creates this crystal misorientation. Here, we show that the observed aggregates are the result of exposure to a steady wave field in the conduit through a customized, process-based model at the scale of individual crystals. We use this model to infer quantitative attributes of the flow at the time of aggregate formation; notably, the formation of misoriented aggregates is only reproduced in bidirectional, not unidirectional, conduit flow.},

Despite evidence that tortuosity disrupts efficient blood flow and that it may be an important clinical biomarker, underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood but are widely appreciated to be largely biomechanical. Many previous studies suggested that tortuosity may arise via an elastic structural buckling instability, but the novel experimental-computational approach used here suggests that tortuosity arises from mechanosensitive, cell-mediated responses to local aberrations in the microstructural integrity of the arterial wall. In particular, computations informed by multimodality imaging show that aberrations in elastic fiber integrity, collagen alignment, and collagen turnover can lead to a progressive loss of structural stability that entrenches during the development of tortuosity. Interpreted in this way, microstructural defects or irregularities of the arterial wall initiate the condition and hypertension is a confounding factor.},

Compared to synchronous beating, we report a 50\% increase of net flow speed when cilia move in an antiplectic wave with phase shift of −π/3 and a decrease for symplectic waves. Furthermore, we observe the formation of traveling vortices in the direction of the wave when metachrony is applied.},

In adult mice, oral delivery of dabrafenib repressed ERK phosphorylation in cochlear cells, and protected from cisplatin- and noise-induced hearing loss. Full protection was achieved in mice with co-treatment with oral AZD5438, a CDK2 kinase inhibitor. Our study explores a previously unidentified cellular pathway and molecular target BRAF kinase for otoprotection and may advance dabrafenib into clinics to benefit patients with cisplatin- and noise-induced ototoxicity.},

  abstract     = {Antiplatelet agents offer a desirable approach to thrombosis prevention through the reduction of platelet reactivity. However, major bleeding events greatly attenuate the clinical outcomes of most antithrombotic agents. Therefore, the development of safer and more effective strategies to prevent vascular occlusion and avoid bleeding is urgently needed. A reconstituted nanoparticle, synthetic high-density lipoprotein (sHDL), which mimics the native HDL, has been established as clinically safe and is easily manufactured on a large scale. In this study, we propose that the delivery of the antiplatelet drug ML355, a selective inhibitor of 12(S)-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), by sHDL will efficiently inhibit thrombosis by targeting ML355 to the intended site of action, improving the pharmaceutical profile and harnessing the innate antithrombotic efficacy of the sHDL carrier. Our data show that ML355-sHDL exhibits more potent inhibition of thrombus formation in both small arterioles and larger arteries in mice without impairing the normal hemostasis in vivo.},

Here, we demonstrate a spontaneous defect-free functionalization method consisting of attaching Au single atoms to monolayers of semiconducting MoS 2 (1H) via S-Au-Cl coordination complexes. This strategy offers an effective and controllable approach for tuning the Fermi level and excitation spectra of MoS 2 via p-type doping and enhancing the thermal boundary conductance of monolayer MoS 2 , thus promoting heat dissipation. The coordination-based method offers an effective and damage-free route of functionalizing TMDs and can be applied to other metals and used in single-atom catalysis, quantum information devices, optoelectronics, and enhanced sensing.},

We analyze 46 patients bearing de novo germline mutations in histone 3 family 3A ( H3F3A ) or H3F3B with progressive neurologic dysfunction and congenital anomalies without malignancies. Molecular modeling of all 37 variants demonstrated clear disruptions in interactions with DNA, other histones, and histone chaperone proteins. Patient histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) analysis revealed notably aberrant local PTM patterns distinct from the somatic lysine mutations that cause global PTM dysregulation. RNA sequencing on patient cells demonstrated up-regulated gene expression related to mitosis and cell division, and cellular assays confirmed an increased proliferative capacity. A zebrafish model showed craniofacial anomalies and a defect in Foxd3-derived glia. These data suggest that the mechanism of germline mutations are distinct from cancer-associated somatic histone mutations but may converge on control of cell proliferation.},

We generated transcriptome (RNA-seq), epigenome (ChIP-seq of H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 histone modifications), open chromatin (ATAC-seq), and chromatin interaction (promoter capture Hi-C) annotations of cultured primary decidua-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and in vitro differentiated decidual stromal cells and developed a computational framework to integrate these functional annotations with results from a GWAS of gestational duration in 56, 384 women. Using these resources, we uncovered additional loci associated with gestational duration and target genes of associated loci. Our strategy illustrates how functional annotations in pregnancy-relevant cell types aid in the experimental follow-up of GWAS for PTB and, likely, other pregnancy-related conditions.},

TLR1/2 signaling is sensitive to the chemical structure of ligands, but its dependence on the spatial distribution of ligands on microbial surfaces remains unexplored. Here, we reveal the quantitative relationship between TLR1/2-triggered immune responses and the spacing of ligand clusters by designing an artificial “phagocytic synapse” nanoarray platform to mimic the cell-microbe interface. The ligand spacing dictates the proximity of receptor clusters on the cell surface and consequently the pro-inflammatory responses of macrophages. However, cell responses reach their maximum at small ligand spacings when the receptor nanoclusters become adjacent to one another. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using spatially patterned ligands to modulate innate immunity. It shows that the receptor clusters of TLR1/2 act as a driver in integrating the spatial cues of ligands into cell-level activation events.},

  abstract     = {Remyelination failure in multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with a migration/differentiation block of oligodendroglia. The reason for this block is highly debated. It could result from disease-related extrinsic or intrinsic regulators in oligodendroglial biology. To avoid confounding immune-mediated extrinsic effect, we used an immune-deficient mouse model to compare induced pluripotent stem cell–derived oligodendroglia from MS and healthy donors following engraftment in the developing CNS. We show that the MS-progeny behaves and differentiates into oligodendrocytes to the same extent as controls. They generate equal amounts of myelin, with bona fide nodes of Ranvier, and promote equal restoration of their host slow conduction. MS-progeny expressed oligodendrocyte- and astrocyte-specific connexins and established functional connections with donor and host glia. Thus, MS oligodendroglia, regardless of major immune manipulators, are intrinsically capable of myelination and making functional axo-glia/glia-glia connections, reinforcing the view that the MS oligodendrocyte differentiation block is not from major intrinsic oligodendroglial deficits.},

Here, we imaged the activity of V2a neurons using micro-endoscopy in freely moving mice. We find that as many as half of the V2a neurons are excited at locomotion arrest and with low reliability. Other V2a neurons are inhibited at locomotor arrests and/or activated during other behaviors such as locomotion initiation or stationary grooming. Our results establish that V2a neurons not only drive stops as suggested by bulk optogenetics but also are stratified into subpopulations that likely contribute to diverse motor patterns.},

Enoxacin mitigated diet-induced obesity in mice, and this was associated with increased energy expenditure. Consistently, subcutaneous white and brown adipose tissues and skeletal muscle of enoxacin-treated mice had higher levels of markers associated with thermogenesis and oxidative metabolism. These effects were cell autonomous since they were recapitulated in vitro in murine and human cell models. In preadipocytes, enoxacin led to a reduction of miR-34a-5p expression and up-regulation of its target genes (e.g., Fgfr1 , Klb , and Sirt1 ), thus increasing FGF21 signaling and promoting beige adipogenesis. Our data demonstrate that enoxacin counteracts obesity by promoting thermogenic signaling and inducing oxidative metabolism in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in a mechanism that involves, at least in part, miRNA-mediated regulation.},

Moreover, we map the position of the N and C termini and determine their role in complex assembly, and visualize the 8S complexes in heterologous caveolae.

Here, we reconstructed seven ancestral firefly luciferase genes, characterized the enzymatic properties of the recombinant proteins, and determined the crystal structures of the gene from ancestral Lampyridae. Results showed that the synthetic luciferase for the last common firefly ancestor exhibited green light caused by a spatial constraint on the luciferin molecule in enzyme, while fatty acyl-CoA synthetic activity, an original function of firefly luciferase, was diminished in exchange. All known firefly species are bioluminescent in the larvae, with a common ancestor arising approximately 100 million years ago. Combined, our findings propose that, within the mid-Cretaceous forest, the common ancestor of fireflies evolved green light luciferase via trade-off of the original function, which was likely aposematic warning display against nocturnal predation.},

In particular, acoustic waves are an important medium for information transport, but they are inherently symmetric in time. In this work, we report giant nonreciprocity in the transmission of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on lithium niobate substrate coated with ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet (FeGaB/Al 2 O 3 /FeGaB) multilayer structure. We exploit this structure with a unique asymmetric band diagram and expand on magnetoelastic coupling theory to show how the magnetic bands couple with acoustic waves only in a single direction. We measure 48.4-dB (power ratio of 1:69, 200) isolation that outperforms current state-of-the-art microwave isolator devices in a previously unidentified acoustic wave system that facilitates unprecedented size, weight, and power reduction. In addition, these results offer a promising platform to study nonreciprocal SAW devices.},

Methods for evaluating these properties typically involve destroying the tissue or require specialized technology and complicated analyses. Here, we present a novel, noninvasive methodology for determining the spatial distribution of tissue features within embryos, making use of nondirectionally migrating cells and software we termed “Landscape, ” which performs automatized high-throughput three-dimensional image registration. Using the live migrating cells as bioprobes, we identified structures within the zebrafish embryo that affect the distribution of the cells and studied one such structure constituting a physical barrier, which, in turn, influences amoeboid cell polarity. Overall, this work provides a unique approach for detecting tissue properties without interfering with animal’s development. In addition, Landscape allows for integrating data from multiple samples, providing detailed and reliable quantitative evaluation of variable biological phenotypes in different organisms.},

MYB binding protein 1A ( MYBBP1A ), encoding a chromatin-bound protein, is hemizygous in most of the PDAC due to a chromosome 17p deletion that also spans TP53 . We find that hemizygous MYBBP1A loss in isogenic PDAC cells promotes tumorigenesis but, paradoxically, homozygous MYBBP1A loss is associated with impaired cell growth and decreased tumorigenesis. Poly–adenosine 5′-diphosphate–ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) interacts with MYBBP1A and displaces it from chromatin. Small molecules, such as olaparib, that trap PARP1 to chromatin are able to evict the minimal pool of chromatin-bound MYBBP1A protein in MYBBP1A hemizygous cells and impair cell growth, greater than its impact on wild-type cells. Our findings reveal how a cell essential gene with one allele lost in cancer cells can be preferentially susceptible to a specific molecular therapy, when compared to wild-type cells.},

Here, we show, using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, that single and double chains of antiskyrmions can be generated at room temperature in nanostripes less than 0.5 μm in width formed from the D 2d Heusler compound Mn 1.4 Pt 0.9 Pd 0.1 Sn. Typically, truncated helical spin textures are formed in low magnetic fields, whose edges are terminated by half antiskyrmions. These evolve into chains of antiskyrmions with increasing magnetic field. Single chains of these objects are located in the middle of the nanostripes even when the stripes are much wider than the antiskyrmions. Moreover, the chains can even include elliptical Bloch skyrmions depending on details of the applied magnetic field history. These findings make D 2d materials special and highly interesting for applications such as magnetic racetrack memory storage devices.},

Here, I analyzed the skin patterns of 18, 114 fish species and found strong mechanistic associations between camouflaged labyrinthine patterns and simple spot motifs, showing remarkable consistency with the pattern blending hypothesis. Genomic analyses confirmed that the coloring on multiple labyrinthine fish species has originated from pattern blending by hybridization, and phylogenetic comparative analyses have further substantiated the pattern blending hypothesis in multiple major fish lineages. These findings provide a plausible mechanistic explanation for the characteristic diversity of animal markings and suggest a novel evolutionary process of complex and camouflaged colorations by means of pattern blending.},

Here, we find that mature OLs in both AD patients and an AD mouse model undergo NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)–dependent Gasdermin D–associated inflammatory injury, concomitant with demyelination and axonal degeneration. The mature OL-specific knockdown of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1; a mitochondrial fission guanosine triphosphatase) abolishes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, corrects myelin loss, and improves cognitive ability in AD mice. Drp1 hyperactivation in mature OLs induces a glycolytic defect in AD models by inhibiting hexokinase 1 (HK1; a mitochondrial enzyme that initiates glycolysis), which triggers NLRP3-associated inflammation. These findings suggest that OL glycolytic deficiency plays a causal role in AD development. The Drp1-HK1-NLRP3 signaling axis may be a key mechanism and therapeutic target for white matter degeneration in AD.},

Here, we report that the adhesive microenvironment tunes the macrophage inflammatory response through the transcriptional coactivator YAP. We find that adhesion to soft hydrogels reduces inflammation when compared to adhesion on stiff materials and is associated with reduced YAP expression and nuclear localization. Substrate stiffness and cytoskeletal polymerization, but not adhesive confinement nor contractility, regulate YAP localization. Furthermore, depletion of YAP inhibits macrophage inflammation, whereas overexpression of active YAP increases inflammation. Last, we show in vivo that soft materials reduce expression of inflammatory markers and YAP in surrounding macrophages when compared to stiff materials. Together, our studies identify YAP as a key molecule for controlling inflammation and sensing stiffness in macrophages and may have broad implications in the regulation of macrophages in health and disease.},

To overcome this limitation, we propose to use generative models (GMs) to produce high-resolution synthetic radiographs that do not contain any personal identification information. Blinded analyses by CV and radiology experts confirmed the high similarity of synthesized and real radiographs. The combination of pooled GM improves the performance of CV algorithms trained on smaller datasets, and the integration of synthesized data into patient data repositories can compensate for underrepresented disease entities. By integrating federated learning strategies, even hospitals with few datasets can contribute to and benefit from GM training.},

CCT also controls the mitochondrial ultrastructure and the metabolic status of T cells, regulating the de novo synthesis of tubulin as well as posttranslational modifications (poly-glutamylation, acetylation, Δ1 and Δ2) of αβ-tubulin heterodimers, fine-tuning tubulin dynamics.

Adding data on 581 known anthropogenic extinctions to the extant global avifauna increases the number of species by 5\%, but quadruples the number of flightless species. The evolution of flightlessness in birds is a widespread phenomenon, occurring in more than half of bird orders and evolving independently at least 150 times. Thus, we estimate that this evolutionary transition occurred at a rate four times higher than it would appear based solely on extant species. Our analysis of preanthropogenic avian diversity shows how anthropogenic effects can conceal the frequency of major evolutionary transitions in life forms and highlights the fact that macroevolutionary studies with only small amounts of missing data can still be highly biased.},

Here, we report a high-precision dataset that reveals substantial variability in oceanic plates and provides further insights into the oceanic K cycle. Sixty-nine sediments worldwide yield a broad δ 41 K range from −1.3 to −0.02‰. The unusually low values are indicative of release of heavy K during continental weathering and uptake of light K during submarine diagenetic alteration. Twenty samples of altered western Pacific crust from ODP Site 801 display δ 41 K from −0.60 to −0.05‰, averaging at −0.32‰.

  abstract     = {In explaining extensive evidence for past liquid water, the debate on whether Mars was primarily warm and wet or cold and arid 4 billion years (Ga) ago has continued for decades. The Sun’s luminosity was ~30\% lower 4 Ga ago; thus, most martian climate models struggle to elevate the mean surface temperature past the melting point of water. Basal melting of ice sheets may help resolve that paradox. We modeled the thermophysical evolution of ice and estimate the geothermal heat flux required to produce meltwater on a cold, arid Mars. We then analyzed geophysical and geochemical data, showing that basal melting would have been feasible on Mars 4 Ga ago. If Mars were warm and wet 4 Ga ago, then the geothermal flux would have even sustained hydrothermal activity. Regardless of the actual nature of the ancient martian climate, the subsurface would have been the most habitable region on Mars.},

  abstract     = {Physiological methods have identified a number of signatures of temporal prediction, a core component of attention. While the underlying neural dynamics have been linked to activity within cortico-striatal networks, recent work has shown that the behavioral benefits of temporal prediction rely on the cerebellum. Here, we examine the involvement of the human cerebellum in the generation and/or temporal adjustment of anticipatory neural dynamics, measuring scalp electroencephalography in individuals with cerebellar degeneration. When the temporal prediction relied on an interval representation, duration-dependent adjustments were impaired in the cerebellar group compared to matched controls. This impairment was evident in ramping activity, beta-band power, and phase locking of delta-band activity. These same neural adjustments were preserved when the prediction relied on a rhythmic stream. Thus, the cerebellum has a context-specific causal role in the adjustment of anticipatory neural dynamics of temporal prediction, providing the requisite modulation to optimize behavior.},

To address this question, we conducted a spatiotemporally resolved analysis of CPC deployment dynamics, tracking cells expressing the pan-CPC gene Isl1 . Most CPCs undergo programmed silencing during early cardiogenesis through proteasome-mediated and PRC2 (Polycomb group repressive complex 2)–mediated Isl1 repression, selectively in the outflow tract. A notable exception is a domain of cardiac neural crest cells (CNCs) in the inflow tract. These “dorsal CNCs” are regulated through a Wnt/β-catenin/Isl1 feedback loop and generate a limited number of trabecular cardiomyocytes that undergo multiple clonal divisions during compaction, to eventually produce ~10\% of the biventricular myocardium. After birth, CNCs continue to generate cardiomyocytes that, however, exhibit diminished clonal amplification dynamics. Thus, although the postnatal heart sustains cardiomyocyte-producing CNCs, their regenerative potential is likely diminished by the loss of trabeculation-like proliferative properties.},

Patients with MDD were mainly characterized by increased abundance of the genus Bacteroides and decreased abundance of the genera Blautia and Eubacterium . These multilevel omics alterations generated a characteristic MDD coexpression network. Disturbed microbial genes and fecal metabolites were consistently mapped to amino acid (γ-aminobutyrate, phenylalanine, and tryptophan) metabolism. Furthermore, we identified a combinatorial marker panel that robustly discriminated MDD from HC individuals in both the discovery and validation sets.

We address this challenge by classifying 541 stations in the United States and Canada into 15 “hydro-regions, ” each with similar seasonal streamflow characteristics. Analysis of seasonal streamflow records at these stations from 1910 to present indicates regionally coherent changes in the frequency of extreme high- and low-flow events. Where changes are significant, these events have, on average, doubled in frequency relative to 1950 to 1969. In hydro-regions influenced by snowmelt runoff, extreme high-flow event frequency has increased despite snowpack depletion by warming winter temperatures. In drought-prone hydro-regions of the western United States and Southeast, extreme low-flow event frequency has increased, particularly during summer and fall. The magnitude and regional consistency of these hydrologic changes warrant attention by watershed stakeholders.

Within only three generations, groups of polarization-selected females showed a 15\% increase in polarization, coupled with increased cohesiveness, compared to fish from control lines. Although lines did not differ in their physical swimming ability or exploratory behavior, polarization-selected fish adopted faster speeds, particularly in social contexts, and showed stronger alignment and attraction responses to multiple neighbors.

Here, we study the molecular mechanism of selective nanomolar-affinity TRPV6 inhibition by (4-phenylcyclohexyl)piperazine derivatives (PCHPDs). We use x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy to solve the inhibitor-bound structures of TRPV6 and identify two types of inhibitor binding sites in the transmembrane region: (i) modulatory sites between the S1-S4 and pore domains normally occupied by lipids and (ii) the main site in the ion channel pore. Our structural data combined with mutagenesis, functional and computational approaches suggest that PCHPDs plug the open pore of TRPV6 and convert the channel into a nonconducting state, mimicking the action of calmodulin, which causes inactivation of TRPV6 channels under physiological conditions. This mechanism of inhibition explains the high selectivity and potency of PCHPDs and opens up unexplored avenues for the design of future-generation biomimetic drugs.},

Molecular engineering in transgenic mice recapitulated a gene duplication event, exon replacements, and altered expression patterns. These changes predictably modified the lymphopoietic characteristics of the thymus, identifying molecular features contributing to conversion of a primordial bipotent lymphoid organ to a tissue specializing in T cell development. The phylogenetic reconstruction associates increasing efficiency of T cell generation with diminishing B cell–generating capacity of the thymus during jawed vertebrate evolution.},

Elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying ion transport and selectivity in subnanometer pores is therefore imperative for the development of ion-selective membranes. Here, we compare the overall energy barrier for salt transport and energy barriers for individual ion transport, showing that cations and anions traverse the membrane pore in an independent manner. Supported by density functional theory simulations, we demonstrate that electrostatic interactions between permeating counterion and fixed charges on the membrane substantially hinder intrapore diffusion. Furthermore, using quartz crystal microbalance, we break down the contributions of partitioning at the pore mouth and intrapore diffusion to the overall energy barrier for salt transport. Overall, our results indicate that intrapore diffusion governs salt transport through subnanometer pores due to ion-pore wall interactions, providing the scientific base for the design of membranes with high ion-ion selectivity.},

Here, we show that the coupling angle between the magnetic moments of two ferromagnetic layers can be precisely controlled by inserting a specially designed magnetic metallic spacer layer between them. The coupling angle is controlled solely by the composition of the spacer layer. Moreover, the biquadratic coupling strength, responsible for noncollinear alignment, is larger than that of current materials.

Next, reinforcement learning is used to develop an optimized control policy to actuate morphing energy landscapes to produce defect-free crystals orders of magnitude faster than natural relaxation times. Morphing energy landscapes mechanistically enable rapid crystal repair via anisotropic stresses to control defect and shape relaxation without melting. This method is scalable for up to at least N = 10 3 particles with mean process times scaling as N 0.5 . Further scalability is possible by controlling parallel local energy landscapes (e.g., periodic landscapes) to generate large-scale global defect-free hierarchical structures.},

Our findings functionally buttress the now multiply-validated observation that a rare coding variant in PLCG2 is associated with a decreased risk of AD.

  abstract     = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is the largest global source of anthropogenic mercury emissions. However, little is known about how effectively mercury released from ASGM is converted into the bioavailable form of methylmercury in ASGM-altered landscapes. Through examination of ASGM-impacted river basins in Peru, we show that lake area in heavily mined watersheds has increased by 670\% between 1985 and 2018 and that lakes in this area convert mercury into methylmercury at net rates five to seven times greater than rivers. These results suggest that synergistic increases in lake area and mercury loading associated with ASGM are substantially increasing exposure risk for people and wildlife. Similarly, marked increases in lake area in other ASGM hot spots suggest that “hydroscape” (hydrological landscape) alteration is an important and previously unrecognized component of mercury risk from ASGM.},

However, the onshore aquifer at the island of Hawai‘i exhibits a notable volumetric discrepancy between high-elevation freshwater recharge and coastal discharge. In this study, we present a novel transport mechanism of freshwater moving from onshore to offshore through a multilayer formation of water-saturated layered basalts with interbedded low-permeability layers of ash/soil. Marine electromagnetic imaging reveals ∼35 km of laterally continuous resistive layers that extend to at least 4 km from west of Hawai‘i’s coastline, containing about 3.5 km 3 of freshened water. We propose that this newly found transport mechanism of fresh groundwater may be the governing mechanism in other volcanic islands. In such a scenario, volcanic islands worldwide can use these renewable offshore reservoirs, considered more resilient to climate change-driven droughts, as new water resources.},

High-precision satellite altimeters have collected sea level records for almost three decades, providing a massive database from which tiny, time-coherent signals can be extracted. Here, four third-degree tides are mapped: one diurnal, two semidiurnal, and one terdiurnal. Aside from practical benefits, such as improved tide prediction for geodesy and oceanography, the new maps reveal unique ways the ocean responds to a precisely known, but hitherto unexplored, force. An unexpected example involves the two semidiurnals, where the smaller lunar force is seen to generate the larger ocean tide, especially in the South Pacific. An explanation leads to new information about an ocean normal mode that spatially correlates with the third-degree astronomical potential. The maps also highlight previously unknown shelf resonances in all three tidal bands.},

We identify a trajectory linking hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with megakaryocytes and prospectively identify a previously unknown intermediate population that is overrepresented in the disease state. We also show that mutant CALR drives transformation primarily from the earliest stem cell compartment, with some contribution from megakaryocyte progenitors. Last, relative to wild-type HSCs, mutant CALR HSCs show increases in JAK-STAT signaling, the unfolded protein response, cell cycle, and a previously undescribed up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis.

Here, we establish the relationship between f O 2 and Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ in quenched liquids of silicate Earth-like composition at 2173 K and 1 bar. Mantle-derived rocks have Fe 3+ /(Fe 3+ +Fe 2+ ) = 0.037 ± 0.005, at which the magma ocean defines an f O 2 0.5 log units above the iron-wüstite buffer. At this f O 2 , the solubilities of H-C-N-O species in the magma ocean produce a CO-rich atmosphere. Cooling and condensation of H 2 O would have led to a prebiotic terrestrial atmosphere composed of CO 2 -N 2 , in proportions and at pressures akin to those observed on Venus. Present-day differences between Earth’s atmosphere and those of her planetary neighbors result from Earth’s heliocentric location and mass, which allowed geologically long-lived oceans, in-turn facilitating CO 2 drawdown and, eventually, the development of life.},

This complicates the prediction of tau spreading, which may become critical for defining individualized tau-PET readouts in clinical trials. Since tau is assumed to spread throughout connected regions, we used functional connectivity to improve tau spreading predictions over Braak staging methods. We included two samples with longitudinal tau-PET from controls and AD patients. Cross-sectionally, we found connectivity of tau epicenters (i.e., regions with earliest tau) to predict estimated tau spreading sequences. Longitudinally, we found tau accumulation rates to correlate with connectivity strength to patient-specific tau epicenters. A connectivity-based, patient-centered tau spreading model improved the assessment of tau accumulation rates compared to Braak stage–specific readouts and reduced sample sizes by ~40\% in simulated tau-targeting interventions. Thus, connectivity-based tau spreading models may show utility in clinical trials.},

The strongest manifolds are found to be linked to Jupiter and have a profound control on small bodies over a wide and previously unconsidered range of three-body energies. Orbits on these manifolds encounter Jupiter on rapid time scales, where they can be transformed into collisional or escaping trajectories, reaching Neptune’s distance in a mere decade.

This has especially been suggested for regulatory adaptations in the evolution of the human brain. We present a new method to detect positive selection on transcription factor binding sites on the basis of measuring predicted affinity change with a machine learning model of binding. Unlike other methods, this approach requires neither defining a priori neutral sites nor detecting accelerated evolution, thus removing major sources of bias. We scanned the signals of positive selection for CTCF binding sites in 29 human and 11 mouse tissues or cell types. We found that human brain–related cell types have the highest proportion of positive selection. This result is consistent with the view that adaptive evolution to gene regulation has played an important role in evolution of the human brain.},

After germination underground, buried seedlings have to dynamically adjust their growth to respond to mechanical stimulation from soil barriers. Here, we designed a lid touch assay and used atomic force microscopy to investigate the mechanical responses of seedlings during soil emergence. Touching seedlings induced increases in cell wall stiffness and decreases in cell elongation, which were correlated with pectin degradation. We revealed that PGX3 , which encodes a polygalacturonase, mediates touch-imposed alterations in the pectin matrix and the mechanics of morphogenesis. Furthermore, we found that ethylene signaling is activated by touch, and the transcription factor EIN3 directly associates with PGX3 promoter and is required for touch-repressed PGX3 expression. By uncovering the link between mechanical forces and cell wall remodeling established via the EIN3-PGX3 module, this work represents a key step in understanding the molecular framework of touch-induced morphological changes.},

We show that the AMOC state in the past decade is not distinctly different from that in the 1990s in the North Atlantic, with a remarkably stable partition of the subpolar overturning occurring prominently in the eastern basins rather than in the Labrador Sea. In contrast, profound hydrographic and oxygen changes, particularly in the subpolar North Atlantic, are observed over the same period, suggesting a much higher decoupling between the AMOC and ocean interior property fields than previously thought.},

We found that serotonin stimulation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is nearly as effective as that in the DRN for promoting waiting, while in the nucleus accumbens, it does not promote waiting. We also found that serotonin stimulation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) promotes waiting only when the timing of future rewards is uncertain.

We identify population structure in the host that reflects a Pleistocene split, whereas photosymbiont differences between reefs most likely reflect contemporary (Holocene) conditions. Signatures of selection in the host were associated with genes linked to diverse processes including osmotic regulation, skeletal development, and the establishment and maintenance of symbiosis.

  abstract     = {Resident macrophages are abundant in the bladder, playing key roles in immunity to uropathogens. Yet, whether they are heterogeneous, where they come from, and how they respond to infection remain largely unknown. We identified two macrophage subsets in mouse bladders, MacM in muscle and MacL in the lamina propria, each with distinct protein expression and transcriptomes. Using a urinary tract infection model, we validated our transcriptomic analyses, finding that MacM macrophages phagocytosed more bacteria and polarized to an anti-inflammatory profile, whereas MacL macrophages died rapidly during infection. During resolution, monocyte-derived cells contributed to tissue-resident macrophage pools and both subsets acquired transcriptional profiles distinct from naïve macrophages. Macrophage depletion resulted in the induction of a type 1–biased immune response to a second urinary tract infection, improving bacterial clearance. Our study uncovers the biology of resident macrophages and their responses to an exceedingly common infection in a largely overlooked organ, the bladder.},

  abstract     = {Obesity drives the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by hepatic steatosis. Several bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) except BMP9 were reported related to metabolic syndrome. This study demonstrates that liver cytokine BMP9 is decreased in the liver and serum of NAFLD model mice and patients. BMP9 knockdown induces lipid accumulation in Hepa 1-6 cells. BMP9–knockout mice exhibit hepatosteatosis due to down-regulated peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) expression and reduced fatty acid oxidation. In vitro, recombinant BMP9 treatment attenuates triglyceride accumulation by enhancing PPARα promoter activity via the activation of p-smad. PPARα-specific antagonist GW6471 abolishes the effect of BMP9 knockdown. Furthermore, adeno-associated virus–mediated BMP9 overexpression in mouse liver markedly relieves liver steatosis and obesity-related metabolic syndrome. These findings indicate that BMP9 plays a critical role in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism in a PPARα-dependent manner and may provide a previously unknown insight into NAFLD therapeutic approaches.},

While restoration of microcapillaries is critical to avoid mortality, therapeutic targeting of this process requires a greater understanding of endothelial repair mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that lung endothelium possesses substantial regenerative capacity and lineage tracing reveals that native endothelium is the source of vascular repair after influenza injury. Ablation of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter–transcription factor 2 (COUP-TF2) (Nr2f2), a transcription factor implicated in developmental angiogenesis, reduced endothelial proliferation, exacerbating viral lung injury in vivo. In vitro, COUP-TF2 regulates proliferation and migration through activation of cyclin D1 and neuropilin 1. Upon influenza injury, nuclear factor κB suppresses COUP-TF2, but surviving endothelial cells ultimately reestablish vascular homeostasis dependent on restoration of COUP-TF2. Therefore, stabilization of COUP-TF2 may represent a therapeutic strategy to enhance recovery from pathogens, including H1N1 influenza and SARS-CoV-2.},

Although transport across BECs is of paramount importance for nutrient uptake as well as ridding the brain of waste products, the intracellular sorting mechanisms that regulate successful receptor-mediated transcytosis in BECs remain to be elucidated. Here, we used a synthetic multivalent system with tunable avidity to the low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein 1 (LRP1) to investigate the mechanisms of transport across BECs. We used a combination of conventional and super-resolution microscopy, both in vivo and in vitro, accompanied with biophysical modeling of transport kinetics and membrane-bound interactions to elucidate the role of membrane-sculpting protein syndapin-2 on fast transport via tubule formation. We show that high-avidity cargo biases the LRP1 toward internalization associated with fast degradation, while mid-avidity augments the formation of syndapin-2 tubular carriers promoting a fast shuttling across.},

A group of genes identified in our screens encode enzymes for the biosynthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is not involved in tumor response to T cell – mediated cytotoxicity. Another gene identified in the screens was PBRM1 , which encodes a subunit of the PBAF form of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. PBRM1 mutations in tumor cells cause resistance to MHC-unrestricted killing, in contrast to their sensitizing effects on T cell – mediated killing. PBRM1 and the GPI biosynthetic pathway regulate the ligands of NK cell receptors in tumor cells and promote cytolytic granule secretion in CLs.

Efforts to achieve spatially controlled bone formation using BMPs are being made. We demonstrate that a carrier consisting of a powder of calcium sulfate/hydroxyapatite (CaS/HA) mixed with bone active molecules provides an efficient drug delivery platform for critical femoral defect healing in rats. The bone-active molecules were composed of osteoinductive rhBMP-2 and the bisphosphonate, and zoledronic acid (ZA) was chosen to overcome BMP-2–induced bone resorption. It was demonstrated that delivery of rhBMP-2 was necessary for critical defect healing and restoration of mechanical properties, but codelivery of BMP-2 and ZA led to denser and stronger fracture calluses. Together, the CaS/HA biomaterial with rhBMP-2 and/or ZA can potentially be used as an off-the-shelf alternative to autograft bone.},

The function of fibulin-4 in ECM assembly, however, remains elusive. Here, we show that fibulin-4 is required for the activity of lysyl oxidase (LOX), a copper-containing enzyme that catalyzes the covalent cross-linking of elastin and collagen. LOX produced by Fbln4 −/− cells had lower activity than LOX produced by wild-type cells due to the absence of lysine tyrosyl quinone (LTQ), a unique cofactor required for LOX activity. Our studies showed that fibulin-4 is required for copper ion transfer from the copper transporter ATP7A to LOX in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), which is a necessary step for LTQ formation. These results uncover a pivotal role for fibulin-4 in the activation of LOX and, hence, in ECM assembly.},

Through direct observation with high spatial and temporal resolution, using laser scanning confocal microscopy and in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), we observe that early-stage attachment of NPs to the interface is diffusion limited and with increasing areal density of the NPSs, further attachment requires cooperative displacement of the previously assembled NPSs both laterally and vertically.

Overexpression of OsDjA9 or knockout of OsDRP1E in transgenic rice, in contrast, leads to elongated mitochondria and enhanced resistance to M. oryzae . Our study therefore reveals a previously unidentified pathogen-infection strategy in which the pathogen delivers an effector into plant cells to target an HSP40-DRP complex; the targeting leads to the perturbation of mitochondrial dynamics, thereby inhibiting mitochondria-mediated plant immunity.},

We demonstrate that IGF2 exhibits dual and opposing roles in controlling inflammatory phenotypes in macrophages by regulating glucose metabolism, relying on the dominant activation of the IGF2 receptor (IGF2R) by low-dose IGF2 (L-IGF2) and IGF1R by high-dose IGF2. IGF2R activation leads to proton rechanneling to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and enables sustained oxidative phosphorylation. Mechanistically, L-IGF2 induces nucleus translocation of IGF2R that promotes Dnmt3a-mediated DNA methylation by activating GSK3α/β and subsequently impairs expression of vacuolar-type H + -ATPase (v-ATPase). This sequestrated assembly of v-ATPase inhibits the channeling of protons to lysosomes and leads to their rechanneling to mitochondria. An IGF2R-specific IGF2 mutant induces only the anti-inflammatory response and inhibits colitis progression. Together, our findings highlight a previously unidentified role of IGF2R activation in dictating anti-inflammatory macrophages.},

  abstract     = {The immune and circulatory systems of mammals are functionally integrated, as exemplified by the immune function of the spleen and lymph nodes. Similar functional integration exists in the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae , as exemplified by the infection-induced aggregation of hemocytes around the heart valves. Whether this is specific to mosquitoes or a general characteristic of insects remained unknown. We analyzed 68 species from 51 families representing 16 orders and found that infection induces the aggregation of hemocytes and pathogens on the heart of insects from all major branches of the class Insecta. An expanded analysis in the holometabolous mosquito, Aedes aegypti , and the hemimetabolous bed bug, Cimex lectularius , showed that infection induces the aggregation of phagocytic hemocytes on the hearts of distantly related insects, with aggregations mirroring the patterns of hemolymph flow. Therefore, the functional integration of the immune and circulatory systems is conserved across the insect tree of life.},

  abstract     = {The quest to understand, design, and synthesize new forms of quantum matter guides much of contemporary research in condensed matter physics. One-dimensional (1D) electronic systems form the basis for some of the most interesting and exotic phases of quantum matter. Here, we describe a family of quasi-1D nanostructures, based on LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 electron waveguides, in which a sinusoidal transverse spatial modulation is imposed. These devices display unique dispersive features in the subband spectra, namely, a sizeable shift (∼7 T) in the spin-dependent subband minima, and fractional conductance plateaus. The first property can be understood as an engineered spin-orbit interaction associated with the periodic acceleration of electrons as they undulate through the nanowire (ballistically), while the second property signifies the presence of enhanced electron-electron scattering in this system. The ability to engineer these interactions in quantum wires contributes to the tool set of a 1D solid-state quantum simulation platform.},

Dominants can exclusively benefit from monopolizing food resources and, therefore, induce an intragroup conflict when leading their group to these resources. We demonstrate that shared decision-making reduces such conflicts by studying movement initiations of wild vulturine guineafowl, a species that forms large, stable social groups with a steep dominance hierarchy. When dominant individuals displace subordinates from monopolizable food patches, the excluded subordinates subsequently initiate collective movement. The dominants then abandon the patch to follow the direction of subordinates, contrasting with nonmonopolizable resources where no individuals are excluded, and dominant individuals contribute extensively to group decisions. Our results demonstrate the role of shared decision-making in maintaining the balance of influence within animal societies.},

By conducting a systematic analysis of germline genomes of 9712 cancer patients representing 22 common cancer types along with 16, 670 noncancer individuals, we identified seven cancer-associated germline genomic patterns (CGGPs), which summarized trinucleotide mutational spectra of germline genomes. A few CGGPs were consistently enriched in the germline genomes of patients whose tumors had smoking signatures or correlated with oncogenesis- and genome instability–related mutations. Furthermore, subgroups defined by the CGGPs were significantly associated with distinct oncogenic pathways, tumor histological subtypes, and prognosis in 13 common cancer types, suggesting that germline genomic patterns enable to inform treatment and clinical outcomes. These results provided evidence that cancer risk and clinical outcomes could be encoded in germline genomes.},

We enhance the seismological catalog of the Dead Sea Fault Zone by including a 220, 000-year-long continuous large earthquake record based on seismites from the Dead Sea center. We constrain seismic shaking intensities via computational fluid dynamics modeling and invert them for earthquake magnitude. Our analysis shows that the recurrence time of large earthquakes follows a power-law distribution, with a mean of 1400 ± 160 years. This mean recurrence is notable shorter than the previous estimate of 11, 000 years for the past 40, 000 years.

This elegant design enables in situ stiffness switching in lightweight and space-saving applications, as demonstrated through three robotic-related components. Under a uniform load, the curved origami can provide universal gripping, controlled force transmissibility, and multistage stiffness response. This work illustrates an unexplored and unprecedented capability of curved origami, which opens new applications in robotics for this particular family of origami patterns.},

Increased osmolality (hypertonicity) causes outflow of water and loss of turgor and is dangerous if the cell is not capable of rapidly restoring its volume. The osmoregulatory adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette transporter OpuA restores the cell volume by accumulating large amounts of compatible solute. OpuA is gated by ionic strength and inhibited by the second messenger cyclic-di-AMP, a molecule recently shown to affect many cellular processes. Despite the master regulatory role of cyclic-di-AMP, structural and functional insights into how the second messenger regulates (transport) proteins on the molecular level are lacking. Here, we present high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures of OpuA and in vitro activity assays that show how the osmoregulator OpuA is activated by high ionic strength and how cyclic-di-AMP acts as a backstop to prevent unbridled uptake of compatible solutes.},

The Rayleigh-Taylor instability that arises when a dense fluid sinks into and displaces a lighter one is particularly difficult to arrest. By preparing a density inversion between two miscible fluids inside the thin gap separating two flat plates, we create a clean initial stationary interface. Under these conditions, we find that the instability is suppressed below a critical plate spacing. With increasing spacing, the system transitions from the limit of stability where mass diffusion dominates over buoyant forces, through a regime where the gap sets the wavelength of the instability, to the unconfined regime governed by the competition between buoyancy and momentum diffusion. Our study, including experiment, simulation, and linear stability analysis, characterizes all three regimes of confinement and opens new routes for controlling mixing processes.},

Yet the reversed high latitude–to–Walker circulation teleconnection is not fully understood. Here, we reveal the dynamical pathways of this teleconnection across different components of the climate system using a hierarchy of climate model simulations. In the fully coupled system with ocean circulation adjustments, the Walker circulation strengthens in response to extratropical radiative cooling of either hemisphere, associated with the upwelling of colder subsurface water in the eastern equatorial Pacific. By contrast, in the absence of ocean circulation adjustments, the Walker circulation response is sensitive to the forcing hemisphere, due to the blocking effect of the northward-displaced climatological intertropical convergence zone and shortwave cloud radiative effects. Our study implies that energy biases in the extratropics can cause pronounced changes of tropical climate patterns.},

However, molecular mechanisms of cap-independent translation of synaptic mRNAs remain largely unknown. Here, we show that GluA1 mRNA contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5′UTR. We also demonstrate that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 interacts with GluA1 mRNA and mediates internal initiation of GluA1 . Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stimulation increases IRES-mediated GluA1 translation via up-regulation of HNRNP A2/B1. Moreover, BDNF-induced GluA1 expression and dendritic spine density were significantly decreased in neurons lacking hnRNP A2/B1.

Here, we identified two distinct microglial populations in adult zebrafish that differ in morphology, distribution, development, and function.

The other white matter–enriched ccl34b.1 − population, regulatory microglia, has ramified protrusions but has limited mobility and phagocytosis capability. These functional differences are further supported by distinct transcriptomes and responses to bacterial infection, where ccl34b.1 + microglia function in tissue clearance and ccl34b.1 − microglia release immune regulators.

  abstract     = {Biodiversity is essential for the maintenance of ecosystem health and delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, the drivers of biodiversity loss and the spatial variation in their impacts are poorly understood. Here, we explore the spatial-temporal distributions of threatened and declining (“biodiversity-loss”) species and find that these species are affected by multiple stressors, with climate and human activities being the fundamental shaping forces. There has been large spatial variation in the distribution of threatened species over China’s provinces, with the biodiversity of Gansu, Guangdong, Hainan, and Shaanxi provinces severely reduced. With increasing urbanization and industrialization, the expansion of construction and worsening pollution has led to habitat retreat or degradation, and high proportions of amphibians, mammals, and reptiles are threatened. Because distributions of species and stressors vary widely across different climate zones and geographical areas, specific policies and measures are needed for preventing biodiversity loss in different regions.},

  abstract     = {The adaptor proteins, STING and MAVS, are components of critical pathogen-sensing pathways that induce innate immunity. Phosphorylation of either adaptor results in activation of the type I interferon pathway. How this phosphorylation is regulated and how it is manipulated by pathogens remain largely unknown. Here, we identified host protein phosphatase, Mg 2+ /Mn 2+ dependent 1G (PPM1G) as a negative regulator of innate immune pathways and showed that this host system is hijacked by Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Mechanistically, KSHV tegument protein ORF33 interacts with STING/MAVS and enhances recruitment of PPM1G to dephosphorylate p-STING/p-MAVS for immunosuppression. Inhibition of PPM1G expression improves the antiviral response against both DNA and RNA viruses. Collectively, our study shows that PPM1G restricts both cytosolic DNA– and RNA–sensing pathways to naturally balance the intensity of the antiviral response. Manipulation of PPM1G by KSHV provides an important strategy for immune evasion.},

Historically, these have been made as continuous, monolithic structures with additive manufacturing, which affords high resolution and throughput, but is inherently limited by process and machine constraints. To address this issue, we present a construction system for mechanical metamaterials based on discrete assembly of a finite set of parts, which can be spatially composed for a range of properties such as rigidity, compliance, chirality, and auxetic behavior. This system achieves desired continuum properties through design of the parts such that global behavior is governed by local mechanisms. We describe the design methodology, production process, numerical modeling, and experimental characterization of metamaterial behaviors. This approach benefits from incremental assembly, which eliminates scale limitations, best-practice manufacturing for reliable, low-cost part production, and interchangeability through a consistent assembly process across part types.},

Where looming is first detected and how critical parameters of predatory approaches are extracted are unclear. In mice, we identify a retinal interneuron (the VG3 amacrine cell) that responds robustly to looming, but not to related forms of motion. Looming-sensitive calcium transients are restricted to a specific layer of the VG3 dendrite arbor, which provides glutamatergic input to two ganglion cells (W3 and OFFα). These projection neurons combine shared excitation with dissimilar inhibition to signal approach onset and speed, respectively. Removal of VG3 amacrine cells reduces the excitation of W3 and OFFα ganglion cells and diminishes defensive responses of mice to looming without affecting other visual behaviors. Thus, the dendrites of a retinal interneuron detect visual threats, divergent circuits downstream extract critical threat parameters, and these retinal computations initiate an innate survival behavior.},

A single intracerebral injection of CRISPR-LNPs against PLK1 (sgPLK1-cLNPs) into aggressive orthotopic glioblastoma enabled up to ~70\% gene editing in vivo, which caused tumor cell apoptosis, inhibited tumor growth by 50\%, and improved survival by 30\%.

Intraperitoneal injections of EGFR-targeted sgPLK1-cLNPs caused their selective uptake into disseminated ovarian tumors, enabled up to ~80\% gene editing in vivo, inhibited tumor growth, and increased survival by 80\%.

Here, we demonstrate that pump-probe electron diffraction with all-optically compressed electron pulses can capture dynamic electromagnetic potentials in a nanophotonic material with sub-light-cycle time resolution via centrosymmetry-violating Bragg spot dynamics. The origin of this effect is a sizable quantum mechanical phase shift that the electron de Broglie wave obtains from the oscillating electromagnetic potentials within less than 1 fs. Coherent electron imaging and scattering can therefore reveal the electromagnetic foundations of light-matter interaction on the level of the cycles of light.},

The SSEs exhibit a dense, uniform structure and a superior ionic conductivity of up to 1 mS/cm. Furthermore, the fabrication time from precursor to final product is typically ~5 min, 10 to 100 times faster than conventional SSE syntheses. This printing and rapid sintering process also allows the layer-by-layer fabrication of multilayer structures without cross-contamination. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a printed solid-state battery with conformal interfaces and excellent cycling stability.

However, because moraine chronologies are characteristically discontinuous, Holocene glacier fluctuations and their climatic drivers remain ambiguous, and future glacier changes are uncertain. Here, we construct a continuous 10-thousand-year (ka) record of glacier activity in the Teton Range, Wyoming, using glacial and environmental indicators in alpine lake sediments. We show that Teton glaciers persisted in some form through early Holocene warmth, likely as small debris-covered glaciers or rock glaciers. Subsequent Neoglacial ice expansion began ~6.3 ka, with two prominent glacier maxima at ~2.8 and 0.1 ka that were separated by a multicentennial phase of ice retreat. Comparison with regional paleoclimate records suggests that glacier activity was dominantly controlled by winter precipitation variability superposed on long-term Holocene temperature trends, offering key insights into western U.S. glacier resilience and vulnerability to future warming.},

Simulated treatment with remdesivir, selinexor, neutralizing antibodies, or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that rapid viral elimination is possible if in vivo potency is sufficiently high. Therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when symptoms develop may decrease shedding duration and immune response intensity but have little effect on viral area under the curve (AUC), which is driven by high early viral loads. Potent therapy dosed before viral peak during presymptomatic infection could lower AUC. Drug resistance may emerge with a moderately potent agent dosed before viral peak. Our results support early treatment for COVID-19 if shedding duration, not AUC, is most predictive of clinical severity.},

In temporal lobe epilepsy, areas of atrophy colocalized with highly interconnected cortical hub regions, whereas idiopathic generalized epilepsy showed preferential subcortical hub involvement. These morphological abnormalities were anchored to the connectivity profiles of distinct disease epicenters, pointing to temporo-limbic cortices in temporal lobe epilepsy and fronto-central cortices in idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Negative effects of age on atrophy further revealed a strong influence of connectome architecture in temporal lobe, but not idiopathic generalized, epilepsy. Our findings were reproduced across individual sites and single patients and were robust across different analytical methods.

Airway dehydration and impaired mucociliary clearance in CF is proposed to result in tonic epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity, which drives amiloride-sensitive electrogenic sodium absorption. Decreasing sodium absorption by inhibiting ENaC can reverse airway surface liquid dehydration. Here, we inhibit endogenous heterotrimeric ENaC channels by introducing inactivating mutant ENaC α mRNA (α mut ENaC). Lipid nanoparticles carrying α mut ENaC were transfected in CF-based airway cells in vitro and in vivo. We observed a significant decrease in macroscopic as well as amiloride-sensitive ENaC currents and an increase in airway surface liquid height in CF airway cells. Similarly, intranasal transfection of α mut ENaC mRNA decreased amiloride-sensitive nasal potential difference in CFTR KO mice. These data suggest that mRNA-based ENaC inhibition is a powerful strategy for reducing mucus dehydration and has therapeutic potential for treating CF in all patients, independent of genotype.},

Typically, the electrical conductivity would increase monotonically with decreasing twist angle owing to the enhanced coupling between adjacent layers. Here, we report a nonmonotonic angle-dependent vertical conductivity across the interface of bilayer graphene with low twist angles. More specifically, the vertical conductivity enhances gradually with decreasing twist angle up to a crossover angle at θ c ≈ 5°, and then it drops notably upon further decrease in the twist angle. Revealed by density functional theory calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy, the abnormal behavior is attributed to the unusual reduction in average carrier density originating from local atomic reconstruction. The impact of atomic reconstruction on vertical conductivity is unique for low-angle twisted 2D van der Waals materials and provides a strategy for designing and optimizing their electronic performance.},

  abstract     = {Motoneurons of neonatal rodents show synchronous activity that modulates the development of the neuromuscular system. However, the characteristics of the activity of human neonatal motoneurons are largely unknown. Using a noninvasive neural interface, we identified the discharge timings of individual spinal motoneurons in human newborns. We found highly synchronized activities of motoneurons of the tibialis anterior muscle, which were associated with fast leg movements. Although neonates’ motor units exhibited discharge rates similar to those of adults, their synchronization was significantly greater than in adults. Moreover, neonatal motor units showed coherent oscillations in the delta band, which is directly translated into force generation. These results suggest that motoneuron synchronization in human neonates might be an important mechanism for controlling fast limb movements, such as those of primitive reflexes. In addition to help revealing mechanisms of development, the proposed neural interface might monitor children at risk of developing motor disorders.},

While genetic variability between different iPSC lines affects differentiation potential, how this variability in somatic cells affects pluripotent potential is less understood. We generated and compared transcriptomic data from 72 dermal fibroblast–iPSC pairs with consistent variation in reprogramming efficiency. By considering equal numbers of samples from self-reported African Americans and White Americans, we identified both ancestry-dependent and ancestry-independent transcripts associated with reprogramming efficiency, suggesting that transcriptomic heterogeneity can substantially affect reprogramming. Moreover, reprogramming efficiency–associated genes are involved in diverse dynamic biological processes, including cancer and wound healing, and are predictive of 5-year breast cancer survival in an independent cohort. Candidate genes may provide insight into mechanisms of ancestry-dependent regulation of cell fate transitions and motivate additional studies for improvement of reprogramming.},

  abstract     = {Terrestrial hydrothermal systems have been proposed as alternative birthplaces for early life but lacked reasonable scenarios for the supply of biomolecules. Here, we show that elemental sulfur (S 0 ), as the dominant mineral in terrestrial hot springs, can reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into formic acid (HCOOH) under ultraviolet (UV) light below 280 nm. The semiconducting S 0 is indicated to have a direct bandgap of 4.4 eV. The UV-excited S 0 produces photoelectrons with a highly negative potential of −2.34 V (versus NHE, pH 7), which could reduce CO 2 after accepting electrons from electron donors such as reducing sulfur species. Simultaneously, UV light breaks sulfur bonds, benefiting the adsorption of charged carbonates onto S 0 and assisting their photoreduction. Assuming that terrestrial hot springs covered 1\% of primitive Earth’s surface, S 0 at 10 μM could have produced maximal 10 9 kg/year HCOOH within 10-cm-thick photic zones, underlying its remarkable contributions to the accumulation of prebiotic biomolecules.},

Recent studies revealed that apoptotic caspase-8 directly cleaves GSDMD to trigger pyroptosis. However, the molecular requirements for caspase-8–dependent GSDMD cleavage and the physiological impact of this signaling axis are unresolved. Here, we report that caspase-8–dependent GSDMD cleavage confers susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–induced lethality independently of caspase-1 and that GSDMD activation provides host defense against Yersinia infection. We further demonstrate that GSDMD inactivation by apoptotic caspases at aspartate 88 (D88) suppresses TNF-induced lethality but promotes anti- Yersinia defense. Last, we show that caspase-8 dimerization and autoprocessing are required for GSDMD cleavage, and provide evidence that the caspase-8 autoprocessing and activity on various complexes correlate with its ability to directly cleave GSDMD. These findings reveal GSDMD as a potential therapeutic target to reduce inflammation associated with mutations in the death receptor signaling machinery.},

Unfortunately, typical two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures do not mimic in vivo conditions, displaying a markedly lowered zinc content, while 3D culture systems are laborious and expensive. Therefore, we developed the Disque Platform (DP)—a high-fidelity culture system where stem cell–derived β cells are reaggregated into thin, 3D discs within 2D 96-well plates. We validated the DP against standard 2D and 3D cultures and interrogated our zinc-activated prodrugs, which release their cargo upon zinc chelation—so preferentially in β cells. Through developing a reliable screening platform that bridges the advantages of 2D and 3D culture systems, we identified an effective hit that exhibits 2.4-fold increase in β cell proliferation compared to harmine.},

By contrast, social connections of counties with less-educated populations, a higher Trump vote share, and a higher fraction of climate change deniers show decreased compliance with mobility restrictions.

Through direct transmission electron microscopy observations at the atomic scale, the structures close to the brittle crack tip zones are clearly revealed. Notably, the lattice reconstructions initiated at the postcrack edges can impose additional strain on the crack tips, modifying the fracture toughness of this material. Moreover, the monatomic thickness allows the restacking of postcrack edges in the shear strain–dominated cracks, which is potentially useful for the rational design of 2D stacking contacts in atomic width. Our studies provide critical insights into the atomistic processes of fracture and unveil the origin of the brittleness in the 2D materials.},

A proof-of-concept prototype sensor, compatible with a 19-gauge hollow-needle commercially available for EUS-FNA, was constructed using microsized optoelectronic chips and microfabrication techniques to perform multisite tissue optical sensing. In our bench-top verification and pilot validation during surgery on freshly excised human pancreatic tissues (four patients), the fabricated sensors showed a comparable performance to our previous fiber-based system.

These results can be largely explained by changes in canopy properties, specifically, new leaves flushed during the dry season have higher photosynthetic capacity than the leaves they replace, compensating for the negative stomatal response to increased dryness. As atmospheric dryness will increase with climate change, our study highlights the importance of reframing how we represent the response of ecosystem photosynthesis to atmospheric dryness in very wet regions, to accurately quantify the land carbon sink.},

LPL expression is regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/specific protein 1 axis in response to receptor activator of nuclear factor–κB ligand. Furthermore, we identified an LPL inhibitor, oroxylin A, that could maintain bone mass in ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis and accelerate bone fracture healing in mice.

It is intriguing but unclear how the soft and polar lattice redefines excitons in layered perovskites. Here, we reveal the intrinsic exciton properties by investigating exciton spin dynamics, which provides a sensitive probe to exciton coulomb interactions. Compared to transition metal dichalcogenides with comparable exciton binding energy, we observe orders of magnitude smaller exciton-exciton interaction and, counterintuitively, longer exciton spin lifetime at higher temperature. The anomalous spin dynamics implies that excitons exist as exciton polarons with substantially weakened inter- and intra-excitonic interactions by dynamic polaronic screening. The combination of strong light matter interaction from reduced dielectric screening and weakened inter-/intra-exciton interaction from dynamic polaronic screening explains their exceptional performance and provides new rules for quantum-confined optoelectronic and spintronic systems.},

Other than focusing on regulating interactions between DC and antigens, we intend to promote cell interactions between DC and T cell by cell surface engineering. T cell activation is greatly improved and generates higher tumor toxicity with the aid of the synthetic glycopolymer modified on the DC surface, although the glycopolymer alone shows no effect. The great promotion of DC–T cell attraction is revealed by cell image tracking in terms of both frequency and duration of contacts. Our findings provide a new method of T cell activation by these engineered “sweet DCs.” This strategy is beneficial for developing more efficient DC-based vaccines.},

  abstract     = {Atmospheric aerosol particles are commonly complex, aqueous organic-inorganic mixtures, and accurately predicting the properties of these particles is essential for air quality and climate projections. The prevailing assumption is that aqueous organic-inorganic aerosols exist predominately with liquid properties and that the hygroscopic inorganic fraction lowers aerosol viscosity relative to the organic fraction alone. Here, in contrast to those assumptions, we demonstrate that increasing inorganic fraction can increase aerosol viscosity (relative to predictions) and enable a humidity-dependent gel phase transition through cooperative ion-molecule interactions that give rise to long-range networks of atmospherically relevant low-mass oxygenated organic molecules (180 to 310 Da) and divalent inorganic ions. This supramolecular, ion-molecule effect can drastically influence the phase and physical properties of organic-inorganic aerosol and suggests that aerosol may be (semi)solid under more conditions than currently predicted. These observations, thus, have implications for air quality and climate that are not fully represented in atmospheric models.},

We measured the corresponding reflection spectra for the SiO 2 /Si material and compared them with the PL spectra. We observed PL spectral splitting and regarded it as strong coupling between colloidal quantum dots and the SiO 2 /Si material. Upper polaritons and lower polaritons exhibited anticrossing behavior. We observed Rabi splitting from single-photon emission in the dielectric cavity at room temperature.

The percentage of women who took part in competitions was nearly triple, and that of high-ability women double, with focal random selection compared to selection in pure performance competitions. In contrast, the behavior of men remained largely unchanged.

Here, we quantify the biophysical impacts of Earth greening on LST from 2000 to 2014 and disentangle the contributions of different factors using a physically based attribution model. We find that 93\% of the global vegetated area shows negative sensitivity of LST to LAI increase at the annual scale, especially for semiarid woody vegetation. Further considering the LAI trends ( P ≤ 0.1), 30\% of the global vegetated area is cooled by these trends and 5\% is warmed. Aerodynamic resistance is the dominant factor in controlling Earth greening’s biophysical impacts: The increase in LAI produces a decrease in aerodynamic resistance, thereby favoring increased turbulent heat transfer between the land and the atmosphere, especially latent heat flux.},

We combined all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, fluorescence spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography to study Na + :substrate coupling in the EAAT homolog Glt Ph . A lipidic cubic phase x-ray crystal structure of wild-type, Na + -only bound Glt Ph at 2.5-Å resolution revealed the fully open, outward-facing state primed for subsequent substrate binding. Simulations and kinetic experiments established that only the binding of two Na + ions to the Na1 and Na3 sites ensures complete HP2 gate opening via a conformational selection-like mechanism and enables high-affinity substrate binding via electrostatic attraction. The combination of Na + -stabilized gate opening and electrostatic coupling of aspartate to Na + binding provides a constant Na + :substrate transport stoichiometry over a broad range of neurotransmitter concentrations.},

Although relatively clean (as opposed to municipal wastes) and of near-constant composition, no commercially practiced technologies exist to fully deconstruct postindustrial multilayer film wastes into pure, recyclable polymers. Here, we demonstrate a unique strategy we call solvent-targeted recovery and precipitation (STRAP) to deconstruct multilayer films into their constituent resins using a series of solvent washes that are guided by thermodynamic calculations of polymer solubility. We show that the STRAP process is able to separate three representative polymers (polyethylene, ethylene vinyl alcohol, and polyethylene terephthalate) from a commercially available multilayer film with nearly 100\% material efficiency, affording recyclable resins that are cost-competitive with the corresponding virgin materials.},

Here, we report a detailed mechanistic study of hydroxyapatite (HA) mineralization pathways in an artificial saliva solution via in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is found that the mineralization of HA starts by forming ion-rich and ion-poor solutions in the saliva solution, followed by coexistence of the classical and nonclassical nucleation processes. For the nonclassical path, amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) functions as the substrate for HA nucleation on the ACP surface, while the classical path features direct HA nucleation from the solution. The growth of HA crystals on the surface of ACP is accompanied by the ACP dissolution process. The discoveries reported in this work are important to understand the physiological and pathological formation of HA minerals, as well as to engineer the biomineralization process for bone healing and hard tissue repairs.},

We realize this approach using a dense layer of electronic sensor spins in a diamond chip, which combines the ability to detect small magnetic fields with a sensitivity to their polarization. Focusing on a thin-film magnetic insulator, we quantify spin-wave amplitudes, visualize spin-wave dispersion and interference, and demonstrate time-domain measurements of spin-wave packets. We theoretically explain the observed anisotropic spin-wave patterns in terms of chiral spin-wave excitation and stray-field coupling to the sensor spins.

  abstract     = {Approximately one-third of the Earth’s photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation occurs in a pyrenoid, an organelle containing the CO 2 -fixing enzyme Rubisco. How constituent proteins are recruited to the pyrenoid and how the organelle’s subcompartments—membrane tubules, a surrounding phase-separated Rubisco matrix, and a peripheral starch sheath—are held together is unknown. Using the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , we found that pyrenoid proteins share a sequence motif. We show that the motif is necessary and sufficient to target proteins to the pyrenoid and that the motif binds to Rubisco, suggesting a mechanism for targeting. The presence of the Rubisco-binding motif on proteins that localize to the tubules and on proteins that localize to the matrix–starch sheath interface suggests that the motif holds the pyrenoid’s three subcompartments together. Our findings advance our understanding of pyrenoid biogenesis and illustrate how a single protein motif can underlie the architecture of a complex multilayered phase-separated organelle.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite oxides exhibit a rich variety of structural phases hosting different physical phenomena that generate multiple technological applications. We find that topological phonons—nodal rings, nodal lines, and Weyl points—are ubiquitous in oxide perovskites in terms of structures (tetragonal, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral), compounds (BaTiO 3 , PbTiO 3 , and SrTiO 3 ), and external conditions (photoexcitation, strain, and temperature). In particular, in the tetragonal phase of these compounds, all types of topological phonons can simultaneously emerge when stabilized by photoexcitation, whereas the tetragonal phase stabilized by thermal fluctuations only hosts a more limited set of topological phonon states. In addition, we find that the photoexcited carrier concentration can be used to tune the topological phonon states and induce topological transitions even without associated structural phase changes. Overall, we propose oxide perovskites as a versatile platform in which to study topological phonons and their manipulation with light.},

These conductance effects arise from nanobubbles inducing surface-governed ion transport through interfacial electrolyte films residing between nanobubble surfaces and nanopipette walls. The nanobubbles investigated here are mechanically generated, made metastable by surface pinning, and verified with cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.

In animals fed high sugar, the binding of PRC2.1 to the chromatin of the sweet gustatory neurons is redistributed to repress a developmental transcriptional network that modulates the responsiveness of these cells to sweet stimuli, reducing sweet sensation. Half of these transcriptional changes persist despite returning the animals to a control diet, causing a permanent decrease in sweet taste.

Here, we introduce a design concept that enables the three-dimensional (3D) printing of super-soft and solvent-free bottlebrush elastomers at room temperature. The key advance is a class of inks comprising statistical bottlebrush polymers that self-assemble into well-ordered body-centered cubic sphere phases. These soft solids undergo sharp and reversible yielding at 20°C in response to shear with a yield stress that can be tuned by manipulating the length scale of microphase separation. The addition of a soluble photocrosslinker allows complete ultraviolet curing after extrusion to form super-soft elastomers with near-perfect recoverable elasticity well beyond the yield strain. These structure–property design rules create exciting opportunities to tailor the performance of 3D-printed elastomers in ways that are not possible with current materials and processes.},

  abstract     = {The role of proteomic instability in cancer, particularly amyloidogenesis, remains obscure. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) transcriptionally governs the proteotoxic stress response to suppress proteomic instability and enhance survival. Paradoxically, HSF1 promotes oncogenesis. Here, we report that AKT activates HSF1 via Ser 230 phosphorylation. In vivo, HSF1 enables megalencephaly and hepatomegaly, which are driven by hyperactive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling. Hsf1 deficiency exacerbates amyloidogenesis and elicits apoptosis, thereby countering tissue overgrowth. Unexpectedly, HSF1 physically neutralizes soluble amyloid oligomers (AOs). Beyond impeding amyloidogenesis, HSF1 shields HSP60 from direct assault by AOs, averting HSP60 destabilization, collapse of the mitochondrial proteome, and, ultimately, mitophagy and apoptosis. The very same mechanism occurs in Alzheimer’s disease. These findings suggest that amyloidogenesis may be a checkpoint mechanism that constrains uncontrolled growth and safeguards tissue homeostasis, congruent with its emerging tumor-suppressive function. HSF1, by acting as an anti-amyloid factor, promotes overgrowth syndromes and cancer but may suppress neurodegenerative disorders.},

Given outstanding mobility and sensitivity of superlattice NWs, an ultralow energy consumption down to subfemtojoule per synaptic event is realized in quasi-2DEG synapses, which rivals that of biological synapses and now available synapse-inspired electronics.

By studying beaver pond creation and recolonization patterns coupled with wolf predation on beavers, we determined that 84\% of newly created and recolonized beaver ponds remained occupied until the fall, whereas 0\% of newly created and recolonized ponds remained active after a wolf killed the dispersing beaver that colonized that pond. By affecting where and when beavers engineer ecosystems, wolves alter all of the ecological processes (e.g., water storage, nutrient cycling, and forest succession) that occur due to beaver-created impoundments. Our study demonstrates how predators have an outsized effect on ecosystems when they kill ecosystem engineers.},

Here, we show that the hydrolase CbsA acts as a phenotypic switch between vascular and nonvascular plant pathogenesis. cbsA was enriched in genomes of vascular phytopathogenic bacteria in the family Xanthomonadaceae and absent in most nonvascular species. CbsA expression allowed nonvascular Xanthomonas to cause vascular blight, while cbsA mutagenesis resulted in reduction of vascular or enhanced nonvascular symptom development. Phylogenetic hypothesis testing further revealed that cbsA was lost in multiple nonvascular lineages and more recently gained by some vascular subgroups, suggesting that vascular pathogenesis is ancestral.

Many fork protection factors block degradation, but how they work remains unclear. Here, we find that 53BP1 protects forks from DNA2-mediated degradation in a cell type–specific manner. Fork protection by 53BP1 reduces S-phase DNA damage and hypersensitivity to replication stress. Unlike BRCA2, FANCD2, and ABRO1 that protect reversed forks generated by SMARCAL1, ZRANB3, and HLTF, 53BP1 protects forks remodeled by FBH1. This property is shared by the fork protection factors FANCA, FANCC, FANCG, BOD1L, and VHL. RAD51 is required to generate the resection substrate in all cases. Unexpectedly, BRCA2 is also required for fork degradation in the FBH1 pathway or when RAD51 activity is partially compromised. We conclude that there are multiple fork protection mechanisms that operate downstream of at least two RAD51-dependent fork remodeling pathways.},

  abstract     = {Elucidating signaling driven by lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) could help drug development. Here, we solve the crystal structure of LMTK3 kinase domain to 2.1Å resolution, determine its consensus motif and phosphoproteome, unveiling in vitro and in vivo LMTK3 substrates. Via high-throughput homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence screen coupled with biochemical, cellular, and biophysical assays, we identify a potent LMTK3 small-molecule inhibitor (C28). Functional and mechanistic studies reveal LMTK3 is a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) client protein, requiring HSP90 for folding and stability, while C28 promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of LMTK3. Pharmacologic inhibition of LMTK3 decreases proliferation of cancer cell lines in the NCI-60 panel, with a concomitant increase in apoptosis in breast cancer cells, recapitulating effects of LMTK3 gene silencing. Furthermore, LMTK3 inhibition reduces growth of xenograft and transgenic breast cancer mouse models without displaying systemic toxicity at effective doses. Our data reinforce LMTK3 as a druggable target for cancer therapy.},

Few days before the polynya openings, persistent ARs maintained a sustained positive total energy flux at the surface, resulting in sea ice thinning and a decline in sea ice concentration in the Maud Rise region. The ARs were associated with anomalously high amounts of total precipitable water and cloud liquid water content exceeding 3 SDs above the climatological mean. The above-normal integrated water vapor transport (IVT above the 99th climatological percentile), as well as opaque cloud bands, warmed the surface (+10°C in skin and air temperature) via substantial increases (+250 W m −2 ) in downward longwave radiation and advection of warm air masses, resulting in sea ice melt and inhibited nighttime refreezing.},

  abstract     = {Diverse processes—e.g., environmental pollution, groundwater remediation, oil recovery, filtration, and drug delivery—involve the transport of colloidal particles in porous media. Using confocal microscopy, we directly visualize this process in situ and thereby identify the fundamental mechanisms by which particles are distributed throughout a medium. At high injection pressures, hydrodynamic stresses cause particles to be continually deposited on and eroded from the solid matrix—notably, forcing them to be distributed throughout the entire medium. By contrast, at low injection pressures, the relative influence of erosion is suppressed, causing particles to localize near the inlet of the medium. Unexpectedly, these macroscopic distribution behaviors depend on imposed pressure in similar ways for particles of different charges, although the pore-scale distribution of deposition is sensitive to particle charge. These results reveal how the multiscale interactions between fluid, particles, and the solid matrix control how colloids are distributed in a porous medium.},

To more rigorously characterize the determinants of spreading, preformed α-synuclein fibrils were injected into the mouse pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), a brain region that manifests LP in PD patients and the distribution of developing α-synuclein pathology compared to that ascertained by anterograde and retrograde connectomic mapping. Within the PPN, α-synuclein pathology was cell-specific, being robust in PD-vulnerable cholinergic neurons but not in neighboring noncholinergic neurons. While nearly all neurons projecting to PPN cholinergics manifested α-synuclein pathology, the kinetics, magnitude, and persistence of the propagated pathology were unrelated to the strength of those connections. Thus, neuronal phenotype governs the somatodendritic uptake of pathological α-synuclein, and while the afferent connectome restricts the subsequent spreading of pathology, its magnitude and persistence is not a strict function of the strength of coupling.},

We present a high-resolution precipitation record from Pliocene fluvial-lacustrine sequences in the Weihe Basin, Central China, a region sensitive to the East Asian monsoon. The record shows an abrupt monsoon shift at ~4.2 million years ago, interpreted as the result of high-latitude cooling, with an extratropical temperature decrease across a critical threshold. The precipitation time series exhibits a pronounced ~100–thousand year periodicity and the presence of precession and half-precession cycles, which suggest low-latitude forcing. The synchronous phase but mismatched amplitudes of the East Asian monsoon precipitation proxy and eccentricity suggest a nonlinear but sensitive precipitation response to temperature forcing in the Pliocene warm world. These observations highlight the role of high- and low-latitude forcing of East Asian monsoon variations on tectonic and orbital time scales.},

The giant protein nebulin forms a long slender filament that associates along the length of the thin filament in skeletal muscle with functions that remain largely obscure. Here nebulin’s role in thin-filament length regulation was investigated by targeting entire super-repeats in the Neb gene; nebulin was either shortened or lengthened by 115 nm. Its effect on thin-filament length was studied using high-resolution structural and functional techniques. Results revealed that thin-filament length is strictly regulated by the length of nebulin in fast muscles. Nebulin’s control is less tight in slow muscle types where a distal nebulin-free thin-filament segment exists, the length of which was found to be regulated by leiomodin-2 (Lmod2). We propose that strict length control by nebulin promotes high-speed shortening and that dual-regulation by nebulin/Lmod2 enhances contraction efficiency.},

Neuroinflammation is a common feature across neurodegenerative disorders and implicated in the progression of neurodegeneration. Dysregulated activation of microglia causes neuroinflammation and has been highlighted as a treatment target in therapeutic strategies. Here, we identified novel therapeutic candidate ALGERNON2 (altered generation of neurons 2) and demonstrate that ALGERNON2 suppressed the production of proinflammatory cytokines and rescued neurodegeneration in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)–induced Parkinson’s disease model. ALGERNON2 stabilized cyclinD1/p21 complex, leading to up-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), which contributes to antioxidative and anti-inflammatory responses. Notably, ALGERNON2 enhanced neuronal survival in other neuroinflammatory conditions such as the transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cell–derived dopaminergic neurons into murine brains. In conclusion, we present that the microglial potentiation of the p21-Nrf2 pathway can contribute to neuronal survival and provide novel therapeutic potential for neuroinflammation-triggered neurodegeneration.},

Previous studies established that cells can optimize such bet hedging upon environmental change by modulating gene expression to adapt both the average and diversity of phenotypes. Here, we demonstrate that cells can tune phenotypic diversity also using posttranslational modifications. In the chemotaxis network of Escherichia coli , we find, for both major chemoreceptors Tar and Tsr, that cell-to-cell variation in response sensitivity is dynamically modulated depending on the presence or absence of their cognate chemoeffector ligands in the environment. Combining experiments with mathematical modeling, we show that this diversity tuning requires only the environment-dependent covalent modification of chemoreceptors and a standing cell-to-cell variation in their allosteric coupling. Thus, when environmental cues are unavailable, phenotypic diversity enhances the population’s readiness for many signals. However, once a signal is perceived, the population focuses on tracking that signal.},

Shallow-water hydrodynamics, where the vortices are treated as shallow weather-layer phenomenon, is commonly evoked for explaining their formation and properties. Here, we report novel formation mechanisms for vortices where the primary driving mechanism is the deep planetary convection occurring in these planets. Using three-dimensional simulations of turbulent convection in rotating spherical shells, we propose two ideas: (i) Rotating turbulent convection generates deep axially aligned cyclones and anticyclones; (ii) a deep planetary dynamo acts to promote additional anticyclones, some as large as Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, in an overlying atmospheric layer. We use these ideas to interpret several observational properties of vortices on Jupiter and Saturn.},

During spermatogenesis, fly circBoule RNAs interact with heat shock proteins (HSPs) Hsc4 and Hsp60C, and mouse circBoule RNAs in sperm interact with HSPA2. circBoule RNAs regulate levels of HSPs by promoting their ubiquitination. The interaction between HSPA2 and circBoule RNAs is conserved in human sperm, and lower levels of the human circBoule RNAs circEx3-6 and circEx2-7 are found in asthenozoospermic sperm.

Endolysosomes mediate endocytosis, exocytosis, cargo transport, and sorting of material for recycling or degradation. We demonstrate the endolysosomal cation channel TRPML2 to be hypotonicity/mechanosensitive, a feature crucial to its involvement in fast-recycling processes of immune cells. We demonstrate that the phosphoinositide binding pocket is required for TRPML2 hypotonicity-sensitivity, as substitution of L314 completely abrogates hypotonicity-sensitivity. Last, the hypotonicity-insensitive TRPML2 mutant L314R slows down the fast recycling pathway, corroborating the functional importance of hypotonicity-sensitive TRPML2.

The high reactivity of few-layer (even monolayer) BP is expected to be “shut down” when not required and to be resumed upon application. Here, we demonstrate a protective chemistry–based methodology for regulating BP reactivity. The protective step initiates from binding Al 3+ with lone pair electrons from P to decrease the electron density on the BP surface, and ends with an oxygen/water-resistant layer through the self-assembly of hydrophobic 1, 2-benzenedithiol (BDT) on BP/Al 3+ . This protective step yields a stabilized BP with low reactivity. Deprotection of the obtained BP/Al 3+ /BDT is achieved by chelator treatment, which removes Al 3+ and BDT from the BP surface. The deprotective process recovers the electron density of BP and thus restores the reactivity of BP.},

  abstract     = {Chaotic itinerancy is a frequently observed phenomenon in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems and is characterized by itinerant transitions among multiple quasi-attractors. Several studies have pointed out that high-dimensional activity in animal brains can be observed to exhibit chaotic itinerancy, which is considered to play a critical role in the spontaneous behavior generation of animals. Thus, how to design desired chaotic itinerancy is a topic of great interest, particularly for neurorobotics researchers who wish to understand and implement autonomous behavioral controls. However, it is generally difficult to gain control over high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. In this study, we propose a method for implementing chaotic itinerancy reproducibly in a high-dimensional chaotic neural network. We demonstrate that our method enables us to easily design both the trajectories of quasi-attractors and the transition rules among them simply by adjusting the limited number of system parameters and by using the intrinsic high-dimensional chaos.},

We undertook transcriptomic profiling of plasma-derived EVs and tumors from 50 patients with metastatic melanoma receiving ICI, and validated with an independent EV-only cohort of 30 patients. Plasma-derived EV and tumor transcriptomes correlate. EV profiles reveal drivers of ICI resistance and melanoma progression, exhibit differentially expressed genes/pathways, and correlate with clinical response to ICI. We created a Bayesian probabilistic deconvolution model to estimate contributions from tumor and non-tumor sources, enabling interpretation of differentially expressed genes/pathways. EV RNA-seq mutations also segregated ICI response. EVs serve as a non-invasive biomarker to jointly probe tumor-intrinsic and immune changes to ICI, function as predictive markers of ICI responsiveness, and monitor tumor persistence and immune activation.},

However, the biological functions of LRRK2 remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that LRRK2 is recruited to lysosomes after exposure of cells to the lysosome membrane–rupturing agent LLOME. Using an unbiased proteomic screen, we identified the motor adaptor protein JIP4 as an LRRK2 partner at the lysosomal membrane. LRRK2 can recruit JIP4 to lysosomes in a kinase-dependent manner via the phosphorylation of RAB35 and RAB10. Using super-resolution live-cell imaging microscopy and FIB-SEM, we demonstrate that JIP4 promotes the formation of LAMP1-negative tubules that release membranous content from lysosomes. Thus, we describe a new process orchestrated by LRRK2, which we name LYTL (LYsosomal Tubulation/sorting driven by LRRK2), by which lysosomal tubulation is used to release vesicles from lysosomes. Given the central role of the lysosome in PD, LYTL is likely to be disease relevant.},

The pulses arrive at the target at almost the full average brightness of the electron source and in synchrony to the optical cycles, providing attosecond time resolution of spectroscopic features.

This approach allows us to use the high solid solution strengthening and shift the alloys’ compositions into previously unattainable phase regions where both nanosized shearable κ-carbides and non-shearable B2 particles are simultaneously formed. The achievement of dual-nanoprecipitation in our CCSs leads to materials with ultrahigh specific tensile strength (up to 260 MPa·cm 3 g −1 ) and excellent tensile elongation (13 to 38\%), a combination outperforming all other high-strength high-entropy alloys and advanced lightweight steels. Our concept of CCSs is thus useful for guiding the design of ultrastrong lightweight metallic materials.},

Here, we developed an algorithm, DORGE (Discovery of Oncogenes and tumor suppressoR genes using Genetic and Epigenetic features), to identify TSGs and OGs by integrating comprehensive genetic and epigenetic data. DORGE identified histone modifications as strong predictors for TSGs, and it found missense mutations, super enhancers, and methylation differences as strong predictors for OGs. We extensively validated DORGE-predicted cancer driver genes using independent functional genomics data. We also found that DORGE-predicted dual-functional genes (both TSGs and OGs) are enriched at hubs in protein-protein interaction and drug-gene networks.

We describe a pathway that features a prominent role of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification for both TOP1- and TOP2-DPC repair. Both undergo rapid and sequential SUMO-2/3 and SUMO-1 modifications in human cells. The SUMO ligase PIAS4 is required for these modifications. RNF4, a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL), then ubiquitylates the TOP-DPCs for their subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This pathway is conserved in yeast with Siz1 and Slx5-Slx8, the orthologs of human PIAS4 and RNF4.},

In this work, we report that the key disease-causative mechanisms, including dedifferentiation and repression of neuronal identity, are triggered by changes in chromatin topology. Here, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)–derived neurons from donor patients with early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (EOFAD) and used a multiomics approach to mechanistically characterize the modulation of disease-associated gene regulatory programs. We demonstrate that EOFAD neurons dedifferentiate to a precursor-like state with signatures of ectoderm and nonectoderm lineages. RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq analysis reveals that transcriptional alterations in the cellular state are orchestrated by changes in histone methylation and chromatin topology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these mechanisms are observed in EOFAD-patient brains, validating our hiPSC-derived neuron models. The mechanistic endotypes of Alzheimer’s disease uncovered here offer key insights for therapeutic interventions.},

Thickening of the ER membrane in the cleavage plane contributed to the formation of lateral diffusion barriers, which restricted the passage of short, but not long, protein transmembrane domains between the mother and bud ER compartments.

Here, we show that Wnt5a is expressed at the optic chiasm midline and promotes the crossing of retinal axons by triggering an alternative Wnt pathway that depends on the accumulation of βcatenin but does not activate the canonical pathway. In ipsilateral neurons, the transcription factor Zic2 switches this alternative Wnt pathway by regulating the expression of a set of Wnt receptors and intracellular proteins. In combination with this alternative Wnt pathway, the asymmetric activation of EphB1 receptors at the midline phosphorylates βcatenin and elicits a repulsive response.

At present, publicly available COVID-19 outcome data for representative populations are available only as area-level counts. Therefore, studies of long-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 outcomes using these data must use an ecological regression analysis, which precludes controlling for individual-level COVID-19 risk factors. We describe these challenges in the context of one of the first preliminary investigations of this question in the United States, where we found that higher historical PM 2.5 exposures are positively associated with higher county-level COVID-19 mortality rates after accounting for many area-level confounders.

Combined ectopic expression in human hepatoma cells impeded HCV uptake and cooperatively mediated transcriptional dysregulation of a noncanonical program of immunity genes. Murine hepatocyte expression of both factors was constitutive and not interferon inducible, while differences in liver expression and the ability to restrict HCV were observed between the murine orthologs and their human counterparts. Genetic ablation of endogenous Cd302 expression in human HCV entry factor transgenic mice increased hepatocyte permissiveness for an adapted HCV strain and dysregulated expression of metabolic process and host defense genes. These findings highlight human-mouse differences in liver-intrinsic antiviral immunity and facilitate the development of next-generation murine models for preclinical testing of HCV vaccine candidates.},

  abstract     = {Electrolyte cations affect the activity of surface-mediated electrocatalytic reactions; however, understanding the modes of interaction between cations and reaction intermediates remains lacking. We show that larger alkali metal cations (excluding the thickness of the hydration shell) promote the electrochemical CO reduction reaction on polycrystalline Cu surfaces in alkaline electrolytes. Combined reactivity and in situ surface-enhanced spectroscopic investigations show that changes to the interfacial electric field strength cannot solely explain the reactivity trend with cation size, suggesting the presence of a nonelectric field strength component in the cation effect. Spectroscopic investigations with cation chelating agents and organic molecules show that the electric and nonelectric field components of the cation effect could be affected by both cation identity and composition of the electrochemical interface. The interdependent nature of interfacial species indicates that the cation effect should be considered an integral part of the broader effect of composition and structure of the electrochemical interface on electrode-mediated reactions.},

Using single-cell RNA-sequencing and in vivo confirmation, we uncover previously unrecognized neural stem and progenitor cell diversity within the fetal mouse and human neocortex, including multiple types of radial glia and intermediate progenitors. We also observed that transcriptional priming underlies the diversification of a subset of ventricular radial glial cells in both species; genetic fate mapping confirms that the primed radial glial cells generate specific types of basal progenitors and neurons. The different precursor lineages therefore diversify streams of cell production in the developing murine and human neocortex.

Here, we report a strategy to produce phenol from lignin by directly deconstructing C sp2 –C sp3 and C–O bonds under mild conditions. It was found that zeolite catalyst could efficiently catalyze both the direct C sp2 –C sp3 bond breakage to remove propyl structure and aliphatic β carbon–oxygen (C β– O) bond hydrolysis to form OH group on the aromatic ring. The yield of phenol could reach 10.9 weight\% with a selectivity of 91.8\%. In this unique route, water was the only reactant besides lignin. A scale-up experiment showed that 4.1 g of pure phenol could be obtained from 50.0 g of lignin. The reaction pathway was proposed by a combination of control experiments and density functional theory studies. This work opens the way for producing phenol from lignin by direct transformation of C sp2 –C sp3 and C–O bonds in lignin.},

The ability to leverage electron properties to help predict phonon properties can thus greatly benefit materials by design for applications like thermoelectrics and electronics. Here, we demonstrate the ability of using transfer learning (TL), where knowledge learned from training machine learning models on electronic bandgaps of 1245 semiconductors is transferred to improve the models, trained using only 124 data, for predicting various phonon properties (phonon bandgap, group velocity, and heat capacity). Compared to directly trained models, TL reduces the mean absolute errors of prediction by 65, 14, and 54\% respectively, for the three phonon properties. The TL models are further validated using several semiconductors outside of the 1245 database. Results also indicate that TL can leverage not-so-accurate proxy properties, as long as they encode composition-property relation, to improve models for target properties, a notable feature to materials informatics in general.},

The scheme is based on simultaneous operation of two nearly identical interferometers, providing a moiré-like period much larger than 2π and benefiting from close-to-maximal sensitivity and from suppression of common-mode noise. The methodology is highly suited to atom interferometers, which offer record sensitivities in measuring gravito-inertial forces but suffer from limited dynamic range. We experimentally demonstrate an atom interferometer with a dynamic-range enhancement of more than an order of magnitude in a single shot and more than three orders of magnitude within a few shots for both static and dynamic signals. This approach can considerably improve the operation of interferometric sensors in challenging, uncertain, or rapidly varying conditions.},

Although the importance of the SCN for the regulation of sleep/wakefulness has been suggested, little is known about the neuronal projections from the SCN, which regulate sleep/wakefulness. Here, we show that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus mediate circadian rhythms in the SCN and regulate wakefulness. Optogenetic activation of CRF neurons promoted wakefulness through orexin/hypocretin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. In vivo Ca 2+ recording showed that CRF neurons were active at the initiation of wakefulness. Furthermore, chemogenetic suppression and ablation of CRF neurons decreased locomotor activity and time in wakefulness. Last, a combination of optical manipulation and Ca 2+ imaging revealed that neuronal activity of CRF neurons was negatively regulated by GABAergic neurons in the SCN. Our findings provide notable insights into circadian regulation of sleep/wakefulness in mammals.},

Excavations at the Andean highland site of Wilamaya Patjxa reveal a 9000-year-old human burial (WMP6) associated with a hunting toolkit of stone projectile points and animal processing tools. Osteological, proteomic, and isotopic analyses indicate that this early hunter was a young adult female who subsisted on terrestrial plants and animals. Analysis of Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene burial practices throughout the Americas situate WMP6 as the earliest and most secure hunter burial in a sample that includes 10 other females in statistical parity with early male hunter burials. The findings are consistent with nongendered labor practices in which early hunter-gatherer females were big-game hunters.},

By examining 1107 genomes from Saccharomycotina (332), Pezizomycotina (761), and Taphrinomycotina (14) species, we inferred a robust genome-wide phylogeny that resolves several contentious relationships and estimated that the Ascomycota last common ancestor likely originated in the Ediacaran period. Comparisons of genomic properties revealed that Saccharomycotina and Pezizomycotina differ greatly in their genome properties and enabled inference of the direction of evolutionary change. The Saccharomycotina typically have smaller genomes, lower guanine-cytosine contents, lower numbers of genes, and higher rates of molecular sequence evolution compared with Pezizomycotina.

As rats shifted from water choices to sucrose choices across the session, the activity of a majority of neurons in the ventral pallidum, a region crucial for reward-related behaviors, closely matched the evolving behavioral preference. The timing of this signal followed the pattern of a reward prediction error, occurring at the cue or the reward depending on when reward identity was revealed. Additionally, optogenetic stimulation of ventral pallidum neurons at the time of reward was able to reverse behavioral preference.

Neuronal oscillations might be involved in the cortical processing of audiovisual speech by selecting which sensory channel contributes more to perception. To test this, we designed computer-generated naturalistic audiovisual speech stimuli where one mismatched phoneme-viseme pair in a key word of sentences created bistable perception. Neurophysiological recordings (high-density scalp and intracranial electroencephalography) revealed that the precise phase angle of theta-band oscillations in posterior temporal and occipital cortex of the right hemisphere was crucial to select whether the auditory or the visual speech cue drove perception.

Components from primary tumor or recruited leukocytes are known to facilitate metastasis formation. However, contribution of target site–specific host factor to metastasis is poorly understood. Here, we show that developmental endothelial locus–1 (DEL-1), an anti-inflammatory factor abundant in the lung and down-regulated by inflammatory insults, protects from melanoma lung metastasis independently of primary tumor development and systemic immunosurveillance. DEL-1 deficiency is associated with gene profiles that favor metastatic progression with inflammation and defective immunosurveillance. Mechanistically, DEL-1 deficiency primarily influences Ly6G + neutrophil accumulation in lung metastatic niche, leading to IL-17A up-regulation from γδ T cells and reduced antimetastatic NK cells. In support, neutrophil depletion or recombinant DEL-1 treatment profoundly reverses these effects. Thus, our results identify DEL-1 as a previously unrecognized link between tumor-induced inflammation and pulmonary metastasis.},

  abstract     = {Progressive unfolding of gene expression cascades underlies diverse embryonic lineage development. Here, we report a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of the complete and invariant embryonic cell lineage of the tunicate Ciona savignyi from fertilization to the onset of gastrulation. We reconstructed a developmental landscape of 47 cell types over eight cell cycles in the wild-type embryo and identified eight fate transformations upon fibroblast growth factor (FGF) inhibition. For most FGF-dependent asymmetric cell divisions, the bipotent mother cell displays the gene signature of the default daughter fate. In convergent differentiation of the two notochord lineages, we identified additional gene pathways parallel to the master regulator T / Brachyury . Last, we showed that the defined Ciona cell types can be matched to E6.5-E8.5 stage mouse cell types and display conserved expression of limited number of transcription factors. This study provides a high-resolution single-cell dataset to understand chordate early embryogenesis and cell lineage differentiation.},

However, until now, there have been only limited assessments of riverine heat impacts. Here, we adopted a synthesis of a pan-Arctic sea ice–ocean model and a land surface model to quantify impacts of river heat on the Arctic sea ice and ocean heat budget. We show that river heat contributed up to 10\% of the regional sea ice reduction over the Arctic shelves from 1980 to 2015. Particularly notable, this effect occurs as earlier sea ice breakup in late spring and early summer. The increasing ice-free area in the shelf seas results in a warmer ocean in summer, enhancing ocean–atmosphere energy exchange and atmospheric warming. Our findings suggest that a positive river heat–sea ice feedback nearly doubles the river heat effect.},

Here, we propose a linear nanomotor based on a plasmonic particle that generates, even when illuminated with a plane wave, a lateral optical force due to its directional side scattering. This force direction is determined by the orientation of the nanoparticle rather than a field gradient or propagation direction of the incident light. We demonstrate the arrangements of the particles allow controlling the lateral force distributions with the resolution beyond the diffraction limit, which can produce movements, as designed, of microobjects in which they are embedded without shaping and steering the laser beam. Our nanomotor to engineer the experienced force can open the door to a new class of micro/nanomechanical devices that can be entirely operated by light.},

Compared with disulfide and thioether bonds, the trisulfide bond effectively promotes the self-assembly ability of doxorubicin homodimeric prodrugs, thereby improving the colloidal stability and in vivo fate of prodrug nanoassemblies. The trisulfide bond also shows higher glutathione sensitivity compared to the conventional disulfide bond, and this sensitivity enables efficient tumor-specific drug release. Therefore, trisulfide bond–bridged prodrug nanoassemblies exhibit high selective cytotoxicity on tumor cells compared with normal cells, notably reducing the systemic toxicity of doxorubicin.

Here, we report a 3.2-Å resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of mTORC2. It reveals entangled folds of the defining Rictor and the substrate-binding SIN1 subunits, identifies the carboxyl-terminal domain of Rictor as the source of the rapamycin insensitivity of mTORC2, and resolves mechanisms for mTORC2 regulation by complex destabilization. Two previously uncharacterized small-molecule binding sites are visualized, an inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) pocket in mTOR and an mTORC2-specific nucleotide binding site in Rictor, which also forms a zinc finger. Structural and biochemical analyses suggest that InsP6 and nucleotide binding do not control mTORC2 activity directly but rather have roles in folding or ternary interactions. These insights provide a firm basis for studying mTORC2 signaling and for developing mTORC2-specific inhibitors.},

During the 21st century, North Atlantic and Southern Ocean OHU exhibit similarly positive trends under a business-as-usual scenario but respectively positive and negative trends under a mitigation scenario. The opposite centurial OHU trends in the Southern Ocean can be attributed partially to distinct GHG trajectories under the two scenarios while the common positive centurial OHU trends in the North Atlantic are mainly due to aerosol effects. Under both scenarios, projected decline of anthropogenic aerosols potentially induces a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and a divergence of meridional oceanic heat transport, which leads to enhanced OHU in the subpolar North Atlantic.},

Here, a series of ILs are developed using biocompatible ionic components, which realizes absorption of gaseous NO to yield IL-NONOates. These IL-NONOates serve as HNO donors to release active ingredient. The release kinetics can be tuned through configuring the geometric construction of ILs (release half-lives, 4.2 to 1061 min). Mechanism research indicates that the tunability depends on the strength of intramolecular hydrogen bond.

Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial complex I in combination with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, MVE or MitoTEMPO, induced a robust integrated stress response (ISR) and markedly diminished cell survival and proliferation in vitro. This was not observed following inhibition of mitochondrial complex III. Administration of MitoTEMPO in combination with the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor phenformin decreased the leukemic burden in a mouse model of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

We compiled 487 arthropod food webs in two long-running grassland biodiversity experiments in Europe and North America to investigate whether and how increasing plant diversity can reduce the impacts of herbivores on plants. We show that plants lose just under half as much energy to arthropod herbivores when in high-diversity mixtures versus monocultures and reveal that plant diversity decreases effects of herbivores on plants by simultaneously benefiting predators and reducing average herbivore food quality. These findings demonstrate that conserving plant diversity is crucial for maintaining interactions in food webs that provide natural control of herbivore pests.},

Here, we use reconstructions of prehistoric sea-level rise, paleogeographies, terrestrial landscape change, and human population dynamics to show how the gradual inundation of an island archipelago resulted in decidedly nonlinear landscape and cultural responses to rising sea levels. Interpretation of past and future responses to sea-level change requires a better understanding of local physical and societal contexts to assess plausible human response patterns in the future.},

  abstract     = {Placenta-mediated pregnancy complications are a major challenge in the management of maternal-fetal health. Maternal thrombophilia is a suspected risk factor, but the role of thrombotic processes in these complications has remained unclear. Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) is an anticoagulant protein highly expressed in the placenta. EPCR autoantibodies and gene variants are associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. In mice, fetal EPCR deficiency results in placental failure and in utero death. We show that inhibition of molecules involved in thrombin generation or in the activation of maternal platelets allows placental development and embryonic survival. Nonetheless, placentae exhibit venous thrombosis in uteroplacental circulation associated with neonatal death. In contrast, maternal EPCR deficiency results in clinical and histological features of placental abruption and is ameliorated with concomitant Par4 deficiency. Our findings unveil a causal link between maternal thrombophilia, uterine hemorrhage, and placental abruption and identify Par4 as a potential target of therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract     = {Spider silk fiber rapidly assembles from spidroin protein in soluble state via an incompletely understood mechanism. Here, we present an integrated model for silk formation that incorporates the effects of multiple chemical and physical gradients on the different spidroin functional domains. Central to the process is liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) that occurs in response to multivalent anions such as phosphate, mediated by the carboxyl-terminal and repetitive domains. Acidification coupled with LLPS triggers the swift self-assembly of nanofibril networks, facilitated by dimerization of the amino-terminal domain, and leads to a liquid-to-solid phase transition. Mechanical stress applied to the fibril structures yields macroscopic fibers with hierarchical organization and enriched for β-sheet conformations. Studies using native silk gland material corroborate our findings on spidroin phase separation. Our results suggest an intriguing parallel between silk assembly and other LLPS-mediated mechanisms, such as found in intracellular membraneless organelles and protein aggregation disorders.},

Our analysis reveals that this compound interacts with Aβ and inhibits both the primary and secondary nucleation pathways in its aggregation process. We characterize this interaction using biophysical experiments and integrative structural ensemble determination methods. We observe that this molecule increases the conformational entropy of monomeric Aβ while decreasing its hydrophobic surface area. We also show that it rescues a Caenorhabditis elegans model of Aβ-associated toxicity, consistent with the mechanism of action identified from the in silico and in vitro studies. These results illustrate the strategy of stabilizing the monomeric states of disordered proteins with small molecules to alter their behavior for therapeutic purposes.},

Recently, lead halide perovskites (LHPs), which have gained great success in optoelectronics, also show interesting magnetic properties. However, the spin-related properties in LHPs originate from the spin-orbit coupling of Pb, limiting further development of these materials in spintronics. Here, we demonstrate a new generation of halide perovskites, by alloying magnetic elements into optoelectronic double perovskites, which provide rich chemical and structural diversities to host different magnetic elements. In our iron-alloyed double perovskite, Cs 2 Ag(Bi:Fe)Br 6 , Fe 3+ replaces Bi 3+ and forms FeBr 6 clusters that homogenously distribute throughout the double perovskite crystals. We observe a strong temperature-dependent magnetic response at temperatures below 30 K, which is tentatively attributed to a weak ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic response from localized regions. We anticipate that this work will stimulate future efforts in exploring this simple yet efficient approach to develop new spintronic materials based on lead-free double perovskites.},

Here, we report induction of a protective anti-ZIKV CD8 + T cell response in the HLA-B*0702 Ifnar1 −/− transgenic mice using an alphavirus-based replicon RNA vaccine expressing ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3, a potent T cell antigen. The NS3 vaccine did not induce a neutralizing antibody response but elicited polyfunctional CD8 + T cells that were necessary and sufficient for preventing death in lethally infected adult mice and fetal growth restriction in infected pregnant mice.

Myosin Va (MyoVa), an actin-based motor, is a classic model for studying cargo transport. However, the molecular basis underlying cargo unloading in MyoVa-mediated transport has remained enigmatic. We have identified MICAL1, an F-actin disassembly regulator, as a binding partner of MyoVa and shown that MICAL1-MyoVa interaction is critical for localization of MyoVa at the midbody. By binding to MICAL1, MyoVa-mediated transport is terminated, resulting in vesicle unloading at the midbody for efficient cytokinesis. The MyoVa/MICAL1 complex structure reveals that MICAL1 and F-actin assembly factors, Spires, share an overlapped binding surface on MyoVa, suggesting a regulatory role of F-actin dynamics in cargo unloading. Down-regulating F-actin disassembly by a MICAL1 mutant significantly reduces MyoVa and vesicles accumulating at the midbody. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that MyoVa binds to MICAL1 at the midbody destination and triggers F-actin disassembly to unload the vesicle cargo.},

Overall, diversification enhances biodiversity, pollination, pest control, nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and water regulation without compromising crop yields. Practices targeting aboveground biodiversity boosted pest control and water regulation, while those targeting belowground biodiversity enhanced nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and water regulation. Most often, diversification practices resulted in win-win support of services and crop yields. Variability in responses and occurrence of trade-offs highlight the context dependency of outcomes.

A fivefold increase in the rate of infanticide and seven cases of lethal fights among mature males were subsequently recorded, and the annual subpopulation growth rate declined by half between 2000 and 2017. The increase in infanticide alone explains 57\% of this decline.

Furthermore, energy predicted a range of mental health metrics. sgACC volume moderated humans’ emotional gain from nonexercise activity in real life: Individuals with low sgACC volume, a risk factor for depression, felt less energized when inactive but benefited more from periods of high nonexercise activity.

We incorporate economic drivers of fishing effort into food-web network models, evaluating the dynamics of thousands of single-species fisheries across hundreds of simulated food webs under fixed-effort and open-access management strategies. Analyzing simulation results reveals that harvesting species with high population biomass can initially support fishery persistence but threatens long-term economic and ecological sustainability by indirectly inducing extinction cascades in non-harvested species. This dynamic is exacerbated in open-access fisheries where profit-driven growth in fishing effort increases perturbation strength. Our results demonstrate how network theory provides necessary ecological context when considering the sustainability of economically dynamic fishing effort.},

In addition, by measuring both (0.31 0 L ) and (0 0.31 L ) peaks, we identify a pronounced difference in the orbital symmetry of the CDW order along the a and b axes, with the CDW along the a axis exhibiting orbital order in addition to charge order.},

  abstract     = {An ongoing debate surrounding transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the scalp is whether it modulates brain activity both directly and in a regionally constrained manner enough to positively affect symptoms in patients with neurological disorders. One alternative explanation is that direct current stimulation affects neural circuits mainly indirectly, i.e., via peripheral nerves. Here, we report that noninvasive direct current stimulation indirectly affects neural circuits via peripheral nerves. In a series of studies, we show that direct current stimulation can cause activation of the greater occipital nerve (ON-tDCS) and augments memory via the ascending fibers of the occipital nerve to the locus coeruleus, promoting noradrenaline release. This noradrenergic pathway plays a key role in driving hippocampal activity by modifying functional connectivity supporting the consolidation of a memory event.},

Our results show that President Trump and other Republican candidates would benefit electorally from a reduction in COVID-19 fatalities.

The source of carbamylated antigens and the mechanisms by which anti-CarP antibodies promote bone erosion in RA remain unknown. Here, we find that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) externalize carbamylated proteins and that RA subjects develop autoantibodies against carbamylated NET (cNET) antigens that, in turn, correlate with levels of anti-CarP. Transgenic mice expressing the human RA shared epitope (HLADRB1* 04:01) immunized with cNETs develop antibodies to citrullinated and carbamylated proteins. Furthermore, anti–carbamylated histone antibodies correlate with radiographic bone erosion in RA subjects. Moreover, anti–carbamylated histone–immunoglobulin G immune complexes promote osteoclast differentiation and potentiate osteoclast-mediated matrix resorption. These results demonstrate that carbamylated proteins present in NETs enhance pathogenic immune responses and bone destruction, which may explain the association between anti-CarP and erosive arthritis in RA.},

T 1 RESS makes it possible to effectively use an MRI technique with improved signal-to-noise ratio efficiency for cancer imaging. In a proof-of-concept study, “dark blood” unbalanced T 1 RESS provided a twofold improvement in tumor-to-brain contrast compared with standard techniques, whereas balanced T 1 RESS greatly enhanced vascular detail.

By expressing a putative tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) gene cluster in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), we elucidate the activity of a pathway consisting of a carboxyl methyltransferase (SlMT2), which methylates the yeast primary metabolite 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) to form a methyl ester, and a SlCHS, which catalyzes the condensation of 3-HAA methyl ester and p -coumaroyl-coenzyme A (CoA) through formation of an amide bond. We demonstrate that this aminoacylation activity could be a common secondary activity in plant CHSs by validating the activity in vitro with variants from S. lycopersicum and Arabidopsis thaliana .

To this end, we present scLearn, a learning-based framework that automatically infers quantitative measurement/similarity and threshold that can be used for different single-cell assignment tasks, achieving a well-generalized assignment performance on different single-cell types.

Challenges associated with low efficiency and high cost of IR light sources and detector arrays have limited its broad adoption. Here, we introduce a new approach to IR hyperspectral microscopy, where the IR spectral map is obtained with off-the-shelf components built for visible light. The method is based on the nonlinear interference of correlated photons generated via parametric down-conversion. In this proof-of-concept we demonstrate the chemical mapping of a patterned sample, where different areas have distinctive IR spectroscopic fingerprints. The method provides a wide field of view, fast readout, and negligible heat delivered to the sample, which opens prospects for its further development for applications in material and biological studies.},

The extent to which such mechanisms control C-type gating of innately heterodimeric K 2P s is unknown. Here, combining K 2P 2.1 (TREK-1) x-ray crystallography in different potassium concentrations, potassium anomalous scattering, molecular dynamics, and electrophysiology, we uncover unprecedented, asymmetric, potassium-dependent conformational changes that underlie K 2P C-type gating. These asymmetric order-disorder transitions, enabled by the K 2P heterodimeric architecture, encompass pinching and dilation, disrupt the S1 and S2 ion binding sites, require the uniquely long K 2P SF2-M4 loop and conserved “M3 glutamate network, ” and are suppressed by the K 2P C-type gate activator ML335. These findings demonstrate that two distinct C-type gating mechanisms can operate in one channel and underscore the SF2-M4 loop as a target for K 2P channel modulator development.},

Ecological selectivity points to extreme post-impact light inhibition as the principal kill mechanism, with the marine food chain temporarily reset to a bacteria-dominated state. Subsequently, in a sunlit ocean inhabited by only rare survivor grazers but abundant small prey, it was mixotrophic nutrition (autotrophy and heterotrophy) and increasing cell sizes that enabled the eventual reestablishment of marine food webs some 2 million years later.},

Here, we present a layer-engineered exfoliation technique for graphene that not only allows us to obtain large-size graphene, up to a millimeter size, but also allows selective thickness control. A thin metal film evaporated on graphite induces tensile stress such that spalling occurs, resulting in exfoliation of graphene, where the number of exfoliated layers is adjusted by using different metal films. Detailed spectroscopy and electron transport measurement analysis greatly support our proposed spalling mechanism and fine quality of exfoliated graphene.

  abstract     = {Homeoproteins were originally identified for embryonic cell–autonomous transcription activity, but they also have non–cell-autonomous activity owing to transfer between cells. This Review discusses transfer mechanisms and focuses on some established functions, such as neurodevelopmental regulation of axon guidance, and postnatal critical periods of brain plasticity that affect sensory processing and cognition. Homeoproteins are present across all eukaryotes, and intercellular transfer occurs in plants and animals. Proposed functions have evolutionary relevance, such as morphogenetic activity and sexual exchange during the mating of unicellular eukaryotes, while others have physiopathological relevance, such as regulation of mood and cognition by influencing brain compartmentalization, connectivity, and plasticity. There are more than 250 known homeoproteins with conserved transfer domains, suggesting that this is a common mode of signal transduction but with many undiscovered functions.},

  abstract     = {Oocyte numbers, a critical determinant of female reproductive fitness, are highly regulated, yet the mechanisms underlying this regulation remain largely undefined. In the Caenorhabditis elegans gonad, RAS/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) signaling regulates oocyte numbers; mechanisms are unknown. We show that the RAS/ERK pathway phosphorylates meiotic chromosome axis protein HTP-1 at serine-325 to control chromosome dynamics and regulate oocyte number. Phosphorylated HTP-1(S325) accumulates in vivo in an ERK-dependent manner in early-mid pachytene stage germ cells and is necessary for synaptonemal complex extension and/or maintenance. Lack of HTP-1 phosphorylation leads to asynapsis and persistence of meiotic double-strand breaks, causing delayed meiotic progression and reduced oocyte number. In contrast, early onset of ERK activation causes precocious meiotic progression, resulting in increased oocyte number, which is reversed by removal of HTP-1 phosphorylation. The RAS/ERK/HTP-1 signaling cascade thus functions to monitor formation and maintenance of synapsis for timely resolution of double-strand breaks, oocyte production, and reproductive fitness.},

Here, we show that melts of ancient mafic clasts from a martian regolith meteorite, NWA 7533, experienced substantial Fe-Ti oxide fractionation. This implies early, impact-induced, oxidation events that increased by five to six orders of magnitude the oxygen fugacity of impact melts from remelting of the crust. Oxygen isotopic compositions of sequentially crystallized phases from the clasts show that progressive oxidation was due to interaction with an 17 O-rich water reservoir. Such an early oxidation of the crust by impacts in the presence of water may have supplied greenhouse gas H 2 that caused an increase in surface temperature in a CO 2 -thick atmosphere.},

To understand the molecular mechanism of haustorium development, we performed a forward genetics screening to isolate mutants exhibiting haustorial defects in the model parasitic plant Phtheirospermum japonicum. We isolated two mutants that show prolonged and sometimes aberrant meristematic activity in the haustorium apex, resulting in severe defects on host invasion. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the two mutants respectively have point mutations in homologs of ETHYLENE RESPONSE 1 ( ETR1 ) and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 ( EIN2 ), signaling components in response to the gaseous phytohormone ethylene. Application of the ethylene signaling inhibitors also caused similar haustorial defects, indicating that ethylene signaling regulates cell proliferation and differentiation of parasite cells. Genetic disruption of host ethylene production also perturbs parasite invasion. We propose that parasitic plants use ethylene as a signal to invade host roots.},

Brillouin light scattering has been proposed as an emerging optical elastography technique to meet this need. However, the information contained in the Brillouin spectrum is still a matter of debate because of fundamental problems in understanding the role of water in biomechanics and in relating the Brillouin data to low-frequency macroscopic mechanical parameters. Here, we investigate this question using gelatin as a model system in which the macroscopic physical properties can be manipulated to mimic all the relevant biological states of matter, ranging from the liquid to the gel and the glassy phase.

We tested the hypothesis that the primary cilium is a hub for transducing biophysical and hedgehog (Hh) signals to regulate tendon enthesis formation and adaptation to loading. Primary cilia were necessary for enthesis development, and cilia assembly was coincident with Hh signaling and enthesis mineralization. Cilia responded inversely to loading; increased loading led to decreased cilia and decreased loading led to increased cilia. Enthesis responses to loading were dependent on Hh signaling through cilia. Results imply a role for tendon enthesis primary cilia as mechanical responders and Hh signal transducers, providing a therapeutic target for tendon enthesis pathologies.},

SugABC is an ABC transporter that translocates trehalose from the periplasmic lipoprotein LpqY into the cytoplasm of mycobacteria. Here, we report four high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures of the mycobacterial LpqY-SugABC complex to reveal how it binds and passes trehalose through the membrane to the cytoplasm. A unique feature observed in this system is the initial mode of capture of the trehalose at the LpqY interface. Uptake is achieved by a pivotal rotation of LpqY relative to SugABC, moving from an open and accessible conformation to a clamped conformation upon trehalose binding. These findings enrich our understanding as to how ABC transporters facilitate substrate transport across the membrane in Gram-positive bacteria.},

Combining this with materials science techniques, we investigate the extracellular matrix of specific human and mouse collagen regions. We show that human-like osteocyte lacunar-canalicular network is retained within human collagen regions and is distinct to that of mouse tissue. This multiscale analysis shows that human and mouse tissues physiologically integrate into a single, functional bone tissue while maintaining their species-specific ultrastructural differences.

Therefore, understanding how PDAC regulates the desmoplastic and immune stromal components is of great clinical importance. We found that acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain 3 (ACSL3) is up-regulated in PDAC and correlates with increased fibrosis. Our in vivo results show that Acsl3 knockout hinders PDAC progression, markedly reduces tumor fibrosis and tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive cells, and increases cytotoxic T cell infiltration. This effect is, at least in part, due to decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor–1 (PAI-1) secretion from tumor cells. Accordingly, PAI-1 expression in PDAC positively correlates with markers of fibrosis and immunosuppression and predicts poor patient survival. We found that PAI-1 pharmacological inhibition strongly enhances chemo- and immunotherapeutic response against PDAC, increasing survival of mice. Thus, our results unveil ACSL3–PAI-1 signaling as a requirement for PDAC progression with druggable attributes.},

Mechanisms of regulating Na + /K + -ATPase homeostatic turnover are unknown. Here, we report that 5-diphosphoinositol 1, 2, 3, 4, 6-pentakisphosphate (5-InsP 7 ), generated by inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1), promotes physiological endocytosis and downstream degradation of Na + /K + -ATPase-α1. Deletion of IP6K1 elicits a twofold enrichment of Na + /K + -ATPase-α1 in plasma membranes of multiple tissues and cell types. Using a suite of synthetic chemical biology tools, we found that 5-InsP 7 binds the RhoGAP domain of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) p85α to disinhibit its interaction with Na + /K + -ATPase-α1. This recruits adaptor protein 2 (AP2) and triggers the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of Na + /K + -ATPase-α1.

Globally, 43.5\% of the blue carbon extracted by fisheries in the high seas comes from areas that would be economically unprofitable without subsidies.

  abstract     = {Earth’s upper mantle, as sampled by mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) at oceanic spreading centers, has developed chemical and isotopic heterogeneity over billions of years through focused melt extraction and re-enrichment by recycled crustal components. Chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of MORB is dwarfed by the large compositional spectrum of lavas at convergent margins, identifying subduction zones as the major site for crustal recycling into and modification of the mantle. The fate of subduction-modified mantle and if this heterogeneity transmits into MORB chemistry remains elusive. Here, we investigate the origin of upper mantle chemical heterogeneity underneath the Western Gakkel Ridge region in the Arctic Ocean through MORB geochemistry and tectonic plate reconstruction. We find that seafloor lavas from the Western Gakkel Ridge region mirror geochemical signatures of an Early Cretaceous, paleo-subduction zone, and conclude that the upper mantle can preserve a long-lived, stationary geochemical memory of past geodynamic processes.},

Here, we report a previously unknown class of bioinspired metagel impedance transformers to overcome this limit. The transformer embeds a two-dimensional metamaterial matrix of steel cylinders into hydrogel. Using experimental data of the biosonar from the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, we demonstrate through theoretical analysis that broadband transmission is achieved when the bioinspired acoustic impedance function is introduced. Furthermore, we experimentally show that the metagel device offers efficient implementation in broadband underwater ultrasound detection with the benefit of being soft and tunable. The bioinspired two-dimensional metagel breaks the length-wavelength dependence, which paves a previously unexplored way for designing next-generation broadband impedance matching devices in diverse wave engineering.},

In this study, we identify direct cross-talk between CDK4/6 and the epigenome via its previously unidentified substrate, SMYD2, a histone/lysine methyltransferase. CDK4/6 positively regulates the phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of SMYD2, while SMYD2 also positively regulates the expression of CDK4/6. We also identify SMYD2 as an α-tubulin methyltransferase, thus connecting CDK4/6-SMYD2 signaling to microtubule dynamics. In addition, depletion or inhibition of CDK4/6 and SMYD2 resulted in increased cilia assembly by affecting (i) microtubule stability and (ii) the expression of IFT20, further connecting CDK4/6-SMYD2 to ciliogenesis. In clinical settings such as breast cancer and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), targeting the up-regulated CDK4/6 and SMYD2 with inhibitors results in restoration of the primary cilium in tumor and cystic cells, which may normalize cilia-mediated extracellular signals that regulate growth, development, and cellular homeostasis.},

In addition, iT regs inhibited proliferation, inflammatory cytokine production, migration, and invasion ability of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)–SFs in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we noted that iT regs directly targeted inflamed SFs to treat autoimmune arthritis, while nT regs failed to do this.

Here, we developed an advanced surface modification technique for orthopedic implants termed lubricated orthopedic implant surface (LOIS), which was inspired by slippery surface of Nepenthes pitcher plant. LOIS presents a long-lasting, extreme liquid repellency against diverse liquids and biosubstances including cells, proteins, calcium, and bacteria. In addition, we confirmed mechanical durability against scratches and fixation force by simulating inevitable damages during surgical procedure ex vivo.

This accumulation leads to enhanced vascular remodeling in the skinfold window chamber and a proregenerative shift in macrophage and dendritic cell phenotype, resulting in improved wound closure after skin transplantation.

We revealed the heterogeneous chemoresistance mechanisms across various B-ALL cell lines and patient-derived samples. We showed that the leukemic perivascular, endosteal, and hematopoietic niche-derived factors maintain B-ALL survival and quiescence (e.g., CXCL12 cytokine signal, VCAM-1/OPN adhesive signals, and enhanced downstream leukemia-intrinsic NF-κB pathway).

We found that the MS to CA1 connection is recruited during recall of a contextual fear memory. Chemogenetic silencing of CA1-projecting MS neurons or septal GABAergic terminals within CA1 blocked memory retrieval. Photostimulation of septal GABAergic terminals in CA1 selectively inhibited interneurons. Abrogating septal GABAergic cells during retrieval disinhibited parvalbumin-rich (PV+) cells in CA1. Direct activation of CA1 PV+ cells impaired memory and prevented the induction of extracellular signal–regulated kinase/mitogen-activated kinase signaling in postsynaptic pyramidal neurons. Opposing disinhibition of hippocampal PV+ cells reversibly restored memory.

Whether NSPCs also have heterogeneous regulations on DSB formation and repair to accommodate region-specific neurogenesis has not been explored. Here, we identified a regional regulator Filia, which is predominantly expressed in mouse hippocampal NSPCs after birth and regulates DNA DSB formation and repair. On one hand, Filia protects stalling replication forks and prevents the replication stress-associated DNA DSB formation. On the other hand, Filia facilitates the homologous recombination–mediated DNA DSB repair. Consequently, Filia −/− mice had impaired hippocampal NSPC proliferation and neurogenesis and were deficient in learning, memory, and mood regulations. Thus, our study provided the first proof of concept demonstrating the region-specific regulations of DSB formation and repair in subtypes of NSPCs.},

  abstract     = {Adjacent neurons in visual cortex have overlapping receptive fields within and across area boundaries, an arrangement theorized to minimize wiring cost. This constraint is traditionally thought to create retinotopic maps of opposing field signs (mirror and nonmirror visual field representations) in adjacent areas, a concept that has become central in current attempts to subdivide the extrastriate cortex. We simulated the formation of retinotopic maps using a model that balances constraints imposed by smoothness in the representation within an area and by congruence between areas. As in the primate cortex, this model usually leads to alternating mirror and nonmirror maps. However, we found that it can also produce a more complex type of map, consisting of sectors with opposing field sign within a single area. Using fully quantitative electrode array recordings, we then demonstrate that this type of inhomogeneous map exists in the controversial dorsomedial region of the primate extrastriate cortex.},

Here, we demonstrate that mangroves, generally supporting high sediment accretion rates, efficiently sequester plastics in their sediments. To this end, we extracted microplastics from dated sediment cores of the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf mangrove ( Avicennia marina ) forests along the Saudi Arabian coast. We found that microplastics &lt;0.5 mm dominated in mangrove sediments, helping explain their scarcity, in surface waters. We estimate that 50 ± 30 and 110 ± 80 metric tons of plastic may have been buried since the 1930s in mangrove sediments across the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf, respectively. We observed an exponential increase in the plastic burial rate (8.5 ± 1.2\% year −1 ) since the 1950s in line with the global plastic production increase, confirming mangrove sediments as long-term sinks for plastics.},

While a mitochondrial NAD + transporter has been identified in yeast, how NAD enters mitochondria in metazoans is unknown. Here, we mine gene essentiality data from human cell lines to identify MCART1 ( SLC25A51 ) as coessential with ETC components. MCART1 -null cells have large decreases in TCA cycle flux, mitochondrial respiration, ETC complex I activity, and mitochondrial levels of NAD + and NADH. Isolated mitochondria from cells lacking or overexpressing MCART1 have greatly decreased or increased NAD uptake in vitro, respectively. Moreover, MCART1 and NDT1 , a yeast mitochondrial NAD + transporter, can functionally complement for each other. Thus, we propose that MCART1 is the long sought mitochondrial transporter for NAD in human cells.},

Here, we report a pair of cellulosomal assembly modules, comprising a cohesin and a dockerin from Clostridium acetobutylicum , which interact together following a unique pH-dependent switch between two functional sites rather than on-off states. The two cohesin-binding sites on the dockerin are switched from one to the other at pH 4.8 and 7.5 with a 180° rotation of the bound dockerin. Combined analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, crystal structure determination, mutagenesis, and isothermal titration calorimetry elucidates the chemical and structural mechanism of the pH-dependent switching of the binding sites. The pH-dependent dual-binding-site switch not only represents an elegant example of biological regulation but also provides a new approach for developing pH-dependent protein devices and biomaterials beyond an on-off switch for biotechnological applications.},

Downplaying uncertainty can raise support in the short term, but reversals in projections may temper these effects or even reduce scientific trust.

However, state-of-the-art tattoo-like electrodes are limited in size (e.g., centimeters) to perform electrophysiology at scale due to challenges including large-area fabrication, skin lamination, and electrical interference from long interconnects. Therefore, we report large-area, soft, breathable, substrate- and encapsulation-free electrodes designed into transformable filamentary serpentines that can be rapidly fabricated by cut-and-paste method. We propose a Cartan curve–inspired transfer process to minimize strain in the electrodes when laminated on nondevelopable skin surfaces. Unwanted signals picked up by the unencapsulated interconnects can be eliminated through a previously unexplored electrical compensation strategy. These tattoo-like electrodes can comfortably cover the whole chest, forearm, or neck for applications such as multichannel electrocardiography, sign language recognition, prosthetic control or mapping of neck activities.},

Outcrops preserve evidence of the replacement of Acheulean by Middle Stone Age (MSA) technological, cognitive, and social innovations between 500 and 300 thousand years (ka) ago, contemporaneous with large-scale taxonomic and adaptive turnover in mammal herbivores. Beginning ~400 ka ago, tectonic, hydrological, and ecological changes combined to disrupt a relatively stable resource base, prompting fluctuations of increasing magnitude in freshwater availability, grassland communities, and woody plant cover. Interaction of these factors offers a resource-oriented hypothesis for the evolutionary success of MSA adaptations, which likely contributed to the ecological flexibility typical of Homo sapiens foragers.},

We observed a rotation of the polarization plane of inelastically scattered light between −20 o and +60 o that are tunable by an out-of-plane magnetic field from −2.5 to 2.5 T. It is experimentally observed that the degree of polarization can be magnetically manipulated between −20 and 85\%.

Nearly 2000 unique coarse-grained polymers are simulated to construct and analyze machine learning models. We find that deep neural networks inexpensively and reliably predict structural properties with limited sequence information as input. By coupling trained ML models with sequential model-based optimization, polymer sequences are proposed to exhibit globular, swollen, or rod-like behaviors, which are verified by explicit simulations. This work highlights the promising integration of coarse-grained modeling with data-driven design and represents a necessary and crucial step toward more complex polymer design efforts.},

With increasing volume fraction, we observe a strong increase in correlations at both medium-range and next-neighbor distances in the supercooled state, both invisible to conventional scattering techniques. Next-neighbor correlations are indicative of ordered precursor clusters preceding crystallization. Furthermore, the increase in such correlations is accompanied by a marked slowing down of the dynamics, proving experimentally a direct relation between orientational order and sample dynamics in a soft matter system. In contrast, correlations continuously increase for nonequilibrated, glassy samples, suggesting that orientational order is reached before the sample slows down to reach (quasi-)equilibrium.},

We find that the monomeric state of Skp is intrinsically disordered and that formation of the oligomerization interface initiates folding of the α-helical coiled-coil arms via a unique “stapling” mechanism, resulting in the formation of active trimeric Skp. Native client proteins contact all three Skp subunits simultaneously, and accordingly, their binding shifts the Skp population toward the active trimer. This activation mechanism is shown to be essential for Salmonella fitness in a mouse infection model. The coupled mechanism is a unique example of how an ATP-independent chaperone can modulate its activity as a function of the presence of client proteins.},

Unfortunately, these small amounts of oxygen also lead to a markedly decreased ductility, which in turn drives the increased cost to purify titanium to avoid this oxygen poisoning effect. Here, we report a systematic study on the oxygen sensitivity of titanium that provides a clear mechanistic view of how oxygen impurities affect the mechanical properties of titanium. The increased slip planarity of Ti-O alloys is caused by an interstitial shuffling mechanism, which is sensitive to temperature, strain rate, and oxygen content and leads to the subsequent alteration of deformation twinning behavior. The insights from our experimental and computational work provide a rationale for the design of titanium alloys with increased tolerance to variations in interstitial content, with notable implications for more widespread use of titanium alloys.},

We show that decellularized ECM from tumor-bearing and obese mammary glands drives TNBC cell invasion. Proteomics of the ECM from the obese mammary gland led us to identify full-length collagen VI as a novel driver of TNBC cell invasion whose abundance in tumor stroma increases with body mass index in human TNBC patients. Last, we describe the mechanism by which collagen VI contributes to TNBC cell invasion via NG2-EGFR cross-talk and MAPK signaling. Overall, these studies demonstrate the value of decellularized ECM scaffolds obtained from tissues to identify novel functions of the ECM.},

  abstract     = {Gene expression aberration is a hallmark of cancers, but the mechanisms underlying such aberrations remain unclear. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are genomic repetitive elements that potentially function as enhancers. Since numerous HERVs are epigenetically activated in tumors, their activation could cause global gene expression aberrations in tumors. Here, we show that HERV activation in tumors leads to the up-regulation of hundreds of transcriptional suppressors, namely, Krüppel-associated box domain–containing zinc-finger family proteins (KZFPs). KZFP genes are preferentially encoded nearby the activated HERVs in tumors and transcriptionally regulated by these adjacent HERVs. Increased HERV and KZFP expression in tumors was associated with better disease conditions. Increased KZFP expression in cancer cells altered the expression of genes related to the cell cycle and cell-matrix adhesion and suppressed cellular growth, migration, and invasion abilities. Our data suggest that HERV activation in tumors drives the synchronized elevation of KZFP expression, presumably leading to tumor suppression.},

No detailed structural analysis has been performed of this material. Moreover, there is little information on the relevance of well-studied artificially induced polymers to these disease-associated molecules. We have isolated polymers from the liver tissue of Z α 1 -antitrypsin homozygotes (E342K) who have undergone transplantation, labeled them using a Fab fragment, and performed single-particle analysis of negative-stain electron micrographs.

Although brain correlates of social processes such as empathy and theory of mind have been studied using single-subject designs, specific behavioral and neural mechanisms underpinning the patient-clinician interaction are unknown. Using a two-person interactive design, we simultaneously recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (hyperscanning) in patient-clinician dyads, who interacted via live video, while clinicians treated evoked pain in patients with chronic pain. Our results show that patient analgesia is mediated by patient-clinician nonverbal behavioral mirroring and brain-to-brain concordance in circuitry implicated in theory of mind and social mirroring. Dyad-based analyses showed extensive dynamic coupling of these brain nodes with the partners’ brain activity, yet only in dyads with pre-established clinical rapport.

In a 30-day mesocosm experiment exposing native benthic aquatic invertebrates to the common insecticide fipronil and four degradates, fipronil compounds caused altered emergence and trophic cascades. Effect concentrations eliciting a 50\% response (EC 50 ) were developed for fipronil and its sulfide, sulfone, and desulfinyl degradates; taxa were insensitive to fipronil amide. Hazard concentrations for 5\% of affected species derived from up to 15 mesocosm EC 50 values were used to convert fipronil compound concentrations in field samples to the sum of toxic units (∑TU Fipronils ). Mean ∑TU Fipronils exceeded 1 (indicating toxicity) in 16\% of streams sampled from five regional studies. The Species at Risk invertebrate metric was negatively associated with ∑TU Fipronils in four of five regions sampled. This ecological risk assessment indicates that low concentrations of fipronil compounds degrade stream communities in multiple regions of the United States.},

However, conventional microscopes/miniscopes are inherently constrained by their limited space-bandwidth product, shallow depth of field (DOF), and inability to resolve three-dimensional (3D) distributed emitters. Here, we present a Computational Miniature Mesoscope (CM 2 ) that overcomes these bottlenecks and enables single-shot 3D imaging across an 8 mm by 7 mm field of view and 2.5-mm DOF, achieving 7-μm lateral resolution and better than 200-μm axial resolution. The CM 2 features a compact lightweight design that integrates a microlens array for imaging and a light-emitting diode array for excitation. Its expanded imaging capability is enabled by computational imaging that augments the optics by algorithms. We experimentally validate the mesoscopic imaging capability on 3D fluorescent samples. We further quantify the effects of scattering and background fluorescence on phantom experiments.},

SPOTlight relies on imaging visual phenotypes by microscopy, precise optical tagging of single target cells, and retrieval of tagged cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. To illustrate SPOTlight’s ability to screen cells based on temporal properties, we chose to develop a photostable yellow fluorescent protein for extended imaging experiments. We screened 3 million cells expressing mutagenesis libraries and identified a bright new variant, mGold, that is the most photostable yellow fluorescent protein reported to date.

Such findings raise the question of how the loss of PRDM9 is circumvented to maintain fertility. We show that genetic background and sex-specific modifiers can obviate the requirement for PRDM9 in mice. Specifically, the meiotic DNA damage checkpoint protein CHK2 acts as a modifier allowing female-specific fertility in the absence of PRDM9. We also report that, in the absence of PRDM9, a PRDM9-independent recombination system is compatible with female meiosis and fertility, suggesting sex-specific regulation of meiotic recombination, a finding with implications for speciation.},

This contrasts with the broadly held idea of a gently sloping ice-bonded permafrost table extending from land to offshore. The extensive unfrozen zone is a marine talik connected to on-land cryopeg. This zone is a potential source and conduit for water and dissolved organic matter, is vulnerable to physical degradation, and is liable to changes in biogeochemical processes that affect carbon cycling and climate feedbacks.},

Common variants in region of FAM171A2 were associated with lower CSF PGRN levels (rs708384, P = 3.95 × 10 −12 ). This was replicated in another independent cohort. The rs708384 was associated with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia and could modify the expression of the FAM171A2 gene. FAM171A2 was considerably expressed in the vascular endothelium and microglia, which are rich in PGRN. The in vitro study further confirmed that the rs708384 mutation up-regulated the expression of FAM171A2, which caused a decrease in the PGRN level.

Our 14, 000-year multiproxy record reveals an ecosystem state shift following seabird establishment 5000 years ago, as marine-derived nutrients from guano facilitated tussac establishment, peat productivity, and increased fire. Seabird arrival coincided with regional cooling, suggesting that the Falkland Islands are a cold-climate refugium.

  abstract     = {The “mismatch” between evolved human physiology and Western lifestyles is thought to explain the current epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in industrialized societies. However, this hypothesis has been difficult to test because few populations concurrently span ancestral and modern lifestyles. To address this gap, we collected interview and biomarker data from individuals of Turkana ancestry who practice subsistence-level, nomadic pastoralism (the ancestral way of life for this group), as well as individuals who no longer practice pastoralism and live in urban areas. We found that Turkana who move to cities exhibit poor cardiometabolic health, partially because of a shift toward “Western diets” high in refined carbohydrates. We also show that being born in an urban area independently predicts adult health, such that life-long city dwellers will experience the greatest CVD risk. By focusing on a substantial lifestyle gradient, our work thus informs the timing, magnitude, and evolutionary causes of CVD.},

Here, we demonstrated that addition of alkali cations in hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites led to substantially elevated carrier temperature, reduced threshold for phonon bottleneck, and enhanced hot carrier transport. The synergetic effects from the Rb, Cs, and K cations result in ~900 K increase in the effective carrier temperature at a carrier density around 10 18 cm −3 with an excitation 1.45 eV above the bandgap. In the doped thin films, the protected hot carriers migrate 100 s of nanometers longer than the undoped sample as imaged by ultrafast microscopy. We attributed these improvements to the relaxation of lattice strain and passivation of halide vacancies by alkali cations based on x-ray structural characterizations and first principles calculations.},

While some monkey species are reported to process auditory nonadjacent dependencies, comparative data from apes are missing, complicating inferences regarding shared ancestry. Here, we examined nonadjacent dependency processing in common marmosets, chimpanzees, and humans using “artificial grammars”: strings of arbitrary acoustic stimuli composed of adjacent (nonhumans) or nonadjacent (all species) dependencies. Individuals from each species (i) generalized the grammars to novel stimuli and (ii) detected grammatical violations, indicating that they processed the dependencies between constituent elements. Furthermore, there was no difference between marmosets and chimpanzees in their sensitivity to nonadjacent dependencies. These notable similarities between monkeys, apes, and humans indicate that nonadjacent dependency processing, a crucial cognitive facilitator of language, is an ancestral trait that evolved at least ~40 million years before language itself.},

Depletion of lung macrophages alleviated arthritis, whereas intranasal supplement of Ym1 protein to Ym1 -deficient mice reversed the disease, suggesting a key role of Ym1 for inflammatory activity by lung macrophages. Ym1 -deficient mice with pneumonitis had less eosinophil infiltration, reduced production of type II cytokines and IgG1, and skewing of macrophages toward alternative activation due to enhanced STAT6 activation. Proteomics analysis connected Ym1 polymorphism with changed lipid metabolism. Induced PPAR-γ and lipid metabolism in Ym1 -deficient macrophages contributed to cellular polarization.

  abstract     = {Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, has been implicated in eliminating pathogenic infections. However, macrophage pyroptosis–related proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb ) have largely gone unexplored. Here, we identified a cell pyroptosis–inducing protein, Rv1579c, named EST12, secreted from the M.tb H37Rv region of difference 3. EST12 binds to the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) in macrophages, and the EST12-RACK1 complex recruits the deubiquitinase UCHL5 to promote the K48-linked deubiquitination of NLRP3, subsequently leading to an NLRP3 inflammasome caspase-1/11–pyroptosis gasdermin D–interleukin-1β immune process. Analysis of the crystal structure of EST12 reveals that the amino acid Y80 acts as a critical binding site for RACK1. An EST12-deficient strain (H37RvΔEST12) displayed higher susceptibility to M.tb infection in vitro and in vivo. These results provide the first proof that RACK1 acts as an endogenous host sensor for pathogens and that EST12-RACK1–induced pyroptosis plays a pivotal role in M.tb -induced immunity.},

We found that knockout of VGLL4 in mesenchymal stem cells and preosteoblasts showed osteoporosis and a cleidocranial dysplasia–like phenotype due to osteoblast differentiation disorders. Mechanistically, we showed that the TEAD transcriptional factors severely inhibited osteoblast differentiation in a YAP binding–independent manner. TEADs interacted with RUNX2 to repress RUNX2 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, VGLL4 relieved the transcriptional inhibition of TEADs by directly competing with RUNX2 to bind TEADs through its two TDU domains. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that VGLL4 plays an important role in regulating osteoblast differentiation and bone development, and that TEADs regulate the transcriptional activity of RUNX2, which may shed light on treatment of cleidocranial dysplasia and osteoporosis.},

We have proposed a novel analytic strategy—quasi-paired cohort—and applied it to a metagenomic study of the ASD microbiome. By comparing paired samples of ASD and neurotypical subjects, we have identified significant deficiencies in ASD children in detoxifying enzymes and pathways, which show a strong correlation with biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction. Diagnostic models based on these detoxifying enzymes accurately distinguished ASD individuals from controls, and the dysfunction score inferred from the model increased with the clinical rating scores of ASD. In summary, our results suggest a previously undiscovered potential role of impaired intestinal microbial detoxification in toxin accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction, a core component of ASD pathogenesis. These findings pave the way for designing future therapeutic strategies to restore microbial detoxification capabilities for patients with ASD.},

EwS is defined by a chromosomal translocation, EWSR1-FLI1 being the most common, that causes genome reprogramming through remodeling of enhancers. Here, we describe an unexpected function of RING1B, which is highly expressed in EwS. While retaining its repressive activity at Polycomb developmental regulated genes, RING1B colocalizes with EWSR1-FLI1 at active enhancers. We demonstrate that RING1B is necessary for the expression of key EWSR1-FLI1 targets by facilitating oncogene recruitment to their enhancers. Knockdown of RING1B impairs growth of tumor xenografts and expression of genes regulated by EWSR1-FLI1 bound enhancers. Pharmacological inhibition of AURKB with AZD1152 increases H2Aub levels causing down-regulation of RING1B/EWSR1-FLI1 common targets.

Mouse CD1d1, an ortholog of human CD1d mainly participating in lipid-antigen presentation to NKT cells, is able to generate intrinsic signals upon stimulation. Mice with macrophage-specific CD1d1 deficiency ( Lym CD1d1−/− ) acquire resistance to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)–induced colitis, attributing to the transcriptional inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome components. The hyperactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome accounts for gut epithelial proliferation and intestine-blood barrier integrity. Mechanistically, occupancy by the natural ligand glycosphingolipid iGb3, CD1d1 responds with intracellular Ser 330 dephosphorylation thus to reduce the Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1)–associated AKT-STAT1 phosphorylation and subsequent NF-κB activation, eventually causing transcriptional down-regulation of Nlrp3 and its immediate substrates Il1b and Il18 in macrophages. Therefore, the counterbalancing role of CD1d1 in macrophages appears to determine severity of DSS-mediated colitis in mice. These findings propose new intervention strategies for treating IBD and other inflammatory disorders.},

Here, we found that increased HSF-1 activity elevates histone H4 levels in somatic tissues during development, while knockdown of H4 completely suppresses HSF-1–mediated longevity. Moreover, overexpression of H4 is sufficient to extend life span. Ablation of HSB-1 induces an H4-dependent increase in micrococcal nuclease protection of both nuclear chromatin and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which consequently results in reduced transcription of mtDNA-encoded complex IV genes, decreased respiratory capacity, and a mitochondrial unfolded protein response–dependent life-span extension.

These radiocarbon ages provide a maximum calibrated (cal) age range for Clovis of ~13, 050 to ~12, 750 cal yr B.P. This radiocarbon record suggests that Clovis first appeared at the end of the Allerød and is one of at least three contemporary archaeological complexes in the Western Hemisphere during the terminal Pleistocene. Stemmed projectile points in western North America are coeval and even older than Clovis, and the Fishtail point complex is well established in the southern cone of South America by ~12, 900 cal yr B.P. Clovis disappeared ~12, 750 cal yr B.P. at the beginning of the Younger Dryas, coincident with the extinction of the remaining North American megafauna (Proboscideans) and the appearance of multiple North American regional archaeological complexes.},

Acute stress and depressive symptoms increased significantly over time as COVID-19 deaths increased across the United States. Preexisting mental and physical health diagnoses, daily COVID-19–related media exposure, conflicting COVID-19 information in media, and secondary stressors were all associated with acute stress and depressive symptoms.

We determined crystal structures of two of these inhibitors in complex with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro that reveals their inhibitory mechanisms and provides a molecular basis for the observed substrate specificity profiles. Last, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro harbors deISGylating activity similar to SARSCoV-1 PLpro but its ability to hydrolyze K48-linked Ub chains is diminished, which our sequence and structure analysis provides a basis for.

Adaptation has been postulated to arise from recurrent circuit mechanisms or as a consequence of neuronally intrinsic suppression. However, it is unclear whether intrinsic suppression by itself can account for effects beyond reduced responses. Here, we test the hypothesis that complex adaptation phenomena can emerge from intrinsic suppression cascading through a feedforward model of visual processing. A deep convolutional neural network with intrinsic suppression captured neural signatures of adaptation including novelty detection, enhancement, and tuning curve shifts, while producing aftereffects consistent with human perception. When adaptation was trained in a task where repeated input affects recognition performance, an intrinsic mechanism generalized better than a recurrent neural network. Our results demonstrate that feedforward propagation of intrinsic suppression changes the functional state of the network, reproducing key neurophysiological and perceptual properties of adaptation.},

Yet, despite high intracolony relatedness, the innate development of colony-specific chemical signatures by individual colony members is largely determined by the colony environment, rather than solely relying on genetic variants shared by nestmates. Therefore, it is puzzling how a nongenic factor could drive the innate development of a quantitative trait that is shared by members of the same colony. Here, we provide one solution to this conundrum by showing that nestmate recognition cues in honey bees are defined, at least in part, by shared characteristics of the gut microbiome across individual colony members. These results illustrate the importance of host-microbiome interactions as a source of variation in animal behavioral traits.},

Here, we experimentally show how nonlinear interferometry with entangled light can provide a powerful tool for mid-IR microscopy while only requiring near-IR detection with a silicon-based camera. In this proof-of-principle implementation, we demonstrate widefield imaging over a broad wavelength range covering 3.4 to 4.3 μm and demonstrate a spatial resolution of 35 μm for images containing 650 resolved elements. Moreover, we demonstrate that our technique is suitable for acquiring microscopic images of biological tissue samples in the mid-IR.

Particles directly delivered to the lung via intratracheal administration demonstrated more substantial reduction in EAE severity when compared with particles delivered to the liver and spleen via intravenous administration. Intratracheally delivered particles were associated with lung APCs and decreased costimulatory molecule expression on the APCs, which inhibited CD4 + T cell proliferation and reduced their population in the central nervous system while increasing them in the lung.

Our ac calorimetry, electrical resistivity, and x-ray absorption study of UTe 2 under applied pressure reveals key insights on the superconducting and magnetic states surrounding pressure-induced quantum criticality at P c1 = 1.3 GPa. First, our specific heat data at low pressures, combined with a phenomenological model, show that pressure alters the balance between two closely competing superconducting orders. Second, near 1.5 GPa, we detect two bulk transitions that trigger changes in the resistivity, which are consistent with antiferromagnetic order, rather than ferromagnetism. Third, the emergence of magnetism is accompanied by an increase in valence toward a U 4+ (5 f 2 ) state, which indicates that UTe 2 exhibits intermediate valence at ambient pressure. Our results suggest that antiferromagnetic fluctuations may play a more substantial role on the superconducting state of UTe 2 than previously thought.},

Here, we report a polymer–metal-organic framework that provides simultaneous and uninterrupted sorption and release of atmospheric water. The adaptable nature of the hydro-active polymer, and its hybridization with a metal-organic framework, enables enhanced sorption kinetics, water uptake, and spontaneous water oozing. We demonstrate continuous water delivery for 1440 hours, producing 6 g of fresh water per gram of sorbent at 90\% relative humidity (RH) per day without active condensation.

We found that learning of olfactory discrimination elevates odor responses of young abGCs and increases their apical dendritic spines. This plasticity did not occur in abGCs during passive odor experience nor in resident granule cells (rGCs) during learning. Furthermore, we found that feedback projections from the piriform cortex show elevated activity during learning, and activating piriform feedback elicited stronger excitatory postsynaptic currents in abGCs than rGCs. Inactivation of piriform feedback blocked abGC plasticity during learning, and activation of piriform feedback during passive experience induced learning-like plasticity of abGCs.

Using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with tensor-based morphometry (TBM), we mapped the spatiotemporal pattern of structural changes in a mouse model of AD-like progressive tauopathy. A novel, coregistered in vivo MRI atlas was then applied to identify regions in the medial temporal lobe that had a significant volume reduction.

Here, using in situ biasing transmission electron microscopy, we studied the thickness-dependent domain switching behavior and predicted the trend of ferroelectricity in nanoscale materials induced by surface strain. We discovered that sample thickness plays a critical role in tailoring the domain switching behavior and ferroelectric properties of single-crystal ferroelectrics, arising from the huge surface strain and the resulting surface reconstruction.

  abstract     = {“Living” cell sheets or bioelectronic chips have great potentials to improve the quality of diagnostics and therapies. However, handling these thin and delicate materials remains a grand challenge because the external force applied for gripping and releasing can easily deform or damage the materials. This study presents a soft manipulator that can manipulate and transport cell/tissue sheets and ultrathin wearable biosensing devices seamlessly by recapitulating how a cephalopod’s suction cup works. The soft manipulator consists of an ultrafast thermo-responsive, microchanneled hydrogel layer with tissue-like softness and an electric heater layer. The electric current to the manipulator drives microchannels of the gel to shrink/expand and results in a pressure change through the microchannels. The manipulator can lift/detach an object within 10 s and can be used repeatedly over 50 times. This soft manipulator would be highly useful for safe and reliable assembly and implantation of therapeutic cell/tissue sheets and biosensing devices.},

We quantified PPI-specific CD8 + T cells within different areas of the human pancreas from nondiabetic controls, autoantibody-positive donors, and donors with T1D to investigate their role in diabetes development. This spatial cellular quantitation revealed unusually high frequencies of autoreactive CD8 + T cells supporting the hypothesis that PPI is indeed a key autoantigen. To our surprise, PPI-specific CD8 + T cells were already abundantly present in the nondiabetic pancreas, thus questioning the dogma that T1D is caused by defective thymic deletion or systemic immune dysregulation. During T1D development, these cells accumulated in and around islets, indicating that an islet-specific trigger such as up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class I might be essential to unmask beta cells to the immune system.},

Their dynamic is determined by the linkage between ubiquitins and by the number of ubiquitin units. Characterizing polyubiquitin behavior as a function of their length is hampered because of increasing system size and conformational variability. Here, we introduce a new approach to efficiently integrating small-angle x-ray scattering with simulations allowing us to accurately characterize the dynamics of linear di-, tri-, and tetraubiquitin in the free state as well as of diubiquitin in complex with NEMO, a central regulator in the NF-κB pathway. Our results show that the behavior of the diubiquitin subunits is independent of the presence of additional ubiquitin modules and that the dynamics of polyubiquitins with different lengths follow a simple model. Together with experimental data from multiple biophysical techniques, we then rationalize the 2:1 NEMO:polyubiquitin binding.},

For triblock terpolymers, an alternating gyroid (G A ) with two chiral networks from distinct end blocks can be formed; however, the network chirality could be positive or negative arbitrarily, giving an achiral phase. Here, by taking advantage of chirality transfer at different length scales, G A with controlled chirality can be achieved through the self-assembly of a chiral triblock terpolymer. With the homochiral evolution from monomer to multichain domain morphology through self-assembly, the triblock terpolymer composed of a chiral end block with a single-handed helical polymer chain gives the chiral network from the chiral end block having a particular handed network.

Here, we develop a mathematical and computational framework for probabilistic artificial intelligence (AI)–based predictive modeling combining data, expert knowledge, multiscale models, and information theory through uncertainty quantification and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). We apply PGMs to chemistry specifically and develop predictive guarantees for PGMs generally. Our proposed framework, combining AI and uncertainty quantification, provides explainable results leading to correctable and, eventually, trustworthy models.

We describe a previously unexplored gas gating mechanism driven by reversible electrochemical metal deposition/dissolution on a conductive membrane, which can continuously modulate the interfacial gas permeability over two orders of magnitude with high efficiency and short response time. The gating mechanism involves neither moving parts nor dead volume and can therefore enable various engineering processes. An electrochemically mediated carbon dioxide concentrator demonstrates proof of concept by integrating the gating membranes with redox-active sorbents, where gating effectively prevented the cross-talk between feed and product gas streams for high-efficiency, directional carbon dioxide pumping. We anticipate our concept of dynamically regulating transport at gas-liquid interfaces to broadly inspire systems in fields of gas separation, miniaturized devices, multiphase reactors, and beyond.},

Solar storms strip a planet’s atmosphere over time, and only a strong magnetosphere would be able to provide maximum protection. We present simplified magnetic dipole field modeling confined within a paraboloidal-shaped magnetopause to show how the expected Earth-Moon coupled magnetospheres provide a substantial buffer from the expected intense solar wind, reducing Earth’s atmospheric loss to space.},

Here, we compile thermocline temperature records of the Indo-Pacific warm pool over the past 25, 000 years, which reveal a major warming in the Early Holocene and a secondary warming in the Middle Holocene. We suggest that the first thermocline warming corresponds to heat transport of southern Pacific shallow overturning circulation driven by June (austral winter) insolation maximum. The second thermocline warming follows equatorial September insolation maximum, which may have caused a steeper west-east upper-ocean thermal gradient and an intensified Walker circulation in the equatorial Pacific. We propose that the warm pool thermocline warming ultimately reduced the interannual ENSO activity in the Early to Middle Holocene. Thus, a substantially increased oceanic heat content of the warm pool, acting as a negative feedback for ENSO in the past, may play its role in the ongoing global warming.},

While the majority of cGAS is cytoplasmic, a fraction of cGAS associates with chromatin. cGAS interacts with replication fork proteins in a DNA binding–dependent manner, suggesting that cGAS encounters replication forks in DNA. Independent of cGAMP and STING, cGAS slows replication forks by binding to DNA in the nucleus. In the absence of cGAS, replication forks are accelerated, but fork stability is compromised. Consequently, cGAS-deficient cells are exposed to replication stress and become increasingly sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy. Thus, by acting as a decelerator of DNA replication forks, cGAS controls replication dynamics and suppresses replication-associated DNA damage, suggesting that cGAS is an attractive target for exploiting the genomic instability of cancer cells.},

We established a compendium of genetic evidence that supports cardiovascular risk induced by antineoplastic drugs. Most of this genetic evidence is attributed to causal alleles altering the expression of cardiovascular disease genes. We found that antineoplastic drugs predicted to induce cardiovascular risk are significantly enriched in drugs associated with cardiovascular adverse reactions, including many first-line cancer treatments. Functional experiments validated that retinoid X receptor agonists can reduce triglyceride lipolysis, thus modulating cardiovascular risk.

We demonstrate that elevated CO 2 causes substantial losses of ammonium-nitrogen that result from anaerobic oxidation of ammonium coupled to reduction of iron. We identify a new autotrophic member of the bacterial order Burkholderiales that may use soil CO 2 as a carbon source to couple anaerobic ammonium oxidation and iron reduction.

Using carbon isotopes and biomarkers, we demonstrate that the three most recent warming events recorded in Greenland ice cores—(i) Dansgaard-Oeschger event 3 (~28 ka B.P.), (ii) Bølling-Allerød (14.7 to 12.9 ka B.P.), and (iii) early Holocene (~11.7 ka B.P.)—caused massive remobilization and carbon degradation from permafrost across northeast Siberia. This amplified permafrost carbon release by one order of magnitude, particularly during the last deglaciation when global sea-level rise caused rapid flooding of the land area thereafter constituting the vast East Siberian Arctic Shelf.

For transcription, active Pol I formed small clusters/condensates that constrained rDNA chromatin in the nucleolus fibrillar center (FC). Treatment with a transcription inhibitor induced Pol I to dissociate from rDNA chromatin and to move like a liquid within the nucleolar cap that transformed from the FC. Expression of a Pol I mutant associated with a craniofacial disorder inhibited transcription by competing with wild-type Pol I clusters and transforming the FC into the nucleolar cap. The cap droplet excluded an initiation factor, ensuring robust silencing.

  abstract     = {We uncover a cycling and NF-κB–driven lncRNA (named Lnc-UC ) that epigenetically modifies transcription of circadian clock gene Rev-erb α, thereby linking circadian clock to colitis. Cycling expression of Lnc-UC is generated by the central clock protein Bmal1 via an E-box element. NF-κB activation in experimental colitis transcriptionally drives Lnc-UC through direct binding to two κB sites. Lnc-UC ablation disrupts colonic expressions of clock genes in mice; particularly, Rev-erb α is down-regulated and its diurnal rhythm is blunted. Consistently, Lnc-UC promotes expression of Rev-erbα (a known dual NF-κB/Nlrp3 repressor) to inactivate NF-κB signaling and Nlrp3 inflammasome in macrophages. Furthermore, Lnc-UC ablation sensitizes mice to experimental colitis and abolishes the diurnal rhythmicity in disease severity. Mechanistically, Lnc-UC physically interacts with Cbx1 protein to reduce its gene silencing activity via H3K9me3, thereby enhancing Rev-erbα transcription and expression. In addition, we identify a human Lnc-UC that has potential to promote Rev-erbα expression and restrain inflammations.},

Paired deep (∆ 14 C and δ 11 B) and surface (δ 15 N) proxy data point to enhanced upwelling coupled with reduced efficiency of the biological pump at 14.6 and 11.7 thousand years (ka) ago, which would have facilitated rapid carbon release to the atmosphere. Transient periods of unusually well-ventilated waters in the deep Southern Ocean occurred at 16.3 and 12.8 ka ago. Contemporaneous atmospheric carbon records indicate that these Southern Ocean ventilation events are also important in releasing respired carbon from the deep ocean to the atmosphere. Our results thus highlight two distinct modes of Southern Ocean circulation and biogeochemistry associated with centennial-scale atmospheric CO 2 jumps during the last deglaciation.},

These ecosystem changes have been alternately attributed to either human activities, climate change, or both, but parsing their relative importance, particularly in the case of Madagascar, has proven difficult. Here, we present a multimillennial (approximately the past 8000 years) reconstruction of the southwest Indian Ocean hydroclimate variability using speleothems from the island of Rodrigues, located ∼1600 km east of Madagascar. The record shows a recurring pattern of hydroclimate variability characterized by submillennial-scale drying trends, which were punctuated by decadal-to-multidecadal megadroughts, including during the late Holocene. Our data imply that the megafauna of the Mascarenes and Madagascar were resilient, enduring repeated past episodes of severe climate stress, but collapsed when a major increase in human activity occurred in the context of a prominent drying trend.},

Of particular interest is the graphene-polymer interface, which is constantly subjected to dynamic loading in applications, including flexible electronics and multifunctional coatings. Through in situ cyclic loading, we directly observed interfacial fatigue propagation at the graphene-polymer interface, which was revealed to satisfy a modified Paris’ law. Furthermore, cyclic loading through vdW contact was able to cause fatigue fracture of even pristine graphene through a combined in-plane shear and out-of-plane tear mechanism. Shear fracture was found to mainly initiate at the fold junctions induced by cyclic loading and propagate parallel to the loading direction. Fracture mechanics analysis was conducted to explain the kinetics of an exotic self-tearing behavior of graphene during cyclic loading. This work offers mechanistic insights into the dynamic reliability of graphene and graphene-polymer interface, which could facilitate the durable design of graphene-based structures.},

A gravity-driven, highly viscous glycerol droplet inside a sealed superhydrophobic capillary is moving more than 10 times faster than a water droplet with three-orders-of-magnitude lower viscosity. Using tracer particles, we show that the low-viscosity droplets are rapidly rotating internally, with flow velocities greatly exceeding the center-of-mass velocity. This is in stark contrast to the faster moving high-viscosity droplets with nearly vanishing internal flows. The anomalous viscosity-enhanced flow is caused by a viscosity-suppressed deformation of the droplet-air interface and a hydro- and aerodynamic coupling between the droplet and the air trapped within the micro/nanostructures (plastron). Our work demonstrates the unexpected role of the plastron in controlling fluid flow beyond the mere reduction in contact area and friction.},

We analyzed changes in the skin and gut microbiota and blood immune markers of children during a 28-day biodiversity intervention. Children in standard urban and nature-oriented daycare centers were analyzed for comparison. The intervention diversified both the environmental and skin Gammaproteobacterial communities, which, in turn, were associated with increases in plasma TGF-β1 levels and the proportion of regulatory T cells.

These relationships can be quantified for tectonically active landscapes, and calculations based on them enable estimation of erosion where observations are lacking. Tests of the predictive power of this relationship in the Himalaya, where erosion is well constrained, affirm the value of our approach. Our model allows estimation of erosion rates in fluvial landscapes using readily available datasets, and the underlying relationship between erosion and rainfall offers the promise of a deeper understanding of how climate and tectonic evolution affect erosion and topography in space and time and of the potential influence of climate on tectonics.},

The analysis of the graphs allows to visualizing time-crystalline order and to analyze features of the quantum system. For example, we explore in detail the melting process of a minimal model of a period-2 discrete time crystal and describe it in terms of the evolution of the associated graph structure. We show that during the melting process, the network evolution exhibits an emergent preferential attachment mechanism, directly associated with the existence of scale-free networks.

However, the location of CO self-shielding (molecular cloud or protoplanetary disk) remains unknown. Here we show that CAIs with predominantly low ( 26 Al/ 27 Al) 0 , &lt;5 × 10 −6 , exhibit a large inter-CAI range of Δ 17 O, from −40‰ to −5‰. In contrast, CAIs with the canonical ( 26 Al/ 27 Al) 0 of ~5 × 10 −5 from unmetamorphosed carbonaceous chondrites have a limited range of Δ 17 O, −24 ± 2‰. Because CAIs with low ( 26 Al/ 27 Al) 0 are thought to have predated the canonical CAIs and formed within first 10, 000–20, 000 years of the Solar System evolution, these observations suggest oxygen isotopic heterogeneity in the early solar system was inherited from the protosolar molecular cloud.},

  abstract     = {Embodied models suggest that moral judgments are strongly intertwined with first-hand somatic experiences, with some pointing to disgust, and others arguing for a role of pain/harm. Both disgust and pain are unpleasant, arousing experiences, with strong relevance for survival, but with distinctive sensory qualities and neural channels. Hence, it is unclear whether moral cognition interacts with sensory-specific properties of one somatic experience or with supramodal dimensions common to both. Across two experiments, participants evaluated ethical dilemmas and subsequently were exposed to disgusting (olfactory) or painful (thermal) stimulations of matched unpleasantness. We found that moral scenarios enhanced physiological and neural activity to subsequent disgust (but not pain), as further supported by an independently validated whole-brain signature of olfaction. This effect was mediated by activity in the posterior cingulate cortex triggered by dilemma judgments. Our results thus speak in favor of an association between moral cognition and sensory-specific properties of disgust.},

By modeling the northern and southern hemispheres separately, we find that longitudinal ridges previously identified in the north extend into the south but are obscured there by surface material. In the south, more numerous large boulders effectively retain surface materials and imply a higher average strength at depth to support them. The north has fewer large boulders and more evidence of boulder dynamics (toppling and downslope movement) and surface flow. These factors result in Bennu’s southern hemisphere being rounder and smoother, whereas its northern hemisphere has higher slopes and a less regular shape. We infer an originally asymmetric distribution of large boulders followed by a partial disruption, leading to wedge formation in Bennu’s history.},

The lower transition temperature of the conjugates with longer ELP or CLP domains enables the formation of well-defined nanoparticles near physiological temperature. Moreover, the morphological transition from vesicles to platelet-like nanostructures occurred when the ratio of the lengths of ELP/CLP decreased. Given the previously demonstrated ability of many ELP-CLP bioconjugates to bind to both hydrophobic drugs and collagen-containing materials, our results suggest new opportunities for designing specific thermoresponsive nanostructures for targeted biological applications.},

These depletions and associated isotopic fractionations were initially believed to result from thermal processing in the protoplanetary disk, but so far, no correlation between the K depletion and its isotopic composition has been found. Our new high-precision K isotope data correlate with other neutron-rich nuclides (e.g., 64 Ni and 54 Cr) and suggest that the observed 41 K variations have a nucleosynthetic origin. We propose that K isotope anomalies are inherited from an isotopically heterogeneous protosolar molecular cloud, and were preserved in bulk primitive meteorites. Thus, the heterogeneous distribution of both refractory and moderately volatile elements in chondritic meteorites points to a limited radial mixing in the protoplanetary disk.},

These technologies could be further developed by directly integrating microfluidics with electronic sensors and curvilinear substrates as well as improved automation for higher throughput. Current additive manufacturing methods, such as stereolithography and multi-jet printing, tend to contaminate substrates with uncured resins or supporting materials during printing. Here, we present a printing methodology based on precisely extruding viscoelastic inks into self-supporting microchannels and chambers without requiring sacrificial materials. We demonstrate that, in the submillimeter regime, the yield strength of the as-extruded silicone ink is sufficient to prevent creep within a certain angular range. Printing toolpaths are specifically designed to realize leakage-free connections between channels and chambers, T-shaped intersections, and overlapping channels. The self-supporting microfluidic structures enable the automatable fabrication of multifunctional devices, including multimaterial mixers, microfluidic-integrated sensors, automation components, and 3D microfluidics.},

Here, we demonstrate a technique to control the solution meniscus, allowing to manufacture single-crystalline organic semiconductor (OSC) films on the highest lyophobic amorphous perfluoropolymer, Cytop. We used U-shaped metal film pattern produced on the Cytop surface, to initiate OSC film growth and to keep the meniscus extended on the Cytop surface. The growing edge of the OSC film helped maintain the meniscus extension, leading to a successive film growth. This technique facilitates extremely sharp switching transistors with a subthreshold swing of 63 mV dec −1 owing to the effective elimination of charge traps at the semiconductor/dielectric interface. The technique should expand the capability of print production of functional films and devices.},

This plastic instability arises from collective dynamics of dislocations interacting with mobile solute atoms, but the resulting sensitivity to the strain rate lacks fundamental understanding. Here, we show, by using high-resolution imaging in tensile deformation experiments of an aluminum alloy, that the band velocities exhibit large fluctuations. Each band produces a velocity signal reminiscent of crackling noise bursts observed in numerous driven avalanching systems from propagating cracks in fracture to the Barkhausen effect in ferromagnets. The statistical features of these velocity bursts including their average shapes and size distributions obey predictions of a simple mean-field model of critical avalanche dynamics. Our results thus reveal a previously unknown paradigm of criticality in the localization of deformation.},

In addition, humanizing blood thiamine content of mice through diet sensitizes SLC19A2-low leukemia cells to ASNase in vivo.

Here, we developed a glycosylated “triple-interaction” stabilized polymeric siRNA nanomedicine (Gal-NP@siRNA) to target BACE1 in APP/PS1 transgenic AD mouse model. Gal-NP@siRNA exhibits superior blood stability and can efficiently penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via glycemia-controlled glucose transporter-1 (Glut1)–mediated transport, thereby ensuring that siRNAs decrease BACE1 expression and modify relative pathways.

Mechanistically, OGD triggered a burst in reactive oxygen species that induced both DSBs and translocation of WRAP53 to the nucleus to promote DNA repair, a pathway that was confirmed in an in vivo mouse model of stroke. Noticeably, nuclear translocation of WRAP53 occurred faster in OGD neurons expressing the Wrap53 human nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2287499 (c.202C&gt;G).

  abstract     = {Axon regeneration constitutes a fundamental challenge for regenerative neurobiology, which necessitates the use of tailor-made biomaterials for controllable delivery of cells and biomolecules. An increasingly popular approach for creating these materials is to directly assemble engineered proteins into high-order structures, a process that often relies on sophisticated protein chemistry. Here, we present a simple approach for creating injectable, photoresponsive hydrogels via metal-directed assembly of His6-tagged proteins. The B 12 -dependent photoreceptor protein CarH C can complex with transition metal ions through an amino-terminal His6-tag, which can further undergo a sol-gel transition upon addition of AdoB 12 , leading to the formation of hydrogels with marked injectability and photodegradability. The inducible phase transitions further enabled facile encapsulation and release of cells and proteins. Injecting the Zn 2+ -coordinated gels decorated with leukemia inhibitory factor into injured mouse optic nerves led to prolonged cellular signaling and enhanced axon regeneration. This study illustrates a powerful strategy for designing injectable biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {Fully implantable neural interfaces with massive recording channels bring the gospel to patients with motor or speech function loss. As the number of recording channels rapidly increases, conventional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chips for neural signal processing face severe challenges on parallelism scalability, computational cost, and power consumption. In this work, we propose a previously unexplored approach for parallel processing of multichannel neural signals in memristor arrays, taking advantage of their rich dynamic characteristics. The critical information of neural signal waveform is extracted and encoded in the memristor conductance modulation. A signal segmentation scheme is developed to adapt to device variations. To verify the fidelity of the processed results, seizure prediction is further demonstrated, with high accuracy above 95\% and also more than 1000× improvement in power efficiency compared with CMOS counterparts. This work suggests that memristor arrays could be a promising multichannel signal processing module for future implantable neural interfaces.},

Global maps of these two properties distinguish the boulder population on near-Earth asteroid (NEA) (101955) Bennu into two types that differ in strength, and both have lower thermal inertia than expected for boulders and meteorites. Neither has strongly temperature-dependent thermal properties. The weaker boulder type probably would not survive atmospheric entry and thus may not be represented in the meteorite collection. The maps also show a high–thermal inertia band at Bennu’s equator, which might be explained by processes such as compaction or strength sorting during mass movement, but these explanations are not wholly consistent with other data. Our findings imply that other C-complex NEAs likely have boulders similar to those on Bennu rather than finer-particulate regoliths. A tentative correlation between albedo and thermal inertia of C-complex NEAs may be due to relative abundances of boulder types.},

Here, we address this question quantitatively, using a custom-made library of 40 Bacillus subtilis strains expressing a fluorescent protein under the control of different transcription and translation control elements. We quantify noise and mean protein abundance by fluorescence microscopy and show that for most of the natural transcription range of B. subtilis , expression noise is equally sensitive to variations in the transcription or translation rate because of the prevalence of extrinsic noise. In agreement, analysis of whole-genome transcriptomic and proteomic datasets suggests that noise optimization through transcription and translation tuning during evolution may only occur in a regime of weak transcription. Therefore, independent control of mean abundance and noise can rarely be achieved, which has strong implications for both genome evolution and biological engineering.},

These approaches yield statistically consistent results up to degree and order 3, with the particle-based field being statistically significant up to degree and order 9. Comparisons with a constant-density shape model show that Bennu has a heterogeneous mass distribution. These deviations can be modeled with lower densities at Bennu’s equatorial bulge and center. The lower-density equator is consistent with recent migration and redistribution of material. The lower-density center is consistent with a past period of rapid rotation, either from a previous Yarkovsky-O’Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack cycle or arising during Bennu’s accretion following the disruption of its parent body.},

We combine analysis of a global dataset with a field study to support a simple hypothesis: River geometry adjusts to the threshold fluid entrainment stress of the most resistant material lining the channel. In addition, we demonstrate how changes in bank strength dictate planform morphology by exerting strong control on channel width. Our findings greatly extend the applicability of threshold channel theory, which was originally developed to explain straight gravel-bedded rivers with uniform grain size and stable banks. The parsimonious threshold-limiting channel model describes the average hydraulic state of natural rivers across a wide range of conditions and may find use in river management, stratigraphy, and planetary science.},

Here, we show, by analyzing spontaneous self-grooming in rats, that neuronal modulation in motor cortex and dorsal striatum is strongly related to transitions between behaviors. Our data suggest that longer action sequences in rodent grooming behavior emerge from stepwise control of individual behavioral transitions, where future actions are encoded differently depending on current motor state. This state-dependent motor coding was found to differentiate between rare behavioral transitions and as opposed to more habitual sequencing of actions.},

A safe and efficient system for the delivery of anticoagulants to mimic the physiological negative feedback mechanism by responding to the coagulation signal changes holds the promise and potential for anticoagulant therapy. Here, we exploit a “closed-loop” controlled release strategy for the delivery of recombinant hirudin, an anticoagulant agent that uses a self-regulated nanoscale polymeric gel. The cross-linked nanogel network increases the stability and bioavailability of hirudin and reduces its clearance in vivo. Equipped with the clot-targeted ligand, the engineered nanogels promote the accumulation of hirudin in the fibrous clots and adaptively release the encapsulated hirudin upon the thrombin variation during the pathological proceeding of thrombus for potentiating anticoagulant activity and alleviating adverse effects. We show that this formulation efficiently prevents and inhibits the clot formation on the mouse models of pulmonary embolism and thrombosis.},

Instead, we detected 4-hour rhythms that might be generated by ultradian oscillators underlying Hydra sleep. Microarray analysis in sleep-deprived Hydra revealed sleep-dependent expression of 212 genes, including cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (PRKG1) and ornithine aminotransferase. Sleep-promoting effects of melatonin, GABA, and PRKG1 were conserved in Hydra . However, arousing dopamine unexpectedly induced Hydra sleep. Opposing effects of ornithine metabolism on sleep were also evident between Hydra and Drosophila , suggesting the evolutionary switch of their sleep-regulatory functions. Thus, sleep-relevant physiology and sleep-regulatory components may have already been acquired at molecular levels in a brain-less metazoan phylum and reprogrammed accordingly.},

In particular, we generate two-photon N00N states and show that the state and spatial entanglement of the emitted photons are tunable via the qubit frequencies. Using quadrature amplitude detection, we reconstruct the moments and correlations of the photonic modes and demonstrate state preparation fidelities of 84\%.

  abstract     = {Mobile oxygen vacancies offer a substantial potential to broaden the range of optical functionalities of complex transition metal oxides due to their high mobility and the interplay with correlated electrons. Here, we report a large electro-absorptive optical variation induced by a topotactic transition via oxygen vacancy fluidic motion in calcium ferrite with large-scale uniformity. The coloration efficiency reaches ~80 cm 2 C −1 , which means that a 300-nm-thick layer blocks 99\% of transmitted visible light by the electrical switching. By tracking the color propagation, oxygen vacancy mobility can be estimated to be 10 −8 cm 2 s −1 V −1 near 300°C, which is a giant value attained due to the mosaic pseudomonoclinic film stabilized on LaAlO 3 substrate. First-principles calculations reveal that the defect density modulation associated with hole charge injection causes a prominent change in electron correlation, resulting in the light absorption modulation. Our findings will pave the pathway for practical topotactic electrochromic applications.},

We derived a product of annual global R s from 2000 to 2014 at 1 km by 1 km spatial resolution using remote sensing data and biome-specific statistical models. Different from the existing view that climate change dominated changes in R s , we showed that land-cover change played a more important role in regulating R s changes in temperate and boreal regions during 2000–2014. Significant changes in R s occurred more frequently in areas with significant changes in short vegetation cover (i.e., all vegetation shorter than 5 m in height) than in areas with significant climate change. These results contribute to our understanding of global R s patterns and highlight the importance of land-cover change in driving global and regional R s changes.},

It is unclear how Cenozoic climatic, geological, and biological forces, acting at diverse spatial and temporal scales, shaped Central Asian ecosystems through time. Our synthesis shows that the Central Asian steppe-desert has existed since at least Eocene times but experienced no less than two regime shifts, one at the Eocene–Oligocene Transition and one in the mid-Miocene. These shifts separated three successive “stable states, ” each characterized by unique floral and faunal structures. Past responses to disturbance in the Asian steppe-desert imply that modern ecosystems are unlikely to recover their present structures and diversity if forced into a new regime. This is of concern for Asian steppes today, which are being modified for human use and lost to desertification at unprecedented rates.},

In this gelation, percolation of the phase-separated structure occurs before the dynamical arrest, leading to the generation of mechanical stress in the gel network. Here, we find a previously unrecognized type of gelation in dilute colloidal suspensions, in which percolation occurs after the local dynamical arrest, i.e., the formation of mechanically stable, rigid clusters. Thus, topological percolation generates little mechanical stress, and the resulting gel is almost stress-free when formed. We also show that the selection of these two types of gelation (stressed and stress-free) is determined solely by the volume fraction as long as the interaction is short-ranged. This universal classification of gelation of particulate systems may have a substantial impact on material and biological science.},

Results indicated that SC was rapidly accumulated and long-term retained in ischemia-reperfusion–induced AKI kidneys, especially in renal tubules, which was possibly due to the specific interactions between SC and Kim-1. SC-TK-SS31 was then prepared by conjugating SS31, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, to SC via reactive oxygen species (ROS)–sensitive thioketal linker. Because of the effective renal distribution combined with ROS-responsive drug release behavior, the administration of SC-TK-SS31 led to an enhanced therapeutic effect of SS31 by protecting mitochondria from damage and reducing the oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell apoptosis.},

Through mathematical modeling of the skin and touch receptors, we show that vibrotaction is dominated by “surface” Rayleigh waves traveling cooperatively through all layers of the skin and bone. Applying our model to experimental data, we identify a universal scaling law for the depth of touch receptors across multiple species, indicating an evolutionarily conserved constant in the sensation of vibrations.},

All experiments contained solutions with anions previously thought to mobilize REE (chloride, fluoride, and carbonate), but REEs were extensively soluble only when alkalis were present. Dysprosium was more soluble than lanthanum when alkali complexed. Addition of silica either traps REE in early crystallizing apatite or negates solubility increases by immobilizing alkalis in silicates. Anionic species such as halogens and carbonates are not sufficient for REE mobility. Additional complexing with alkalis is required for substantial REE transport in and around carbonatites as a precursor for economic grade-mineralization.},

Whether these differences were already established at birth or appeared later during development is unknown. To delve into this question, we use virtual reconstruction tools and geometric morphometrics to recover the 3D morphology of the ribcages of four Neanderthal individuals from birth to around 3 years old: Mezmaiskaya 1, Le Moustier 2, Dederiyeh 1, and Roc de Marsal.

Here, we report state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of electrified Pt(111)/water interfaces, aiming at unraveling the structure and capacitive behavior of interface water. Our calculation reproduces the bell-shaped differential Helmholtz capacitance and shows that the interface water follows the Frumkin adsorption isotherm when varying the electrode potential, leading to a peculiar negative capacitive response.

Hierarchical carbon spheres preclude the agglomeration of graphene oxide, while graphene oxide sheets physically disperse, ensuring structural stability. The obtained HNMs contain micropores that are dominated by a combination of ultramicropores and mesopores, resulting in high VOCs/H 2 adsorption capacity, up to 235 and 352 mg/g at 200 ppmv and 3.3 weight\% (77 K and 1.2 bar), respectively.

  abstract     = {Manipulating orientation of organic emitters remains a formidable challenge in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Here, expansion of the acceptor plane of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters was demonstrated to selectively modulate emitting dipole orientation. Two proof-of-the-concept molecules, PXZPyPM and PXZTAZPM, were prepared by introducing a planar 2-phenylpyridine or 2, 4, 6-triphenyl-1, 3, 5-triazine substituent into a prototypical molecule (PXZPM) bearing a pyrimidine core and two phenoxazine donors. This design approach suppressed the influence of substituents on electronic structures and associated optoelectronic properties. Accordingly, PXZPyPM and PXZTAZPM preserved almost the same excited states and similar emission characteristics as PXZPM. The expanded acceptor plane of PXZPyPM and PXZTAZPM resulted in a 15 to 18\% increase in horizontal ratios of emitting dipole orientation. PXZPyPM supported its green device exhibiting an external quantum efficiency of 33.9\% and a power efficiency of 118.9 lumen per watt, competitive with the most efficient green TADF OLEDs reported so far.},

Here, the relative contributions of GW and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) to the long-term variability of TC track density (TCTD) over the North Pacific (NP) are quantified on the basis of statistical analyses and climate model simulations. Results show that historical GW mainly reduced (increased) TCTD over the western (eastern) NP, while the positive (negative) IPO corresponds to a NP basin–wide increase (decrease) in TCTD except in some coastal regions. The IPO has a much greater impact on TCTD over the western NP than GW, while the IPO and GW impacts are about equal over the eastern NP during 1960–2019. These findings have important implications for projecting future TC activity over the NP.},

  abstract     = {The quest of geological proxies to evaluate low-latitude hydrological changes at a planetary scale remains an ongoing issue. The Dole effect is such a potential proxy owing to its global character. We propose a new approach to recalculate the fluctuation of the Dole effect (∆DE*) over the past 800 thousand years (ka). The ∆DE* calculated this way is dominated by precession cycles alone, with lesser variance in the obliquity bands and almost no variance in the eccentricity bands. Moreover, the ∆DE* is notably correlated with Chinese stalagmite δ 18 O record over the past 640 ka; simulated terrestrial rainfall changes between 30°N and 30°S over the past 300 ka. Our findings highlight the predominant role of the low-latitude hydroclimate in governing the ∆DE* on orbital time scales, while high-latitude climate impacts are negligible. In turn, we argue that the ∆DE* can be used to indicate low-latitude hydrological changes at a global extent.},

Because of their strong dipole moment, excitons in bilayer WSe 2 can be controlled by transverse electric field. At the same time, unlike indirect excitons in artificially stacked heterostructures based on transition metal dichalcogenides, naturally stacked bilayers are much simpler in fabrication.},

However, progress in these is limited due to high optical loss and low gain. In this work, we demonstrate an electrically pumped quantum dot (QD) random laser with visible emission based on a previously unexplored paradigm named coherent Förster resonance energy transfer (CFRET). In the CFRET process, when a coherent photonic mode is formed because of multiple scattering of the emitted light traveling in mixed donor and acceptor QDs, the donor QDs not only serve as scattering centers but are also enable coherent energy transfer to acceptor QDs. Therefore, the laser action can be easily achieved, and the lasing threshold is greatly reduced. Our approach of electrically pumped QD-based random lasers represents a substantial step toward a full-spectrum random laser for practical applications.},

We found that in aqueous microdroplets having the same size as cells and that are confined in hydrocarbon oil, negatively charged molecules were distributed rather uniformly over the interior of the microdroplet, whereas positively charged molecules were localized at and near the surface. However, the addition of salt (NaCl) to the microdroplet caused all charged molecules to be localized near the oil-water interface. This salt-induced relocalization required less salt concentration in microdroplets compared to bulk water. Moreover, the localization became more prominent as the size of the microdroplet was reduced. The relocatization also critically depended on the type of oil. Our results imply that salt ions and different hydrophobic interfaces together may govern the local distribution of charged biomolecules in confined intracellular environments.},

Despite its importance for brain connectivity, very little is known about SWM in humans, mainly due to the lack of noninvasive imaging methods. Here, we lay the groundwork for systematic in vivo SWM mapping using ultrahigh resolution 7 T magnetic resonance imaging. Using biophysical modeling informed by quantitative ion beam microscopy on postmortem brain tissue, we demonstrate that MR contrast in SWM is driven by iron and can be linked to the microscopic iron distribution. Higher SWM iron concentrations were observed in U-fiber–rich frontal, temporal, and parietal areas, potentially reflecting high fiber density or late myelination in these areas. Our SWM mapping approach provides the foundation for systematic studies of interindividual differences, plasticity, and pathologies of this crucial structure for cortico-cortical connectivity in humans.},

Innervation was highly enriched in the mouse endocrine pancreas, with regional differences. Islet nerve density was increased in nonobese diabetic mice, in mice treated with streptozotocin, and in pancreata of human donors with type 2 diabetes.

Comparison of gene oscillations in control and epilepsy predicted time-dependent alterations in energy metabolism, which were verified experimentally. Although aerobic glycolysis remained constant from morning to afternoon in controls, it increased in epilepsy. In contrast, oxidative phosphorylation increased in control and decreased in epilepsy. Thus, the control hippocampus shows circadian molecular remapping, which is altered in epilepsy. We suggest that the hippocampus operates in a different functioning mode in epilepsy.

However, the effect of spatial inversion symmetry breaking on thermal transport in uniform media remains to be elucidated. Here, we show nonreciprocal thermal transport in the multiferroic helimagnet TbMnO 3 . The longitudinal thermal conductivity depends on whether the thermal current is parallel or antiparallel to the vector product of the electric polarization and magnetization.

However, the previous research has demonstrated limited electric-field modulation of the effective magnetic damping, a parameter that governs the magnetization dynamics. Here, we propose an approach to manipulate the damping by using the large damping enhancement induced by the two-magnon scattering and a nonlocal spin relaxation process in which spin currents are resonantly transported from antiferromagnetic domains to ferromagnetic matrix in a mixed-phased metallic alloy FeRh. This damping enhancement in FeRh is sensitive to its fraction of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, which can be dynamically tuned by electric fields through a strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling. In a heterostructure of FeRh and piezoelectric PMN-PT, we demonstrated a more than 120\% modulation of the effective damping by electric fields during the antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition. Our results demonstrate an efficient approach to controlling the magnetization dynamics, thus enabling low-power tunable electronics.},

  abstract     = {Cryptic ligand binding sites, which are not evident in the unligated structures, are beneficial in tackling with difficult but attractive drug targets, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, cryptic sites have thus far not been rationally pursued in the early stages of drug development. Here, we demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance that the cryptic site in Bcl-xL exists in a conformational equilibrium between the open and closed conformations under the unligated condition. While the fraction of the open conformation in the unligated wild-type Bcl-xL is estimated to be low, F143W mutation that is distal from the ligand binding site can substantially elevate the population. The F143W mutant showed a higher hit rate in a phage-display peptide screening, and the hit peptide bound to the cryptic site of the wild-type Bcl-xL. Therefore, by controlling the conformational equilibrium in the cryptic site, the opportunity to identify a PPI inhibitor could be improved.},

We found that even combining ICT with chemotherapy, which was wildly used in clinical trials, failed to achieve satisfactory tumor inhibition in the B16F10 model. Thus, we further constructed a previously unexplored immune cocktail therapy and realized multiple boosting of the cancer-immunity cycle. Cocktail therapy consisted of two kinds of tumor microenvironment-responsive drug and gene delivery nanoparticles to achieve specific delivery of doxorubicin and codelivery of plasmids expressed small hairpin RNA of PD-L1 (pshPD-L1) and hyaluronidase (pSpam1) in the tumor area. Experimental evidences proved that any component in the cocktail therapy was indispensable, and the cocktail therapy exhibited excellent antitumor effects against different types of tumors. The cocktail therapy presented here offers a searching strategy for more synergistic units with ICT and is meaningful for developing more efficient antitumor immunotherapy.},

Two-photon endomicroscopy provides a minimally invasive approach to image buried brain structures, once it is integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens embedded in the brain. However, its imaging resolution and field of view are compromised by the intrinsic aberrations of the GRIN lens. Here, we develop a two-photon endomicroscopy by adding adaptive optics based on direct wavefront sensing, which enables recovery of diffraction-limited resolution in deep-brain imaging. A new precompensation strategy plays a critical role to correct aberrations over large volumes and achieve rapid random-access multiplane imaging. We investigate the neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, a critical deep brain structure, and reveal the relationship between the somatic and dendritic activity of pyramidal neurons.},

The excitation mechanism of EPR in STM, however, is broadly debated, raising concerns about widespread application of this technique. We present an extensive experimental study and modeling of EPR-STM of Fe and hydrogenated Ti atoms on a MgO surface. Our results support a piezoelectric coupling mechanism, in which the EPR species oscillate adiabatically in the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the STM tip. An analysis based on Bloch equations combined with atomic-multiplet calculations identifies different EPR driving forces. Specifically, transverse magnetic field gradients drive the spin-1/2 hydrogenated Ti, whereas longitudinal magnetic field gradients drive the spin-2 Fe. Also, our results highlight the potential of piezoelectric coupling to induce electric dipole moments, thereby broadening the scope of EPR-STM to nonpolar species and nonlinear excitation schemes.},

We report that, concurrent with classical ThT-positive products, fibrillization in saline also gives rise to polymorphs invisible to ThT (τ − ). The generation of τ − fibril polymorphs is stochastic and can skew the apparent fibrillization kinetics revealed by ThT. Their emergence has thus been ignored so far or mistaken for fibrillization inhibitions/failures. They present a yet undescribed atomic organization and show an exacerbated propensity toward self-replication in cortical neurons, and in living mice, their injection into the substantia nigra pars compacta triggers a synucleinopathy that spreads toward the dorsal striatum, the nucleus accumbens, and the insular cortex.},

Here, we describe the molecular characterization of the four members of the Bcl-2 family in the most primitive metazoan, Trichoplax adhaerens . All four trBcl-2 homologs are multimotif Bcl-2 group, with trBcl-2L1 and trBcl-2L2 being highly divergent antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members, whereas trBcl-2L3 and trBcl-2L4 are homologs of proapoptotic Bax and Bak, respectively. trBax expression permeabilizes the mitochondrial outer membrane, while trBak operates as a BH3-only sensitizer repressing antiapoptotic activities of trBcl-2L1 and trBcl-2L2. The crystal structure of a trBcl-2L2:trBak BH3 complex reveals that trBcl-2L2 uses the canonical Bcl-2 ligand binding groove to sequester trBak BH3, indicating that the structural basis for apoptosis control is conserved from T. adhaerens to mammals. Finally, we demonstrate that both trBax and trBak BH3 peptides bind selectively to human Bcl-2 homologs to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy treatment.},

We create picosecond electron pulses for probing dynamic events by chopping a continuous beam with a radio frequency (RF)–driven pulser with the pulse repetition rate tunable from 100 MHz to 12 GHz. As a first application, we studied gigahertz electromagnetic wave propagation dynamics in an interdigitated comb structure. We reveal, on nanometer space and picosecond time scales, the transient oscillating electromagnetic field around the tines of the combs with time-resolved polarization, amplitude, and local field enhancement.

Anti–programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody–conjugated GNRs inhibited PD-1/PD-L1 interactions efficiently and induced T cell–mediated GrB release that can be imaged using activatable imaging probe. GNRs enabled real-time immunotherapy response monitoring in a tumor-bearing mice model and distinguished between highly responsive and poorly responsive tumors. Furthermore, increasing doses resulted in a better response and enhanced sensitivity in poorly responsive tumors.

This approach leverages fluid-based heat transfer from printed networks in the tissues to activate heat-inducible transgenes expressed by embedded cells. We show that gene expression patterning can be tuned both spatially and dynamically by varying channel network architecture, fluid temperature, fluid flow direction, and stimulation timing in a user-defined manner and maintained in vivo. We apply this approach to activate the 3D positional expression of Wnt ligands and Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulators, which are major regulators of development, homeostasis, regeneration, and cancer throughout the animal kingdom.},

We show that in the regime where the Coriolis effect is strong, the scaling exponent of Nusselt number versus Rayleigh number exceeds one-third once the Rayleigh number is large enough. The convective rolls revolve in prograde direction, signifying the emergence of zonal flow.

Here, we demonstrate that the minimal Pmt unit necessary for PSM export is PmtCD and provide its first atomic characterization by single-particle cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography. We have captured the transporter in the ATP-bound state at near atomic resolution, revealing a type II ABC exporter fold, with an additional cytosolic domain.

Here, we show that SETD2 is an actin methyltransferase that trimethylates lysine-68 (ActK68me3) in cells via its interaction with HTT and the actin-binding adapter HIP1R. ActK68me3 localizes primarily to the insoluble F-actin cytoskeleton in cells and regulates actin polymerization/depolymerization dynamics. Disruption of the SETD2-HTT-HIP1R axis inhibits actin methylation, causes defects in actin polymerization, and impairs cell migration. Together, these data identify SETD2 as a previously unknown HTT effector regulating methylation and polymerization of actin filaments and provide new avenues for understanding how defects in SETD2 and HTT drive disease via aberrant cytoskeletal methylation.},

  abstract     = {Quantum dots have innate advantages as the key component of optoelectronic devices. For white light–emitting diodes (WLEDs), the modulation of the spectrum and color of the device often involves various quantum dots of different emission wavelengths. Here, we fabricate a series of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) through a scalable acid reagent engineering strategy. The growing electron-withdrawing groups on the surface of CQDs that originated from acid reagents boost their photoluminescence wavelength red shift and raise their particle sizes, elucidating the quantum size effect. These CQDs emit bright and remarkably stable full-color fluorescence ranging from blue to red light and even white light. Full-color emissive polymer films and all types of high–color rendering index WLEDs are synthesized by mixing multiple kinds of CQDs in appropriate ratios. The universal electron-donating/withdrawing group engineering approach for synthesizing tunable emissive CQDs will facilitate the progress of carbon-based luminescent materials for manufacturing forward-looking films and devices.},

  abstract     = {Students who speak English as a second language (ESL) are underserved and underrepresented in postsecondary science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. To date, most existing research with ESL students in higher education is qualitative. Drawing from this important body of work, we investigate the impact of a social-belonging intervention on anticipated changes in belonging, STEM GPA, and proportion of STEM credits obtained in students’ first semester and first year of college. Using data from more than 12, 000 STEM-interested students at 19 universities, results revealed that the intervention increased ESL students’ anticipated sense of belonging and three of the four academic outcomes. Moreover, anticipated changes in belonging mediated the intervention’s effects on these academic outcomes. Robustness checks revealed that ESL effects persisted even when controlling for other identities correlated with ESL status. Overall, results suggest that anticipated belonging is an understudied barrier to creating a multilingual and diverse STEM workforce.},

Solid catalysts show promise in achieving chirality-controlled growth, but poor size control and synthesis efficiency hampers advancement. Here, we demonstrate the first synthesis of refractory metal nanoparticles (W, Mo, and Re) with near-monodisperse sizes. High concentrations ( N = 10 5 to 10 7 cm −3 ) of nanoparticles (diameter 1 to 5 nm) are produced and reduced in a single process, enabling SWCNT synthesis with controlled chiral angles of 19° ± 5°, demonstrating abundance &gt;93\%. These results confirm the interface thermodynamics and kinetic growth theory mechanism, which has been extended here to include temporal dependence of fast-growing chiralities. The solid catalysts are further shown effective via floating catalyst growth, offering efficient production possibilities.},

In this work, we elucidate the physiological function of this polymer in the acclimation of the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to nutrient deprivation. Our data reveal that polyphosphate synthesis is vital to control cellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate homeostasis and maintain both respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport upon sulfur deprivation. Using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that electron flow in the energy-generating organelles is essential to induce and sustain acclimation to sulfur deprivation at the transcriptional level. These previously unidentified links among polyphosphate synthesis, photosynthetic and respiratory electron flow, and the acclimation of cells to nutrient deprivation could unveil the mechanism by which polyphosphate helps organisms cope with a myriad of stress conditions in a fluctuating environment.},

When activated by x-rays, nMOFs effectively generate reactive oxygen species to release DAMPs and tumor antigens while delivering CpG oligodeoxynucleotides as PAMPs to facilitate the maturation of antigen-presenting cells. Together, DAMPs, tumor antigens, and PAMPs expand cytotoxic T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes to reinvigorate the adaptive immune system for local tumor regression. When treated in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, the local therapeutic effects of nMOF-based vaccines were extended to distant tumors via attenuating T cell exhaustion. Our work demonstrates the potential of nMOFs as x-ray–activable in situ cancer vaccines to awaken the host’s innate and adaptive immune systems for systemic antitumor immunity.},

However, the surface could become an additional heat dissipation channel if phonons couple with photons forming hybrid surface quasiparticles called surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs). Here, we experimentally demonstrate the formation of SPhPs on the surface of SiN nanomembranes and subsequent enhancement of heat conduction. Our measurements show that the in-plane thermal conductivity of membranes thinner than 50 nm doubles up as the temperature rises from 300 to 800 kelvin, while thicker membranes show a monotonic decrease. Our theoretical analysis shows that these thickness and temperature dependencies are fingerprints of SPhP contribution to heat conduction. The demonstrated thermal transport by SPhPs can be useful as a previously unidentified channel of heat dissipation in a variety of fields including microelectronics and silicon photonics.},

The multicellular constructs supported the formation of tumor spheroids with extensive F-actin networks surrounding the spheroids, enabling cell-cell communication, and comparative cell-matrix interactions and encapsulation response to those observed in Matrigel.

We show that speciation and extinction rates nearly simultaneously decreased in the environmentally dynamic phase after ecosystem formation and stabilized after deep-water conditions established in Lake Ohrid. As the lake deepens, we also see a switch in the macroevolutionary trade-off, resulting in a transition from a volatile assemblage of short-lived endemic species to a stable community of long-lived species. Our results emphasize the importance of the interplay between environmental/climate change, ecosystem stability, and environmental limits to diversity for diversification processes.

Here, we use magnetohydrodynamic and impact simulations and analytic relationships to demonstrate that although impact plasmas can transiently enhance the field inside the Moon, the resulting fields are at least three orders of magnitude too weak to explain lunar crustal magnetic anomalies.

We compared subfossil assemblages with modern-day communities and revealed a 40\% decrease in generic diversity, concomitant to a shift from competitive to stress-tolerant species dominance since the mid-Holocene. Regions with characteristically poor water quality—high chl- a , dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and turbidity—had lower contemporary diversity and the greatest community composition shift observed in the past, driven by the near extirpation of Acropora .

However, it has limited ability to manipulate sound vortices, and a more powerful mechanism for sound vortex manipulation is strongly desired. Here, we propose the diffraction mechanism to manipulate sound vortices in a cylindrical waveguide with phase gradient metagratings (PGMs). A sound vortex diffraction law is theoretically revealed based on the generalized conservation principle of topological charge. This diffraction law can explain and predict the complicated diffraction phenomena of sound vortices, as confirmed by numerical simulations. To exemplify our findings, we designed and experimentally verified a PGM based on Helmholtz resonators that support asymmetric transmission of sound vortices. Our work provides previously unidentified opportunities for manipulating sound vortices, which can advance more versatile design for OAM-based devices.},

The rate of violent victimization for SGMs is 71.1 victimizations per 1000 people compared with 19.2 victimizations per 1000 people for those who are not SGMs. SGMs are 2.7 times more likely to be a victim of violent crime than non-SGMs. These findings raise the importance of further considering sexual orientation and gender identity in victimization and interventions.},

  abstract     = {CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (T regs ) are pivotal for the inhibition of autoimmune inflammatory responses. One way to therapeutically harness the immunosuppressive actions of T regs is to stimulate the proliferative expansion of TNFR2-expressing CD4 + Foxp3 + T regs via transmembrane TNF (tmTNF). Here, we report that two-pore channel (TPC) inhibitors markedly enhance tmTNF expression on antigen-presenting cells. Furthermore, injection of TPC inhibitors including tetrandrine, or TPC-specific siRNAs in mice, increases the number of T regs in a tmTNF/TNFR2-dependent manner. In a mouse colitis model, inhibition of TPCs by tetrandrine markedly attenuates colon inflammation by expansion of T regs . Mechanistically, we show that TPC inhibitors enhance tmTNF levels by disrupting surface expression of TNF-α–converting enzyme by regulating vesicle trafficking. These results suggest that the therapeutic potential of TPC inhibitors is mediated by expansion of TNFR2-expressing T regs and elucidate the basis of clinical use in the treatment of autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract     = {Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride were recently reported to hold unusual narrow homogeneous linewidths of tens of megahertz within the Fourier transform limit at room temperature. This unique observation was traced back to decoupling from in-plane phonon modes. Here, we investigate the origins for the mechanical decoupling. New sample preparation improved spectral diffusion, which allowed us to reveal a gap in the electron-phonon spectral density for low phonon frequencies. This sign for mechanical decoupling persists up to room temperature and explains the observed narrow lines at 300 kelvin. We investigate the dipole emission directionality and reveal preferred photon emission through channels between the layers supporting the claim for out-of-plane distorted defect centers. Our work provides insights into the underlying physics for the persistence of Fourier transform limit lines up to room temperature and gives a guide to the community on how to identify the exotic emitters.},

Proteomic analysis of sEV-enriched fractions using reverse phase protein array revealed a signature of seven proteins that differentiated BC patients from healthy individuals, of which FAK and fibronectin displayed high diagnostic accuracy. The size of sEVs was significantly reduced in advanced disease stage, concomitant with a stage-specific protein signature.

Magnonic bands, consisting of two SW frequency modes, appear with a bandgap under the application of moderate gate voltage, which can be switched off by withdrawing the voltage. The experimental results are reproduced by plane wave method–based numerical calculations, and simulated SW mode profiles show propagating SWs through nanochannels with different magnetic properties. The anticrossing between these two modes gives rise to the observed magnonic bandgap.},

For reasons that are not understood, central nervous system remyelinated axons often have thin myelin sheaths with a disorganized structure susceptible to secondary demyelination. We found that expression of the sphingomyelin hydrolase neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to myelinating oligodendrocytes changes their response to inflammatory cytokines. OPCs do not express nSMase2 and exhibit a protective/regenerative response to tumor necrosis factor–α and interleukin-1β. Oligodendrocytes express nSMase2 and exhibit a stress response to cytokine challenge that includes an overproduction of ceramide, a sphingolipid that forms negative curvatures in membranes. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of nSMase2 in myelinating oligodendrocytes normalized the ceramide content of remyelinated fibers and increased thickness and compaction. These results suggest that inhibition of nSMase2 could improve the quality of myelin and stabilize structure.},

Here, we demonstrate the nonmonotonic contactless long-range manipulation of binary droplets on pristine substrates due to the sensing of localized water vapor sources. The droplet-source system presents an unexpected off-centered equilibrium position. We capture the underlying mechanism behind this symmetry breaking with a simplified model based on the full two-dimensional functional form of the surface tension gradient induced by the source on the droplet’s free surface. This insight on the transport mechanism enables us to demonstrate its versatility for applications by printing, aligning, and reacting materials controllably in space and time on pristine substrates.},

Controlling for psychiatric comorbidities, substance use, education, and income, those with ADHD start adulthood with normal credit demand and default rates. However, in middle age, their default rates grow exponentially, yielding poor credit scores and diminished credit access despite high demand. Sympathomimetic prescriptions are unassociated with improved financial behaviors. Last, financial distress is associated with fourfold higher risk of suicide among those with ADHD.

The voltage-strain coupling is three orders of magnitude larger than the best-performing ceramics in terms of piezoelectric actuation. We trace this huge electroactuation to the concerted action of 100 billions of nanopores per square centimeter cross section and to potential-dependent pressures of up to 150 atmospheres at the single-pore scale.

Here, we used a remote sensing approach to estimate carbon losses driven by edge effect in Amazonia over the 2001 to 2015 period. We found that carbon losses associated with edge effect (947 Tg C) corresponded to one-third of losses from deforestation (2592 Tg C). Despite a notable negative trend of 7 Tg C year −1 in carbon losses from deforestation, the carbon losses from edge effect remained unchanged, with an average of 63 ± 8 Tg C year −1 . Carbon losses caused by edge effect is thus an additional unquantified flux that can counteract carbon emissions avoided by reducing deforestation, compromising the Paris Agreement’s bold targets.},

Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that metastatic prostate cancer patients with more than five hm-cells have a significantly poorer survival probability than those with zero to five hm-cells. Thus, prevalence of hm-cells is a prognosticator of poor outcome in prostate cancer, and a potentially predictive and therapy response biomarker for agents cotargeting stromal components and preventing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.},

Recent emerging viral threats, including Zika virus, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV-2 responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlight the cost and difficulty in responding rapidly. To address these challenges, we develop a platform for low-cost and rapid detection of viral RNA with DNA nanoswitches that mechanically reconfigure in response to specific viruses. Using Zika virus as a model system, we show nonenzymatic detection of viral RNA with selective and multiplexed detection between related viruses and viral strains. For clinical-level sensitivity in biological fluids, we paired the assay with sample preparation using either RNA extraction or isothermal preamplification. Our assay requires minimal laboratory infrastructure and is adaptable to other viruses, as demonstrated by quickly developing DNA nanoswitches to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva. Further development and field implementation will improve our ability to detect emergent viral threats and ultimately limit their impact.},

  abstract     = {Dysregulation of T cell apoptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of acute systemic inflammation–induced immunosuppression, as seen in sepsis and trauma. However, the regulatory mechanisms of T cell apoptosis are unclear. Activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has been shown to induce T cell apoptosis. Notch was previously identified as the top negative regulator of STING in macrophages through a kinase inhibitor library screening. However, how Notch signaling regulates STING activation in T cells is unknown. Here, using a γ-secretase inhibitor to block Notch signaling, we found that Notch protected CD4 T cells from STING-mediated apoptosis during endotoxemia. Mechanistically, Notch intracellular domain (NICD) interacted with STING at the cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) binding domain and competed with CDN to inhibit STING activation. In conclusion, our data reveal a previously unidentified role of Notch in negative regulation of STING-mediated apoptosis in CD4 T cells.},

We report a new multiplexed cantilever-free scanning probe method for synthesizing compositionally diverse and size-controlled halide perovskite nanocrystals spanning square centimeter areas. Single-particle photoluminescence studies reveal multiple independent emission modes due to defect-defined band edges with relative intensities that depend on crystal size at a fixed composition. Smaller particles, but ones with dimensions that exceed the quantum confinement regime, exhibit blue-shifted emission due to reabsorption of higher-energy modes. Six different halide perovskites have been synthesized, including a layered Ruddlesden-Popper phase, and the method has been used to prepare functional solar cells based on single nanocrystals.

Existing clinical drugs to traumatic SCI have limited therapeutic efficacy because of either the poor blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability or a single function. Here, we suggest a “pleiotropic messenger” strategy based on near-infrared (NIR)–triggered on-demand NO release at the lesion area for traumatic SCI recovery via the concurrent neuroregeneration and neuroprotection processing. This NO delivery system was constructed as upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) core coated by zeolitic imidazolate framework–8 (ZIF-8) with NO donor (CysNO). This combined strategy substantial promotes the repair of SCI in vertebrates, ascribable to the pleiotropic effects of NO including the suppression of gliosis and inflammation, the promotion of neuroregeneration, and the protection of neurons from apoptosis, which opens intriguing perspectives not only in nerve repair but also in neurological research and tissue engineering.},

We demonstrate that net phytoplankton growth occurred even under 100\% ice cover as early as February and that it resulted at least partly from photosynthesis.

The key material is a stimuli-responsive photoresist containing cross-links formed by noncovalent, directional interactions between β-cyclodextrin (host) and adamantane (guest). This allows reversible actuation under physiological conditions by application of soluble competitive guests. Cells adhering in these scaffolds build up initial traction forces of ~80 nN. After application of an equibiaxial stretch of up to 25\%, cells remodel their actin cytoskeleton, double their traction forces, and equilibrate at a new dynamic set point within 30 min. When the stretch is released, traction forces gradually decrease until the initial set point is retrieved. Pharmacological inhibition or knockout of nonmuscle myosin 2A prevents these adjustments, suggesting that cellular tensional homeostasis strongly depends on functional myosin motors.},

By identification of conserved sequence signatures and molecular dynamics simulations, we devised a mutation that stabilized this form. Functionally locking gB allowed the structural determination of its membrane-embedded prefusion conformation at sub-nanometer resolution and enabled the unambiguous fit of all ectodomains. The resulting pseudo-atomic model reveals a notable conservation of conformational domain rearrangements during fusion between HSV-1 gB and the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G, despite their very distant phylogeny.

Ultrafine nanostructuring with feature sizes below 20 nm allows us to fully suppress contribution of the propagating vibrational modes (propagons), leaving only the diffusive vibrational modes (diffusons) to contribute to thermal transport in a-Si 3 N 4 . A combination of the phonon-gas kinetics model and the Allen-Feldmann theory reproduced the measured results without any fitting parameters. The thermal conductivity reduction was explained as extremely strong diffusive boundary scattering of both propagons and diffusons. These findings give rise to substantial tunability of thermal conductivity of amorphous materials, which enables us to provide better thermal solutions in microelectronic devices.},

Here, we report a facile method to tailor both the actuation behavior and mechanical properties of printed LCE filaments by varying printing parameters. On the basis of the comprehensive processing-structure-property relationship, we propose a simple strategy to print functionally graded LCEs, which greatly increases the design space for creating active morphing structures. We further demonstrate mitigation of stress concentration near the interface between an actuatable LCE tube and a rigid glass plate through gradient printing.

Experimental results not only demonstrate that the photogenerated electrons can be effectively transferred to the isolated Ru atoms for hydrogen evolution but also imply that the TiO 2 architecture with multi-edges might facilitate the charge separation and transport. The change in valence and the evolution of electronic structure of Ru sites are well probed during the photocatalytic process.

Dopamine and beta signals were anticorrelated over seconds-long time frames, in agreement with the posited rule, but at finer time scales, we identified conditions in which these signals were modulated with the same polarity. These measurements demonstrated that task-elicited beta suppressions preceded dopamine peaks and that relative dopamine-beta timing and polarity depended on reward value, performance history, movement, and striatal domain.

We find that the red wing pattern master regulatory transcription factor Optix binds dozens of loci also under selection, which frequently form three-dimensional adaptive hubs with selection acting on multiple physically interacting genes. Many Optix-bound genes under selection are tied to pigmentation and wing development, and these loci collectively maintain separation between adaptive red color pattern phenotypes in natural populations.

Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to probe the conformations of adhesive protein Pvfp-5β and its salt-tolerant underwater adhesion on superhydrophilic mica. Dopa and positively charged basic residues form pairs, in this intrinsically disordered protein, and these residue pairs can lead to firm surface binding. Our simulations further suggest that the unmodified Tyr shows similar functions on surface adhesion by forming pairing structure with a positively charged residue.

Transmission electron microscopy, nanomechanical testing, and ab initio calculations find a critical layer thickness on the order of 1 μm, below which the FeAl 2 layer homogeneously codeforms with the FeAl layer. The FeAl 2 layer undergoes a fundamental change from multimodal, contained slip to unimodal slip that is aligned and fully transmitting across the FeAl/FeAl 2 interface. Lightweight Fe-Al alloys with room-temperature, ductile-like responses can inspire new applications in reactor systems and other structural applications for extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {Oxygenation of Earth’s oceans and atmosphere through time has consequences for subducted surface signatures that are now stored in the mantle. Here, we report significant mass-dependent selenium isotope variations in modern hot spot–influenced oceanic lavas. These variations are correlated with tracers of mantle source enrichment, which can only be explained by incorporation of abyssal pelagic sediments subducted from a redox-stratified mid-Proterozoic ocean. Selenium geochemical signatures of these sediments have mostly been preserved during long-term recycling and may therefore complement the global surface sediment record as ancient oxygen archives. Combined deep mantle and surface perspectives, together with emerging models for atmospheric oxygen based on selenium systematics, further imply a significantly oxygenated ocean-atmosphere system throughout the mid-Proterozoic.},

The transport mechanism involves a sequence of molecular orientation reversals directed by hydrogen-bonding interactions as the neutral molecules traverse the interlayer gap and pass through the intralayer voids that show similarities with the transport of water through transmembrane aquaporin channels in biological systems.

We show that saccadic latencies, looking time, and time spent engaged with a stimulus sequence are explained by the properties of the learning environments, including the level of surprise of the stimulus, overall predictability of the environment, and progress in learning the environmental structure.

It comprises a gel-like fibrin network formed by coagulation of blood to trap a large number of red blood cells. Upon implantation, the cross-linked RBCs in the blood clot can attract and recruit a great number of immune cells, leading to the formation of an “immune niche.” Encapsulated with tumor-associated antigen and adjuvant, the blood clot vaccine (BCV) can induce a robust anticancer immune response. The BCV combined with immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits tumor growth in B16F10 and 4T1 tumor models. The proposed implantable blood clot cancer vaccine can be readily made by mixing the blood from patients with cancer with immunomodulating agents ex vivo, followed by reimplantation into the same patient for personalized cancer immunotherapy in future clinical translation.},

However, due to the strong dispersion of passive materials, achieving cross-wavelength invisibility remains an open challenge. Inspired by the natural ecological relationship between transparent midwater oceanic animals and the cross-wavelength detection strategy of their predators, we propose a cross-wavelength invisibility concept that integrates various invisibility tactics, where a Boolean metamaterial design procedure is presented to balance divergent material requirements over cross-scale wavelengths. As proof of concept, we experimentally demonstrate longwave cloaking and shortwave transparency simultaneously through a nanoimprinting technique. Our work extends the concept of stealth techniques from individual invisibility tactics targeting a single-wavelength spectrum to an integrated invisibility tactic targeting a cross-wavelength applications and may pave the way for development of cross-wavelength integrated metadevices.},

Both organizational axes were present when investigating the genetic correlation of cortical thickness, suggesting a strong genetic component in humans, and had a comparable organization in macaques, demonstrating they are phylogenetically conserved in primates. In both species, the inferior-superior dimension of cortical organization aligned with the predictions of dual-origin theory, and in humans, we found that the posterior-to-anterior axis related to a functional topography describing a continuum of functions from basic processes involved in perception and action to more abstract features of human cognition.

The resulting first-order transition is robust with respect to changes in network connectivity and natural frequency distribution. This allows us to identify the relaxation character of the oscillators as the essential parameter that determines the nature of the synchronization transition.

Their demagnetization must involve excitation of magnons, driven either through exchange coupling between the 5d6s-itinerant and 4f-localized electrons or by coupling of 4f spins to lattice excitations. Here, we disentangle the ultrafast dynamics of 5d6s and 4f magnetic moments in terbium metal by time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We show that the demagnetization time of the Tb 4f magnetic moments of 400 fs is set by 4f spin–lattice coupling. This is experimentally evidenced by a comparison to ferromagnetic gadolinium and supported by orbital-resolved spin dynamics simulations. Our findings establish coupling of the 4f spins to the lattice via the orbital momentum as an essential mechanism driving magnetization dynamics via ultrafast magnon generation in technically relevant materials with strong magnetic anisotropy.},

An unprecedentedly low dry sliding friction coefficient of 0.06 in bulk ceramics was obtained mainly due to the inhibition of the microcrack propagation by the ordered 2D graphene array.

Here, we present an alternative to this well-established paradigm by showing how an unexpectedly small volume of nano-sized crystals can cause a disproportionate increase in magma viscosity. Our in situ observations on a basaltic melt, rheological measurements in an analog system, and modeling demonstrate how just a few volume\% of nanolites results in a marked increase in viscosity above the critical value needed for explosive fragmentation, even for a low-viscosity melt.

  abstract     = {Cells respond to starvation by shutting down protein synthesis and by activating catabolic processes, including autophagy, to recycle nutrients. This two-pronged response is mediated by the integrated stress response (ISR) through phosphorylation of eIF2α, which represses protein translation, and by inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, which promotes autophagy also through a stress-responsive transcriptional program. Implementation of such a program, however, requires protein synthesis, thus conflicting with general repression of translation. How is this mismatch resolved? We found that the main regulator of the starvation-induced transcriptional program, TFEB, counteracts protein synthesis inhibition by directly activating expression of GADD34, a component of the protein phosphatase 1 complex that dephosphorylates eIF2α. We discovered that GADD34 plays an essential role in autophagy by tuning translation during starvation, thus enabling lysosomal biogenesis and a sustained autophagic flux.

  abstract     = {Drug resistance threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of human infections. This highlights an urgent need for new and improved drugs with novel mechanisms of action to avoid cross-resistance. Current cell-based drug screens are, however, restricted to binary live/dead readouts with no provision for mechanism of action prediction. Machine learning methods are increasingly being used to improve information extraction from imaging data. These methods, however, work poorly with heterogeneous cellular phenotypes and generally require time-consuming human-led training. We have developed a semi-supervised machine learning approach, combining human- and machine-labeled training data from mixed human malaria parasite cultures. Designed for high-throughput and high-resolution screening, our semi-supervised approach is robust to natural parasite morphological heterogeneity and correctly orders parasite developmental stages. Our approach also reproducibly detects and clusters drug-induced morphological outliers by mechanism of action, demonstrating the potential power of machine learning for accelerating cell-based drug discovery.},

Exciton diffusion represents an important channel of energy transport in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). While early studies performed on TMD heterobilayers suggested that carriers and excitons exhibit long diffusion, a rich variety of scenarios can exist. In a moiré crystal with a large supercell and deep potential, interlayer excitons may be completely localized. As the moiré period reduces at a larger twist angle, excitons can tunnel between supercells and diffuse over a longer lifetime. The diffusion should be the longest in commensurate heterostructures where the moiré superlattice is completely absent. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the rich phenomena of interlayer exciton diffusion in WSe 2 /MoSe 2 heterostructures by comparing several samples prepared with chemical vapor deposition and mechanical stacking with accurately controlled twist angles.},

Here, we use live- and fixed-cell 3D super-resolution and scanning electron microscopy to analyze structural and functional nuclear organization in somatic cells. We identify chains of interlinked ~200- to 300-nm-wide chromatin domains (CDs) composed of aggregated nucleosomes that can overlap with individual topologically associating domains and are distinct from a surrounding RNA-populated interchromatin compartment. High-content mapping uncovers confinement of cohesin and active histone modifications to surfaces and enrichment of repressive modifications toward the core of CDs in both hetero- and euchromatic regions. This nanoscale functional topography is temporarily relaxed in postreplicative chromatin but remarkably persists after ablation of cohesin. Our findings establish CDs as physical and functional modules of mesoscale genome organization.},

Here, we report an ultrastrong (2.15 GPa) low-carbon nanosteel processed by heterostructure and interstitial mediated warm rolling. The nanosteel consists of thin (~17.8 nm) lamellae, which was enabled by two unreported mechanisms: (i) improving deformation compatibility of dual-phase heterostructure by adjusting warm rolling temperature and (ii) segregating carbon atoms to lamellar boundaries to stabilize the nanolamellae. Defying our intuition, warm rolling produced finer lamellae than cold rolling, which demonstrates the potential and importance of tuning deformation compatibility of interstitial containing heterostructure for nanocrystallization. This previously unreported approach is applicable to most low-carbon, low-alloy steels for producing ultrahigh strength materials in industrial scale.},

Our proposal is supported by (i) rhyolitic lavas are volatile depleted; (ii) textural evidence supports a pyroclastic origin for effusive products; (iii) numerical models show that small ash particles ≲10 −5 m can diffusively degas, stick, and sinter to low porosity, in the time available between fragmentation and the surface; and (iv) inferred ascent rates from both explosive and apparently effusive eruptions can overlap. Our model reconciles previously paradoxical observations and offers a new framework in which to evaluate physical, numerical, and geochemical models of Earth’s most violent volcanic eruptions.},

Using a semiconductor laser that is driven by a sinusoidal current and injection-locked to microresonator solitons, our scheme transfers the spectral purity of a dissipative soliton oscillator into the subharmonic frequencies of the microcomb repetition rate. In addition, the gain-switched comb provides dense optical spectral emissions that divide the line spacing of the soliton microcomb. With the potential to be fully integrated, the merger of the two chipscale devices may profoundly facilitate the wide application of frequency comb technology.},

We show that dry-hot extremes have homogeneously enlarged over the past 122 years, pointing to spatial propagation of extreme dryness and heat and increased probability of continental-scale compound extremes. Last, we show an interesting shift between the main driver of dry-hot extremes over time. While meteorological drought was the main driver of dry-hot events in the 1930s, the observed warming trend has become the dominant driver in recent decades.

Here, using a global drylands dataset, we found that biocrusts form an alternative stable state (biocrust cover, ~80\%; vascular cover, ≤10\%) besides bare soil (both biocrust and vascular cover, ≤10\%) and vascular plants (vascular cover, &gt;50\%; biocrust cover, ~5\%). The pattern of multiple stable states associated with biocrusts differs from the classic fold bifurcation, and values of the aridity index in the range of 0 to 0.6 define a bistable region where multiple stable states coexist. This study empirically demonstrates the existence and thresholds of multiple stable states associated with biocrusts along climatic gradients and thus may greatly contribute to conservation and restoration of global drylands.},

Blocking antibodies against PD-1 or its ligands have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. However, only a fraction of patients develop durable antitumor responses. Clinical outcomes have reached a plateau without substantial advances by combinatorial approaches. Thus, great interest has recently emerged to investigate, in depth, the mechanisms by which the PD-1 pathway transmits inhibitory signals with the goal to identify molecular targets for improvement of the therapeutic success. These efforts have revealed unpredictable dimensions of the pathway and uncovered novel mechanisms involved in PD-1 and PD-L1 regulation and function. Here, we provide an overview of the recent advances on the mechanistic aspects of the PD-1 pathway and discuss the implications of these new discoveries and the gaps that remain to be filled.},

  abstract     = {TET2 DNA dioxygenase is frequently mutated in human hematopoietic malignancies and functionally inactivated in many solid tumors through a nonmutational mechanism. We recently found that TET2 mediates the interferon-JAK-STAT pathway to stimulate chemokine expression and tumor infiltration of lymphocytes (TILs). TET2 is monoubiquitylated at K1299, which promotes its activity. Here, we report that USP15 is a TET2 deubiquitinase and inhibitor. USP15 catalyzes the removal of K1299-linked monoubiquitin and negatively regulates TET2 activity. Gene expression profiling demonstrates that TET2 and USP15 oppositely regulate genes involved in multiple inflammatory pathways, and TET2 is a major target of USP15 function. Deletion of Usp15 in melanoma stimulates chemokine expression and TILs in a TET2-dependent manner, leading to increased response to immunotherapy and extended life span of tumor-bearing mice. These results reveal a previously unknown regulator of TET2 activity and suggest USP15 as a potential therapeutic target for immunotherapy of solid tumors.},

Here, we identified an interaction between mitophagy protein FUNDC1 (FUN14 domain containing 1) and receptor subunit of human SCF (SKP1/cullin/F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex FBXL2 as a gatekeeper for mitochondrial Ca 2+ homeostasis through degradation of IP3R3 (inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor type 3). Loss of FUNDC1 in FUNDC1 −/− mice accentuated high-fat diet–induced cardiac remodeling, functional and mitochondrial anomalies, cell death, rise in IP3R3, and Ca 2+ overload. Mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed an interaction between FUNDC1 and FBXL2. Truncated mutants of Fbox (Delta-F-box) disengaged FBXL2 interaction with FUNDC1. Activation or transfection of FBXL2, inhibition of IP3R3 alleviated, whereas disruption of FBXL2 localization sensitized lipotoxicity-induced cardiac damage. FUNDC1 deficiency accelerated and decelerated palmitic acid–induced degradation of FBXL2 and IP3R3, respectively. Our data suggest an essential role for interaction between FUNDC1 and FBXL2 in preserving mitochondrial Ca 2+ homeostasis and cardiac function in obese hearts.},

Our multi-aperture spectral imager weighs less than 20 mg and simultaneously acquires 20 image channels across the 795- to 980-nm spectral region. Each channel is formed by a metasurface-tuned filter and a metalens doublet. The doublets incorporate absorptive field stops, reducing cross-talk between image channels. We demonstrate our instrument’s capabilities with both still images and video. Narrowband filtering, necessary for the device’s operation, also mitigates chromatic aberration, a common problem in metasurface imagers. Similar instruments operating at visible wavelengths hold promise as compact, aberration-free color cameras. Parallel optical processing using metasystem arrays enables novel, compact instruments for scientific studies and consumer electronics.},

These negatively charged molecules coordinate an electropositive ring of arginines at the center of pores distributed throughout the capsid surface. Kinetic studies indicate that the binding of IP 6 increases the stable lifetimes of the capsid by several orders of magnitude from minutes to hours. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover the mechanisms that underlie the unusually high stability of mature capsids in complex with IP 6 . We find that capsid hexamers and pentamers have differential binding modes for IP 6 . Ligand density calculations show three sites of interaction with IP 6 including at a known capsid inhibitor binding pocket. Free energy calculations demonstrate that IP 6 preferentially stabilizes pentamers over hexamers to enhance fullerene modes of assembly. These results elucidate the molecular role of IP 6 in stabilizing and assembling the retroviral capsid.},

Here, we report a high-throughput magnetic programming strategy based on heating magnetic soft materials above the Curie temperature of the embedded ferromagnetic particles and reorienting their magnetic domains by applying magnetic fields during cooling. We demonstrate discrete, three-dimensional, and reprogrammable magnetization with high spatial resolution (~38 μm). Using the reprogrammable magnetization capability, reconfigurable mechanical behavior of an auxetic metamaterial structure, tunable locomotion of a surface-walking soft robot, and adaptive grasping of a soft gripper are shown. Our approach further enables high-throughput magnetic programming (up to 10 samples/min) via contact transfer. Heat-assisted magnetic programming strategy described here establishes a rich design space and mass-manufacturing capability for development of multiscale and reprogrammable soft machines.},

Here, we address this limitation by temporarily stabilizing bioinks with a complementary thermo-reversible gelatin network. This strategy enables the effective printing of biomaterials that would typically not meet printing requirements, with instrument parameters and structural output largely independent of the base biomaterial. This approach is demonstrated across a library of photocrosslinkable bioinks derived from natural and synthetic polymers, including gelatin, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, dextran, alginate, chitosan, heparin, and poly(ethylene glycol). A range of complex and heterogeneous structures are printed, including soft hydrogel constructs supporting the 3D culture of astrocytes.

We find that Trypanosoma brucei RAP1 relies on a unique double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding activity to achieve this goal. T. brucei causes human sleeping sickness and regularly switches its major surface antigen, variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), to evade the host immune response. VSGs are monoallelically expressed from subtelomeres, and Tb RAP1 is essential for VSG regulation. We identify dsDNA and single-stranded DNA binding activities in Tb RAP1, which require positively charged 737 RKRRR 741 residues that overlap with Tb RAP1’s nuclear localization signal in the MybLike domain. Both DNA binding activities are electrostatics-based and sequence nonspecific. The dsDNA binding activity can be substantially diminished by phosphorylation of two 737 RKRRR 741 -adjacent S residues and is essential for Tb RAP1’s telomere localization, VSG silencing, telomere integrity, and cell proliferation.},

Here, we show that independently of PARP9, the conserved carboxyl-terminal RING and DTC (Deltex carboxyl-terminal) domains of DTX3L and other human Deltex proteins (DTX1 to DTX4) catalyze ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin’s Gly 76 .

Here, through real-time single-molecule visualization of replication fork progression in Xenopus egg extracts, we determine explicitly the outcome of fork collisions with nucleosomes. Most of the parental histones are evicted from the DNA, with histone recycling, nucleosome sliding, and replication fork stalling also occurring but at lower frequencies. Critically, we find that local histone recycling becomes dominant upon depletion of endogenous histones from extracts, revealing that free histone concentration is a key modulator of parental histone dynamics at the replication fork.

These neurotoxins localize specifically to the stinging hairs and are miniproteins of 4 kDa, whose 3D structure is stabilized in an inhibitory cystine knot motif, a characteristic shared with neurotoxins found in spider and cone snail venoms.

By designing broadband artificial stimuli to sample the inputs encoded under natural conditions, we resolve this disparity while markedly increasing the percentage of deep layer neurons found to encode whisker movements, as well as the diversity of these encoded features. Deep layer neurons encode two main types of events, sticks and sweeps, corresponding to high angular velocity bumps and large angular displacements with high velocity, respectively. Neurons can exclusively encode sticks or sweeps, or they can encode both, with or without direction selectivity. Beyond unifying coding theories from naturalistic and artificial stimulation studies, these findings delineate a simple and generalizable set of whisker movement features that can support a range of perceptual processes.},

  abstract     = {Quantum dot–like single-photon sources in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit appealing quantum optical properties but lack a well-defined atomic structure and are subject to large spectral variability. Here, we demonstrate electrically stimulated photon emission from individual atomic defects in monolayer WS 2 and directly correlate the emission with the local atomic and electronic structure. Radiative transitions are locally excited by sequential inelastic electron tunneling from a metallic tip into selected discrete defect states in the WS 2 bandgap. Coupling to the optical far field is mediated by tip plasmons, which transduce the excess energy into a single photon. The applied tip-sample voltage determines the transition energy. Atomically resolved emission maps of individual point defects closely resemble electronic defect orbitals, the final states of the optical transitions. Inelastic charge carrier injection into localized defect states of two-dimensional materials provides a powerful platform for electrically driven, broadly tunable, atomic-scale single-photon sources.},

Here, we directly observe the coupling of magnons and phonons in both time and frequency domains upon femtosecond laser excitation. This strain-spin coupling leads to a magnetoacoustic resonance in perpendicular magnetic [Co/Pd] n multilayers, reaching frequencies in the extremely high frequency (EHF) band, e.g., 60 GHz. We propose a theoretical model to explain the physical mechanism underlying the strain-spin interaction. Our model explains the amplitude increase of the magnetoacoustic resonance state with time and quantitatively predicts the composition of the combined strain-spin state near the resonance. We also detail its precise dependence on the magnetostriction. The results of this work offer a potential pathway to manipulating both the magnitude and timing of EHF and strongly coupled magnon-phonon excitations.},

We demonstrate that cGAS/STING activation is required to resist lethal poxvirus infection. We identified viral Schlafen (vSlfn) as the main STING inhibitor, and ectromelia virus was severely attenuated in the absence of vSlfn. Both vSlfn-mediated virulence and STING inhibitory activity were mapped to the recently discovered poxin cGAMP nuclease domain. Animals were protected from subcutaneous, respiratory, and intravenous infection in the absence of vSlfn, and interferon was the main antiviral protective mechanism controlled by the DNA sensing pathway.

Using this system, we showed proof-of-principle modeling of tumor progression and engineered cardiac tissue vascularization. We demonstrated that 3D curvature induced rotation and mixing under laminar flow, leading to unique phenotypic and transcriptional changes in endothelial cells (ECs). Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq identified specific EC gene clusters in spiral microvessels. These mark a proinflammatory phenotype associated with vascular development and remodeling, and a unique cell cluster expressing genes regulating vascular stability and development.

We present single-EV microarray, a method to distinguish microvesicles from exosomes and assess heterogeneity at a single-EV level. Single-EV microarray and proteomics revealed increased ANXA1 primarily on aggregating and calcifying microvesicles. ANXA1 vesicle aggregation was suppressed by calcium chelation, altering pH, or ANXA1 neutralizing antibody. ANXA1 knockdown attenuated EV aggregation and microcalcification formation in human cardiovascular cells and acellular three-dimensional collagen hydrogels.

We study the primary steps of singlet fission in a pentacene film by using a combination of TG and 2D electronic spectroscopy complemented by quantum chemical and nonadiabatic dynamics calculations. We show that the coherent vibrational dynamics induces the ultrafast transition from the singlet excited electronic state to the triplet-pair state via a degeneracy of potential energy surfaces, i.e., a multidimensional conical intersection. Significant vibronic coupling of the electronic wave packet to a few key intermolecular rocking modes in the low-frequency region connect the excited singlet and triplet-pair states.

  abstract     = {How time is measured by neural stem cells during temporal neurogenesis has remained unresolved. By combining experiments and computational modeling, we define a Shh/Gli-driven three-node timer underlying the sequential generation of motor neurons (MNs) and serotonergic neurons in the brainstem. The timer is founded on temporal decline of Gli-activator and Gli-repressor activities established through down-regulation of Gli transcription. The circuitry conforms an incoherent feed-forward loop, whereby Gli proteins not only promote expression of Phox2b and thereby MN-fate but also account for a delayed activation of a self-promoting transforming growth factor–β (Tgfβ) node triggering a fate switch by repressing Phox2b. Hysteresis and spatial averaging by diffusion of Tgfβ counteract noise and increase temporal accuracy at the population level, providing a functional rationale for the intrinsically programmed activation of extrinsic switch signals in temporal patterning. Our study defines how time is reliably encoded during the sequential specification of neurons.},

  abstract     = {Coupling of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian monsoon (IM) is central to seasonal summer monsoon rainfall predictions over the Indian subcontinent, although a nonstationary relationship between the two nonlinear phenomena can limit seasonal predictability. Radiative effects of volcanic aerosols injected into the stratosphere during large volcanic eruptions (LVEs) tend to alter ENSO evolution; however, their impact on ENSO-IM coupling remains unclear. Here, we investigate how LVEs influence the nonlinear behavior of the ENSO and IM dynamical systems using historical data, 25 paleoclimate reconstructions, last-millennium climate simulations, large-ensemble targeted climate sensitivity experiments, and advanced analysis techniques. Our findings show that LVEs promote a significantly enhanced phase-synchronization of the ENSO and IM oscillations, due to an increase in the angular frequency of ENSO. The results also shed innovative insights into the physical mechanism underlying the LVE-induced enhancement of ENSO-IM coupling and strengthen the prospects for improved seasonal monsoon predictions.},

Historic landslides have primarily been triggered by rainfall, but the region is also prone to large earthquakes on the 1100-km-long Cascadia Subduction Zone megathrust. Little is known about the number of landslides triggered by these earthquakes because the last magnitude 9 rupture occurred in 1700 CE. Here, we map 9938 deep-seated bedrock landslides in the Oregon Coast Range and use surface roughness dating to estimate that past earthquakes triggered fewer than half of the landslides in the past 1000 years. We find landslide frequency increases with mean annual precipitation but not with modeled peak ground acceleration or proximity to the megathrust. Our results agree with findings about other recent subduction zone earthquakes where relatively few deep-seated landslides were mapped and suggest that despite proximity to the megathrust, most deep-seated landslides in the Oregon Coast Range were triggered by rainfall.},

However, empirical evidence is fragmentary. Here, we reconstruct sea ice exported from the Arctic Ocean over the past 1400 years, using a spatial network of proxy records. We find robust evidence for extreme export of sea ice commencing abruptly around 1300 CE and terminating in the late 1300s. The exceptional magnitude and duration of this “Great Sea-Ice Anomaly” was previously unknown. The pulse of ice along East Greenland resulted in downstream increases in polar waters and ocean stratification, culminating ~1400 CE and sustained during subsequent centuries. While consistent with external forcing theories, the onset and development are notably similar to modeled spontaneous abrupt cooling enhanced by sea-ice feedbacks. These results provide evidence that marked climate changes may not require an external trigger.},

We probed the consequences of truncating the mycobacterial galactan, an essential linear polysaccharide of about 30 residues. Galactan covalently bridges cell envelope layers, with the outermost cell wall linkage point occurring at residue 12. Reducing galactan chain length by approximately half compromises fitness, alters cell morphology, and increases the potency of hydrophobic antibiotics. Systematic variation of the galactan chain length revealed that it determines periplasm size. Thus, glycan chain length can directly affect cellular physiology and antibiotic activity, and mycobacterial glycans, not proteins, regulate periplasm size.},

Coherent seismic energy is evident from 1 to 5 hertz beginning approximately 5 hours before the flood impacted Punakha village, which originated at the source lake and advanced down the valley during the GLOF duration.

Analyses of brain region volume and neural circuits associated with cavefish behavior identified evolutionary convergence in hindbrain and hypothalamic expansion, and changes in neurotransmitter systems, including increased numbers of catecholamine and hypocretin/orexin neurons. To define evolutionary changes in brain function, we performed whole-brain activity mapping associated with behavior. Hunting behavior evoked activity in sensory processing centers, while sleep-associated activity differed in the rostral zone of the hypothalamus and tegmentum.

Here, we create a novel mechanistic framework for understanding and predicting how sleep changes during ontogeny and across phylogeny. We use this theory to quantitatively distinguish between sleep used for neural reorganization versus repair. Our findings reveal an abrupt transition, between 2 and 3 years of age in humans. Specifically, our results show that differences in sleep across phylogeny and during late ontogeny (after 2 or 3 years in humans) are primarily due to sleep functioning for repair or clearance, while changes in sleep during early ontogeny (before 2 or 3 years) primarily support neural reorganization and learning. Moreover, our analysis shows that neuroplastic reorganization occurs primarily in REM sleep but not in NREM. This developmental transition suggests a complex interplay between developmental and evolutionary constraints on sleep.},

This crisis triggered major radiations. In the sea, the rise of the first scleractinian reefs and rock-forming calcareous nannofossils points to substantial changes in ocean chemistry. On land, there were major diversifications and originations of conifers, insects, dinosaurs, crocodiles, lizards, turtles, and mammals.

Transcriptomes revealed a specific gene regulatory network (GRN) mediating both brain anatomy changes and behavioral modifications.

This “prolonged dependency” is considered key for the evolution of other notable human traits, such as large brains, complex societies, and extended postreproductive lifespans. Prolonged dependency must therefore have evolved under conditions in which reproductive success is gained with parental investment and diminished with early parental loss. We tested this idea using data from wild chimpanzees, which have similarly extended immature years as humans and prolonged mother-offspring associations. Males who lost their mothers after weaning but before maturity began reproducing later and had lower average reproductive success. Thus, persistent mother-immature son associations seem vital for enhancing male reproductive success, although mothers barely provision sons after weaning. We posit that these associations lead to social gains, crucial for successful reproduction in complex social societies, and offer insights into the evolution of prolonged dependency.},

Recent computational-experimental screenings have identified several existing drugs that could serve as effective inhibitors of the virus’ main protease, M pro , which is involved in gene expression and replication. Among these, ebselen (2-phenyl-1, 2-benzoselenazol-3-one) appears to be particularly promising. Here, we examine, at a molecular level, the potential of ebselen to decrease M pro activity. We find that it exhibits a distinct affinity for the catalytic region. Our results reveal a higher-affinity, previously unknown binding site localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed strain analysis indicates that, on such a site, ebselen exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access through surface-loop interactions, thereby inducing a reconfiguration of water hotspots. Together, these findings highlight the promise of ebselen as a repurposed drug against SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract     = {Recent reports suggest that 10 to 30\% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) infected patients are asymptomatic and that viral shedding may occur before symptom onset. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities to prevent disease spread. We developed P-BEST, a method for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing, which identifies all positive subjects within a set of samples using a single round of testing. Each sample is assigned into multiple pools using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing. We pooled sets of 384 samples into 48 pools, providing both an eightfold increase in testing efficiency and an eightfold reduction in test costs, while identifying up to five positive carriers. We then used P-BEST to screen 1115 health care workers using 144 tests. P- BEST provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for increasing testing capacity that can be easily integrated into diagnostic laboratories.},

  abstract     = {Biodiversity loss is a social and ecological emergency, and calls have been made for the global expansion of protected areas (PAs) to tackle this crisis. It is unclear, however, where best to locate new PAs to protect biodiversity cost-effectively. To answer this question, we conducted a spatial meta-analysis by overlaying seven global biodiversity templates to identify conservation priority zones. These are then combined with low human impact areas to identify cost-effective zones (CEZs) for PA designation. CEZs cover around 38\% of global terrestrial area, of which only 24\% is currently covered by existing PAs. To protect more CEZs, we propose three scenarios with conservative, moderate, and ambitious targets, which aim to protect 19, 26, and 43\% of global terrestrial area, respectively. These three targets are set for each Convention on Biological Diversity party with spatially explicit CEZs identified, providing valuable decision support for the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.},

Here, we show that restraint stress leads to hyperarousal associated with strong activation of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (CRH PVN ) and hypocretin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (Hcrt LH ). CRH PVN neurons directly innervate Hcrt LH neurons, and optogenetic stimulation of LH-projecting CRH PVN neurons elicits hyperarousal. CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockdown of the crh gene in CRH PVN neurons abolishes hyperarousal induced by stimulating LH-projecting CRH PVN neurons. Genetic ablation of Hcrt neurons or crh gene knockdown significantly counteracts restraint stress–induced hyperarousal. Single-cell mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) revealed extensive changes to immune cell distribution and functional responses in peripheral blood during hyperarousal upon optogenetic stimulation of CRH PVN neurons simulating stress-induced insomnia. Our findings suggest both central and peripheral systems are synergistically engaged in the response to stress via CRH PVN circuitry.},

Furthermore, tests have proven difficult because factors besides ecology can drive changes in morphology. Here, we document the ecomorphometric evolution of the extinct Ammonoidea at 1-million-year resolution, from their origination in the Early Devonian (Emsian) to the Early Triassic (Induan), over ~156 million years. This time interval encompasses six global extinction events, including two of the Big Five, and incorporates multiple ammonoid radiations. However, we find no evidence for early bursts of ecomorphological disparity. This contradicts arguments that the temporal scope, or traits measured in genomic data, conceal evidence of early bursts. Rather, early bursts may be less prevalent in fossil data than is often assumed.},

Here, we use persistent homology, an emergent type of topological data analysis, to understand MRO structure in sodium silicate glasses. To enable this analysis, we introduce a self-consistent categorization of rings with rigorous geometrical definitions of the structural entities. Furthermore, we enable quantitative comparison of the persistence diagrams by computing the cumulative sum of all points weighted by their lifetime. On the basis of these analysis methods, we show that the approach can be used to deconvolute the contributions of various MRO features to the FSDP. More generally, the developed methodology can be applied to analyze and categorize molecular dynamics data and understand MRO structure in any class of amorphous solids.},

So far, effective approved drugs for hepatic steatosis are still in development, and removing the unnecessary TG from the hepatocytes is an enormous challenge. Here, we explore a promising anti-hepatic steatosis strategy by boosting hepatocellular TG transport using β-alanine–modified gadofullerene (GF-Ala) nanoparticles. We confirm that GF-Ala could reverse hepatic steatosis in oleic acid–induced hepatocytes, fructose-induced mice, and obesity-associated transgenic ob/ob mice. Observably, GF-Ala improves hepatomegaly and hepatic lipid accumulation, reduces lipid peroxidation, and repairs abnormal mitochondria. Of note, we demonstrate that GF-Ala markedly inhibits the posttranslational degradation of apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) and boosts hepatocellular TG transport based on their superior antioxidant property. Together, we conclude that GF-Ala could potently ameliorate hepatic TG transport and maintain hepatic metabolic homeostasis without apparent toxicity, being beneficial for treatments of hepatic steatosis and other fatty liver diseases.},

We revealed that the onset of phototransduction is accompanied by a rapid (&lt;5 ms), nanometer-scale electromechanical deformation in individual human cone photoreceptors. Characterizing this biophysical phenomenon associated with phototransduction in vivo was enabled by high-speed phase-resolved optical coherence tomography in a line-field configuration that allowed sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to visualize the nanometer/millisecond-scale light-induced shape change in photoreceptors. The deformation was explained as the optical manifestation of electrical activity, caused due to rapid charge displacement following isomerization, resulting in changes of electrical potential and surface tension within the photoreceptor disc membranes. These all-optical recordings of light-induced activity in the human retina constitute an optoretinogram and hold remarkable potential to reveal the biophysical correlates of neural activity in health and disease.},

Besides, we further implement broadband achromatic polarization beamsplitter with high polarization isolation (extinction ratio up to 21). The adoption of all-silicon configuration not only facilitates the integration with CMOS technology but also endows the polarization multiplexing meta-atoms with broad phase dispersion coverage, ensuring the large size and high performance of the metadevices.

We found that lysine-specific demethylase 1A ( Kdm1a/Lsd1 ) is absolutely required for Paneth cell differentiation. Lsd1 -deficient crypts, devoid of Paneth cells, are still able to form organoids without a requirement of exogenous or endogenous Wnt. Mechanistically, we find that LSD1 enzymatically represses genes that are normally expressed only in fetal and neonatal epithelium. This gene profile is similar to what is seen in repairing epithelium, and we find that Lsd1 -deficient epithelium has superior regenerative capacities after irradiation injury.

The location and clustering of the immobilized chain ends are analyzed by spin diffusion. Fast 1 H spin diffusion from the amorphous regions shows confinement of chain ends to the crystallite surface, corroborated by fast 13 C spin exchange between chain ends.

Here, we find that several phosphorylation sites in the human vasopressin receptor (V 2 R), positioned either individually or in clusters, differentially contribute to βarr recruitment, trafficking, and ERK1/2 activation. Even a single phosphorylation site in V 2 R, suitably positioned to cross-talk with a key residue in βarrs, has a decisive contribution in βarr recruitment, and its mutation results in strong G-protein bias. Molecular dynamics simulation provides mechanistic insights into the pivotal role of this key phosphorylation site in governing the stability of βarr interaction and regulating the interdomain rotation in βarrs.

Likely Trump-voting Florida residents were 10 to 11 percentage points less likely to evacuate Hurricane Irma than Clinton voters (34\% versus 45\%), a gap not present in prior hurricanes. Results are robust to fine-grain geographic controls, which compare likely Clinton and Trump voters living within 150 m of each other. The rapid surge in media-led suspicion of hurricane forecasts—and the resulting divide in self-protective measures—illustrates a large behavioral consequence of science denialism.},

  abstract     = {The role of ocean anoxia as a cause of the end-Triassic marine mass extinction is widely debated. Here, we present carbonate-associated sulfate δ 34 S data from sections spanning the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic transition, which document synchronous large positive excursions on a global scale occurring in ~50 thousand years. Biogeochemical modeling demonstrates that this S isotope perturbation is best explained by a fivefold increase in global pyrite burial, consistent with large-scale development of marine anoxia on the Panthalassa margin and northwest European shelf. This pyrite burial event coincides with the loss of Triassic taxa seen in the studied sections. Modeling results also indicate that the pre-event ocean sulfate concentration was low (&lt;1 millimolar), a common feature of many Phanerozoic deoxygenation events. We propose that sulfate scarcity preconditions oceans for the development of anoxia during rapid warming events by increasing the benthic methane flux and the resulting bottom-water oxygen demand.},

Here, we show that postsynaptic differences between cells also make a strong contribution to response differences. Cells in the dorsal retina had longer axon initial segments (AISs)—the greater number of Na v 1.6 channels in longer AISs directly mediates higher rates of spiking and helps avoid depolarization block that terminates spiking in ventral cells with shorter AISs. The pre- and postsynaptic specializations that shape the output of OFF-α T RGCs interact in different ways: In dorsal cells, strong inputs and the long AISs are both necessary to generate their strong, sustained spiking outputs, while in ventral cells, weak inputs or the short AISs are both sufficient to limit the spiking signal.},

In this study, we explored the dynamics of free holes in methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr 3 ) single crystals using the time-of-flight (ToF) current spectroscopy. By combining ToF spectroscopy and Monte Carlo simulation, three energy states were detected in the bandgap of MAPbBr 3 . In addition, we found the trapping and detrapping rates of free holes ranging from a few microseconds to hundreds of microseconds. Contrary to previous studies, we revealed a strong detrapping activity of traps. We showed that these traps substantially affect the transport properties of MAPbBr 3 , including mobility and mobility-lifetime product.

Yet, their implementation in real-world scenarios is challenging, mostly because of sensitivity of quantum correlations to scattering. Recent developments in optimizing the shape of single photons introduce new ways to control entangled photons. Nevertheless, shaping single photons in real time remains a challenge due to the weak associated signals, which are too noisy for optimization processes. Here, we overcome this challenge and control scattering of entangled photons by shaping the classical laser beam that stimulates their creation. We discover that because the classical beam and the entangled photons follow the same path, the strong classical signal can be used for optimizing the weak quantum signal. We show that this approach can increase the length of free-space turbulent quantum links by up to two orders of magnitude, opening the door for using wavefront shaping for quantum communications.},

ICOS/ICOSL axis–mediated glucose incorporation and utilization were crucial for inflammatory T H subset induction by B cells, and activation of mTOR was critical for T cell glycolysis in this process. Consistently, upon encountering ICOSL + B cells, activated effector memory T H cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus spontaneously differentiated into inflammatory T H subsets. Immunotherapy using rituximab that specifically depleted B cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis efficiently abrogated the capabilities of memory T H cells to incorporate and use glucose, thereby impairing the pathogenic differentiation of inflammatory T H subsets.},

We determined that drug target genes with five genetic features—tissue specificity of gene expression, Mendelian associations, phenotype- and tissue-level effects of genome-wide association (GWA) loci driven by eQTL, and genetic constraint—confer a 2.6-fold greater risk of side effects, compared to genes without such features.

Emerging directional liquid transport applications have prosperously advanced in recent years but still present some challenges.

Here, we describe a multicomponent hydrogel that recapitulates the 3D fibrous structure of interstitial tissue regions where idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) initiates. In contrast to findings on 2D hydrogels, myofibroblast differentiation in 3D was inversely correlated with hydrogel stiffness but positively correlated with matrix fibers. Using a multistep bioinformatics analysis of IPF patient transcriptomes and in vitro pharmacologic screening, we identify matrix metalloproteinase activity to be essential for 3D but not 2D myofibroblast differentiation. Given our observation that compliant degradable 3D matrices amply support fibrogenesis, these studies demonstrate a departure from the established relationship between stiffness and myofibroblast differentiation in 2D, and provide a new 3D model for studying fibrosis and identifying antifibrotic therapeutics.},

In this work, we present novel insights of the interplay between the distributions of facilities and population that maximize accessibility over the existing road networks. Results in six cities reveal that travel costs could be reduced in half through redistributing facilities. In the optimal scenario, the average travel distance can be modeled as a functional form of the number of facilities and the population density. As an application of this finding, it is possible to estimate the number of facilities needed for reaching a desired average travel distance given the population distribution in a city.},

Nano-XANES was then used to study the trace secondary phases in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) particles.

However, it is largely unknown whether this process is regulated by physical stimuli such as extracellular mechanical signals. Here, we report that DSB repair is regulated by extracellular mechanical signals. Low extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness impairs DSB repair and renders cells sensitive to genotoxic agents. Mechanistically, we found that the MAP4K4/6/7 kinases are activated and phosphorylate ubiquitin in cells at low stiffness. Phosphorylated ubiquitin impairs RNF8-mediated ubiquitin signaling at DSB sites, leading to DSB repair deficiency. Our results thus demonstrate that ECM stiffness regulates DSB repair efficiency and genotoxic sensitivity through MAP4K4/6/7 kinase–mediated ubiquitin phosphorylation, providing a previously unidentified regulation in DSB-induced ubiquitin signaling.},

Here, we present multifunctional acoustic tweezers that can manipulate bioparticles in a disposable Petri dish. Various functionalities including cell patterning, tissue engineering, concentrating particles, translating cells, stimulating cells, and cell lysis are demonstrated. Moreover, leaky surface acoustic wave–based holography is achieved by encoding required phases in electrode profiles of interdigitated transducers. This overcomes the frequency and resolution limits of previous holographic techniques to control three-dimensional acoustic beams in microscale. This study presents a favorable technique for noncontact and label-free manipulation of bioparticles in commonly used Petri dishes.

However, it is challenging to reduce the size of biocompatible thermometers down to submicrometers, despite their potential applications for the thermal imaging of subtissue structures with single-cell resolution. Here, using quantum nanothermometers based on optically accessible electron spins in nanodiamonds, we demonstrate in vivo real-time temperature monitoring inside Caenorhabditis elegans worms. We developed a microscope system that integrates a quick-docking sample chamber, particle tracking, and an error correction filter for temperature monitoring of mobile nanodiamonds inside live adult worms with a precision of ±0.22°C. With this system, we determined temperature increases based on the worms’ thermogenic responses during the chemical stimuli of mitochondrial uncouplers. Our technique demonstrates the submicrometer localization of temperature information in living animals and direct identification of their pharmacological thermogenesis, which may allow for quantification of their biological activities based on temperature.},

Two-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures offer a unique method to create a quantum light source: Moiré trapping potentials for excitons are predicted to create arrays of quantum emitters. While signatures of moiré-trapped excitons have been observed, their quantum nature has yet to be confirmed. Here, we report photon antibunching from single moiré-trapped interlayer excitons in a heterobilayer. Via magneto-optical spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the discrete anharmonic spectra arise from bound band-edge electron-hole pairs trapped in moiré potentials. Last, we exploit the large permanent dipole of interlayer excitons to achieve large direct current (DC) Stark tuning up to 40 meV. Our results confirm the quantum nature of moiré-confined excitons and open opportunities to investigate their inhomogeneity and interactions between the emitters or energetically tune single emitters into resonance with cavity modes.},

Understanding its mechanistic complexity requires simple tractable systems that can be used for these studies. In the early spider embryo, Hh signaling mediates the formation of overall anterior-posterior polarity, yet it remains unclear what mechanisms link the initial Hh signaling activity with body axis segmentation, in which distinct periodic stripe-forming dynamics occur depending on the body region. We performed genome-wide searches for genes that transcriptionally respond to altered states of Hh signaling. Characterization of genes negatively regulated by Hh signaling suggested that msx1 , encoding a conserved transcription factor, functions as a key segmentation gene. Knockdown of msx1 prevented all dynamic processes causing spatial repetition of stripes, including temporally repetitive oscillations and bi-splitting, and temporally nonrepetitive tri-splitting. Thus, Hh signaling controls segmentation dynamics and diversity via msx1 . These genome-wide data from an invertebrate illuminate novel mechanistic features of Hh-based patterning.},

However, mechanical cues in soft and biological materials often occur at low Re , where waves are overdamped. Overdamped waves are not only difficult to observe experimentally, also theoretically their description remains incomplete. Here, we present direct measurements of the propagation and attenuation of mechanical signals in colloidal soft solids, induced by an optical trap. We derive an analytical theory for low Re wave propagation and damping, which is in excellent agreement with the experiments. Our results present both a previously unexplored method to characterize damped waves in soft solids and a theoretical framework showing how localized mechanical signals can provoke a remote and delayed response.},

Our analysis revealed that reprogramming cells proceed in an asynchronous trajectory and diversify into heterogeneous subpopulations. We identified fluorescent probes and surface markers to enrich for the early reprogrammed human cells. Furthermore, combinatory usage of the surface markers enabled the fine segregation of the early-intermediate cells with diverse reprogramming propensities. scATAC-Seq analysis further uncovered the genomic partitions and transcription factors responsible for the regulatory phasing of reprogramming process. Binary choice between a FOSL1 and a TEAD4-centric regulatory network determines the outcome of a successful reprogramming. Together, our study illuminates the multitude of diverse routes transversed by individual reprogramming cells and presents an integrative roadmap for identifying the mechanistic part list of the reprogramming machinery.},

No approved adjuvants yet have the capability to independently modulate inflammation and protection. Here, we demonstrate a method to limit inflammation while retaining and often increasing the protective responses. To accomplish this goal, we combined a partial selective nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) inhibitor with several current adjuvants. The resulting vaccines reduce systemic inflammation and boost protective responses. In an influenza challenge model, we demonstrate that this approach enhances protection. This method was tested across a broad range of adjuvants and antigens. We anticipate these studies will lead to an alternative approach to vaccine formulation design that may prove broadly applicable to a wide range of adjuvants and vaccines.},

Similar to in vivo dormant blastocysts, let-7–induced dormant blastocysts exhibited low level of proliferation, apoptosis, and nutrient metabolism. Let-7 suppressed c-myc/mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling to induce embryonic diapause. It also inhibited ODC1 expression reducing biosynthesis of polyamines, which are known to reactivate dormant embryos. Furthermore, the overexpression of let-7 blocked trophoblast differentiation and implantation potential of human embryo surrogates, and prolonged survival of human blastocysts in vitro, supporting the idea that embryonic diapause was an evolutionary conserved phenomenon.

Here, we close this gap by introducing a simple yet general method to prove the security of QKD with arbitrarily long-range pulse correlations. Our method is compatible with those security proofs that accommodate all the other typical device imperfections, thus paving the way toward achieving implementation security in QKD with arbitrary flawed devices. Moreover, we introduce a new framework for security proofs, which we call the reference technique.

In tumor cells, the ROS boosted the ABTS· + production to activate photothermal-induced ICD. In DCs, it relieved the immunosuppression, promoting DC maturation (57\%) and antigen presenting. As a result of the ML assistant, the therapeutic systems improved the infiltration of CD8 + T cells to 53\% in tumor tissues, eliciting strong abscopal effect and antimetastasis effect. The MLs were believed to be a superior candidate of adjuvants for enhancing immune response and cancer therapeutic efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Evidence across social science indicates that average effects of persuasive messages are small. One commonly offered explanation for these small effects is heterogeneity: Persuasion may only work well in specific circumstances. To evaluate heterogeneity, we repeated an experiment weekly in real time using 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign advertisements. We tested 49 political advertisements in 59 unique experiments on 34, 000 people. We investigate heterogeneous effects by sender (candidates or groups), receiver (subject partisanship), content (attack or promotional), and context (battleground versus non-battleground, primary versus general election, and early versus late). We find small average effects on candidate favorability and vote. These small effects, however, do not mask substantial heterogeneity even where theory from political science suggests that we should find it. During the primary and general election, in battleground states, for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, effects are similarly small. Heterogeneity with large offsetting effects is not the source of small average effects.},

Oxidative damage produces a unique change in the high-frequency (&gt;10 4 Hz) impedance and phase signals of leaves, which is not replicated by other abiotic stressors, such as drought. The polymer tattoos are resilient against ozone-induced chemical degradation and persist on the leaves of fruiting plants, thus allowing for frequent and long-term monitoring of cellular ozone damage in economically important crops, such as grapes and apples.},

Plasmonic colors emerging from resonant interactions between light and metallic nanostructures can overcome these restrictions. With dynamic characteristics enabled by functional materials, dynamic plasmonic coloration may find a variety of applications in display technologies. In this review, we elucidate basic concepts for dynamic plasmonic color generation and highlight recent advances. In particular, we devote our review to a selection of dynamic controls endowed by functional materials, including magnesium, liquid crystals, electrochromic polymers, and phase change materials.

Stable isotope analysis directly reveals the foods consumed by individuals. We present multi-tissue isotope analyses of two Ancient Beringian infants from the Upward Sun River site (USR), Alaska (~11, 500 years ago). Models of fetal bone turnover combined with seasonally-sensitive taxa show that the carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of USR infant bone collagen reflects maternal diets over the summer. Using comparative faunal isotope data, we demonstrate that although terrestrial sources dominated maternal diets, salmon was also important, supported by carbon isotope analysis of essential amino acids and bone bioapatite. Tooth enamel samples indicate increased salmon use between spring and summer. Our results do not support either strictly megafaunal specialists or generalized foragers but indicate that Ancient Beringian diets were complex and seasonally structured.},

Here, we show that the 2014–2016 El Niño contributed to the observed cooling through an unusual combination of both the reduced heat advection from the Pacific (dominant in the eastern SIO) and the basin-wide cyclonic wind anomaly that led to shoaling of isotherms (dominant in the western SIO). The ensuing recovery was mainly forced by an anticyclonic wind anomaly associated with stronger trade winds that caused deepening of isotherms and upper-ocean warming, effectively suppressing the 2014–2016 cooling signal propagating from the eastern boundary. The results presented here highlight the complexity of the SIO heat content variability driven by remote and local forcing.},

The coat proteins (CPs) in these genomes are particularly diverse, with notable variation in length and often no recognizable similarity to previously known viruses. We recombinantly expressed metagenome-derived ssRNA phage CPs to produce virus-like particles and determined the three-dimensional structure of 22 previously uncharacterized ssRNA phage capsids covering nine distinct CP types. The structures revealed substantial deviations from the previously known ssRNA phage CP fold, uncovered an unusual prolate particle shape, and revealed a previously unseen dsRNA binding mode.

At typical temperature and solar conditions simulating different life cycle stages (i.e., storage, paving, and use), common road and roofing asphalts produced complex mixtures of organic compounds, including hazardous pollutants. Chemically speciated emission factors using high-resolution mass spectrometry reveal considerable oxygen and reduced sulfur content and the predominance of aromatic (~30\%) and intermediate/semivolatile organic compounds (~85\%), which together produce high overall secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields. Emissions rose markedly with moderate solar exposure (e.g., 300\% for road asphalt) with greater SOA yields and sustained SOA production. On urban scales, annual estimates of asphalt-related SOA precursor emissions exceed those from motor vehicles and substantially increase existing estimates from noncombustion sources. Yet, their emissions and impacts will be concentrated during the hottest, sunniest periods with greater photochemical activity and SOA production.},

Transmission of thermosensory signals into hypothalamic thermoregulation centers represents a key layer of regulation in heat defense. Yet, how these signals are transmitted into the hypothalamus remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB) glutamatergic prodynorphin and cholecystokinin neuron populations are progressively recruited to defend elevated body temperature. These two nonoverlapping neuron types form circuits with downstream preoptic hypothalamic neurons to inhibit the thermogenesis of brown adipose tissues (BATs) and activate tail vasodilation, respectively. Both circuits are activated by warmth and can limit fever development. The prodynorphin circuit is further required for regulating energy expenditure and body weight homeostasis. Thus, these findings establish that the genetic and functional specificity of heat defense neurons occurs as early as in the LPB and uncover categorical neuron types for encoding two heat defense variables, inhibition of BAT thermogenesis and activation of vasodilation.},

Moreover, mothers choose to invest in offspring over themselves when faced with a tradeoff, whereas fathers choose to invest in themselves. Furthermore, our study suggests a pathway whereby variation in parental behavior (specifically paternal care) may lead to alterations in DNA methylation within the vasopressin receptor 1a gene and gene expression in the lateral septum.

To create an enhanced anti-MRSA lysin, a novel variant of lysostaphin was engineered by T cell epitope deletion. This “deimmunized” lysostaphin dampened human T cell activation, mitigated ADA responses in human HLA transgenic mice, and enabled safe and efficacious repeated dosing during a 6-week longitudinal infection study. Furthermore, the deimmunized lysostaphin evaded established anti–wild-type immunity, thereby providing significant anti-MRSA protection for animals that were immune experienced to the wild-type enzyme.

This is especially disappointing because the N SB nematic is promising for applications in electro-optic devices. By applying an electric field to a planar cell filled with the compound CB7CB, we have found an N TB -N SB phase transition using birefringence measurements. This field-induced transition to the biaxial N SB occurred, although the field was applied along the symmetry axis of the macroscopically uniaxial N TB . Therefore, this transition is a counterintuitive example of breaking of the macroscopic uniaxial symmetry. We show by theoretical modeling that the transition cannot be explained without considering explicitly the biaxiality of both phases at the microscopic scale. This strongly suggests that molecular biaxiality should be a key factor favoring the stability of the N SB phase.},

Our approach uses reinforcement learning (RL), which finds solution strategies even in the face of large uncertainty and sparse feedback. We demonstrate the potential of our RL approach by removing molecules autonomously with a scanning probe microscope from a supramolecular structure. Our RL agent reaches an excellent performance, enabling us to automate a task that previously had to be performed by a human.

  abstract     = {Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures, which usually exist in noncentrosymmetric materials where the crystal inversion symmetry breaking generates the so-called Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This requirement unfortunately excludes many important magnetic material classes, including the recently found two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials, which offer unprecedented opportunities for spintronic technology. Using photoemission electron microscopy and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, we investigated and stabilized Néel-type magnetic skyrmion in vdW ferromagnetic Fe 3 GeTe 2 on top of (Co/Pd) n in which the Fe 3 GeTe 2 has a centrosymmetric crystal structure. We demonstrate that the magnetic coupling between the Fe 3 GeTe 2 and the (Co/Pd) n could create skyrmions in Fe 3 GeTe 2 without the need of an external magnetic field. Our results open exciting opportunities in spintronic research and the engineering of topologically protected nanoscale features by expanding the group of skyrmion host materials to include these previously unknown vdW magnets.},

However, the rational design and efficient regulation of PDA absorption property remain a challenge due to the complex structure within PDA. In this work, we propose a facile method to regulate the light absorption behaviors of PDA by constructing donor-acceptor pairs within the microstructures through the chemical connections between indoledihydroxy/indolequinone and their oligomers with 2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl moiety. The detailed structural and spectral analysis, as well as the density functional theory simulation, further confirms the existence of donor-acceptor molecular pair structures, which could decrease the energy bandgap and increase the electron delocalization for enhancing light absorption across a broad spectrum. These rationally designed PDA nanoparticles with tunable absorption properties also show improved total photothermal effect and demonstrate excellent performances in solar desalination.},

Upon irradiation, the gel system exhibited heat-responsive release of DOX and vaccine-like nanoparticles, CpG-P-ss-M, along with chemotherapy- and phototherapy-generated abundant tumor-specific antigen storage in situ. The released CpG-P-ss-M acted as a carrier adsorbed and delivered antigens to LNs, promoting the uptake of antigens by DCs and DC maturation.

Seemingly stable conformations of viscoelastic structures may gradually creep until their stability is lost, while a discernible creeping in viscoelastic solids does not necessarily lead to instability. In lieu of theoretical predictive tools for viscoelastic instabilities, we are presently limited to numerical simulation to predict future stability. In this work, we describe viscoelastic solids through a temporally evolving instantaneous reference metric with respect to which elastic strains are measured. We show that for incompressible viscoelastic solids, this transparent and intuitive description allows to reduce the question of future stability to static calculations. We demonstrate the predictive power of the approach by elucidating the subtle mechanism of delayed instability in thin elastomeric shells, showing quantitative agreement with experiments.},

We used PhenoChip to expose single cells of the coral symbiont Symbiodinium to thermal and chemical treatments and monitor single-cell photophysiology via chlorophyll fluorometry. This revealed strain-specific thermal sensitivity thresholds and distinct pH optima for photosynthetic performance, and permitted the identification of single cells with elevated resilience toward rising temperature.

Following taxonomic identification with FISH probes, the growth and division patterns of the corresponding bacterial taxa, including species that cannot be cultured separately in vitro, are revealed.

We specifically test the hypothesis of human-caused extinctions by using posterior predictive methods. We find that human population size is able to predict past extinctions with 96\% accuracy. Predictors based on past climate, in contrast, perform no better than expected by chance, suggesting that climate had a negligible impact on global mammal extinctions.

Near the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas fault, low-frequency earthquakes and slow-slip events take place deeper than most seismicity, at temperature conditions typically associated with stable sliding. However, laboratory experiments indicate that the strength of granitic gouge decreases with increasing temperature above 350°C, providing a possible mechanism for weakening if temperature is to vary dynamically. Here, we argue that recurring low-frequency earthquakes and slow-slip transients at these depths may arise because of shear heating and the temperature dependence of frictional resistance. Recurring thermal instabilities can explain the recurrence pattern of the mid-crustal low-frequency earthquakes and their correlative slip distribution. Shear heating associated with slow slip is sufficient to generate pseudotachylyte veins in host rocks even when fault slip is dominantly aseismic.},

The induced spoof surface plasmon polariton helps overcome inherent emissivity loss of the polymer and creates near-ideal selective and broadband emission on the separate sides. This design results in not only remarkable surface cooling when the J ET is attached with either side facing outwards but also space cooling when used as an enclosure wall.

The mammalian SC has eight structural components, including SYCE1, the only central element protein with known causative mutations in human infertility. We combine mouse genetics, cellular, and biochemical studies to reveal that SYCE1 undergoes multivalent interactions with SC component SIX6OS1. The N terminus of SIX6OS1 binds and disrupts SYCE1’s core dimeric structure to form a 1:1 complex, while their downstream sequences provide a distinct second interface. These interfaces are separately disrupted by SYCE1 mutations associated with nonobstructive azoospermia and premature ovarian failure (POF), respectively. Mice harboring SYCE1’s POF mutation and a targeted deletion within SIX6OS1’s N terminus are infertile with failure of chromosome synapsis. We conclude that both SYCE1-SIX6OS1 binding interfaces are essential for SC assembly, thus explaining how SYCE1’s reported clinical mutations give rise to human infertility.},

Here, we provide evidence that histone exchange at gene promoters is not simply a consequence of PIC assembly or transcription but instead is mediated by activators. We further show that not all activators up-regulate gene expression by inducing histone turnover. Thus, histone exchange does not simply correlate with transcriptional activity, but instead reflects the mode of action of the activator.

Fixed cell–based approaches can provide snapshots of high-dimensional expression profiles but have fundamental limits on revealing temporal information, and fluorescence-based live-cell imaging approaches provide temporal information but are technically challenging for multiplex long-term imaging. We first developed a live-cell imaging platform that tracks cellular status change through combining endogenous fluorescent labeling that minimizes perturbation to cell physiology and/or live-cell imaging of high-dimensional cell morphological and texture features. With our platform and an A549 VIM-RFP epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) reporter cell line, live-cell trajectories reveal parallel paths of EMT missing from snapshot data due to cell-cell dynamic heterogeneity.

However, the current approach to hyperthermia involves exposures lasting tens of minutes to hours, which is not possible to achieve in many circumstances because of blood vessel cooling and respiratory motion. Here, we investigate a novel approach to overcome these limitations: to use fractionated ultrashort (~30 s) thermal exposures (~41° to 45°C) to release doxorubicin from a thermosensitive liposome. This is first demonstrated in a dorsal chamber tumor model using two-photon microscopy. Thermal exposures were then conducted with a rabbit tumor model using a custom MRgFUS system incorporating temperature feedback control. Drug release was confirmed, and longitudinal experiments demonstrated profoundly enhanced tumor growth inhibition and survival.},

  abstract     = {Immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment allow cancer cells to escape immune recognition and support cancer progression and dissemination. To improve therapeutic efficacy, we designed a liposomal oxaliplatin formulation (PCL8-U75) that elicits cytotoxic effects toward both cancer and immunosuppressive cells via protease-mediated, intratumoral liposome activation. The PCL8-U75 liposomes displayed superior therapeutic efficacy across all syngeneic cancer models in comparison to free-drug and liposomal controls. The PCL8-U75 depleted myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. The combination of improved cancer cell cytotoxicity and depletion of immunosuppressive populations of immune cells is attractive for combination with immune-activating therapy. Combining the PCL8-U75 liposomes with a TLR7 agonist induced immunological rejection of established tumors. This combination therapy increased intratumoral numbers of cancer antigen–specific cytotoxic T cells and Foxp3 − T helper cells. These results are encouraging toward advancing liposomal drug delivery systems with anticancer and immune-modulating properties into clinical cancer therapy.},

Here, we show that the PC regulates neuronal migration via cyclic adenosine 3’-5’ monosphosphate (cAMP) production activating centrosomal protein kinase A (PKA). Biosensor live imaging revealed a periodic cAMP hotspot at the centrosome of embryonic, postnatal, and adult migrating neurons. Genetic ablation of the PC, or knockdown of ciliary adenylate cyclase 3, caused hotspot disappearance and migratory defects, with defective centrosome dynamics and altered nucleokinesis. Delocalization of PKA from the centrosome phenocopied the migratory defects. Our results show that the PC and centrosome form a single cAMP signaling unit dynamically regulating migration, further highlighting the centrosome as a signaling hub.},

Our analyses of the Moon Mineralogy Mapper data show that hematite, a ferric mineral, is present at high latitudes on the Moon, mostly associated with east- and equator-facing sides of topographic highs, and is more prevalent on the nearside than the farside. Oxygen delivered from Earth’s upper atmosphere could be the major oxidant that forms lunar hematite. Hematite at craters of different ages may have preserved the oxygen isotopes of Earth’s atmosphere in the past billions of years. Future oxygen isotope measurements can test our hypothesis and may help reveal the evolution of Earth’s atmosphere.},

  abstract     = {For normal neurogenesis and circuit formation, delamination of differentiating neurons from the proliferative zone must be precisely controlled; however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying cell attachment are poorly understood. Here, we show that Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) controls neuronal delamination by local suppression of the RapGEF2–Rap1–N-cadherin cascade at the apical endfeet in the dorsal midbrain. Dscam transcripts were expressed in differentiating neurons, and DSCAM protein accumulated at the distal part of the apical endfeet. Cre- loxP –based neuronal labeling revealed that Dscam knockdown impaired endfeet detachment from ventricles. DSCAM associated with RapGEF2 to inactivate Rap1, whose activity is required for membrane localization of N-cadherin. Correspondingly, Dscam knockdown increased N-cadherin localization and ventricular attachment area at the endfeet. Furthermore, excessive endfeet attachment by Dscam knockdown was restored by co-knockdown of RapGEF2 or N-cadherin . Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanism that regulates a critical step in early neuronal development.},

We found increased WM in the cerebellum after spaceflight, providing the first clear evidence of sensorimotor neuroplasticity. At the region of interest level, this increase persisted 7 months after return to Earth. We also observe a widespread redistribution of CSF, with concomitant changes in the voxel fractions of adjacent GM. We show that these GM changes are the result of morphological changes rather than net tissue loss, which remained unclear from previous studies.

OCT6-based reprogramming does not alter the mesenchymal-epithelial transition but is attenuated through the delayed activation of the pluripotency network in comparison with OCT4-based reprogramming. Creating a series of reciprocal domain-swapped chimeras and mutants across all OCT factors, we clearly delineate essential elements of OCT4/OCT6-dependent reprogramming and, conversely, identify the features that prevent induction of pluripotency by other OCT factors. With this strategy, we further discover various chimeric proteins that are superior to OCT4 in reprogramming. Our findings clarify how reprogramming competences of OCT factors are conferred through their structural components.},

Moreover, we observed that the habenular neurons display spatiotemporally structured spontaneous activity that shows prominent alterations and refinement with age. These alterations in habenular activity are accompanied by sequential neurogenesis and the integration of distinct neural clusters across development.

Here, we recorded single-unit activity in the neocortex in awake nonhuman primates during TACS and found dose-dependent neural entrainment to the stimulation waveform. Cluster analysis of changes in interspike intervals identified two main types of neural responses to TACS—increased burstiness and phase entrainment.

  abstract     = {Deep CO 2 emissions characterize many nonvolcanic, seismically active regions worldwide, and the involvement of deep CO 2 in the earthquake cycle is now generally recognized. However, no long-time records of such emissions have been published, and the temporal relations between earthquake occurrence and tectonic CO 2 release remain enigmatic. Here, we report a 10-year record (2009–2018) of tectonic CO 2 flux in the Apennines (Italy) during intense seismicity. The gas emission correlates with the evolution of the seismic sequences: Peaks in the deep CO 2 flux are observed in periods of high seismicity and decays as the energy and number of earthquakes decrease. We propose that the evolution of seismicity is modulated by the ascent of CO 2 accumulated in crustal reservoirs and originating from the melting of subducted carbonates. This large-scale, continuous process of CO 2 production favors the formation of overpressurized CO 2 -rich reservoirs potentially able to trigger earthquakes at crustal depth.},

Recent results from neutron total scattering experiments have shown that the atomic arrangements of many disordered crystalline materials are not random nor are they represented by the long-range structure observed from diffraction experiments. Despite the importance of disordered materials and the impact of disorder on the expression of physical properties, the underlying fundamental atomic-scale rules of disordering are not currently well understood. Here, we report that heterogeneous disordering (and associated structural distortions) can be understood by the straightforward application of Pauling’s rules (1929). This insight, corroborated by first principles calculations, can be used to predict the short-range, atomic-scale changes that result from structural disordering induced by extreme conditions associated with energy-related applications, such as high temperature, high pressure, and intense radiation fields.},

Strongly correlated Weyl semimetals, particularly when magnetism is incorporated, offer a unique and fertile platform to explore emergent phenomena in novel topological matter and topological spintronics. The antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Mn 3 Sn exhibits many exotic physical properties such as a large spontaneous Hall effect and has recently attracted intense interest. In this work, we report synthesis of epitaxial Mn 3+ x Sn 1− x films with greatly extended compositional range in comparison with that of bulk samples. As Sn atoms are replaced by magnetic Mn atoms, the Kondo effect, which is a celebrated example of strong correlations, emerges, develops coherence, and induces a hybridization energy gap. The magnetic doping and gap opening lead to rich extraordinary properties, as exemplified by the prominent DC Hall effects and resonance-enhanced terahertz Faraday rotation.},

Fibrin must be mechanically tough to withstand rupture, after which life-threatening pieces (thrombotic emboli) are carried downstream by blood flow. Despite multiple studies on fibrin viscoelasticity, mechanisms of fibrin rupture remain unknown. Here, we examined mechanically and structurally the strain-driven rupture of human blood plasma–derived fibrin clots where clotting was triggered with tissue factor. Toughness, i.e., resistance to rupture, quantified by the critical energy release rate (a measure of the propensity for clot embolization) of physiologically relevant fibrin gels was determined to be 7.6 ± 0.45 J/m 2 . Finite element (FE) simulations using fibrin material models that account for forced protein unfolding independently supported this measured toughness and showed that breaking of fibers ahead the crack at a critical stretch is the mechanism of rupture of blood clots, including thrombotic embolization.},

We present simple glove-based sensors to accumulate natural sweat with minimal evaporation, capitalizing on high sweat gland densities to collect hundreds of microliters in just 30 min without active sweat stimulation. Sensing electrodes are patterned on nitrile gloves and finger cots for in situ detection of diverse biomarkers, including electrolytes and xenobiotics, and multiple gloves or cots are worn in sequence to track overarching analyte dynamics. Direct integration of sensors into gloves represents a simple and low-overhead scheme for natural sweat analysis, enabling sweat-based physiological monitoring to become practical and routine without requiring highly complex or miniaturized components for analyte collection and signal transduction.},

However, there are no strong indications that modern eukaryotic H 2 metabolism originated from archaea or alphaproteobacteria. Here, we present evidence for the origin of H 2 metabolism genes in eukaryotes from an ancestor of the Anoxychlamydiales—a group of anaerobic chlamydiae, newly described here, from marine sediments. Among Chlamydiae, these bacteria uniquely encode genes for H 2 metabolism and other anaerobiosis-associated pathways. Phylogenetic analyses of several components of H 2 metabolism reveal that Anoxychlamydiales homologs are the closest relatives to eukaryotic sequences. We propose that an ancestor of the Anoxychlamydiales contributed these key genes during the evolution of eukaryotes, supporting a mosaic evolutionary origin of eukaryotic metabolism.},

The conformational space of AS412 was skewed toward β-hairpin–like conformations in closed states, which also depended on HVR1, assigning function to these enigmatic E2 regions. Scavenger receptor class B, type I entry dependency of HCV was associated with NAb resistance and correlated perfectly with decreased virus propensity to interact with HCV co-receptor CD81, indicating that decreased NAb sensitivity resulted in a more complex entry pathway. This link between global E1/E2 states and functionally distinct AS412 conformations has important implications for targeting AS412 in rational HCV vaccine designs.},

Despite 50 years of active research, questions remain concerning the structure and transformation of SiO 2 under shock compression. Continuum gas-gun studies have established that under shock loading quartz transforms through an assumed mixed-phase region to a dense high-pressure phase. While it has often been assumed that this high-pressure phase corresponds to the stishovite structure observed in static experiments, there have been no crystal structure data confirming this. In this study, we use gas-gun shock compression coupled with in situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction to interrogate the crystal structure of shock-compressed α-quartz up to 65 GPa. Our results reveal that α-quartz undergoes a phase transformation to a disordered metastable phase as opposed to crystalline stishovite or an amorphous structure, challenging long-standing assumptions about the dynamic response of this fundamental material.},

To elucidate the contribution of hydrodynamics in determining sites of CTC vascular colonization, the physical forces affecting these cells must be evaluated in a highly controlled manner. To this end, we have bioprinted endothelialized vascular beds and perfused these constructs with metastatic mammary gland cells under physiological flow rates. By pairing these in vitro devices with an advanced computational flow model, we found that the bioprinted analog was readily capable of evaluating the accuracy and integrated complexity of a computational flow model, while also highlighting the discrete contribution of hydrodynamics in vascular colonization. This intersection of these two technologies, bioprinting and computational simulation, is a key demonstration in the establishment of an experimentation pipeline for the understanding of complex biophysical events.},

  abstract     = {The notably lobular distribution of immune lesions in type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been hypothesized to be the result of innervation within the pancreas. To investigate whether neuroimmune interactions could explain this phenomenon, we explored the impact of sympathetic signaling in the RIP-LCMV-GP mouse model of autoimmune diabetes. In this model, the CD8 + T cell attack on β cells replicates a key pathogenic feature of human T1D. We found that inhibition of α 1 adrenoceptors, ablation of sympathetic nerves, and surgical denervation all had a protective effect in this model, without affecting the systemic presence of β cell–reactive CD8 + T cells. In vivo multiphoton imaging revealed a local effect within pancreatic islets including limited infiltration of both macrophages and β cell–specific CD8 + T cells. Islet-resident macrophages expressed adrenoceptors and were responsive to catecholamines. Islet macrophages may therefore constitute a pivotal neuroimmune signaling relay and could be a target for future interventions in T1D.},

This method labeled Ly6C hi and Ly6C lo monocytes after tamoxifen dosing and detected a surge of perivascular macrophages before blood-brain barrier breakdown in adult stroke. When dosed by tamoxifen at embryonic day 17 (E17), this method captured fetal hematopoietic cells at E18, subdural Ki67 + ameboid cells at postnatal day 2 (P2), and perivascular microglia, leptomeningeal macrophages, and Iba1 + Tmem119 + P2RY12 + parenchymal microglia in selective brain regions at P24. Furthermore, this fate mapping strategy revealed an acute influx of monocytes after neonatal stroke, which gradually transformed into a ramified morphology and expressed microglial marker genes (Sall1, Tmem119, and P2RY12) for at least 62 days after injury. These results suggest an underappreciated level of monocyte-to-microglia transition in development and after neonatal stroke.},

The uniform and quantitatively controlled layer of Fe via ALD facilitates the topotactic exsolution, increasing finely dispersed nanoparticles. The introduction of Fe 2 O 3 yields the formation of Ni-Fe alloy owing to the spontaneous alloy formation energy of −0.43 eV, leading to an enhancement of the catalytic activity for dry methane reforming with a prolonged stability of 410 hours. Overall, the abundant alloy nanocatalysts via ALD mark an important step forward in the evolution of exsolution and its application to the field of energy utilization.},

Behavioral trajectories were associated with stable interindividual differences in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and persistent epigenetic effects on neuronal plasticity genes in the hippocampus. Using genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing, we show that one-third of the DNA methylation changes were maintained after withdrawal from the enriched environment.

Here, bioresorbable polyanhydride reservoirs store drugs in defined reservoirs without leakage until wirelessly triggered valve structures open to allow release. These valves operate through an electrochemical mechanism of geometrically accelerated corrosion induced by passage of electrical current from a wireless, bioresorbable power-harvesting unit.

To address this property of cardiolipin, we use the mitochondrial adenosine 5′-diphosphate/adenosine 5′-triphosphate carrier (Aac) as a model. Here, we have determined that cardiolipin is critical for both the tertiary and quaternary assembly of the major yeast Aac isoform Aac2 as well as its conformation. Notably, these cardiolipin-provided structural roles are separable. In addition, we show that multiple copies of Aac2 engage in shared complexes that are largely dependent on the presence of assembled respiratory complexes III and IV or respiratory supercomplexes. Intriguingly, the assembly state of Aac2 is sensitive to its transport-related conformation. Together, these results expand our understanding of the numerous structural roles provided by cardiolipin for mitochondrial membrane proteins.},

We found that mitochondrial dysfunction triggers a profound rewiring of the proteomic landscape, culminating in the sequential activation of precise metabolic programs preceding cell death. Unexpectedly, we identified a marked induction of pyruvate carboxylase (PCx) and other anaplerotic enzymes involved in replenishing tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Suppression of PCx aggravated oxidative stress and neurodegeneration, showing that anaplerosis is protective in OXPHOS-deficient neurons. Restoration of mitochondrial fusion in end-stage degenerating neurons fully reversed these metabolic hallmarks, thereby preventing cell death.

YxxØ mutation, AP2M1 depletion, or disruption by ACA causes incorrect localization of viral proteins, which is exemplified by the failure of nuclear import of IAV nucleoprotein and diminished endoplasmic reticulum localization of ZIKV-NS3 and enterovirus-A71-2C proteins, thereby suppressing viral replication.

YeeE is composed of loops and 13 helices including 9 transmembrane α helices, most of which show an intramolecular pseudo 222 symmetry. Four characteristic loops are buried toward the center of YeeE and form its central region surrounded by the nine helices. Additional electron density maps and successive molecular dynamics simulations imply that thiosulfate can remain temporally at several positions in the proposed pathway.

Wnt signaling directly controls the transcription of an endothelium-specific transcytosis inhibitor, major facilitator superfamily domain–containing protein 2a (MFSD2A), in a β-catenin–dependent manner. MFSD2A overexpression reverses Wnt deficiency–induced transcytosis in endothelial cells and in retinas. Moreover, Wnt signaling mediates MFSD2A-dependent vascular endothelium transcytosis through a caveolin-1 (CAV-1)–positive caveolae pathway. In addition, levels of omega-3 fatty acids are also decreased in Wnt signaling–deficient retinas, reflecting the basic function of MFSD2A as a lipid transporter. Our findings uncovered the Wnt/β-catenin/MFSD2A/CAV-1 axis as a key pathway governing endothelium transcytosis and inner BRB integrity.},

Controlled presentation of SA-PD-L1 on the surface of poly(ethylene glycol) microgels improves local retention of the immunomodulatory agent over 3 weeks in vivo. Furthermore, local induction of allograft acceptance is achieved in a murine model of diabetes only when receiving the SA-PD-L1–presenting biomaterial in combination with a brief rapamycin treatment. Immune characterization revealed an increase in T regulatory and anergic cells after SA-PD-L1-microgel delivery, which was distinct from naïve and biomaterial alone microenvironments.

  abstract     = {Connexin family proteins assemble into hexameric channels called hemichannels/connexons, which function as transmembrane channels or dock together to form gap junction intercellular channels (GJIChs). We determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of human connexin 31.3 (Cx31.3)/GJC3 hemichannels in the presence and absence of calcium ions and with a hearing-loss mutation R15G at 2.3-, 2.5-, and 2.6-Å resolutions, respectively. Compared with available structures of GJICh in open conformation, Cx31.3 hemichannel shows substantial structural changes of highly conserved regions in the connexin family, including opening of calcium ion–binding tunnels, reorganization of salt-bridge networks, exposure of lipid-binding sites, and collocation of amino-terminal helices at the cytoplasmic entrance. We also found that the hemichannel has a pore with a diameter of ~8 Å and selectively transports chloride ions. Our study provides structural insights into the permeant selectivity of Cx31.3 hemichannel.},

Many TEeRS are subsequently co-opted in transcription networks, but how KZFPs influence this process is largely unknown. We identify ZNF417 and ZNF587 as primate-specific KZFPs repressing HERVK (human endogenous retrovirus K) and SVA (SINE-VNTR-Alu) integrants in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Expressed in specific regions of the human developing and adult brain, ZNF417/587 keep controlling TEeRS in ESC-derived neurons and brain organoids, secondarily influencing the differentiation and neurotransmission profile of neurons and preventing the induction of neurotoxic retroviral proteins and an interferon-like response. Thus, evolutionarily recent KZFPs and their TE targets partner up to influence human neuronal differentiation and physiology.},

The predominant hypothesis that micro-damage accumulation exceeds the rate of biological repair is missing a mechanistic explanation. Here, we used collagen hybridizing peptides to measure collagen molecular damage during tendon cyclic fatigue loading and computational simulations to identify potential explanations for our findings. Our results revealed that triple-helical collagen denaturation accumulates with increasing cycles of fatigue loading, and damage is correlated with creep strain independent of the cyclic strain rate. Finite-element simulations demonstrated that biphasic fluid flow is a possible fascicle-level mechanism to explain the rate dependence of the number of cycles and time to failure. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that triple-helical unfolding is rate dependent, revealing rate-dependent mechanisms at multiple length scales in the tissue. The accumulation of collagen molecular denaturation during cyclic loading provides a long-sought “micro-damage” mechanism for the development of overuse injuries.},

Neuropathological studies suggest early AD pathology in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of young adults at genetic risk for AD ( APOE ε4-carriers). Because the EC harbors grid cells, a likely neural substrate of path integration (PI), we examined PI performance in APOE ε4-carriers during a virtual navigation task. We report a selective impairment in APOE ε4-carriers specifically when recruitment of compensatory navigational strategies via supportive spatial cues was disabled. A separate fMRI study revealed that PI performance was associated with the strength of entorhinal grid-like representations when no compensatory strategies were available, suggesting grid cell dysfunction as a mechanistic explanation for PI deficits in APOE ε4-carriers. Furthermore, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex was involved in the recruitment of compensatory navigational strategies via supportive spatial cues. Our results provide evidence for selective PI deficits in AD risk carriers, decades before potential disease onset.},

Here, we describe the development of a biologic that fuses GLP-1 to FGF21 with an elastin-like polypeptide linker that acts as a sustained release module with zero-order drug release. We show that once-weekly dual-agonist treatment of diabetic mice results in potent weight-reducing effects and enhanced glycemic control that are not observed with either agonist alone. Furthermore, the dual-agonist formulation has superior efficacy compared to a GLP-1/FGF21 mixture, demonstrating the utility of combining two structurally distinct peptides into one multifunctional molecule.

  abstract     = {Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a gasotransmitter and a potential therapeutic agent. However, molecular targets relevant to its therapeutic actions remain enigmatic. Sulfide-quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) irreversibly oxidizes H 2 S. Therefore, SQR is assumed to inhibit H 2 S signaling. We now report that SQR-mediated oxidation of H 2 S drives reverse electron transport (RET) at mitochondrial complex I, which, in turn, repurposes mitochondrial function to superoxide production. Unexpectedly, complex I RET, a process dependent on high mitochondrial membrane potential, induces superoxide-dependent mitochondrial uncoupling and downstream activation of adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK). SQR-induced mitochondrial uncoupling is separated from the inhibition of mitochondrial complex IV by H 2 S. Moreover, deletion of SQR, complex I, or AMPK abolishes therapeutic effects of H 2 S following intracerebral hemorrhage. To conclude, SQR mediates H 2 S signaling and therapeutic effects by targeting mitochondrial electron transport to induce mitochondrial uncoupling. Moreover, SQR is a previously unrecognized target for developing non-protonophore uncouplers with broad clinical implications.},

Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense mutation of ACTL7A in both brothers. This mutation is deleterious and causes sperm acrosomal ultrastructural defects. The Actl7a knock-in mouse model was generated, and male mutated mice showed sperm acrosomal defects, which were completely consistent with the observations in patients. Furthermore, the sperm from ACTL7A / Actl7a -mutated men and mice showed reduced expression and abnormal localization of PLCζ as a potential cause of embryonic arrest and failure of fertilization.

Differences from tetrapod limbs include the absence of digit-specific expansion of hoxd13 and hand2 and distal limitation of alx4 and pax9 , which potentially evolved through an enhanced response to shh signaling in limbs. These developmental patterns indicate that the digit program originated in postaxial fin radials and later expanded anteriorly inside of a preexisting autopod-like domain during the evolution of limbs. Our findings provide a genetic framework for the transition of fins into limbs that supports the significance of classical models proposing a bending of the tetrapod metapterygial axis.},

  abstract     = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics have been explored to treat various genetic disorders. Lipid-derived nanomaterials are currently one of the most promising biomaterials that mediate effective mRNA delivery. However, efficiency and safety of this nanomaterial-based mRNA delivery remains a challenge for clinical applications. Here, we constructed a series of lipid-like nanomaterials (LLNs), named functionalized TT derivatives (FTT), for mRNA-based therapeutic applications in vivo. After screenings on the materials, we identified FTT5 as a lead material for efficient delivery of long mRNAs, such as human factor VIII (hFVIII) mRNA (~4.5 kb) for expression of hFVIII protein in hemophilia A mice. Moreover, FTT5 LLNs demonstrated high percentage of base editing on PCSK9 in vivo at a low dose of base editor mRNA (~5.5 kb) and single guide RNA. Consequently, FTT nanomaterials merit further development for mRNA-based therapy.},

Using a prototypical system that can be treated analytically, we show that each of these BICs always splits into a pair of new type BIC and lasing threshold mode when a parity-time (PT)–symmetric perturbation is introduced. The radiation loss at the lasing threshold is exactly balanced by the net gain of the particles. These PT symmetry-induced BICs are different from ordinary BICs, as they can be excited by an external source but do not radiate, and they carry a different quality factor divergence rate from that of the ordinary BICs. While most of the attention of PT-symmetric systems is captured by the coalescence of modes at exceptional points, the splitting of ordinary BICs is a new phenomenon that illustrates the rich physics embedded in PT-symmetric systems.},

The DELTEX family ubiquitin ligases (DTX1 to DTX4 and DTX3L) are characterized by a RING domain followed by a C-terminal domain (DTC) of hitherto unknown function. Here, we use two label-free mass spectrometry techniques to investigate the interactome and ubiquitinated substrates of human DTX2 and identify a large proportion of proteins associated with the DNA damage repair pathway. We show that DTX2-catalyzed ubiquitination of these interacting proteins requires PARP1/2-mediated ADP-ribosylation and depends on the DTC domain. Using a combination of structural, biochemical, and cell-based techniques, we show that the DTX2 DTC domain harbors an ADP-ribose–binding pocket and recruits poly-ADP-ribose (PAR)–modified proteins for ubiquitination. This PAR-binding property of DTC domain is conserved across the DELTEX family E3s. These findings uncover a new ADP-ribose–binding domain that facilitates PAR-dependent ubiquitination.},

While there is growing interest in using cheaters as antiviral therapeutics, the mechanisms underlying cheating have been rarely explored. During experimental evolution of MS2 phage, we observed the parallel emergence of two independent cheater mutants. The first, a point deletion mutant, lacked polymerase activity but was advantageous in viral packaging. The second synonymous mutant cheater displayed a completely different cheating mechanism, involving an altered RNA structure. Continued evolution revealed the demise of the deletion cheater and rise of the synonymous cheater. A mathematical model inferred that while a single cheater is expected to reach an equilibrium with the wild type, cheater demise arises from antagonistic interactions between coinfecting cheaters. These findings highlight layers of parasitism: viruses parasitizing cells, cheaters parasitizing intact viruses, and cheaters may parasitize other cheaters.},

Surgically fixating torn tendon into bone results in the formation of a scar tissue interface with inferior biomechanical properties. Progress toward enthesis regeneration requires biomaterial approaches to protect cells from high levels of interfacial strain. We report an innovative tissue reinforcement strategy: a stratified scaffold containing osseous and tendinous tissue compartments attached through a continuous polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel interface. Tuning the gelation kinetics of the hydrogel modulates integration with the flanking compartments and yields biomechanical performance advantages. Notably, the hydrogel interface reduces formation of strain concentrations between tissue compartments in conventional stratified biomaterials that can have deleterious biological effects. This design of mechanically robust stratified composite biomaterials may be appropriate for a broad range of tendon and ligament-to-bone insertions.},

Here, we demonstrated that load initiation time, magnitude, and mode all regulate microvascular growth, as well as upstream angiogenic and mechanotransduction signaling pathways. Immediate load initiation inhibited angiogenesis and expression of early sprout tip cell selection genes, while delayed loading enhanced microvascular network formation and upstream signaling pathways.

Twenty years later, creating such short pulses still requires state-of-the-art few-cycle laser amplifiers to most efficiently exploit “instantaneous” optical nonlinearities in noble gases for spectral broadening and parametric frequency conversion. Here, we show that nonlinear compression can be much more efficient when driven in molecular gases by pulses substantially longer than a few cycles because of enhanced optical nonlinearity associated with rotational alignment. We use 80-cycle pulses from an industrial-grade laser amplifier to simultaneously drive molecular alignment and supercontinuum generation in a gas-filled capillary, producing more than two octaves of coherent bandwidth and achieving &gt;45-fold compression to a duration of 1.6 cycles. As the enhanced nonlinearity is linked to rotational motion, the dynamics can be exploited for long-wavelength frequency conversion and compressing picosecond lasers.},

The liquid state of these markers allows for high-precision placement under image guidance using thin needles. Based on step-by-step modifications, the image features and mechanical properties of markers can be optimized to bridge diagnostic imaging and specific therapeutic interventions. The performance of Carbo-gel is demonstrated for markers that (i) have radiographic, magnetic resonance, and ultrasound visibility; (ii) are palpable and visible; and (iii) are localizable by near-infrared fluorescence and radio guidance.

Leveraging computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tracked direct valuation through experience and vicarious valuation through observation and their dissociable, but interacting neural representations in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, respectively. Their functional coupling with the right temporoparietal junction representing instantaneous social information instantiated a hitherto uncharacterized social prediction error, rather than a reward prediction error, in the putamen. These findings suggest that an integrated network involving the brain’s reward hub and social hub supports social influence in human decision-making.},

Stimuli response could remotely adjust the membrane selectivity. Azobenzene derivatives can be photo-switched between trans and cis isomers under ultraviolet or visible light. Here, the azobenzenes were implanted as light switches to bridge the flexible cyclen building blocks. The smart covalent organic network membranes fold and unfold as origami that can be photo-switched between on-state (large) and off-state (small) pores. The cis membranes with off state under ultraviolet (UV) light have higher dye rejection than trans membranes with on-state channels. By controlling the trans-to-cis azobenzene isomerization via UV/Vis light, the pore size can be remotely controlled at the molecular level and the solvent permeance and dye rejection can be dynamically tuned.},

In this work, we exploit these characteristics to achieve efficient ultrafast all-optical modulation in a crystalline gallium phosphide (GaP) nanoantenna through the optical Kerr effect (OKE) and two-photon absorption (TPA) in the visible/near-infrared range. We show that an individual GaP nanodisk can yield differential reflectivity modulations of up to ~40\%, with characteristic modulation times between 14 and 66 fs, when probed at the anapole excitation (AE). Numerical simulations reveal that the AE represents a unique condition where both the OKE and TPA contribute with the same modulation sign, maximizing the response. These findings highly outperform previous reports on sub–100-fs all-optical switching from resonant nanoscale dielectrics, which have demonstrated modulation depths no larger than 0.5\%, placing GaP nanoantennas as a promising choice for ultrafast all-optical modulation at the nanometer scale.},

Using sheep and chickens, two species with similar cardiovascular developmental milestones to humans, we combined in vivo experiments with in vitro studies at organ, cellular, mitochondrial, and molecular levels. We tested mitochondria-targeted antioxidant intervention with MitoQ against cardiovascular dysfunction programmed by developmental hypoxia, a common complication in human pregnancy. Experiments in sheep determined in vivo fetal and adult cardiovascular function through surgical techniques not possible in humans, while those in chicken embryos isolated effects independent of maternal or placental influences. We show that hypoxia generates mitochondria-derived oxidative stress during cardiovascular development, programming endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in adult offspring. MitoQ treatment during hypoxic development protects against this cardiovascular risk via enhanced nitric oxide signaling, offering a plausible intervention strategy.},

Using data-driven methods, we find that facial expressions depicted in 63 sculptures from the ancient Americas tend to accord with Western expectations for emotions that unfold in specific social contexts. Ancient American sculptures tend to portray at least five facial expressions in contexts predicted by Westerners, including “pain” in torture, “determination”/“strain” in heavy lifting, “anger” in combat, “elation” in social touch, and “sadness” in defeat-supporting the universality of these expressions.},

In Harpegnathos saltator ants, adult workers can transition to a queen-like state called gamergate, which results in reprogramming of social behavior and life-span extension. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we compared the distribution of neuronal and glial populations before and after the social transition. We found that the conversion of workers into gamergates resulted in the expansion of neuroprotective ensheathing glia. Brain injury assays revealed that activation of the damage response gene Mmp1 was weaker in old workers, where the relative frequency of ensheathing glia also declined. On the other hand, long-lived gamergates retained a larger fraction of ensheathing glia and the ability to mount a strong Mmp1 response to brain injury into old age. We also observed molecular and cellular changes suggestive of age-associated decline in ensheathing glia in Drosophila .},

We discovered a previously unknown mechanism that breaks the permeability-selectivity trade-off in using a rotating nanoporous graphene membrane with pores of 2 to 4 nanometers in diameter. The results show that the rotating membrane exhibits almost 100\% salt rejection even when the pore size is larger than that of hydrated ions, and the surface slip at the liquid/graphene interface of rotating membrane enables concurrent ultra-selectivity and unprecedented high permeability. A novel concept of “temporal selectivity” is proposed to attribute the unconventional selectivity to the time difference between the ion’s penetration time through the pore and the bypass time required for ion’s sliding across the pore. The newly discovered temporal selectivity overcomes the limitation imposed by pore size and provokes a novel theory in designing high-performance membranes.},

The first, targeting BET and CXCR2, is specific for mesenchymal TNBC and induces apoptosis, whereas the second, targeting BET and the proteasome, is effective for major TNBC subtypes and triggers ferroptosis. Ferroptosis was induced at low drug doses and was associated with increased cellular iron and decreased glutathione levels, concomitant with reduced levels of GPX4 and key glutathione biosynthesis genes. Further functional studies, analysis of clinical datasets and breast cancer specimens revealed a unique vulnerability of TNBC to ferroptosis inducers, enrichment of ferroptosis gene signature, and differential expression of key proteins that increase labile iron and decrease glutathione levels.

Key challenges of this approach include the delivery of dCas9-VPR, activation efficiency, long-term expression of the target gene, and adverse effects in vivo. Using dual adeno-associated viral vectors expressing split dCas9-VPR, we show efficient transcriptional activation and long-term expression of cone photoreceptor-specific M-opsin ( Opn1mw ) in a rhodopsin-deficient mouse model for retinitis pigmentosa.

Catalytic performance tests on a fixed-bed reactor show that 92.4\% xylene selectivity in CO-free products and 70.8\% para -xylene selectivity in xylene are obtained on each optimized catalyst. Isotope effects of H 2 /D 2 and CO 2 / 13 CO 2 indicate that xylene product is substantially generated from toluene methylation rather than disproportionation.

  abstract     = {Colliding drops are encountered in everyday technologies and natural processes, from combustion engines and commodity sprays to raindrops and cloud formation. The outcome of a collision depends on many factors, including the impact velocity and the degree of alignment, and intrinsic properties like surface tension. Yet, little is known on binary impact dynamics of low-surface-tension drops on a low-wetting surface. We investigate the dynamics of an oil drop impacting an identical sessile drop sitting on a superamphiphobic surface. We observe five rebound scenarios, four of which do not involve coalescence. We describe two previously unexplored cases for sessile drop liftoff, resulting from drop-on-drop impact. Numerical simulations quantitatively reproduce the rebound scenarios and enable quantification of velocity profiles, energy transfer, and viscous dissipation. Our results illustrate how varying the offset from head-on alignment and the impact velocity results in controllable rebound dynamics for oil drop collisions on superamphiphobic surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Inflammation triggers degradation of intervertebral disc extracellular matrix (ECM), a hallmark of disc degeneration that contributes to back pain. Mechanosensitive nucleus pulposus cells are responsible for ECM production, yet the impact of a proinflammatory microenvironment on cell mechanobiology is unknown. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we show that tumor necrosis factor–α (TNFα)–induced inflammation alters cell morphology and biophysical properties (circularity, contractility, cell stiffness, and hydraulic permeability) in a mechanism dependent on actomyosin contractility in a three-dimensional (3D) culture. We found that RhoA activation rescued cells from TNFα-induced mechanobiological disruption. Using a novel explant-in-hydrogel culture system, we demonstrate that nuclear factor kappa-B nuclear translocation and transcription are mechanosensitive, and its downstream effects on ECM degradation are regulated by actomyosin contractility. Results define a scaling relationship between circularity, contractility, and hydraulic permeability that is conserved from healthy to inflammatory microenvironments and is indicative of cell mechanobiological control across scales in 3D.},

Here, we showed that loss of the m 6 A reader YTH-domain family 2 (YTHDF2) promoted demethylation of histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which led to enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines and facilitated the deposition of m 6 A cotranscriptionally. Mechanistically, the mRNA of lysine demethylase 6B ( KDM6B ) was m 6 A-modified and its decay mediated by YTHDF2. YTHDF2 deficiency stabilized KDM6B to promote H3K27me3 demethylation of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and subsequently enhanced their transcription. Furthermore, we identified H3K27me3 as a barrier for m 6 A modification during transcription. KDM6B recruits the m 6 A methyltransferase complex to facilitate the methylation of m 6 A in transcribing mRNA by removing adjacent H3K27me3 barriers. These results revealed cross-talk between m 6 A and H3K27me3 during bacterial infection, which has broader implications for deciphering epitranscriptomics in immune homeostasis.},

Here, we use laser writing to convert portions of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) into nitrogen-doped cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC). The dense 3C-SiC surface layer is connected to the PDMS matrix via a spongy graphite layer, facilitating electrochemical and photoelectrochemical activity. We demonstrate the fabrication of arbitrary two-dimensional (2D) SiC-based patterns in PDMS and freestanding 3D constructs.

Here, we demonstrate through both experiment and numerical simulation that the movement of vortices in a rotating turbulent convective flow resembles that of inertial Brownian particles, i.e., they initially move ballistically and then diffusively after certain critical time. Moreover, the transition from ballistic to diffusive behaviors is direct, as predicted by Langevin, without first going through the hydrodynamic memory regime. The transitional timescale and the diffusivity of the vortices can be collapsed excellently onto a master curve for all explored parameters. In the spatial domain, however, the vortices exhibit organized structures, as if they are performing tethered random motion. Our results imply that the convective vortices have inertia-induced memory such that their short-term movement can be predicted and their motion can be well described in the framework of Brownian motions.},

IFN-γ activates an antiviral cellular state, limiting viral entry and replication. Moreover, IFN-γ is implicated in brain development. We tested the hypothesis that IFN-γ signaling contributes to molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Transient IFN-γ treatment of neural progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells increased neurite outgrowth. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) genes were persistently up-regulated through neuronal differentiation—an effect that was mediated by IFN-γ-induced promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies. Critically, IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth required both PML and MHCI. We also found evidence that IFN-γ disproportionately altered the expression of genes associated with schizophrenia and autism, suggesting convergence between genetic and environmental risk factors. Together, these data implicate IFN-γ signaling in neurodevelopmental disorder etiology.},

However, realistic circuit-level noise severely restricts these improvements. This is because gate operations, such as a controlled-NOT (CX) gate, which do not commute with the dominant error, unbias the noise channel. Here, we overcome the challenge of implementing a bias-preserving CX gate using biased-noise stabilized cat qubits in driven nonlinear oscillators. This continuous-variable gate relies on nontrivial phase space topology of the cat states. Furthermore, by following a scheme for concatenated error correction, we show that the availability of bias-preserving CX gates with moderately sized cats improves a rigorous lower bound on the fault-tolerant threshold by a factor of two and decreases the overhead in logical Clifford operations by a factor of five. Our results open a path toward high-threshold, low-overhead, fault-tolerant codes tailored to biased-noise cat qubits.},

Here, we build a general statistical dynamics of cities across scales, from single agents to entire urban systems. We include agents’ strategic behavior to produce predictable growth rates, which requires balancing relative incomes and costs over time. We implement these dynamics using stochastic differential equations and control theory to demonstrate a number of general emergent properties of cities deriving from limit theorems applied to growth rates. This framework establishes necessary conditions for scaling to be conserved by urban dynamics and shows how exponent corrections can be calculated. These ideas are tested using stochastic simulations and a long timeseries for 382 US Metropolitan Areas over nearly five decades.},

Our model used immune-competent mice, tympanic membrane perforation and inoculation with luminescent Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enabled bacterial abundance tracking in real-time for 100 days. The resulting chronic infection exhibited hallmark features of clinical CSOM, including inhibition of tympanic membrane healing and purulent ear discharge. We evaluated the standard care fluoroquinolone ofloxacin and demonstrated that this therapy resulted in a temporary reduction of bacterial burden. These data are consistent with the clinical problem of persistent infection in CSOM and the need for therapeutic outcome measures that assess eradication post-therapeutic endpoint.

  abstract     = {The biophysical and molecular mechanisms that enable animals to detect magnetic fields are unknown. It has been proposed that birds have a light-dependent magnetic compass that relies on the formation of radical pairs within cryptochrome molecules. Using spectroscopic methods, we show that pigeon cryptochrome clCRY4 is photoreduced efficiently and forms long-lived spin-correlated radical pairs via a tetrad of tryptophan residues. We report that clCRY4 is broadly and stably expressed within the retina but enriched at synapses in the outer plexiform layer in a repetitive manner. A proteomic survey for retinal-specific clCRY4 interactors identified molecules that are involved in receptor signaling, including glutamate receptor–interacting protein 2, which colocalizes with clCRY4. Our data support a model whereby clCRY4 acts as an ultraviolet-blue photoreceptor and/or a light-dependent magnetosensor by modulating glutamatergic synapses between horizontal cells and cones.},

  abstract     = {Noncanonical functions of autophagy proteins have been implicated in neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The WD domain of the autophagy protein Atg16L is dispensable for canonical autophagy but required for its noncanonical functions. Two-year-old mice lacking this domain presented with robust β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology, tau hyperphosphorylation, reactive microgliosis, pervasive neurodegeneration, and severe behavioral and memory deficiencies, consistent with human disease. Mechanistically, we found this WD domain was required for the recycling of Aβ receptors in primary microglia. Pharmacologic suppression of neuroinflammation reversed established memory impairment and markers of disease pathology in this novel AD model. Therefore, loss of the Atg16L WD domain drives spontaneous AD in mice, and inhibition of neuroinflammation is a potential therapeutic approach for treating neurodegeneration and memory loss. A decline in expression of ATG16L in the brains of human patients with AD suggests the possibility that a similar mechanism may contribute in human disease.},

Although 4E-BP has been shown to be important in growth control, stress response, cancer, neuronal activity, and mammalian circadian rhythms, it is not understood how it preferentially represses a subset of mRNAs. We successfully used HyperTRIBE (targets of RNA binding proteins identified by editing) to identify in vivo 4E-BP mRNA targets in both Drosophila and mammals under conditions known to activate 4E-BP. The protein associates with specific mRNAs, and ribosome profiling data show that mTOR inhibition changes the translational efficiency of 4E-BP TRIBE targets more substantially compared to nontargets. In both systems, these targets have specific motifs and are enriched in translation-related pathways, which correlate well with the known activity of 4E-BP and suggest that it modulates the binding specificity of eIF4E and contributes to mTOR translational specificity.},

In this work, we develop a systematic, generally applicable, and practically feasible methodology for easing the sign problem by efficiently computable basis changes and use it to rigorously assess the sign problem. Our framework introduces measures of non-stoquasticity that—as we demonstrate analytically and numerically—at the same time provide a practically relevant and efficiently computable figure of merit for the severity of the sign problem. Complementing this pragmatic mindset, we prove that easing the sign problem in terms of those measures is generally an NP-complete task for nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians and simple basis choices by a reduction to the MAXCUT-problem.},

Furthermore, loss of Miz1 up-regulates the expression of Ace2 , the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Concomitant partial loss of NF- κ B/RelA prevented the development of COPD-like phenotype in Miz1 -deficient mice. Miz1 protein levels are reduced in the lungs from patients with COPD, and in the lungs of mice exposed to chronic cigarette smoke.

Here, we present an ultrathin and durable nanomesh strain gauge for continuous motion activity monitoring that minimizes mechanical constraints on natural skin motions. The device is made from reinforced polyurethane-polydimethylsiloxane (PU-PDMS) nanomeshes and exhibits excellent sustainability, linearity, and durability with low hysteresis. Its thinness geometry and softness provide minimum mechanical interference on natural skin deformations. During speech, the nanomesh-attached face exhibits skin strain mapping comparable to that of a face without nanomeshes.

The authors claimed that this method could specifically detect persulfidated proteins of cell lysate with minor false-positive hits; hence, it could be used for proteomic-level analysis of protein persulfidation. However, when using this method for Escherichia coli cell lysate analysis, we found that the percentage of false-positive hit was &gt;90\%. We performed a systematic study on this method and discovered that iodoacetyl-PEG2-biotin tag mislabeling is the reason causing this low specificity.

Using aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we present a direct observation of the grain boundaries in a layer-stacked 2D polyimine with a resolution of 2.3 Å, shedding light on their formation mechanisms. We found that the polyimine growth followed a “birth-and-spread” mechanism. Antiphase boundaries implemented a self-correction to the missing-linker and missing-node defects, and tilt boundaries were formed via grain coalescence. Notably, we identified grain boundary reconstructions featuring closed rings at tilt boundaries. Quantum mechanical calculations revealed that boundary reconstruction is energetically allowed and can be generalized into different 2D polymer systems. We envisage that these results may open up the opportunity for future investigations on defect-property correlations in 2D polymers.},

Using nanoparticle functionalized bioinks, it was possible to print implants with distinct growth factor patterns and release profiles spanning from days to weeks. The extent of angiogenesis in vivo depended on the spatial presentation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Higher levels of vessel invasion were observed in implants containing a spatial gradient of VEGF compared to those homogenously loaded with the same total amount of protein. Printed implants containing a gradient of VEGF, coupled with spatially defined BMP-2 localization and release kinetics, accelerated large bone defect healing with little heterotopic bone formation. This demonstrates the potential of growth factor printing, a putative point of care therapy, for tightly controlled tissue regeneration.},

A decades-old hypothesis proposes that slow adaptation requires myosin motors to modulate the tip-link position on taller stereocilia. This “motor model” depended on data suggesting that the receptor current decay had a time course similar to that of hair-bundle creep (a continued movement in the direction of a step-like force stimulus). Using cochlear and vestibular hair cells of mice, rats, and gerbils, we assessed how modulating adaptation affected hair-bundle creep. Our results are consistent with slow adaptation requiring myosin motors. However, the hair-bundle creep and slow adaptation were uncorrelated, challenging a critical piece of evidence upholding the motor model. Considering these data, we propose a revised model of hair cell adaptation.},

The homogeneous blend solution spontaneously self-assembles to anisotropically stacked hybrids as the solvent evaporates. Two minor phases—BCP/inorganic precursor and homopolystyrene (hPS)—form closely stacked, Janus domains that are dispersed/confined in the major homopoly(methyl methacrylate) (hPMMA) matrix. hPS phases are partially covered by BCP-rich phases, where ordered mesostructures develop. With increasing the relative amount of hPS, the anisotropic shape evolves from bowls to 2D nanosheets.

The causative mutation, an Ile102Asn substitution in the synaptic vesicular protein, VAMP2, was associated with morphological synaptic changes and specific behavioral deficits, while in vitro electrophysiological investigations with fluorescence imaging revealed a markedly diminished probability of vesicular release in mutants. Our data show that global shifts in the synaptic efficiency across brain-wide networks leads to an altered probability of vigilance state transitions, possibly as a result of an altered excitability balance within local circuits controlling sleep-wake architecture.},

  abstract     = {Strain accumulated on the deep extension of some faults is episodically released during transient slow-slip events, which can subsequently load the shallow seismogenic region. At the San Andreas fault, the characteristics of slow-slip events are difficult to constrain geodetically due to their small deformation signal. Slow-slip events (SSEs) are often accompanied by coincident tremor bursts composed of many low-frequency earthquakes. Here, we probabilistically estimate the spatiotemporal clustering properties of low-frequency earthquakes detected along the central San Andreas fault. We find that tremor bursts follow a power-law spatial and temporal decay similar to earthquake aftershock sequences. The low-frequency earthquake clusters reveal that the underlying slow-slip events have two modes of rupture velocity. Compared to regular earthquakes, these slow-slip events have smaller stress drop and rupture velocity but follow similar magnitude-frequency, moment-area, and moment-duration scaling. Our results connect a broad spectrum of transient fault slip that spans several orders of magnitude in rupture velocity.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) hold infectious biofilms together and limit antimicrobial penetration and clinical infection control. Here, we present zwitterionic micelles as a previously unexplored, synthetic self-targeting dispersant. First, a pH-responsive poly(ε-caprolactone)- block -poly(quaternary-amino-ester) was synthesized and self-assembled with poly(ethylene glycol)- block -poly(ε-caprolactone) to form zwitterionic, mixed-shell polymeric micelles (ZW-MSPMs). In the acidic environment of staphylococcal biofilms, ZW-MSPMs became positively charged because of conversion of the zwitterionic poly(quaternary-amino-ester) to a cationic lactone ring. This allowed ZW-MSPMs to self-target, penetrate, and accumulate in staphylococcal biofilms in vitro. In vivo biofilm targeting by ZW-MSPMs was confirmed for staphylococcal biofilms grown underneath an implanted abdominal imaging window through direct imaging in living mice. ZW-MSPMs interacted strongly with important EPS components such as eDNA and protein to disperse biofilm and enhance ciprofloxacin efficacy toward remaining biofilm, both in vitro and in vivo. Zwitterionic micellar dispersants may aid infection control and enhance efficacy of existing antibiotics against remaining biofilm.},

As the precise physiological substrates of BHA are unknown, this assumption remains controversial. Our analysis of laminar multielectrode data from V1 and A1 in monkeys outlines two components of stimulus-evoked BHA distributed across the cortical layers: an “early-deep” and “late-superficial” response. Early-deep BHA has a clear spatial and temporal overlap with MUA. Late-superficial BHA was more prominent and accounted for more of the BHA signal measured near the cortical pial surface. However, its association with local MUA is weak and often undetectable, consistent with the view that it reflects dendritic processes separable from local neuronal firing.},

We quantify the role of bioturbation and bioerosion in ecospace utilization and ecosystem engineering using information from 1367 stratigraphic units. An increase in all diversity metrics is demonstrated for the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, followed by a decrease in most values during the middle to late Cambrian, and by a more modest increase during the Ordovician. A marked increase in ichnodiversity and ichnodisparity of bioturbation is shown during the CE and of bioerosion during the GOBE. Innovations took place first in offshore settings and later expanded into marginal-marine, nearshore, deep-water, and carbonate environments. This study highlights the importance of the CE, despite its Ediacaran roots. Differences in infaunalization in offshore and shelf paleoenvironments favor the hypothesis of early Cambrian wedge-shaped oxygen minimum zones instead of a horizontally stratified ocean.},

Stable oscillations require a substantial source of dissipation to balance the energy input of motors. Conventionally, it stems from external fluid. We show, in contrast, that external fluid friction is negligible compared to internal elastic stress through a simultaneous measurement of motion and flow field of an isolated and active Chlamydomonas cilium beating near the instability threshold. Consequently, internal friction emerges as the sole source of dissipation for ciliary oscillations. We combine these experimental insights with theoretical modeling of active filaments to show that an instability to oscillations takes place when active stresses are strain softening and shear thinning. Together, our results reveal a counterintuitive mechanism of ciliary beating and provide a general experimental and theoretical methodology to analyze other active filaments, both biological and synthetic ones.},

The structures revealed that the luminal extension tail (LE) characteristic of SERCA2b runs parallel to the lipid-water boundary near the luminal ends of transmembrane (TM) helices TM10 and TM7 and approaches the luminal loop flanked by TM7 and TM8. While the LE served to stabilize the cytosolic and TM domain arrangement of SERCA2b, deletion of the LE rendered the overall conformation resemble that of SERCA1a and SERCA2a and allowed multiple conformations. Thus, the LE appears to play a critical role in conformational regulation in SERCA2b, which likely explains the different kinetic properties of SERCA2b from those of other isoforms lacking the LE.},

A single memristor crossbar is used to store the weight parameters of a fully connected Hopfield network and adjust the network dynamics in situ. Furthermore, we harness the intrinsic nonlinearity of memristors within the crossbar to implement an efficient and simplified annealing process for the optimization. Solutions of continuous function optimizations on sphere function and Matyas function as well as combinatorial optimization on Max-cut problem are experimentally demonstrated, indicating great potential of the transiently chaotic memristive network in solving optimization problems in general.},

At the heart of this challenge lies the coffee-ring effect (CRE), ring-shaped nonuniform deposits formed during postdeposition drying. We present an experimental study of the drying mechanism of a binary solvent ink formulation. We show that Marangoni-enhanced spreading in this formulation inhibits contact line pinning and deforms the droplet shape to naturally suppress the capillary flows that give rise to the CRE. This general formulation supports uniform deposition of 2D crystals and their derivatives, enabling scalable and even wafer-scale device fabrication, moving them closer to industrial-level additive manufacturing.},

Recently, interfacial DMI has been found in magnetic layers adjacent to transition metals due to the spin-orbit coupling and at interfaces with graphene due to the Rashba effect. We report direct observation of strong DMI induced by chemisorption of oxygen on a ferromagnetic layer at room temperature. The sign of this DMI and its unexpectedly large magnitude—despite the low atomic number of oxygen—are derived by examining the oxygen coverage–dependent evolution of magnetic chirality. We find that DMI at the oxygen/ferromagnet interface is comparable to those at ferromagnet/transition metal interfaces; it has enabled direct tailoring of skyrmion’s winding number at room temperature via oxygen chemisorption. This result extends the understanding of the DMI, opening up opportunities for the chemisorption-related design of spin-orbitronic devices.},

With record current densities of 1000 kA/cm 2 , the LEDs transition to lasing, with brightness over 20 μW. Despite a light extraction efficiency of only 15\%, these devices exceed the output power of any previous electrically driven submicrometer LED or laser pixel by 100 to 1000 times while showing comparable external quantum efficiencies. Modeling suggests that spreading of the electron-hole recombination region in fin LEDs at high injection levels suppresses the nonradiative Auger recombination processes.

Under laser irradiation, those bacterial-infected tumors would be effectively ablated. Because of the immune-stimulation function, such bacteria-based photothermal therapy (PTT) would subsequently trigger antitumor immune responses, which could be further enhanced by immune checkpoint blockade to effectively suppress the growth of abscopal tumors. A robust immune memory effect to reject rechallenged tumors is also observed after bacteria-based PTT.

We consistently identified epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic populations across all stages. We found common and cell type–specific cell cycle programs associated with proliferation. In addition to defining the processes of epithelial replenishment and mesenchymal differentiation, we also identified molecular signatures that could better distinguish epithelial and mesenchymal subpopulations in fish.

  abstract     = {Major changes in the microbiome are associated with health and disease. Some microbiome states persist despite seemingly unfavorable conditions, such as the proliferation of aerobe-anaerobe communities in oxygen-exposed environments in wound infections or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Mechanisms underlying transitions into and persistence of these states remain unclear. Using two microbial taxa relevant to the human microbiome, we combine genome-scale mathematical modeling, bioreactor experiments, transcriptomics, and dynamical systems theory to show that multistability and hysteresis (MSH) is a mechanism describing the shift from an aerobe-dominated state to a resilient, paradoxically persistent aerobe-anaerobe state. We examine the impact of changing oxygen and nutrient regimes and identify changes in metabolism and gene expression that lead to MSH and associated multi-stable states. In such systems, conceptual causation-correlation connections break and MSH must be used for analysis. Using MSH to analyze microbiome dynamics will improve our conceptual understanding of stability of microbiome states and transitions between states.},

Diversity (D H ) gene segments rearrange first, followed by variable (V H ) gene rearrangements. Here, we provide evidence that each rearrangement step is guided by different rules of engagement between rearranging gene segments. D H gene segments, which recombine by deletion of intervening DNA, must be located within a RAG1/2 scanning domain for efficient recombination. In the absence of intergenic control region 1, a regulatory sequence that delineates the RAG scanning domain on wild-type IgH alleles, V H and D H gene segments can recombine with each other by both deletion and inversion of intervening DNA. We propose that V H gene segments find their targets by distinct mechanisms from those that apply to D H gene segments.

The MPE was shown to be highly dependent on the stacking order of the heterostructure, as well as the interface symmetry: Growing CrSe on top of BST results in induced ferromagnetism, while growing BST on CrSe yielded no evidence of an MPE. Cr-termination in the former case leads to double-exchange interactions between Cr 3+ surface states and Cr 2+ bulk states. This Cr 3+ -Cr 2+ exchange stabilizes the ferromagnetic order localized at the interface and magnetically polarizes the BST Sb band. In contrast, Se-termination at the CrSe/BST interface yields no detectable MPE. These results directly confirm the MPE in BST films and provide critical insights into the sensitivity of the surface state.},

Here, we report that atomically dispersed nickel (Ni) in zincblende cadmium–zinc sulfide quantum dots (ZCS QDs) delivers an efficient and durable photocatalytic performance for water splitting under sunlight. The finely tuned Ni atoms dispersed in ZCS QDs exhibit an ultrahigh photocatalytic H 2 production activity of 18.87 mmol hour −1 g −1 . It could be ascribed to the favorable surface engineering to achieve highly active sites of monovalent Ni(I) and the surface heterojunctions to reinforce the carrier separation owing to the suitable energy band structures, built-in electric field, and optimized surface H 2 adsorption thermodynamics. This work demonstrates a synergistic regulation of the physicochemical properties of QDs for high-efficiency photocatalytic H 2 production.},

We show here that H3K27me3, the PRC2 catalytic product, increases during oligodendrocyte maturation. Depletion of embryonic ectoderm development (EED), a core PRC2 subunit, reduces differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), and causes an OPC-to-astrocyte fate switch in a region-specific manner. Although dispensable for myelin maintenance, EED is critical for oligodendrocyte remyelination. Genomic occupancy and transcriptomic analyses indicate that EED establishes a chromatin landscape that selectively represses inhibitory WNT and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, and senescence-associated programs. Blocking WNT or BMP pathways partially restores differentiation defects in EED-deficient OPCs. Thus, our findings reveal that EED/PRC2 is a crucial epigenetic programmer of CNS myelination and repair, while demonstrating a spatiotemporal-specific role of PRC2-mediated chromatin silencing in shaping oligodendrocyte identity and lineage plasticity.},

The fluorous-tagged peptides were assembled into nanostructures, efficiently internalized by cells via several endocytic pathways and released into the cytosol after endosomal escape. They were relatively stable against enzymatic degradation and showed much higher efficiency than nonfluorinated analogs and cell penetrant peptide–conjugated ones. The proposed strategy also efficiently delivered a proapoptotic peptide into specific sites in the cells and restored the function of cargo peptide after cytosolic delivery. The fluorous-tagged proapoptotic peptide efficiently inhibited tumor growth in vivo. This study provides an efficient fluorination strategy to promote the cytosolic delivery of peptides.},

We report an approach to manufacturing interleukin-10 (IL-10)–loaded EVs (IL-10 + EVs) by engineering macrophages for treating ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI). Delivery of IL-10 via EVs enhanced not only the stability of IL-10, but also its targeting to the kidney due to the adhesive components on the EV surface. Treatment with IL-10 + EVs significantly ameliorated renal tubular injury and inflammation caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury, and potently prevented the transition to chronic kidney disease. Mechanistically, IL-10 + EVs targeted tubular epithelial cells, and suppressed mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, thereby promoting mitophagy to maintain mitochondrial fitness. Moreover, IL-10 + EVs efficiently drove M2 macrophage polarization by targeting macrophages in the tubulointerstitium. Our study demonstrates that EVs can serve as a promising delivery platform to manipulate IL-10 for the effective treatment of ischemic AKI.},

The controversial existence of H8 of the class A GPCR neurotensin receptor 1 (NTS1) has been examined here for the nonthermostabilized receptor in a functionally supporting membrane environment using electron paramagnetic resonance, molecular dynamics simulations, and circular dichroism. Lipid-protein interactions with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids, in particular, stabilize the residues 374 to 390 of NTS1 into forming a helix. Furthermore, introduction of a helix-breaking proline residue in H8 elicited an increase in ß-arrestin–NTS1 interactions observed in pull-down assays, suggesting that the structure and/or dynamics of H8 might play an important role in GPCR signaling.},

How unfolded proteins are managed within mitochondria remains unclear. Here, we found that excessive unfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix of yeast cells are consolidated into solid-phase inclusions, which we term deposits of unfolded mitochondrial proteins (DUMP). Formation of DUMP occurs in mitochondria near endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria contact sites and is regulated by mitochondrial proteins controlling the production of cytidine 5′-diphosphate–diacylglycerol. DUMP formation is age dependent but accelerated by exogenous unfolded proteins. Many enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were enriched in DUMP. During yeast cell division, DUMP formation is necessary for asymmetric inheritance of damaged mitochondrial proteins between mother and daughter cells. We provide evidence that DUMP-like structures may be induced by excessive unfolded proteins in human cells.},

The relict collisional zone is Paleoproterozoic in age and implies subduction operating at least as early as ~2 billion years (Ga) ago. Seismic evidence of subduction from six continents at this age is interpreted as the oldest evidence of global plate tectonics. The sutures identified can be linked in a plate network that resulted in the assembly of Nuna, likely Earth’s first supercontinent.

Selective dopamine detection is achieved with a detection limit of 50 pM in buffer solution, 5 nM in 10\% serum, and 50 nM in artificial sweat. Density functional theory calculations and scanning transmission electron microscopy show that two types of Mn defects are dominant: Mn on top of a Mo atom (Mn topMo ) and Mn substituting a Mo atom (Mn Mo ). At low dopamine concentrations, physisorption on Mn Mo dominates. At higher concentrations, dopamine chemisorbs on Mn topMo , which is consistent with calculations of the dopamine binding energy (2.91 eV for Mn topMo versus 0.65 eV for Mn Mo ).

  abstract     = {Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination may reduce the risk of a range of infectious diseases, and if so, it could protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we compared countries that mandated BCG vaccination until at least 2000 with countries that did not. To minimize any systematic effects of reporting biases, we analyzed the rate of the day-by-day increase in both confirmed cases (134 countries) and deaths (135 countries) in the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks. The 30-day window was adjusted to begin at the country-wise onset of the pandemic. Linear mixed models revealed a significant effect of mandated BCG policies on the growth rate of both cases and deaths after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism). Our analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19.},

Here, we used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to identify the oligomerization states of an amyloid probe thioflavin T (ThT) on hIAPP 8–37 assembly to be exclusively even numbers. We demonstrate that both adhesive interactions between ThT and the protein substrate and cohesive interactions among ThT molecules govern the oligomerization state of the bounded ThT. Specifically, the work of the cohesive interaction between two head/tail ThTs is determined to be 6.4 k B T , around 50\% larger than that of the cohesive interaction between two side-by-side ThTs (4.2 k B T ). Overall, our STM imaging and theoretical understanding at the single-molecule level provide valuable insights into the design of drug compounds using the selective oligomerization of molecular probes to recognize protein self-assembly.},

Mice readily self-administered fentanyl vapor, titrated their drug intake, and exhibited addiction-like behaviors, including escalation of drug intake, somatic signs of withdrawal, drug intake despite punishment, and reinstatement of drug seeking. Electrophysiological recordings from ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons showed a lower amplitude of GABA B receptor–dependent currents during protracted abstinence from fentanyl vapor self-administration. This mouse model of fentanyl self-administration recapitulates key features of opioid addiction, overcomes limitations of the intravenous model, and allows investigation of the neurobiology of opioid addiction in unprecedented ways.},

Here, we completely reassess the foundations of chemical exchange models and redesign a master equation treatment for exchange accurate to infinite order in perturbation theory. The net result is an astonishingly simple correction to the traditional picture, which vastly improves convergence with no increased computational cost. We demonstrate that this approach accurately and efficiently extracts physical parameters from complex experimental data, such as coherent hyperpolarization dynamics in magnetic resonance, and is applicable to a wide range of other systems.},

In the case of bulk hexagonal boron nitride, this scattering leads to strong quantum interference between different excitonic resonances, strongly redistributing oscillator strength with respect to optical absorption spectra.

Both the venom and target specifications underlying these two forms of envenomation are still poorly understood. Here, we show a target-switching mechanism in centipede ( Scolopendra subspinipes ) venom. On the basis of this mechanism, a major toxin component [Ssm Spooky Toxin (SsTx)] in centipede venom inhibits the Shal channel in conspecifics but not in heterospecifics to cause short-term, recoverable, and nonlethal envenomation. This same toxin causes fatal heterospecific envenomation, for example, by switching its target to the Shaker channels in heterospecifics without inhibiting the Shaker channel of conspecific S. subspinipes individuals. These findings suggest that venom components exhibit intricate coevolution with their targets in both heterospecifics and conspecifics, which enables a single toxin to develop graded intraspecific and interspecific antagonistic interactions.},

While small, this fast response can be constrained by observations. Spatially varying aerosol effects can be detected on the regional scale, specifically warming over Europe and cooling over Asia. These results provide empirical evidence for the important role of aerosols in setting regional land temperature trends and point to an emergent constraint that suggests strong global aerosol forcing and high transient climate response.},

We reveal that one phosphate and two sodium ions (Pi-2Na) are located at the core of Tm PiT and that the third sodium ion (Na fore ) is located near the inner membrane boundary. We propose an elevator-like mechanism for sodium and phosphate transport by Tm PiT, with the Tm PiT-Na/Pi complex adopting an inward occluded conformation. We found that disease-related h PiT variants carry mutations in the corresponding sodium- and phosphate-binding residues identified in Tm PiT.

Screening of yeasts for triacylglycerol (TAG) content demonstrated near-theoretical-limit accuracy, ~120 cells min −1 throughput and full-vitality preservation, while sorting fatty acid degree of unsaturation (FA-DU) featured ~82\% accuracy at ~40 cells min −1 . From a yeast library expressing algal diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs), a pDEP-RADS run revealed all reported TAG-synthetic variants and distinguished FA-DUs of enzyme products. Furthermore, two previously unknown DGATs producing low levels of monounsaturated fatty acid–rich TAG were discovered. This first demonstration of RACS for enzyme discovery represents hundred-fold saving in time consumables and labor versus culture-based approaches.

Here, we now show that, in stark contrast to results published for other PRC2 subunits, genetic depletion of Phf19 increases HSC identity and quiescence. While proliferation of HSCs is normally triggered by forced mobilization, defects in differentiation impede long-term correct blood production, eventually leading to aberrant hematopoiesis. At molecular level, PHF19 deletion triggers a redistribution of the histone repressive mark H3K27me3, which notably accumulates at blood lineage–specific genes. Our results provide novel insights into how epigenetic mechanisms determine HSC identity, control differentiation, and are key for proper hematopoiesis.},

In most OLEDs, roll-off primarily occurs due to exciton quenching, which is commonly assumed to be active only above device turn-on. Below turn-on, exciton and charge carrier densities are often presumed to be too small to cause quenching. Using lock-in detection of photoluminescence, we find that this assumption is not generally valid; luminescence can be quenched by &gt;20\% at biases below turn-on. We show that this low-bias quenching is due to hole accumulation induced by intrinsic polarization of the electron transport layer (ETL). Further, we demonstrate that selection of nonpolar ETLs or heating during deposition minimizes these losses, leading to efficiency enhancements of &gt;15\%. These results reveal design rules to optimize efficiency, clarify how ultrastable glasses improve OLED performance, and demonstrate the importance of quantifying exciton quenching at low bias.},

Different from the magnetoelastic coupling, more than 40 years ago, it was proposed that surface acoustic waves may induce surface magnons via rotational motion of the lattice in anisotropic magnets. However, a signature of this magnon-phonon coupling mechanism, termed magneto-rotation coupling, has been elusive. Here, we report the first observation and theoretical framework of the magneto-rotation coupling in a perpendicularly anisotropic film Ta/CoFeB(1.6 nanometers)/MgO, which consequently induces nonreciprocal acoustic wave attenuation with an unprecedented ratio of up to 100\% rectification at a theoretically predicted optimized condition.

  abstract     = {Lithium (Li) or zinc (Zn) metal anodes have attracted interest for battery research due to their high theoretical capacities and low redox potentials. However, uncontrollable dendrite growth, especially under high current (&gt;4 mA cm −2 ), precludes reversable cycling in Li or Zn metal batteries with a high-loading (&gt;4 mAh cm −2 ), precludes reversable cycling in Li or Zn metal batteries with high-loading (&gt;4 mAh cm −2 ) cathode. We report a cation regulation mechanism to address this failure. Collagen hydrolysate coated on absorbed glass mat (CH@AGM) can simultaneously induce a deionization shock inside the separator and spread cations on the anode to promote uniform electrodeposition. Employing 24 mAh cm −2 cathodes, Li and Zn metal batteries with CH@AGM delivered 600 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.7\%. In comparison, pristine Li and Zn metal batteries only survive for 10 and 100 cycles, respectively. This approach enabled 400 cycles in a 200 Ah-class Zn metal battery, which suggests a scalable method to achieve dendrite-free anodes in various batteries.},

With this feature, optimal PTT temperature for effective tumor treatment with minimal normal tissue damage can be obtained. In addition, because of the bioactive silicate components, the composite hydrogel has bioactivity to repair heat damage caused by PTT.

Poor solution behavior, which manifests as high solution viscosity or opalescence, profoundly affects the developability of mAb drugs. Using a diverse dataset of 59 mAbs, including 43 approved products, and an array of molecular descriptors spanning colloidal, conformational, charge-based, hydrodynamic, and hydrophobic properties, we show that poor solution behavior is prevalent (&gt;30\%) in mAbs and is singularly predicted (&gt;90\%) by the diffusion interaction parameter ( k D ), a dilute-solution measure of colloidal self-interaction. No other descriptor, individually or in combination, was found to be as effective as k D .

Yet the factors that influence where immigrants choose to settle after arrival remain unclear. We bring evidence to this question by analyzing population-level data for refugees resettled within the United States. Unlike other immigrants, refugees are assigned to initial locations across the country but are free to relocate and select another residence after arrival. Drawing on individual-level administrative data for adult refugees resettled between 2000 and 2014 ( N = 447, 747), we examine the relative desirability of locations by examining how retention rates and patterns of secondary migration differ across states. We find no discernible evidence that refugees’ locational choices are strongly influenced by state partisanship or the generosity of welfare benefits. Instead, we find that refugees prioritize locations with employment opportunities and existing co-national networks.},

Recent developments in micro-nanofabrication allow us now to construct a skin-muscle type system combining interfacial liquid repellence atop a mechanically functional structure. Specifically, we design surfaces comprising bioinspired, mushroom-like repelling heads and spring-like flexible supports, which are realized by three-dimensional direct laser lithography. The flexible supports elevate liquid repellency by resisting droplet impalement and reducing contact time. This, previously unknown, use of spring-like flexible supports to enhance liquid repellency provides an excellent level of control over droplet manipulation. Moreover, this extends repellent microstructure research from statics to dynamics and is envisioned to yield functionalities and possibilities by linking functional surfaces and mechanical metamaterials.},

In this study, we used an optically induced electrokinetics (OEK) microfluidic method for label-free separation and characterization of patient gastric cancer cells. This method showed high effectiveness and sensitivity. We successfully separated cancer cells from a simulated peritoneal lavage mixture of gastric cancer cell lines and peritoneal lavage cells in a ratio of 1:1000. We further separated gastric cancer cells from six patients’ ascites with purity up to 71\%. In addition, we measured the cell membrane capacitances, which may be used as a biomarker for gastric cancer cells. Thus, our method can be used to effectively and rapidly detect peritoneal metastasis and to acquire cellular electrical information.},

In TBG, the nematic order parameter is not Ising like, as in tetragonal crystals, but has a three-state Potts character related to the threefold rotational symmetry ( C 3 z ) of the moiré superlattice. We find that, even in the presence of static strain that explicitly breaks the C 3 z symmetry, the system can still undergo a nematic-flop phase transition that spontaneously breaks in-plane twofold rotations. Moreover, elastic fluctuations, manifested as acoustic phonons, mediate a nemato-orbital coupling that ties the nematic director orientation to certain soft directions in momentum space, rendering the Potts-nematic transition mean field and first order. In contrast to the case of rigid crystals, the Fermi surface hot spots associated with these soft directions are maximally coupled to low-energy nematic fluctuations in the moiré superlattice case.},

To advance our understanding of physiological functions of Daxx, we developed a conditional Daxx allele in mice. We demonstrate that Daxx loss is well tolerated in the pancreas but creates a permissive transcriptional state that cooperates with environmental stress (inflammation) and other genetic lesions ( Men1 loss) to alter gene expression and cell state, impairing pancreas recovery from inflammatory stress in vivo. The transcriptional changes are associated with dysregulation of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs), and dysregulation of endogenous genes near ERVs is also observed in human PanNETs with DAXX mutations. Our results reveal a physiologic function of DAXX, provide a mechanism associated with impaired tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis, and expand our understanding of ERV regulation in somatic cells.},

However, the possibility of exploiting these trade-offs for fighting already resistant isolates has not been addressed in depth, despite the fact that bacterial pathogens are frequently antibiotic-resistant, forming either homogeneous or heterogeneous populations. Using a set of Pseudomonas aeruginosa -resistant mutants, we found that ceftazidime selects pyomelanogenic tobramycin-hypersusceptible mutants presenting chromosomal deletions in the analyzed genetic backgrounds. Since pyomelanogenic resistant mutants frequently coexist with other morphotypes in patients with cystic fibrosis, we analyzed the exploitation of this trade-off to drive extinction of heterogeneous resistant populations by using tobramycin/ceftazidime alternation. Our work shows that this approach is feasible because phenotypic trade-offs associated with the use of ceftazidime are robust.

When identifying inundated roads, we propose corrections for potential biases arising from model integration. Our results for the San Francisco Bay Area show that employee absences are limited to the homes and workplaces within the areas of inundation, while delays propagate far inland. Communities with limited availability of alternate roads experience long delays irrespective of their proximity to the areas of inundation.

We investigate the mechanism by which glucose restriction (GR) extends yeast replicative life span, by combining ribosome profiling and RNA-seq with microfluidic-based single-cell analysis. We discovered a cross-talk between glucose sensing and the regulation of intracellular methionine: GR down-regulated the transcription and translation of methionine biosynthetic enzymes and transporters, leading to a decreased intracellular methionine concentration; external supplementation of methionine cancels the life span extension by GR. Furthermore, genetic perturbations that decrease methionine synthesis/uptake extend life span. These observations suggest that intracellular methionine mediates the life span effects of various nutrient and genetic perturbations, and that the glucose-methionine cross-talk is a general mechanism for coordinating the nutrient status and the translation/growth of a cell. Our work also implicates proteasome as a downstream effector of the life span extension by GR.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we report the existence of a communication system among human smooth muscle cells that uses mechanical forces to frequency modulate long-range calcium waves. An important consequence of this mechanical signaling is that changes in stiffness of the underlying extracellular matrix can interfere with the frequency modulation of Ca 2+ waves, causing smooth muscle cells from healthy human donors to falsely perceive a much higher agonist dose than they actually received. This aberrant sensing of contractile agonist dose on stiffer matrices is completely absent in isolated smooth muscle cells, although the isolated cells can sense matrix rigidity. We show that the intercellular communication that enables this collective Ca 2+ response in smooth muscle cells does not involve transport across gap junctions or extracellular diffusion of signaling molecules. Instead, our data support a collective model in which mechanical signaling among smooth muscle cells regulates their response to contractile agonists.},

Countering this paradigm, nanoparticulate vaccines have been reported to act as delivery systems for vaccine antigens and induce immunity without the need for exogenous adjuvants or local inflammation; however, the mechanisms underlying the immunogenicity of nanoparticle vaccines are incompletely identified. Here, we show that antigens displayed on self-assembling nanofiber scaffolds and delivered intranasally are presented by CD103 + and CD11b + lung dendritic cells that up-regulate CD80 and migrate into the draining lymph node (LN). This was accompanied by a nearly exclusive priming and accumulation of antigen-specific T H 17 cells occurring independently in both LN and lung. Thus, self-assembling peptide nanofiber vaccines may represent a novel, needle- and adjuvant-free means of eliciting protective immunity against fungal and bacterial infections at skin and mucosal barrier surfaces.},

Aerobic heterotrophs use the largest share of global power (54.5\%) with a median power utilization of 2.23 × 10 −18 watts per cell, while sulfate reducers and methanogens use 1.08 × 10 −19 and 1.50 × 10 −20 watts per cell, respectively.

We study REs that reveal fault weakening after a large megathrust earthquake in Costa Rica, followed by fault recovery. We find shorter RE recurrence intervals and larger slip areas immediately following the mainshock that both gradually return to pre-earthquake values. RE seismic moments remain nearly constant throughout the earthquake cycle. This implies a balance between fault weakening (reducing slip) and transient embrittlement (increasing rupture area by converting regions from aseismic to seismic slip), induced by the increased loading rate following the mainshock. This interpretation is consistent with positive, negative, and constant moment versus RE recurrence interval trends reported in other studies following large earthquakes and with experimental work showing slip amplitudes and stress drop decrease with loading rate.},

We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to investigate WM microstructure cross-sectionally and longitudinally after mTBI and correlate these with neuropsychological performance. Cross-sectionally, early decreases of fractional anisotropy and increases of mean diffusivity corresponded to WM regions with elevated free water fraction on NODDI. This elevated free water was more extensive in the patient subgroup reporting more early postconcussive symptoms. The longer-term longitudinal WM changes consisted of declining neurite density on NODDI, suggesting axonal degeneration from diffuse axonal injury for which NODDI is more sensitive than DTI. Therefore, NODDI is a more sensitive and specific biomarker than DTI for WM microstructural changes due to mTBI that merits further study for mTBI diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring.},

Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput 3D culture platform used to systematically screen 1200 culture conditions with varying doses, durations, dynamics, and combinations of signaling cues to derive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and midbrain dopaminergic neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Statistical models of the robust dataset reveal previously unidentified patterns about cell competence to Wnt, retinoic acid, and sonic hedgehog signals, and their interactions, which may offer insights into the combinatorial roles these signals play in human central nervous system development.

Theoretical studies have suggested the possible coexistence of traveling and standing waves in excitable systems. Here, we demonstrate the direct transformation of a traveling into a standing wave and establish conditions for the stability of this conversion. This theory combines excitable wave stopping and the emergence of a family of standing waves at zero velocity, without altering diffusion parameters. Experimentally, we show the existence of this phenomenon on the cell cortex of some Dictyostelium and mammalian mutant strains. We further predict a template that encompasses a spectrum of protrusive phenotypes, including pseudopodia and filopodia, through transitions between traveling and standing waves, allowing the cell to switch between excitability and bistability. Overall, this suggests that a previously-unidentified method of pattern formation, in which traveling waves spread, stop, and turn into standing waves that rearrange to form stable patterns, governs cell motility.},

These results confirm that La Niña conditions significantly influence southwest U.S. drought over the past millennium but only account for, by one metric, ~13\% of interannual drought variability in that region. Atlantic sea surface temperatures may also contribute a small influence, but unexplained variability suggests a substantial role for internal atmospheric variability. This conclusion is buttressed by analysis of simulations from the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble.

A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) – the causal agent in COVID-19 – affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.},

Here, we report a highly reliable severity diagnostic biomarker, acetylated 676th lysine transforming growth factor–beta–induced protein (TGFBIp K676Ac). TGFBIp K676Ac was consistently elevated in the blood of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ( n = 113), especially in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) compared to non-ICU patients.

  abstract     = {The sources of the stone used to construct Stonehenge around 2500 BCE have been debated for over four centuries. The smaller “bluestones” near the center of the monument have been traced to Wales, but the origins of the sarsen (silcrete) megaliths that form the primary architecture of Stonehenge remain unknown. Here, we use geochemical data to show that 50 of the 52 sarsens at the monument share a consistent chemistry and, by inference, originated from a common source area. We then compare the geochemical signature of a core extracted from Stone 58 at Stonehenge with equivalent data for sarsens from across southern Britain. From this, we identify West Woods, Wiltshire, 25 km north of Stonehenge, as the most probable source area for the majority of sarsens at the monument.},

Here, a pH-responsive polymersome codelivering hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and tunicamycin (Tuni) drugs is developed to simultaneously induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagic flux blockade for achieving an antitumor effect and inhibiting tumor metastasis. The pH response of poly(β-amino ester) and HCQ synergistically deacidifies the lysosomes, thereby blocking the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and lastly blocking autophagic flux. The function mechanism of regulating autophagy was systematically investigated on orthotopic luciferase gene–transfected, 4T1 tumor–bearing BALB/c mice through Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. The Tuni triggers ER stress to regulate the PERK/Akt signaling pathway to increase the autophagic level. The “autophagic stress” generated by triggering ER stress–induced autophagy and blocking autophagic flux is effective against tumors. The reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 due to ER stress and reduced focal adhesions turnover due to the blockade of autophagic flux synergistically inhibit tumor metastasis.},

Magnetoionic approaches appear particularly promising, electrolytes and ionic conductors being capable of on/off control of ferromagnetism and tuning of magnetic anisotropy. A clear limitation, however, is that these devices either electrically tune a known ferromagnet or electrically induce ferromagnetism from another magnetic state, e.g., antiferromagnetic. Here, we demonstrate that ferromagnetism can be voltage-induced even from a diamagnetic (zero-spin) state suggesting that useful magnetic phases could be electrically induced in “nonmagnetic” materials. We use ionic liquid–gated diamagnetic FeS 2 as a model system, showing that as little as 1 V induces a reversible insulator-metal transition by electrostatic surface inversion. Anomalous Hall measurements then reveal electrically tunable surface ferromagnetism at up to 25 K. Density functional theory–based modeling explains this in terms of Stoner ferromagnetism induced via filling of a narrow e g band.},

We also demonstrate various complex pattern geometries, such as wave, square, nut, zigzag, and elliptical nanostructures, on diverse substrates via T-nTP. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to obtain a high-density crossbar metal-insulator-metal memristive array using a combined method of T-nTP and directed self-assembly.

Even without report of long range magnetic order, the anomalous Hall conductivity reaches 15, 507 Ω −1 cm −1 with an anomalous Hall ratio of ≈ 1.8\%; an order of magnitude larger than Fe. Defying theoretical expectations, KV 3 Sb 5 shows enhanced skew scattering that scales quadratically, not linearly, with the longitudinal conductivity, possibly arising from the combination of highly conductive Dirac quasiparticles with a frustrated magnetic sublattice. This allows the possibility of reaching an anomalous Hall angle of 90° in metals. This observation raises fundamental questions about AHEs and opens new frontiers for AHE and spin Hall effect exploration, particularly in metallic frustrated magnets.},

Mechanistic analyses of cytokine expression in the psoriatic site, cfDNA levels in circulation and inflamed skin, skin permeation, and biodistribution of cNPs also matched the therapeutic outcomes.

A bulk porous material with a long-range lamellar pattern was obtained using a linear gradient, yielding a high-performance, bulk nacre-mimetic composite with excellent strength and toughness after infiltration. In addition, cross-aligned and circular lamellar structures can be obtained by freeze-casting on surfaces modified with bilayer linear gradient and radial gradient, respectively, which are impossible to realize with conventional freeze-casting techniques.

Loss of the positive charge had greater effect on the skeletal isoform, mediated via distortion of a salt bridge network, a molecular latch inducing rotation of a cytoplasmic domain, and partial progression to open-state traits of the large cytoplasmic assembly accompanied by alteration of the Ca 2+ binding site, which concur with the major “hyperactive” feature of the mutated channel.

  abstract     = {Mild mitochondrial stress experienced early in life can have beneficial effects on the life span of organisms through epigenetic regulations. Here, we report that acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) represents a critical mitochondrial signal to regulate aging through the chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase complex (NuRD) in Caenorhabditis elegans . Upon mitochondrial stress, the impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle results in a decreased level of citrate, which accounts for reduced production of acetyl-CoA and consequently induces nuclear accumulation of the NuRD and a homeodomain-containing transcription factor DVE-1, thereby enabling decreased histone acetylation and chromatin reorganization. The metabolic stress response is thus established during early life and propagated into adulthood to allow transcriptional regulation for life-span extension. Furthermore, adding nutrients to restore acetyl-CoA production is sufficient to counteract the chromatin changes and diminish the longevity upon mitochondrial stress. Our findings uncover the molecular mechanism of the metabolite-mediated epigenome for the regulation of organismal aging.},

  abstract     = {ELKS1 is a protein with proposed roles in regulated exocytosis in neurons and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling in cancer cells. However, how these two potential roles come together under physiological settings remain unknown. Since both regulated exocytosis and NF-κB signaling are determinants of mast cell (MC) functions, we generated mice lacking ELKS1 in connective tissue MCs ( Elks1 f/f Mcpt5 -Cre) and found that while ELKS1 is dispensable for NF-κB–mediated cytokine production, it is essential for MC degranulation both in vivo and in vitro. Impaired degranulation was caused by reduced transcription of Syntaxin 4 (STX4) and Syntaxin binding protein 2 (Stxpb2), resulting from a lack of ELKS1-mediated stabilization of lysine-specific demethylase 2B (Kdm2b), which is an essential regulator of STX4 and Stxbp2 transcription. These results suggest a transcriptional role for active-zone proteins like ELKS1 and suggest that they may regulate exocytosis through a novel mechanism involving transcription of key exocytosis proteins.},

  abstract     = {Aging results in profound immune dysfunction, resulting in the decline of vaccine responsiveness previously attributed to irreversible defects in the immune system. In addition to increased interleukin-6 (IL-6), we found aged mice exhibit increased systemic IL-10 that requires forkhead box P3–negative (FoxP3 − ), but not FoxP3 + , CD4 + T cells. Most IL-10–producing cells manifested a T follicular helper (Tfh) phenotype and required the Tfh cytokines IL-6 and IL-21 for their accrual, so we refer to them as Tfh10 cells. IL-21 was also required to maintain normal serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10. Notably, antigen-specific Tfh10 cells arose after immunization of aged mice, and neutralization of IL-10 receptor signaling significantly restored Tfh-dependent antibody responses, whereas depletion of FoxP3 + regulatory and follicular regulatory cells did not. Thus, these data demonstrate that immune suppression with age is reversible and implicate Tfh10 cells as an intriguing link between “inflammaging” and impaired immune responses with age.},

However, its photonic applications are restricted to visible and partial near-infrared spectral range owing to its fundamental optical bandgap (1.12 eV). With recent advances in strain engineering, material properties, including optical bandgap, can be tailored considerably. This paper reports the strain-induced shrinkage in the Si bandgap, providing photosensing well beyond its fundamental absorption limit in Si nanomembrane (NM) photodetectors (PDs). The Si-NM PD pixels were mechanically stretched (biaxially) by a maximum strain of ~3.5\% through pneumatic pressure–induced bulging, enhancing photoresponsivity and extending the Si absorption limit up to 1550 nm, which is the essential wavelength range of the lidar sensors for obstacle detection in self-driving vehicles. The development of deformable three-dimensional optoelectronics via gas pressure–induced bulging also facilitated the realization of unique device designs with concave and convex hemispherical architectures, which mimics the electronic prototypes of biological eyes.},

The scalability of processing steps and materials in the manufacture and operation of tandems is considered. The resulting energy payback time and greenhouse gas emission factor of the all-perovskite tandem configuration are 0.35 years and 10.7 g CO 2 -eq/kWh, respectively, compared to 1.52 years and 24.6 g CO 2 -eq/kWh for the silicon benchmark. Prolonging the lifetime provides a strong technological lever for reducing the carbon footprint such that the perovskite-silicon tandem can outcompete the current benchmark on energy and environmental performance. Perovskite-perovskite tandems with flexible and lightweight form factors further improve the energy and environmental performance by around 6\% and thus enhance the potential for large-scale, sustainable deployment.},

Here, we report a class of Pd-Te hexagonal nanoplates (HPs) with a Pd 20 Te 7 phase that simultaneously overcome the activity and methanol-tolerant issues in alkaline DMFC. Because of the specific arrangement of Pd atoms deviated from typical hexagonal close-packing, Pd-Te HPs/C displays extraordinary methanol tolerance with high ORR performance compared with commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations reveal that the high performance of Pd-Te HPs can be attributed to the breakthrough of the linear relationship between OOH* and OH* adsorption, which leaves sufficient room to improve the ORR activity but suppresses the methanol oxidation reaction. The concurrent high ORR activity and excellent methanol tolerance endow Pd-Te HPs as practical electrocatalysts for DMFC and beyond.},

Here, by accurately integrating a QD and its mirror image onto the two foci of a bifocal metalens, we demonstrate the on-demand generation and separation of the spin states of the emitted single photons. The photon streams with different spin states emitted from the QD can be flexibly manipulated to propagate along arbitrarily designed directions with high collimation of the smallest measured beaming divergence angle of 3.17°.

Here, we combine depth-resolved Doppler broadening and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopies to identify vacancy clusters in ion-irradiated Fe and measure their density as a function of depth. Despite large concentrations of dislocations and voids in the pristine samples, positron annihilation measurements uncovered the structure of vacancy clusters and the change in their size and density with irradiation dose. When combined with transmission electron microscopy measurements, the study demonstrates an association between the increase in the density of small vacancy clusters with irradiation and a remarkable reduction in the size of large voids. This, previously unknown, mechanism for the interaction of cascade damage with voids in ion-irradiated materials is a consequence of the high porosity of the initial microstructure.},

However, it remains unclear how the surface heat reservoir is replenished by ocean processes to sustain the atmospheric heat uptake. Using high-resolution climate simulations, we find that the vertical heat transport by ocean mesoscale eddies acts as an important heat supplier to the surface ocean in frontal regions. This vertical eddy heat transport is not accounted for by the prevailing inviscid and adiabatic ocean dynamical theories such as baroclinic instability and frontogenesis but is tightly related to the atmospheric forcing. Strong surface cooling associated with intense winds in winter promotes turbulent mixing in the mixed layer, destructing the vertical shear of mesoscale eddies. The restoring of vertical shear induces an ageostrophic secondary circulation transporting heat from the subsurface to surface ocean.},

By using an attosecond two-color interferometric approach in combination with high spectral resolution, we have captured the changes induced by the nuclear motion on the centrifugal barrier that sustains the well-known shape resonance in valence-ionized N 2 . We show that despite the nuclear motion altering the bond length by only 2\%, which leads to tiny changes in the potential barrier, the corresponding change in the ionization time can be as large as 200 attoseconds.

To investigate the impact of dorsoventral polarity on cell locomotion through different confining geometries, we fabricated microchannels of fixed cross-sectional area, albeit with distinct aspect ratios. Vertical confinement, exerted along the dorsoventral polarity axis, induces myosin II–dependent nuclear stiffening, which results in RhoA hyperactivation at the cell poles and slow bleb-based migration. In lateral confinement, directed perpendicularly to the dorsoventral polarity axis, the absence of perinuclear myosin II fails to increase nuclear stiffness. Hence, cells maintain basal RhoA activity and display faster mesenchymal migration. In summary, by integrating microfabrication, imaging techniques, and intravital microscopy, we demonstrate that dorsoventral polarity, observed in vivo and in vitro, directs cell responses in confinement by spatially tuning RhoA activity, which controls bleb-based versus mesenchymal migration.},

This pattern is well-known, but unexplained, and remains an outstanding problem in our understanding of porphyry ore deposit formation. We approach this problem by investigating the oxidation state of magmatic sulfur, which controls the behavior of ore-forming metals during magma differentiation and magmatic-hydrothermal transition. We use sulfur in apatite to reconstruct the sulfur oxidation state in the Gangdese batholith, southern Tibet. We find that magma sulfate content increased abruptly after India-Eurasia collision. Apatite sulfur content and the calculated magma S 6+ /ΣS ratio correlate with whole-rock dysprosium/ytterbium ratio, suggesting that residual garnet, favored in thickened crust, exerts a first-order control on sulfur oxidation in magmatic orogens. Our findings link sulfur oxidation to internal petrogenic processes and imply an intrinsic relationship of magma oxidation with synmagmatic crustal thickening.},

Second, the spin information is brought toward the conducting inner shells of a multiwall carbon nanotube used as a confined nanoguide benefiting from both weak spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions.

The driving force for this dynamic complex pattern has remained unexplained for decades, challenging our understanding of this fundamental biological problem and hindering clinical planning for inherited diseases. Here, we demonstrate that the nonrandom mtDNA segregation is an intracellular process based on organelle selection.

  abstract     = {Flagellar beating drives sperm through the female reproductive tract and is vital for reproduction. Flagellar waves are generated by thousands of asymmetric molecular components; yet, paradoxically, forward swimming arises via symmetric side-to-side flagellar movement. This led to the preponderance of symmetric flagellar control hypotheses. However, molecular asymmetries must still dictate the flagellum and be manifested in the beat. Here, we reconcile molecular and microscopic observations, reconnecting structure to function, by showing that human sperm uses asymmetric and anisotropic controls to swim. High-speed three-dimensional (3D) microscopy revealed two coactive transversal controls: An asymmetric traveling wave creates a one-sided stroke, and a pulsating standing wave rotates the sperm to move equally on all sides. Symmetry is thus achieved through asymmetry, creating the optical illusion of bilateral symmetry in 2D microscopy. This shows that the sperm flagellum is asymmetrically controlled and anisotropically regularized by fast-signal transduction. This enables the sperm to swim forward.},

The coupling mechanism, however, is poorly understood. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of air-oxidized and dithionite-reduced ACIII from the photosynthetic bacterium Roseiflexus castenholzii at 3.3- and 3.5-Å resolution, respectively. We identified a menaquinol binding pocket and an electron transfer wire comprising six hemes and four iron-sulfur clusters that is capable of transferring electrons to periplasmic acceptors. We detected a proton translocation passage in which three strictly conserved, mid-passage residues are likely essential for coupling the redox-driven proton translocation across the membrane. These results allow us to propose a previously unrecognized coupling mechanism that links the respiratory and photosynthetic functions of ACIII. This study provides a structural basis for further investigation of the energy transformation mechanisms in bacterial photosynthesis and respiration.},

Geometric considerations of rigid rod packing imply that a domain of sufficiently short rods in a background membrane of long rods is more susceptible to twist than the inverse structure, a long-rod domain in a short-rod membrane. The midplane tilt at the interdomain edge forces splay, which, in turn, manifests as spontaneous edge curvature with energetics controlled by the length asymmetry of constituent rods. A thermodynamic model of such tilt-curvature coupling at interdomain edges explains a number of experimental observations, including annularly shaped long-rod domains, and a nonmonotonic dependence of edge twist on domain radius. Our work shows how coupling between orientational and compositional degrees of freedom in two-dimensional fluids gives rise to complex shapes of fluid domains, analogous to shape transitions in 3D fluid vesicles.},

CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β/asparagine endopeptidase (C/EBPβ/AEP) signaling spatiotemporally mediates AD pathologies in the brain via cleaving both β-amyloid precursor protein and Tau. We show that gut dysbiosis occurs in 5xFAD mice, and is associated with escalation of the C/EBPβ/AEP pathway in the gut with age. Unlike that of aged wild-type mice, the microbiota of aged 3xTg mice accelerate AD pathology in young 3xTg mice, accompanied by active C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in the brain. Antibiotic treatment diminishes this signaling and attenuates amyloidogenic processes in 5xFAD, improving cognitive functions. The prebiotic R13 inhibits this pathway and suppresses amyloid aggregates in the gut. R13-induced Lactobacillus salivarius antagonizes the C/EBPβ/AEP axis, mitigating gut leakage and oxidative stress. Our findings support the hypothesis that C/EBPβ/AEP signaling is activated by gut dysbiosis, implicated in AD pathologies in the gut.},

A porous and magnetic microbubble platform is developed to formulate tPA. This system can maintain the tPA activity during circulation, be magnetically guided to the thrombi, and then remotely activated for drug release. The ultrasound stimulation also improves the drug penetration into thrombi. In a mouse model of venous thrombosis, the residual thrombus decreased by 67.5\% when compared to conventional injection of tPA. The penetration of tPA by ultrasound was up to several hundred micrometers in thrombi. This strategy not only improves the therapeutic efficacy but also accelerates the lytic rate, enabling it to be promising in time-critical thrombolytic therapy.},

A hot-phonon bottleneck effect significantly extends the cooling time of hot charge carriers, which thermalize through carrier–optic phonon scattering, followed by optic phonon decay to acoustic phonons and finally thermal conduction. To understand these processes, we adjust the lattice dynamics independently of electronics by changing isotopes. We show that doubling the mass of hydrogen in methylammonium lead iodide by replacing protons with deuterons causes a large 20 to 50\% softening of the longitudinal acoustic phonons near zone boundaries, reduces thermal conductivity by ~50\%, and slows carrier relaxation kinetics. Phonon softening is attributed to anticrossing with the slowed libration modes of the deuterated molecules and the reduced thermal conductivity to lowered phonon velocities. Our results reveal how tuning the organic molecule dynamics enables control of phonons important to thermal conductivity and the hot-phonon bottleneck.},

However, how GEF-H1 activates Rho upon microtubule disassembly remains elusive. Here, we found that BNIP-2, a BCH domain–containing protein that binds both RhoA and GEF-H1 and traffics with kinesin-1 on microtubules, is important for GEF-H1–driven RhoA activation upon microtubule disassembly. Depletion of BNIP-2 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells decreases RhoA activity and promotes cell migration. Upon nocodazole-induced microtubule disassembly, the interaction between BNIP-2 and GEF-H1 increases, while knockdown of BNIP-2 reduces RhoA activation and cell rounding via uncoupling RhoA-GEF-H1 interaction. Together, these findings revealed that BNIP-2 couples microtubules and focal adhesions via scaffolding GEF-H1 and RhoA, fine-tuning RhoA activity and cell migration.},

Sensitivity to piperlongumine was dependent on its ability to suppress RUVBL1/2-TTT, a complex involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. Cancer cells with high mTORC1 activity are subjected to higher levels of DNA damage stress via c-Myc and displayed an increased dependency on RUVBL1/2 for survival and counteracting genotoxic stress. Examination of clinical cancer tissues also demonstrated that high mTORC1 activity was accompanied by high RUVBL2 expression.

In Hall’s Cave, layers below, above, and in the YD have 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios consistent with incorporation of extraterrestrial or mantle-derived material. The HSE abundances indicate that these layers contain volcanic gas aerosols and not extraterrestrial materials.

Here, we provide theoretical evidence of a previously unidentified mechanism of chirality amplification in lyotropic liquid crystals, whereby phase chirality is governed by fluctuation-stabilized helical deformations in the conformations of their constituent molecules. Our results compare favorably to recent experimental studies of DNA origami assemblies and demonstrate the influence of intramolecular mechanics on chiral supramolecular order, with potential implications for a broad class of experimentally relevant colloidal systems.},

  abstract     = {T cell factor 1 (Tcf1) is the first T cell–specific protein induced by Notch signaling in the thymus, leading to the activation of two major target genes, Gata3 and Bcl11b . Tcf1 deficiency results in partial arrests in T cell development, high apoptosis, and increased development of B and myeloid cells. Phenotypically, seemingly fully T cell–committed thymocytes with Tcf1 deficiency have promiscuous gene expression and an altered epigenetic profile and can dedifferentiate into more immature thymocytes and non-T cells. Restoring Bcl11b expression in Tcf1-deficient cells rescues T cell development but does not strongly suppress the development of non-T cells; in contrast, expressing Gata3 suppresses their development but does not rescue T cell development. Thus, T cell development is controlled by a minimal transcription factor network involving Notch signaling, Tcf1, and the subsequent division of labor between Bcl11b and Gata3, thereby ensuring a properly regulated T cell gene expression program.},

The Nazis justified genocide supposedly to control the spread of disease. This exemplifies humanity’s ability to turn upon itself, based on racially guided epidemiological principles, merely because of the appearance of a bacterium. Deadly disease and starvation dynamics are explored using modeling and the maths of food ration cards. Strangely, the epidemic was curtailed and was brought to a sudden halt before winter, when typhus normally accelerates. A far more massive epidemic outbreak was prevented through the antiepidemic efforts by the often considered incompetent and corrupt ghetto leadership and the Herculean efforts of ghetto doctors.},

A largely unexplored arena is the intrinsic tuning of VdW magnets toward new ground states. Chromium trihalides provided the first such example with a change of interlayer magnetic coupling emerging upon exfoliation. Here, we take a different approach to engineer previously unknown ground states, not by exfoliation, but by tuning the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the nonmagnetic ligand atoms (Cl, Br, I). We synthesize a three-halide series, CrCl 3 − x − y Br x I y , and map their magnetic properties as a function of Cl, Br, and I content. The resulting triangular phase diagrams unveil a frustrated regime near CrCl 3 . First-principles calculations confirm that the frustration is driven by a competition between the chromium and halide SOCs. Furthermore, we reveal a field-induced change of interlayer coupling in the bulk of CrCl 3 − x − y Br x I y crystals at the same field as in the exfoliation experiments.},

Development of a rational strategy that allows access to high-performance 3D microdevices with multiple stable geometric configurations remains challenging. We introduce a mechanically guided scheme to build geometrically reconfigurable 3D mesostructures through a bottom-up design strategy based on a class of elementary reconfigurable structures with the simplest ribbon geometries. Quantitative mechanics modeling of the structural reconfigurability allows for the development of phase diagrams and design maps. Demonstrations of ~30 reconfigurable mesostructures with diverse geometric topologies and characteristic dimensions illustrate the versatile applicability.

However, effective delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into the skin is a substantial hurdle due to skin’s barrier function and poor stability of siRNA. Using ionic liquids as an enabling technology, we report on the effective delivery of NFKBIZ siRNA into the skin and its therapeutic efficacy in a psoriasis model. Treatment with IL-siRNA suppressed aberrant gene expression and resulted in down-regulation of psoriasis-related signals including TNF-α and IL-17A.

Full-visible-range SCs are developed in a BCP PC consisting of alternating lamellae, one of which contains a chemically cross-linked, interpenetrated hydrogel network. The absorption of a nonvolatile ionic liquid into the domains of the interpenetrated network allows for further manipulation of SC by using multiple-order photonic reflections, giving rise to unprecedented visible SCs arising from reflective color mixing. Furthermore, by using a hygroscopic ionic liquid ink, a printable 3D touchless interactive display is created where 3D position of a human finger is efficiently visualized in different SCs as a function of finger-to-display distance.},

E2 is structurally flexible and functions in engaging host receptors. Many nAbs bind to the “neutralizing face” on E2, including several broadly nAbs encoded by the V H 1-69 germline gene family that bind to a similar conformation (A) of this face. Here, a previously unknown conformation (B) of the neutralizing face is revealed in crystal structures of two of four additional E2–V H 1-69 nAb complexes. In this conformation, the E2 front-layer region is displaced upon antibody binding, exposing residues in the back layer for direct antibody interaction.

We show that PG editing increases the competitiveness of A. baumannii during bacterial warfare by providing immunity against peptidoglycan-targeting T6SS effectors from various bacterial competitors. In contrast, we found that d -Lys production is detrimental to pathogenesis due, at least in part, to the activity of the human enzyme d -amino acid oxidase (DAO), which degrades d -Lys producing H 2 O 2 toxic to bacteria. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the last common ancestor of A. baumannii had the ability to produce d -Lys.

Wilms tumor-1 (WT1) is a master regulator of gene expression in podocytes, binding nearly all genes known to be crucial for maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. Using murine models and human kidney organoids, we investigated WT1-mediated transcriptional reprogramming during the course of podocyte injury.

In this study, we combine CED with novel, molecular-grade positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and show how PETobinostat, a novel PET-imageable HDAC inhibitor, is effective against DIPG models. PET data reveal that CED has significant mouse-to-mouse variability; imaging is used to modulate CED infusions to maximize tumor saturation. The use of PET-guided CED results in survival prolongation in mouse models; imaging shows the need of CED to achieve high brain concentrations.

  abstract     = {As the leading cause of trauma-related mortality, blood loss due to hemorrhage is notoriously difficult to triage and manage. To enable timely and appropriate care for patients with trauma, this work elucidates the externally measurable physiological features of exsanguination, which were used to develop a globalized model for assessing blood volume status (BVS) or the relative severity of blood loss. These features were captured via both a multimodal wearable system and a catheter-based reference and used to accurately infer BVS in a porcine model of hemorrhage ( n = 6). Ultimately, high-level features of cardiomechanical function were shown to strongly predict progression toward cardiovascular collapse and used to estimate BVS with a median error of 15.17 and 18.17\% for the catheter-based and wearable systems, respectively. Exploring the nexus of biomedical theory and practice, these findings lay the groundwork for digital biomarkers of hemorrhage severity and warrant further study in human subjects.},

We find &gt;900 vessels of Chinese origin in 2017 and &gt;700 in 2018 fished illegally in North Korean waters, catching an estimated amount of Todarodes pacificus approximating that of Japan and South Korea combined (&gt;164, 000 metric tons worth &gt;$440 million).

We develop a greater understanding of these processes by contrasting observations with simulations of global convection. These comparisons also enhance our comprehension of the physics of distant Sun-like stars. Here, we infer toroidal flow power as a function of wave number, frequency, and depth in the solar interior through helioseismic analyses of space-based observations. The inferred flows grow with spatial wave number and temporal frequency and are confined to low latitudes, supporting the argument that rotation induces systematic differences between the poles and equator. In contrast, the simulations used here show the opposite trends—power diminishing with increasing wave number and frequency while flow amplitudes become weakest at low latitudes. These differences highlight gaps in our understanding of solar convection and point to challenges ahead.},

Much is known about the structures of the individual CCV components, but data are lacking about the structures of the fully assembled complexes together with membrane and in complex with cargo. Here, we determined the structures of natively assembled CCVs in a variety of geometries. We show that the adaptor β2 appendages crosslink adjacent CHC β-propellers and that the appendage densities are enriched in CCV hexagonal faces. We resolve how adaptor protein 2 and other associated factors in hexagonal faces form an assembly hub with an extensive web of interactions between neighboring β-propellers and propose a structural model that explains how adaptor binding can direct the formation of pentagonal and hexagonal faces.},

Although at birth infants have an immature auditory system and limited language experience, they show remarkable speech perception skills. To assess neonates’ ability to process the complex acoustic cues of speech, we combined near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain responses to syllables differing in consonants. The syllables were presented in three conditions preserving (i) original temporal modulations of speech [both amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM)], (ii) both fast and slow AM, but not FM, or (iii) only the slowest AM (&lt;8 Hz). EEG responses indicate that neonates can encode consonants in all conditions, even without the fast temporal modulations, similarly to adults. Yet, the fast and slow AM activate different neural areas, as shown by NIRS. Thus, the immature human brain is already able to decompose the acoustic components of speech, laying the foundations of language learning.},

The protocol entails the delivery of modified mRNA encoding the transcription factor ETV2 at the intermediate mesodermal stage of differentiation. This approach reproducibly differentiated 13 diverse h-iPSC lines into h-iECs with exceedingly high efficiency. In contrast, standard differentiation methods that relied on endogenous ETV2 were inefficient and notably inconsistent. Our h-iECs were functionally competent in many respects, including the ability to form perfused vascular networks in vivo. Timely activation of ETV2 was critical, and bypassing the mesodermal stage produced putative h-iECs with reduced expansion potential and inability to form functional vessels. Our protocol has broad applications and could reliably provide an unlimited number of h-iECs for vascular therapies.},

Here, we show that the high expression of FcγRIIB restricts atypical MBC responses to membrane-associated antigens that function to actively exclude FcγRIIB from the B cell immune synapse and include the co-receptor CD19, allowing B cell antigen receptor signaling and differentiation toward plasma cells. Thus, chronic infectious diseases result in the expansion of B cells that robustly respond to antigens that associate with cell surfaces, such as antigens in immune complexes, but are unable to respond to fully soluble antigens, such as self-antigens.},

Instead, we found that PIP3 blocked delivery of clinically-relevant lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) across multiple cell types in vitro and in vivo. PIP3-driven reductions in LNP delivery were not caused by toxicity, cell uptake, or endosomal escape. Interestingly, RNA sequencing and metabolomics analyses suggested an increase in basal metabolic rate. Higher transcriptional activity and mitochondrial expansion led us to formulate two competing hypotheses that explain the reductions in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery. First, PIP3 induced consumption of limited cellular resources, “drowning out” exogenously-delivered mRNA. Second, PIP3 triggers a catabolic response that leads to protein degradation and decreased translation.},

First-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal it is an axion insulator with sizable surface hybridization gaps.

Therefore, as an intrinsic ferromagnetic axion insulator with clean low-energy band structures, MnBi 8 Te 13 serves as an ideal system to investigate rich emergent phenomena, including the quantized anomalous Hall effect and quantized magnetoelectric effect.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can be degraded in a ubiquitin-independent process by the 20 S proteasome. Decline in 20 S activity characterizes neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we examine 20 S degradation of IDP tau, a protein that aggregates into insoluble deposits in Alzheimer’s disease. We show that cleavage of tau by the 20 S proteasome is most efficient within the aggregation-prone repeat region of tau and generates both short, aggregation-deficient peptides and two long fragments containing residues 1 to 251 and 1 to 218. Phosphorylation of tau by the non-proline–directed Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibits degradation by the 20 S proteasome. Phosphorylation of tau by GSK3β, a major proline-directed tau kinase, modulates tau degradation kinetics in a residue-specific manner. The study provides detailed insights into the degradation products of tau generated by the 20 S proteasome, the residue specificity of degradation, single-residue degradation kinetics, and their regulation by posttranslational modification.},

We find that depletion of ADA2, an ectoenzyme that catabolizes extracellular dAdo to dIno, or supplementation of dAdo or dIno stimulates IFN-β. Under conditions of reduced ADA2 enzyme activity, dAdo is transported into cells and undergoes catabolysis by the cytosolic isoenzyme ADA1, driving intracellular accumulation of dIno. dIno is a functional immunometabolite that interferes with the cellular methionine cycle by inhibiting SAM synthetase activity. Inhibition of SAM-dependent transmethylation drives epigenomic hypomethylation and overexpression of immune-stimulatory endogenous retroviral elements that engage cytosolic dsRNA sensors and induce IFN-β. We uncovered a previously unknown cellular signaling pathway that responds to extracellular DNA–derived metabolites, coupling nucleoside catabolism by adenosine deaminases to cellular IFN-β production.},

MSNs were preloaded with anti-inflammatory agents (microRNA-21 or curcumin) and modified with stimuli-responsive molecules to achieve accurate cargo release at designated locations. The resulting cABs actively target macrophages in the inflammatory region and effectively promote M2 polarization of these macrophages to modulate inflammation due to the synergistic regulatory effects of AB membranes and the intracellular release of preloaded cargos.

Because of this stability and flexibility, we surmise that deep learning will become an algorithmic mainstay for cell deconvolution of various data types.

In this study, results revealed that DP spheroids are effective at inducing the progression of the hair follicle cycle from telogen to anagen compared with just DP cell or minoxidil treatment. Because of the importance of paracrine signaling in this process, secretome and exosomes were isolated from DP cell culture, and their therapeutic efficacies were investigated.

This dichotomy is a natural outcome of formation models assuming that planetesimal accretion occurred nearly instantaneously. However, it has recently been proposed that the accretion of many planetesimals lasted over ≳1 million years (Ma). This could have resulted in partially differentiated internal structures, with individual bodies containing iron cores, achondritic silicate mantles, and chondritic crusts. This proposal can be tested by searching for a meteorite group containing evidence for these three layers. We combine synchrotron paleomagnetic analyses with thermal, impact, and collisional evolution models to show that the parent body of the enigmatic IIE iron meteorites was such a partially differentiated planetesimal. This implies that some chondrites and achondrites simultaneously coexisted on the same planetesimal, indicating that accretion was protracted and that apparently undifferentiated asteroids may contain melted interiors.},

Intraciliary and cytoplasmic Ca 2+ transients were detected in the crown cells at the node. These Ca 2+ transients showed L-R asymmetry, which was lost in the absence of fluid flow or the PKD2 channel. Further characterization allowed classification of the Ca 2+ transients into two types: cilium-derived, L-R-asymmetric transients (type 1) and cilium-independent transients without an L-R bias (type 2). Type 1 intraciliary transients occurred preferentially at the left posterior region of the node, where L-R symmetry breaking takes place. Suppression of intraciliary Ca 2+ transients delayed L-R symmetry breaking.

We present here a potentiometric mechanotransducer that is fabricated through an all-solution processing approach. This mechanotransducer shows ultralow-power consumption, highly tunable sensing behavior, and capability to detect both static and low-frequency dynamic mechanical stimuli. Furthermore, we developed two novel classes of sensing devices, including strain-insensitive sensors and single-electrode-mode e-skins, which are challenging to achieve using the existing methods.

We imaged films with up to four water layers that grow anisotropically over a single face. Growth usually begins from the near edges of a face where defects preferentially capture water vapor. Thicker films produced by condensation cooling completely engulf nanoparticles and form thicker menisci over defects. The high surface tension of water smooths film surfaces and produces films of inhomogeneous thickness.

We further identified JAG1 signaling as a previously unknown upstream activator of MYO10 expression in leader cells. Using live-cell imaging, we found that MYO10 drives filopodial persistence necessary for micropatterning extracellular fibronectin into linear tracks at the edge of 3D collective invasion exclusively in leaders.

We report that the deacetylase SirT7 is a dual sirtuin, as it also features auto-mADPRT activity. SirT7 mADPRT occurs at a previously undefined active site, and its abrogation alters SirT7 chromatin distribution. We identify an epigenetic pathway by which ADP-ribosyl-SirT7 is recognized by the ADP-ribose reader mH2A1.1 under glucose starvation, inducing SirT7 relocalization to intergenic regions. SirT7 promotes mH2A1 enrichment in a subset of nearby genes, many of them involved in second messenger signaling, resulting in their specific up- or down-regulation. The expression profile of these genes under calorie restriction is consistently abrogated in SirT7-deficient mice, resulting in impaired activation of autophagy.

To determine the mechanisms of gastrointestinal (GI) CD tissue tropism, we systematically characterized the spatial localization of infection-induced metabolic and microbiome alterations, in a mouse model of CD. Notably, the impact of the transition between acute and persistent infection differed between tissue sites, with sustained large-scale effects of infection in the esophagus and large intestine, providing a potential mechanism for the tropism of CD within the GI tract. Infection affected acylcarnitine metabolism; carnitine supplementation prevented acute-stage CD mortality without affecting parasite burden by mitigating infection-induced metabolic disturbances and reducing cardiac strain. Overall, results identified a previously-unknown mechanism of disease tolerance in CD, with potential for new therapeutic regimen development.

  abstract     = {Staphylococcus aureus infection is difficult to eradicate because of biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance. The increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection necessitates the development of a new agent against bacterial biofilms. We report a new coumarin compound, termed DCH, that effectively combats MRSA in vitro and in vivo and exhibits potent antibiofilm activity without detectable resistance. Cellular proteome analysis suggests that the molecular mechanism of action of DCH involves the arginine catabolic pathway. Using molecular docking and binding affinity assays of DCH, and comparison of the properties of wild-type and ArgR-deficient MRSA strains, we demonstrate that the arginine repressor ArgR, an essential regulator of the arginine catabolic pathway, is the target of DCH. These findings indicate that DCH is a promising lead compound and validate bacterial ArgR as a potential target in the development of new drugs against MRSA biofilms.},

In our HIV-1–preinfected humanized mice, both therapeutic and control HSPCs repopulated efficiently without abnormalities. Although the HIV-1–mediated selection of anti–HIV-1 RNAi-modified clones was evident in HIV-1–infected mice, the organ-to-organ and intra-organ clonal distributions in infected mice were indistinguishable from those in uninfected mice. HIV-1–infected cells showed clonal patterns distinct from those of HSPCs.

  abstract     = {In optical imaging, light propagation is affected by the inhomogeneities of the medium. Sample-induced aberrations and multiple scattering can strongly degrade the image resolution and contrast. On the basis of a dynamic correction of the incident and/or reflected wavefronts, adaptive optics has been used to compensate for those aberrations. However, it only applies to spatially invariant aberrations or to thin aberrating layers. Here, we propose a global and noninvasive approach based on the distortion matrix concept. This matrix basically connects any focusing point of the image with the distorted part of its wavefront in reflection. A singular value decomposition of the distortion matrix allows to correct for high-order aberrations and forward multiple scattering over multiple isoplanatic modes. Proof-of-concept experiments are performed through biological tissues including a turbid cornea. We demonstrate a Strehl ratio enhancement up to 2500 and recover a diffraction-limited resolution until a depth of 10 scattering mean free paths.},

We identified distinct firing patterns of prefrontal parvalbumin (PV) INs and somatostatin (SST) INs upon social interaction. Moreover, social interaction closely correlated with elevated gamma rhythms particularly at low gamma band (20 to 50 Hz). Pharmacogenetic inhibition of PV INs, instead of SST INs, reduced low gamma power and impaired sociability. Optogenetic synchronization of either PV INs or SST INs at low gamma frequency improved sociability, whereas high gamma frequency or random frequency stimulation had no effect. These results reveal a functional differentiation among IN subtypes and suggest the importance of low gamma rhythms in social interaction behavior. Furthermore, our findings underscore previously unrecognized potential of SST INs as therapeutic targets for social impairments commonly observed in major neuropsychiatric disorders.},

Here, we present an algorithm that generates synthetic attC sites with conserved structural features and minimal sequence-level constraints. We demonstrate that all generated sites are functional, their recombination efficiency can reach 60\%, and they can be embedded into protein coding sequences. To improve recombination of less efficient sites, we applied large-scale mutagenesis and library enrichment coupled to next-generation sequencing and machine learning. Our results validated the efficiency of this approach and allowed us to refine synthetic attC design principles.

Dynamic filament cross-linking and sliding and excluded-volume interactions promote formation of bundles at small densities and of active polar nematics at high densities. A buckling-type instability sets the size of polar domains and the density of topological defects. We predict a universal scaling of the active diffusion coefficient and the domain size with activity, and its dependence on parameters like motor concentration and filament persistence length.

The carboxylic acid–rich structures were evolved step by step by exploring various sequences from intrinsically disordered coils over supercharged nanobarrels to hierarchically spider β sheet containing protein-supercharged polypeptide chimeras. The latter material is characterized by interconnected β sheet nanodomains decorated on their surface by carboxylic acid groups, forming self-supportive membranes and allowing for proton conduction in the hydrated state. The membranes showed an extraordinary proton conductivity of 18.5 ± 5 mS/cm at RH = 90\%, one magnitude higher than other protein devices.

However, the mechanisms by which these proteins of retroviral origin alter brain cell communication remain poorly understood. Here, we combined single-molecule tracking, calcium imaging, and behavioral approaches to demonstrate that the envelope protein (Env) of HERV type W, which is normally silenced but expressed in patients with neuropsychiatric conditions, alters the N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor (NMDAR)–mediated synaptic organization and plasticity through glia- and cytokine-dependent changes. Env expression in the developing hippocampus was sufficient to induce behavioral impairments at the adult stage that were prevented by Env neutralization or tuning of NMDAR trafficking. Thus, we show that a HERV gene product alters glutamate synapse maturation and generates behavioral deficits, further supporting the possible etiological interplay between genetic, immune, and synaptic factors in psychosis.},

Many different quality control machineries exist to maintain ER stability under the stresses associated with synthesizing, folding, and modifying complex proteins and lipids. The best understood of these mechanisms is the unfolded protein response of the ER (UPR ER ), in which transmembrane proteins serve as sensors, which trigger a coordinated transcriptional response of genes dedicated for mitigating the stress. As the name suggests, the UPR ER is most well described as a functional response to protein misfolding stress.

It is an intrinsically triboelectric negative material with trapped air within closed voids, exhibiting ultrahigh static surface potential and excellent compressibility.

  abstract     = {Metasurfaces with unparalleled controllability of light have shown great potential to revolutionize conventional optics. However, they mainly require external light excitation, which makes it difficult to fully integrate them on-chip. On the other hand, integrated photonics enables packing optical components densely on a chip, but it has limited free-space light controllability. Here, by dressing metasurfaces onto waveguides, we molded guided waves into any desired free-space modes to achieve complex free-space functions, such as out-of-plane beam deflection and focusing. This metasurface also breaks the degeneracy of clockwise- and counterclockwise-propagating whispering gallery modes in an active microring resonator, leading to on-chip direct orbital angular momentum lasing. Our study shows a viable route toward complete control of light across integrated photonics and free-space platforms and paves a way for creating multifunctional photonic integrated devices with agile access to free space, which enables a plethora of applications in communications, remote sensing, displays, etc.},

Here, we report that SpyCas9 also recognizes sequences within an N(A/C/T)GG motif. These sequences were identified on the basis of preferential enrichment in a growth-based screen in Escherichia coli . DNA binding, cleavage, and editing assays in bacteria and human cells validated recognition, with activities paralleling those for NAG(A/C/T) PAMs and dependent on the first two PAM positions. Molecular-dynamics simulations and plasmid-clearance assays with mismatch-intolerant variants supported induced-fit recognition of an extended PAM by SpyCas9 rather than recognition of NGG with a bulged R-loop. Last, the editing location for SpyCas9-derived base editors could be shifted by one nucleotide by selecting between (C/T)GG and adjacent N(C/T)GG PAMs. SpyCas9 and its enhanced variants thus recognize a larger repertoire of PAMs, with implications for precise editing, off-target predictions, and CRISPR-based immunity.},

We show that Gadl1 −/− mice are deficient in β-alanine, carnosine, and anserine, particularly in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, and skeletal muscle. Gadl1 −/− mice also exhibited decreased anxiety, increased levels of oxidative stress markers, alterations in energy and lipid metabolism, and age-related changes. Examination of the GADL1 active site indicated that the enzyme may have multiple physiological substrates, including aspartate and cysteine sulfinic acid. Human genetic studies show strong associations of the GADL1 locus with plasma levels of carnosine, subjective well-being, and muscle strength. Together, this shows the multifaceted and organ-specific roles of carnosine peptides and establishes Gadl1 knockout mice as a versatile model to explore carnosine biology and its therapeutic potential.},

Here, we show that the contact time of bouncing droplets on high solid fraction surfaces can be reduced by reducing the texture size to ~100 nm. We demonstrated that the texture size–dependent contact time reduction could be attributed to the dominance of line tension on nanotextures and that compact arrangement of nanotextures is essential to withstand the impact pressure of raindrops. Our findings illustrate a potential survival strategy of insects to rapidly shed impacting raindrops, and suggest a previously unidentified design principle to engineering robust water-repellent materials for applications including miniaturized drones.},

Despite such an intriguing proposal, controlling the unconventional AHE by inducing these cluster multipoles has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that strain can manipulate the hidden Berry curvature effect by inducing the higher-rank cluster multipoles in spin-orbit–coupled antiferromagnets. Observing the large AHE on fully strained antiferromagnetic Nd 2 Ir 2 O 7 thin films, we prove that strain-induced cluster T 1 -octupoles are the only source of observed AHE.

Here, an artificial metalloenzyme, copper cluster firmly anchored in bovine serum albumin conjugated with tumor-targeting peptide, is exquisitely constructed. It is capable of persistently transforming hydrogen peroxide in tumor microenvironment to hydroxyl radical and oxygen in a catalytic manner. The stable catalysis recycling stems from the electron transfer between copper cluster and substrate with well-matched energy levels. Notably, their high biocompatibility, tumor-specific recognition, and persistent catalytic performance ensure the substantial anticancer efficacy by triggering DNA damage. Meanwhile, by coupling with enzyme-like reactions, the operando therapy effect is expediently traced by chemiluminescence signal with high sensitivity and sustainability.

Here, we demonstrate that the high magnetization of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) at ULF makes possible relaxivity- and susceptibility-based effects unachievable with conventional contrast agents (CAs). We leverage these effects to acquire high-contrast images of SPIONs in a rat model with ULF MRI using short scan times.

These fluctuations usually result from internal dynamics, and many studies have linked them to internal climate modes in the North Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Here, we show that variations in volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols have caused in-phase, multidecadal SST variations since 1920 across all ocean basins. These forced variations resemble the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in time. Unlike the North Atlantic, where indirect and direct aerosol effects on surface solar radiation drive the multidecadal SST variations, over the tropical central and western Pacific atmospheric circulation response to aerosol forcing plays an important role, whereas aerosol-induced radiation change is small. Our new finding implies that AMO-like climate variations in Eurasia, North America, and other regions may be partly caused by the aerosol forcing, rather than being originated from the North Atlantic SST variations as previously thought.},

Here, we introduce “cell invasion in digital microfluidic microgel systems” (CIMMS), which bridges the gap between them, allowing the stratification of cells on the basis of their invasiveness into hydrogels for RNA sequencing. In initial studies with a breast cancer model, 244 genes were found to be differentially expressed between invading and noninvading cells, including genes correlating with ECM-remodeling, chemokine/cytokine receptors, and G protein transducers.

Investigating the mechanical properties of glass is challenging because any global deformation that might result in shear rejuvenation would require a prohibitively long relaxation time. Moreover, glass is well known to be heterogeneous, and a global perturbation would prevent exploration of local mechanical/transport properties. However, investigation based on a local probe, i.e., microrheology, may overcome these problems. Here, we establish active microrheology of a bulk metallic glass, via a probe particle driven into host medium glass. This technique is amenable to experimental investigations via nanoindentation tests. We provide distinct evidence of a strong relationship between the microscopic dynamics of the probe particle and the macroscopic properties of the host medium glass. These findings establish active microrheology as a promising technique for investigating the local properties of bulk metallic glass.},

  abstract     = {Originating with the discovery of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) in condensed matter physics, topological order has been receiving increased attention also for classical wave phenomena. Topological protection enables efficient and robust signal transport; mechanical topological insulators (TIs), in particular, are easy to fabricate and exhibit interfacial wave transport with minimal dissipation, even in the presence of sharp edges, defects, or disorder. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a phononic crystal Floquet TI (FTI). Hexagonal arrays of circular piezoelectric disks bonded to a PLA substrate, shunted through negative electrical capacitance, and manipulated by external integrated circuits, provide the required spatiotemporal modulation scheme to break time-reversal symmetry and impart a synthetic angular momentum bias that can induce strong topological protection on the lattice edges. Our proposed reconfigurable FTI may find applications for robust acoustic emitters and mechanical logic circuits, with distinct advantages over electronic equivalents in harsh operating conditions.},

Here, we present a cryo–electron microscopy structure of full-length Ca 2+ -free CALHM1 from Danio rerio at an overall resolution of 3.1 Å. Our structure reveals an octameric architecture with a wide pore diameter of ~20 Å, presumably representing the active conformation. The overall structure is substantially different from that of the isoform CALHM2, which forms both undecameric hemichannels and gap junctions. The N-terminal small helix folds back to the pore and forms an antiparallel interaction with transmembrane helix 1. Structural analysis revealed that the extracellular loop 1 region within the dimer interface may contribute to oligomeric assembly. A positive potential belt inside the pore was identified that may modulate ion permeation. Our structure offers insights into the assembly and gating mechanism of the CALHM1 channel.},

Here we report quantum walks of biphoton frequency combs where the duration of the walk, or circuit depth, is tunable over a continuous range without any change to the physical footprint of the system—a feature absent from previous photonic implementations. In our platform, entangled photon pairs hop between discrete frequency modes with the coupling between these modes mediated by electro-optic modulation of the waveguide refractive index. Through control of the phase across different modes, we demonstrate a rich variety of behavior: from walks exhibiting enhanced ballistic transport or strong energy confinement, to subspaces featuring scattering centers or local traps. We also explore the role of entanglement dimensionality in the creation of energy bound states, which illustrates the potential for these walks to quantify high-dimensional entanglement.},

We address this question by analyzing county-level data between 1960 and 2016. Our estimates suggest that level differences in mortality rates between the poorest and least poor counties decreased meaningfully between 1960 and 2000. Nearly three-quarters of the decrease occurred between 1960 and 1980, coincident with the introduction of antipoverty programs and improvements in medical care for infants. We estimate that declining inequality accounts for 18\% of the national reduction in infant mortality between 1960 and 2000. However, we also find that level differences between the poorest and least poor counties remained constant between 2000 and 2016, suggesting an important role for policies that improve the health of infants in poor areas.},

Leveraging 16 years of data—68.5 million Medicare enrollees—we provide strong evidence of the causal link between long-term PM 2.5 exposure and mortality under a set of causal inference assumptions. Using five distinct approaches, we found that a decrease in PM 2.5 (by 10 micrograms per cubic meter) leads to a statistically significant 6 to 7\% decrease in mortality risk. Based on these models, lowering the air quality standard to 10 micrograms per cubic meter would save 143, 257 lives (95\% confidence interval, 115, 581 to 170, 645) in one decade.

Is belonging relevant to students’ persistence—even when they form the numerical majority, as at many broad-access institutions? We evaluated a randomized intervention aimed at bolstering first-year students’ sense of belonging at a broad-access university ( N = 1, 063). The intervention increased the likelihood that racial-ethnic minority and first-generation students maintained continuous enrollment over the next two academic years relative to multiple control groups. This two-year gain in persistence was mediated by greater feelings of social and academic fit one-year post-intervention.

We report that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) plays a critical role in survival of CD4 + T cells that undergo HIV-1 reactivation from latency or de novo infection. PLK1 is elevated in both scenarios, which requires HIV-1 Nef. HIV-1 enhances PLK1 SUMOylation, causing its nuclear translocation and protein stabilization. Inhibition or knockdown of PLK1 markedly facilitates death of HIV-1-infected CD4 + T cells. Furthermore, PLK1 inhibitors strikingly reduce the size of HIV-1 latent reservoirs in primary CD4 + T cells. Our findings demonstrate that HIV-1 infection hijacks PLK1 to prevent cell death induced by viral cytopathic effects, and that PLK1 is a promising target for chemical “killing” of HIV-1 reservoir cells.},

Our A3G-BEs could install a single disease-associated C-to-T substitution with high precision.

The transcriptional mechanisms governing this pluripotent ground state are unresolved. Release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol2) is a multistep process necessary for pluripotency and cell cycle gene transcription in SL. We show that β-catenin, stabilized by GSK3 inhibition in medium with 2i, supplies transcriptional coregulators at pluripotency loci. This selectively strengthens pluripotency loci and renders them addicted to transcription initiation for productive gene body elongation in detriment to Pol2 pause release. By contrast, cell cycle genes are not bound by β-catenin, and proliferation/self-renewal remains tightly controlled by Pol2 pause release under 2i conditions.

  abstract     = {Forecasting fields of oceanic phenomena has long been dependent on physical equation–based numerical models. The challenge is that many natural processes need to be considered for understanding complicated phenomena. In contrast, rules of the processes are already embedded in the time-series observation itself. Thus, inspired by largely available satellite remote sensing data and the advance of deep learning technology, we developed a purely satellite data–driven deep learning model for forecasting the sea surface temperature evolution associated with a typical phenomenon: a tropical instability wave. During the testing period of 9 years (2010–2019), our model accurately and efficiently forecasts the sea surface temperature field. This study demonstrates the strong potential of the satellite data–driven deep learning model as an alternative to traditional numerical models for forecasting oceanic phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Precipitation extremes will likely intensify under climate change. However, much uncertainty surrounds intensification of high-magnitude events that are often inadequately resolved by global climate models. In this analysis, we develop a framework involving targeted dynamical downscaling of historical and future extreme precipitation events produced by a large ensemble of a global climate model. This framework is applied to extreme “atmospheric river” storms in California. We find a substantial (10 to 40\%) increase in total accumulated precipitation, with the largest relative increases in valleys and mountain lee-side areas. We also report even higher and more spatially uniform increases in hourly maximum precipitation intensity, which exceed Clausius-Clapeyron expectations. Up to 85\% of this increase arises from thermodynamically driven increases in water vapor, with a smaller contribution by increased zonal wind strength. These findings imply substantial challenges for water and flood management in California, given future increases in intense atmospheric river-induced precipitation extremes.},

Associated with each crossing point (or Weyl node) is a topological invariant known as the Berry monopole charge. The circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE), whereby circular polarized light generates a helicity-dependent photocurrent, is a notable example of a macroscopic property that emerges directly from the topology of the Weyl semimetal band structure. Recently, it was predicted that the amplitude of the CPGE associated with optical transitions near a Weyl node is proportional to its monopole charge. In chiral Weyl systems, nodes of opposite charge are nondegenerate, opening a window of wavelengths where the CPGE resulting from uncompensated Berry charge can emerge. Here, we report measurements of CPGE in the chiral Weyl semimetal RhSi, revealing a CPGE response in an energy window that closes at 0.65 eV, in agreement with the predictions of density functional theory.},

The number of rare protist species in these communities, as estimated in metagenomic studies, decays as a steep power law of their abundance. The ecological factors at the origin of this pattern remain elusive. We propose that chaotic advection by oceanic currents affects biodiversity patterns of rare species. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a spatially explicit coalescence model that reconstructs the species diversity of a sample of water. Our model predicts, in the presence of chaotic advection, a steeper power law decay of the species abundance distribution and a steeper increase of the number of observed species with sample size. A comparison of metagenomic studies of planktonic protist communities in oceans and in lakes quantitatively confirms our prediction. Our results support that oceanic currents positively affect the diversity of rare aquatic microbes.},

Existing research tends to look at the effect of easily measurable student characteristics. However, a vast number of harder-to-measure student traits, skills, and resources affect educational success. We present a conceptual framework for the cumulative effect of all factors, which we call student capital. We develop a method for estimating student capital in groups of students and find that student capital is distributed exponentially in each of 140 cohorts of community college students. Students’ ability to be successful does not behave like standard tests of intelligence. Instead, it acts like a limited resource, distributed unequally. The results suggest that rather than removing barriers related to easily measured characteristics, interventions should be focused on building up the skills and resources needed to be successful in school.},

Depletion of ARID1A in human NGP neuroblastoma cells promoted the adrenergic-to-mesenchymal transition with changes in enhancer-mediated gene expression due to alterations in the genomic occupancies of distinct SWI/SNF assemblies, BAF and PBAF. Our findings indicate that ARID1A is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma, whose depletion enhances tumor development and promotes the emergence of the more drug-resistant mesenchymal cell state.},

These challenges highlight the need for causal tests of hippocampal function in nonhuman primate models. Here, we tested rhesus monkeys on a battery of cognitive tasks including transitive inference, temporal order memory, shape recall, source memory, and image recognition. Contrary to predictions, we observed no robust impairments in memory or relational cognition either within- or between-groups following hippocampal damage. These results caution against over-generalizing from human correlational studies or rodent experimental studies, compel a new generation of nonhuman primate studies, and indicate that we should reassess the relative contributions of the hippocampus proper compared to other regions in visual memory and relational cognition.},

Studies included in their analysis reporting matched tumor and blood concentration versus time data were evaluated using classical PK endpoints and compared to the unestablished percent injected dose (\%ID) in tumor metric from the Wilhelm et al . study. The\%ID in tumor was poorly correlated with standard PK metrics that describe NP tumor delivery (AUC tumor /AUC blood ratio) and only moderately associated with maximal tumor concentration. The relative tumor delivery of NPs was ~100-fold greater as assessed by the standard AUC tumor /AUC blood ratio than by\%ID in tumor. These results strongly suggest that PK metrics and calculations can influence the interpretation of NP tumor delivery and stress the need to properly validate novel PK metrics against traditional approaches.},

The presence of nanoparticles in metastases was monitored and quantified with MRI and was noticed up to 1 week after their administration.

Two main explanations have been proposed. The first attributes the N:P variability to changes in the community composition of well-adapted phytoplankton. The second proposes that variability arises from physiological acclimation involving intracellular adjustments of nutrient allocation under nutrient deficiency. Using a model of phytoplankton physiology, observational datasets, and a review of laboratory culture results, we assess the mechanistic basis of N:P variability. We find that the taxonomic composition of well-adapted phytoplankton best explains observed variations in POM N:P. Furthermore, we show that acclimation to nutrient deficiency may be safely neglected when considering the effects of ecology on POM N:P. These findings provide insight into the controls on global variability in POM composition and average phytoplankton physiological performance in the oceans.},

This decline is 21 ± 5\% larger than that from 2015 to 2019.

  abstract     = {Marine protists are integral to the structure and function of pelagic ecosystems and marine carbon cycling, with rhizarian biomass alone accounting for more than half of all mesozooplankton in the oligotrophic oceans. Yet, understanding how their environment shapes diversity within species and across taxa is limited by a paucity of observations of heritability and life history. Here, we present observations of asexual reproduction, morphologic plasticity, and ontogeny in the planktic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma in laboratory culture. Our results demonstrate that planktic foraminifera reproduce both sexually and asexually and demonstrate extensive phenotypic plasticity in response to nonheritable factors. These two processes fundamentally explain the rapid spatial and temporal response of even imperceptibly low populations of planktic foraminifera to optimal conditions and the diversity and ubiquity of these species across the range of environmental conditions that occur in the ocean.},

Pharmaceutical repurposing, an effective drug development technique using existing drugs, could shorten development time and reduce costs compared to those of de novo drug discovery. We carried out virtual screening of antiviral compounds targeting the spike glycoprotein (S), main protease (M pro ), and the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD)–angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) complex of SARS-CoV-2. PC786, an antiviral polymerase inhibitor, showed enhanced binding affinity to all the targets. Furthermore, the postfusion conformation of the trimeric S protein RBD with ACE2 revealed conformational changes associated with PC786 drug binding.

Here, we support Pd catalysts on a thermochemically stable but “soft” engineering plastic, polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), for acetylene partial hydrogenation. Near the glass transition temperature (~353 K), the mobile PPS chains cover the entire surface of Pd particles via strong metal-polymer interactions. The Pd-PPS interface enables H 2 activation only in the presence of acetylene that has a strong binding affinity to Pd and thus can disturb the Pd-PPS interface. Once acetylene is hydrogenated to weakly binding ethylene, re-adsorption of PPS on the Pd surface repels ethylene before it is further hydrogenated to ethane. The Pd-PPS interaction enables selective partial hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene even in an ethylene-rich stream and suppresses catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. The results manifest the unique possibility of harnessing dynamic metal-polymer interaction for designing chemoselective and long-lived catalysts.},

A numerical multiphysics model was developed to examine microparticle flow and needle blockage in a syringe-needle system. Using experimental data, a simple empirical mathematical model was introduced. Results from injection experiments were subsequently incorporated into an artificial neural network to establish a predictive framework for injectability. Last, simulations and experimental results contributed to the design of a syringe that maximizes injectability in vitro and in vivo. The custom injection system enabled a sixfold increase in injectability of large microparticles compared to a commercial syringe.

This study presents a wearable full-color OLED display using a two-dimensional (2D) material-based backplane transistor. The 18-by-18 thin-film transistor array was fabricated on a thin MoS 2 film that was transferred to Al 2 O 3 (30 nm)/polyethylene terephthalate (6 μm). Red, green, and blue OLED pixels were deposited on the device surface.

Here, we present a unique one-step vapor-phase process, termed sulfur chemical vapor deposition, to generate highly stable, ultrahigh refractive index ( n &gt; 1.9) polymers directly from elemental sulfur. The deposition process involved vapor-phase radical polymerization between elemental sulfur and vinyl monomers to provide polymer films with controlled thickness and sulfur content, along with the refractive index as high as 1.91. Notably, the HRIP thin film showed unprecedented optical transparency throughout the visible range, attributed to the absence of long polysulfide segments within the polymer, which will serve as a key component in a wide range of optical devices.},

The infrared excitation spectra of the molecules are thereby gathered in this electronic device, enabling the identification of chemical species with high sensitivity. Our realistic theoretical calculations demonstrate the superiority of this technique for molecular sensing, capable of performing spectral identification at the zeptomol level within a microscopic all-electrical device.},

Here, we report an original phenomenon occurring at the tip of asymmetric (half-flat, half-curved) pillars: Droplets reconfigure and get oriented on the curved side of these Janus tips. This local, geometry-driven effect, namely, tip-induced flipping of droplets, is found to be generic and have spectacular global consequences: Vast assemblies of Janus pillars enable a continuous, long-range, and fast self-transport of water harvested from fogs, which makes it possible to collect and concentrate droplets at different scales.},

Only incompetent helpers of a strain familiar to the helper rat exerted a detrimental effect on helping; rats helped at near control levels in the presence of incompetent helpers from an unfamiliar strain. Duos and trios of potential helper rats helped at superadditive rates, demonstrating that rats act nonindependently with helping facilitated by the presence of competent-to-help bystanders. Furthermore, helping was facilitated in rats that had previously observed other rats’ helping and were then tested individually.

They are in excellent agreement with the simulations of a kinematic model accounting for stochastic and microhydrodynamic properties and, in particular, the flagella chirality. Theoretical analysis reveals the scaling laws behind the average rheotactic velocity at moderate shear rates using a chirality parameter and explains the reorientation dynamics leading to saturation at large shear rates from the marginal stability of a fixed point.

Further, we show that FAST readily achieves FRL-induced editing of internal organs in tdTomato reporter mice. Finally, FAST was demonstrated to achieve FRL-triggered editing of the PLK1 oncogene in a mouse xenograft tumor model. Beyond extending the spectrum of light energies in optogenetic toolbox for CRISPR-Cas9 technologies, this study demonstrates how FAST system can be deployed for programmable deep tissue gene editing in both biological and biomedical contexts toward high precision and spatial specificity.},

By testing the theory against experiments on soap bubbles, we find quantitative agreement with the analytical predictions of the nucleation and the early coarsening phases associated with the patterns.

While tectonic plate motions provide evidence for this relation, the mechanism by which mantle processes influence near-surface tectonics remains elusive. Here, we present an azimuthal anisotropy model for the Pacific Northwest crust that strongly correlates with high-velocity structures in the underlying mantle but shows no association with the regional mantle flow field. We suggest that the crustal anisotropy is decoupled from horizontal basal tractions and, instead, created by upper mantle vertical loading, which generates pressure gradients that drive channelized flow in the mid-lower crust. We then demonstrate the interplay between mantle heterogeneities and lithosphere dynamics by predicting the viscous crustal flow that is driven by local buoyancy sources within the upper mantle. Our findings reveal how mantle vertical load distribution can actively control crustal deformation on a scale of several hundred kilometers.},

  abstract     = {The eastern oyster ( Crassostrea virginica ) is an important proxy for examining historical trajectories of coastal ecosystems. Measurement of ~40, 000 oyster shells from archaeological sites along the Atlantic Coast of the United States provides a long-term record of oyster abundance and size. The data demonstrate increases in oyster size across time and a nonrandom pattern in their distributions across sites. We attribute this variation to processes related to Native American fishing rights and environmental variability. Mean oyster length is correlated with total oyster bed length within foraging radii (5 and 10 km) as mapped in 1889 and 1890. These data demonstrate the stability of oyster reefs despite different population densities and environmental shifts and have implications for oyster reef restoration in an age of global climate change.},

  abstract     = {The biological utilization of dissolved silicon (DSi) influences ocean ecology and biogeochemistry. In the deep sea, hexactinellid sponges are major DSi consumers that remain poorly understood. Their DSi consumption departs from the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of shallow-water demosponges and appears particularly maladapted to incorporating DSi from the modest concentrations typical of the modern ocean. Why did sponges not adapt to the shrinking DSi availability that followed diatom expansion some 100 to 65 million years ago? We propose that sponges incorporate DSi combining passive (aquaglyceroporins) and active (ArsB) transporters, while only active transporters (SITs) operate in diatoms and choanoflagellates. Evolution of greater silicon transport efficiency appears constrained by the additional role of aquaglyceroporins in transporting essential metalloids other than silicon. We discuss the possibility that lower energy costs may have driven replacement of ancestral SITs by less efficient aquaglyceroporins, and discuss the functional implications of conservation of aquaglyceroporin-mediated DSi utilization in vertebrates.},

However, the timing and temporal link of these events remain uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that the low thermal conductivity of the lunar crust combined with heat extraction by partial melting of deep cumulates undergoing convection results in an LMO solidification time scale of 150 to 200 million years. Combining this result with a crystallization model of the LMO and with the ages and isotopic compositions of lunar samples indicates that the Moon formed 4.425 ± 0.025 billion years ago. This age is in remarkable agreement with the U-Pb age of Earth, demonstrating that the U-Pb age dates the final segregation of Earth’s core.},

However, there are long-existing challenges to achieving dynamic meta-holography in the visible range, such as low frame rate and low frame number. In this work, we demonstrate a design of meta-holography that can achieve 2 28 different holographic frames and an extremely high frame rate (9523 frames per second) in the visible range. The design is based on a space channel metasurface and a high-speed dynamic structured laser beam modulation module. The space channel consists of silicon nitride nanopillars with a high modulation efficiency. This method can satisfy the needs of a holographic display and be useful in other applications, such as laser fabrication, optical storage, optics communications, and information processing.},

Here, we demonstrate that the interaction of TIP60 with DNA-PKcs is attenuated specifically in S phase, which facilitates HR pathway activation. SUMO2 modification of TIP60 K430 mediated by PISA4 E3 ligase blocks its interaction with DNA-PKcs, whereas TIP60 K430R mutation recovers its interaction with DNA-PKcs, which results in abnormally increased phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs S2056 in S phase and marked inhibition of HR efficiency, but barely affects NHEJ activity. TIP60 K430R mutant cancer cells are more sensitive to radiation and PARP inhibitors in cancer cell killing and tumor growth inhibition.

Here, we describe an unprecedented “ester dance” reaction: a predictable translocation of an ester group from one carbon atom to another on an aromatic ring. Specifically, a phenyl carboxylate substituent can be shifted from one carbon to an adjacent carbon on a (hetero) aromatic ring under palladium catalysis to often give a thermodynamically favored, regioisomeric product with modest to good conversions. The obtained ester moiety can be further converted to various aromatic derivatives through the use of classic and state-of-the-art transformations including amidation, acylations, and decarbonylative couplings.},

In this context, a single integrated microneedle patch (IMP) with multiple release kinetics is demonstrated to provide better physiologic insulin coverage for postprandial glycemic excursion in a convenient and pain-free manner. The combination of rapid separating technique and multiple individual microneedle arrays provides the combined ability to efficiently deliver insulin into the skin within seconds and to independently control insulin release kinetics. In addition, the diabetic rats with a traditional breakfast-lunch-dinner lifestyle exhibit obvious intraday glucose fluctuations, while the hypoglycemic experiments indicate that the IMP is capable of simultaneous bolus and sustained insulin delivery to closely match the glucose rise that occurs in response to meals and efficiently minimize excessive fluctuations, suggesting the potential of this new transdermal insulin delivery system as substitutes for multiple daily injections.},

In the wild type, Cx36 plaques at rod/cone contacts accounted for more than 95\% of photoreceptor labeling and paired recordings showed the transjunctional conductance between rods and cones was ~300 pS. When Cx36 was eliminated on one side of the gap junction, in either conditional knockout, Cx36 labeling and rod/cone coupling were almost abolished. We could not detect direct rod/rod coupling, and cone/cone coupling was minor.

Proteins, lipids, and sugars converge in composition during fossilization through lipoxidation and glycoxidation to form endogenous N-, O-, and S-heterocyclic polymers. Nonetheless, multivariate spectral analysis reveals molecular heterogeneities: The relative abundance of glycoxidation and lipoxidation products distinguishes different tissue types. Preserved chelating ligands are diagnostic of different modes of biomineralization.

Inspired by processes encountered in nature, where insects and animals often rely on strain and temperature to alter the optical appearance of dispersed liquid crystalline elements, chiral droplets are dispersed in polymer films and deformation induced by uniaxial or biaxial stretching.

Animals bearing human MDSC-containing solid tumor xenografts received treatment with MDSC-targeting human natural killer (NK) cells and underwent nanoparticle contrast–enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging. Whereas conventional CT-derived tumor metrics were unable to differentiate NK cell immunotherapy tumors from untreated tumors, nano-radiomics revealed texture-based features capable of differentiating treatment groups.

However, the mechanisms regulating MRE11 functions at reversed forks are currently unclear. Here, we identify the MRE11-binding protein MRNIP as a novel fork protection factor that directly binds to MRE11 and specifically represses its exonuclease activity. The loss of MRNIP results in impaired replication fork progression, MRE11 exonuclease–dependent degradation of reversed forks, persistence of underreplicated genomic regions, chemosensitivity, and chromosome instability.

Among epithelial cells enriched in IPF, we identify a previously unidentified population of aberrant basaloid cells that coexpress basal epithelial, mesenchymal, senescence, and developmental markers and are located at the edge of myofibroblast foci in the IPF lung. Among vascular endothelial cells, we identify an ectopically expanded cell population transcriptomically identical to bronchial restricted vascular endothelial cells in IPF. We confirm the presence of both populations by immunohistochemistry and independent datasets. Among stromal cells, we identify IPF myofibroblasts and invasive fibroblasts with partially overlapping cells in control and COPD lungs. Last, we confirm previous findings of profibrotic macrophage populations in the IPF lung. Our comprehensive catalog reveals the complexity and diversity of aberrant cellular populations in IPF.},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a form of chronic lung disease characterized by pathologic epithelial remodeling and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). To comprehensively define the cell types, mechanisms, and mediators driving fibrotic remodeling in lungs with PF, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of single-cell suspensions from 10 nonfibrotic control and 20 PF lungs. Analysis of 114, 396 cells identified 31 distinct cell subsets/states. We report that a remarkable shift in epithelial cell phenotypes occurs in the peripheral lung in PF and identify several previously unrecognized epithelial cell phenotypes, including a KRT5 − / KRT17 + pathologic, ECM-producing epithelial cell population that was highly enriched in PF lungs. Multiple fibroblast subtypes were observed to contribute to ECM expansion in a spatially discrete manner. Together, these data provide high-resolution insights into the complexity and plasticity of the distal lung epithelium in human disease and indicate a diversity of epithelial and mesenchymal cells contribute to pathologic lung fibrosis.},

In this study, we designed 1D fiber-shaped multi-synapses comprising ferroelectric organic transistors fabricated on a 100-μm Ag wire and used them as multisynaptic channels in an e-textile neural network for wearable neuromorphic applications. The device mimics diverse synaptic functions with excellent reliability even under 6000 repeated input stimuli and mechanical bending stress. Various NOR-type textile arrays are formed simply by cross-pointing 1D synapses with Ag wires, where each output from individual synapse can be integrated and propagated without undesired leakage. Notably, the 1D multi-synapses achieved up to ~90 and ~70\% recognition accuracy for MNIST and electrocardiogram patterns, respectively, even in a single-layer neural network, and almost maintained regardless of the bending conditions.},

Yet, both samples exhibit pronounced transient expansion upon laser heating in femtosecond x-ray diffraction experiments. We show that the granular microstructure is essential to support the contractive out-of-plane stresses originating from in-plane expansion via the Poisson effect that add to the uniaxial contractive stress driven by spin disorder. We prove the spin contribution by saturating the magnetic excitations with a first laser pulse and then detecting the purely expansive response to a second pulse. The contractive spin stress is reestablished on the same 100-ps time scale that we observe for the recovery of the ferromagnetic order. Finite-element modeling of the mechanical response of FePt nanosystems confirms the morphology dependence of the dynamics.},

They are part of a 30- to 40-million year younger age-progressive hotspot track with St. Helena HIMU (high time-integrated 238 U/ 204 Pb) composition, which is also observed at the EMI-type Shona hotspot track in the southernmost Atlantic. Whereas the primary EMI-type hotspots overlie the margin of the African LLSVP, the HIMU-type hotspots are located above a central portion of the African LLSVP, reflecting a large-scale geochemical zonation. We propose that extraction of large volumes of EMI-type mantle from the margin of the LLSVP by primary plume heads triggered upwelling of HIMU material from a more internal domain of the LLSVP, forming secondary plumes.},

Inflammation is associated with numerous fibrotic pathogeneses; however, its role in the multifaceted mechanisms of fibrosis remains unclear. IL-13 is implicated in aberrant responses involved in fibrotic disease, and we aimed to understand its role in the inflammatory processes of a common fibrotic disorder, Dupuytren’s disease. We demonstrated T-cells produced IFN-g, which induced IL-13 secretion from mast cells and up-regulated IL-13Ra1 on fibroblasts, rendering them more reactive to IL-13. Consequently, diseased myofibroblasts demonstrated enhanced fibroproliferative effects upon IL-13 stimulation. We established IFN-g and IL-13 responses involved STAT dependent pathways, and STAT targeting (tofacitinib) could inhibit IL-13 production from mast cells, IL-13Ra1 up-regulation in fibroblasts and fibroproliferative effects of IL-13 on diseased myofibroblasts. Accordingly, utilizing Dupuytren’s as an accessible human model of fibrosis, we propose targeting STAT pathways may offer previously unidentified therapeutic approaches in the management of fibrotic disease.},

However, recent decades have shown only limited progress in discovering novel extracellular matrix–protein–derived ligands for translational applications. Through motif analysis of evolutionarily conserved RGD-containing regions in laminin (LM) and peptide-functionalized hydrogel microarray screening, we identified a peptide (a1) that showed superior supports for endothelial cell (EC) functions. Mechanistic studies attributed the results to the capacity of a1 engaging both LM- and Fn-binding integrins. RNA sequencing of ECs in a1-functionalized hydrogels showed ~60\% similarities with Matrigel in “vasculature development” gene ontology terms. Vasculogenesis assays revealed the capacity of a1-formulated hydrogels to improve EC network formation. Injectable alginates functionalized with a1 and MMPQK (a vascular endothelial growth factor–mimetic peptide with a matrix metalloproteinase–degradable linker) increased blood perfusion and functional recovery over decellularized extracellular matrix and (RGDS + MMPQK)–functionalized hydrogels in an ischemic hindlimb model, illustrating the power of this approach.},

  abstract     = {Twinning is a critically important deformation mode in hexagonal close-packed metals. Twins are three-dimensional (3D) domains, whose growth is mediated by the motion of facets bounding the 3D twin domains and influences work hardening in metals. An understanding of twin transformations therefore necessitates that the atomic-scale structure and intrinsic mobilities of facets be known and characterized. The present work addresses the former point by systematically characterizing the boundary structures of 3D { 1 ¯ 012 } twins in magnesium using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Eight characteristic facets associated with twin boundaries are reported, five of which have never been experimentally observed before. Further, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the formation and motion of these facets is associated with the accumulation of twinning dislocations. This work provides insights into understanding the structural character of 3D twins and serves to develop strategies for modulating twin kinetics by modifying twin boundaries, such as solute segregation.},

Using flight initiation distance (FID) methods within a personality paradigm, the behavioral responses of baboons suggested that observers were not perceived as neutral but instead viewed as a high-ranking social threat. Habituation was also not equal across group members, with repeatable individual differences more important than contextual factors (e.g., habitat) in determining the distance at which baboons visually oriented or displaced from observers. A strong correlation between individual visual tolerance and displacement tolerance (i.e., convergent validity) indicated a personality trait. We offer several suggestions for how to account for these factors and minimize potential bias in future studies.},

Here, we systematically explored the nanomechanical properties of a range of Gram-negative bacteria ( Salmonella , Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Klebsiella pneumoniae ) with different degrees of β-lactam resistance. Our observations indicated that the BLR bacteria had cell stiffness values almost 10× lower than that of β-lactam–susceptible bacteria, caused by reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis. With the aid of numerical modeling and experimental measurements, we demonstrated that these stiffness findings can be used to develop programmable, stiffness-mediated antimicrobial nanowires that mechanically penetrate the BLR bacterial cell envelope. We anticipate that these stiffness-related findings will aid in the discovery and development of novel treatment strategies for BLR Gram-negative bacterial infections.},

We show evidence of strong purifying selection around the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the spike and other genes among bat, pangolin, and human coronaviruses, suggesting similar evolutionary constraints in different host species. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2’s entire RBM was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins, possibly a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2’s ability to infect humans. Similar purifying selection in different host species, together with frequent recombination among coronaviruses, suggests a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses.},

  abstract     = {Laser technology has developed and accelerated photo-induced nonequilibrium physics, from both the scientific and engineering viewpoints. Floquet engineering, i.e., controlling material properties and functionalities by time-periodic drives, is at the forefront of quantum physics of light-matter interaction. However, it is limited to ideal dissipationless systems. Extending Floquet engineering to various materials requires understanding of the quantum states emerging in a balance of the periodic drive and energy dissipation. Here, we derive a general description for nonequilibrium steady states (NESSs) in periodically driven dissipative systems by focusing on systems under high-frequency drive and time-independent Lindblad-type dissipation. Our formula correctly describes the time average, fluctuation, and symmetry properties of the NESS, and can be computed efficiently in numerical calculations. This approach will play fundamental roles in Floquet engineering in a broad class of dissipative quantum systems from atoms and molecules to mesoscopic systems, and condensed matter.},

These RESs consist of UNC-7 innexin in AVA and UNC-9 innexin in A-MNs. UNC-7 has multiple isoforms differing in the length and sequence of the amino terminus. In a heterologous expression system, only one UNC-7 isoform, UNC-7b, can form heterotypic gap junctions (GJs) with UNC-9 that strongly favor I j in the UNC-9 to UNC-7 direction. Knockout of unc-7b alone almost eliminated the I j , whereas AVA-specific expression of UNC-7b substantially rescued the coupling defect of unc-7 mutant. Neutralizing charged residues in UNC-7b amino terminus abolished the rectification property of UNC-7b/UNC-9 GJs. Our results suggest that the rectification property results from electrostatic interactions between charged residues in UNC-7b amino terminus.},

However, state-of-the-art ECRAMs have not yet demonstrated stable and efficient operation at temperatures required for packaged electronic devices (~90°C).

These ECRAMs show linear resistance tuning over a &gt;2× dynamic range, 20-nanosecond switching, submicrosecond write-read cycling, low noise, and low-voltage (±1 volt) and low-energy (~80 femtojoules per write) operation combined with excellent endurance (&gt;10 9 write-read operations at 90°C).

A controllable source of this sound is realized through joule heating of thin, conductive films by an alternating current. Here, we show that arrays of these sources generate sound unique to this mechanism. From the sound alone, we spatially resolve current flow by varying the film geometry and electrical phase. Confinement concentrates heat to such a degree that the film properties become largely irrelevant. Electrical coupling between sources creates its own distinctive sound that depends on the current flow direction, making it unusually sensitive to the interactions of multiple currents sharing the same space. By controlling the flow, a full phased array can be created from just a single film.},

This inhibition is thought to be the result of zinc diffusion across the synaptic cleft and subsequent binding to the extracellular domain of the NMDAR. However, this model fails to incorporate the observed association of the highly zinc-sensitive NMDAR subunit GluN2A with the postsynaptic zinc transporter ZnT1, which moves intracellular zinc to the extracellular space. Here, we report that disruption of ZnT1-GluN2A association by a cell-permeant peptide strongly reduced NMDAR inhibition by synaptic zinc in mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus synapses. Moreover, synaptic zinc inhibition of NMDARs required postsynaptic intracellular zinc, suggesting that cytoplasmic zinc is transported by ZnT1 to the extracellular space in close proximity to the NMDAR. These results challenge a decades-old dogma on how zinc inhibits synaptic NMDARs and demonstrate that presynaptic release and a postsynaptic transporter organize zinc into distinct microdomains to modulate NMDAR neurotransmission.},

From remarkable textural, mineralogical, chemical, and thermodynamic similarities, we show that the high-temperature Kudryavy volcano fumarolic environment from Kurile Islands is a likely proxy of the Fe-alkali-halogen metasomatism on the CV and CO carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies. Ca-Fe–rich and Na-Al-Cl–rich secondary silicates in CV and CO chondrites are, thus, inferred to be fumarolic-like incrustations that precipitate from hot and reduced hydrothermal vapors after interactions with the wallrocks during buoyancy-driven Darcy flow percolation. These vapors may originate from the progressive heating and devolatilization of a chondritic protolith on their parent body or are remnant of the cooling of residual local nebular gases at the time of their primary planetesimal accretion.},

This originates from the thin-film assembly of cellulose fibers in the cells of the septum that induce thin-film interference–like colors at the microscale, thus accounting for the structure’s overall silvery-white reflectance at the macroscale. These cells further assemble into two thin layers, resulting in a mechanically robust, iridescent septum, which is also significantly light due to its high air porosity (&gt;70\%) arising from the cells’ hollow-core structure.

Deletion of calpain-2 or treatment with a selective calpain-2 inhibitor for 2 weeks prevented most of these neuropathological features. Changes in TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) subcellular localization similar to those found in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia were also prevented by deletion of calpain-2 or treatment with calpain-2 inhibitor.

Midbrain dopamine neurons are known to reinforce economic choices through their signal evoked by outcomes after decisions are made. However, although critical internal processing is executed while decisions are being made, little is known about the role of dopamine neurons during this period. We found that dopamine neurons exhibited dynamically changing signals related to the internal processing while rhesus monkeys were making decisions. These neurons encoded the value of an option immediately after it was offered and then gradually changed their activity to represent the animal’s upcoming choice. Similar dynamics were observed in the orbitofrontal cortex, a center for economic decision-making, but the value-to-choice signal transition was completed earlier in dopamine neurons. Our findings suggest that dopamine neurons are a key component of the neural network that makes choices from values during ongoing decision-making processes.},

  abstract     = {Chronic inflammatory gastric reflux alters the esophageal microenvironment and induces metaplastic transformation of the epithelium, a precancerous condition termed Barrett’s esophagus (BE). The microenvironmental niche, which includes the extracellular matrix (ECM), substantially influences cell phenotype. ECM harvested from normal porcine esophageal mucosa (eECM) was formulated as a mucoadhesive hydrogel, and shown to largely retain basement membrane and matrix-cell adhesion proteins. Dogs with BE were treated orally with eECM hydrogel and omeprazole ( n = 6) or omeprazole alone ( n = 2) for 30 days. eECM treatment resolved esophagitis, reverted metaplasia to a normal, squamous epithelium in four of six animals, and downregulated the pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor–α + cell infiltrate compared to control animals. The metaplastic tissue in control animals ( n = 2) did not regress. The results suggest that in vivo alteration of the microenvironment with a site-appropriate, mucoadhesive ECM hydrogel can mitigate the inflammatory and metaplastic response in a dog model of BE.},

Leaf strategies aboveground span an economic spectrum from “live fast and die young” to “slow and steady, ” but the economy defined by root strategies belowground remains unclear. Here, we take a holistic view of the belowground economy and show that root-mycorrhizal collaboration can short circuit a one-dimensional economic spectrum, providing an entire space of economic possibilities. Root trait data from 1810 species across the globe confirm a classical fast-slow “conservation” gradient but show that most variation is explained by an orthogonal “collaboration” gradient, ranging from “do-it-yourself” resource uptake to “outsourcing” of resource uptake to mycorrhizal fungi. This broadened “root economics space” provides a solid foundation for predictive understanding of belowground responses to changing environmental conditions.},

It has been shown that excessive inhibition of CN is a critical factor for Down syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we determined RCAN1’s mode of action. Using a combination of structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies, we show that RCAN1 inhibits CN via multiple routes: first, by blocking essential substrate recruitment sites and, second, by blocking the CN active site using two distinct mechanisms. We also show that phosphorylation either inhibits RCAN1-CN assembly or converts RCAN1 into a weak inhibitor, which can be reversed by CN via dephosphorylation. This highlights the interplay between posttranslational modifications in regulating CN activity. Last, this work advances our understanding of how active site inhibition of CN can be achieved in a highly specific manner. Together, these data provide the necessary road map for targeting multiple neurological disorders.},

Enrichment of spin-zero isotopes in silicon markedly improves the dephasing time T 2 * , which, unexpectedly, can extend two orders of magnitude beyond theoretical expectations. Using a single-atom 31 P qubit in enriched 28 Si, we show that the abnormally long T 2 * is due to the freezing of the dynamics of the residual 29 Si nuclei, caused by the electron-nuclear hyperfine interaction. Inserting a waiting period when the electron is controllably removed unfreezes the nuclear dynamics and restores the ergodic T 2 * value. Our conclusions are supported by a nearly parameter-free modeling of the 29 Si nuclear spin dynamics, which reveals the degree of backaction provided by the electron spin. This study clarifies the limits of ergodic assumptions in nuclear bath dynamics and provides previously unidentified strategies for maximizing coherence and gate fidelity of spin qubits in semiconductors.},

However, mRNA’s short cytoplasmic half-life limits its utility to therapeutic applications amenable to repeated dosing or short-term overexpression. Here, we describe a biomaterial that enables a durable in vivo response to a single mRNA dose via an “overexpress and sequester” mechanism, whereby mRNA-transfected cells locally overexpress a growth factor that is then sequestered within the biomaterial to sustain the biologic response over time. In a murine diabetic wound model, this strategy demonstrated improved wound healing compared to delivery of a single mRNA dose alone or recombinant protein. In addition, codelivery of anti-inflammatory proteins using this biomaterial eliminated the need for mRNA chemical modification for in vivo therapeutic efficacy. The results support an approach that may be broadly applicable for single-dose delivery of mRNA without chemical modification.},

Mutational patterns further supported most reassignments. For instance, cell lines identified as originating from the skin often exhibited a UV mutational signature. We cataloged 366 “golden set” cell lines in which transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles strongly resemble the cancer type of origin, further proposing their assignments to subtypes.

NEAT1_2 is required for assembly of paraspeckles (PS), nuclear bodies that protect cancer cells from oncogene-induced replication stress and chemotherapy. Searching for proteins that modulate this event, we identified factors involved in the 3′ end processing of polyadenylated RNA and components of the Integrator complex. Perturbation experiments established that, by promoting the cleavage of NEAT1_2 , Integrator forces NEAT1_2 to NEAT1_1 isoform switching and, thereby, restrains PS assembly. Consistently, low levels of Integrator subunits correlated with poorer prognosis of cancer patients exposed to chemotherapeutics.

Depleting endogenous H 2 S either by hypoxia or by inhibiting CBS via chemical or genetic means reduces persulfidation of PHD2 and inhibits activity, preventing hydroxylation of HIF-1α, resulting in stabilization. Our in vitro findings are further supported by the depletion of CBS in the zebrafish model that exhibits axis defects and abnormal intersegmental vessels. Exogenous H 2 S supplementation rescues both in vitro and in vivo phenotypes. We have identified the persulfidated residues and defined their functional significance in regulating the activity of PHD2 via point mutations. Thus, the CBS/H 2 S/PHD2 axis may provide therapeutic opportunities for pathologies associated with HIF-1α dysregulation in chronic diseases.},

TAT-DP-2, a membrane-permeable derivative, induces Kv2.1 surface cluster dispersal, prevents post-injurious pro-apoptotic potassium current enhancement, and is neuroprotective in vitro by disrupting the association of Kv2.1 with VAPA.

  abstract     = {Transgenic coexpression of a class I–restricted tumor antigen–specific T cell receptor (TCR) and CD8αβ (TCR8) redirects antigen specificity of CD4 + T cells. Reinforcement of biophysical properties and early TCR signaling explain how redirected CD4 + T cells recognize target cells, but the transcriptional basis for their acquired antitumor function remains elusive. We, therefore, interrogated redirected human CD4 + and CD8 + T cells by single-cell RNA sequencing and characterized them experimentally in bulk and single-cell assays and a mouse xenograft model. TCR8 expression enhanced CD8 + T cell function and preserved less differentiated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells after tumor challenge. TCR8 + CD4 + T cells were most potent by activating multiple transcriptional programs associated with enhanced antitumor function. We found sustained activation of cytotoxicity, costimulation, oxidative phosphorylation– and proliferation-related genes, and simultaneously reduced differentiation and exhaustion. Our study identifies molecular features of TCR8 expression that can guide the development of enhanced immunotherapies.},

  abstract     = {Slow earthquakes, like regular earthquakes, result from unstable frictional slip. They produce little slip and can therefore repeat frequently. We assess their predictability using the slip history of the Cascadia subduction between 2007 and 2017, during which slow earthquakes have repeatedly ruptured multiple segments. We characterize the system dynamics using embedding theory and extreme value theory. The analysis reveals a low-dimensional (&lt;5) nonlinear chaotic system rather than a stochastic system. We calculate properties of the underlying attractor like its correlation and instantaneous dimension, instantaneous persistence, and metric entropy. We infer that the system has a predictability horizon of the order of days weeks. For the better resolved segments, the onset of large slip events can be correctly forecasted by high values of the instantaneous dimension. Longer-term deterministic prediction seems intrinsically impossible. Regular earthquakes might similarly be predictable but with a limited predictable horizon of the order of their durations.},

Upon expansion, disease loci acquire heterochromatic characteristics, which may provoke changes to chromatin conformation and thereby affect both gene expression and repeat instability. Here, we tested this hypothesis by performing 4C sequencing at the DMPK and HTT loci from DM1 and HD–derived cells. We find that allele sizes ranging from 15 to 1700 repeats displayed similar chromatin interaction profiles. This was true for both loci and for alleles with different DNA methylation levels and CTCF binding. Moreover, the ectopic insertion of an expanded CAG repeat tract did not change the conformation of the surrounding chromatin. We conclude that CAG/CTG repeat expansions are not enough to alter chromatin conformation in cis. Therefore, it is unlikely that changes in chromatin interactions drive repeat instability or changes in gene expression in these disorders.},

The foremost interaction responsible for chiral magnetism is the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), resulting from inversion symmetry breaking in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling. However, the atomistic origin of DMIs and their relationship to emergent electrodynamic phenomena, such as topological Hall effect (THE), remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of interfacial DMIs in 3 d –5 d transition metal-oxide-based LaMnO 3 /SrIrO 3 superlattices on THE from a chiral spin texture. By additively engineering the interfacial inversion symmetry with atomic-scale precision, we directly link the competition between interfacial collinear ferromagnetic interactions and DMIs to an enhanced THE. The ability to control the DMI and resulting THE points to a pathway for harnessing interfacial structures to maximize the density of chiral spin textures useful for developing high-density information storage and quantum magnets for quantum information science.},

Two Escherichia coli mutants producing distinct exopolymers are investigated. We use the incident electron beam to provoke and observe the precipitation of Mn-bearing minerals. Differences in the morphology and distribution of Mn precipitates on the two strains reflect differences in nucleation site density and accessibility. Direct observation under liquid conditions highlights the critical role of bacterial cell surface charges and exopolymer types in metal mineralization. This has strong environmental implications because biofilms structured by exopolymers are widespread in nature and constitute the main form of microbial life on Earth.},

In combination with high-resolution dense motion reconstruction, we find elongated ~45- to 90-nm-wide chromatin “blobs.” A computational chromatin model suggests that these blobs are dynamically associating chromatin fragments in close physical and genomic proximity and adopt topologically associated domain–like interactions in the time-average limit. Experimentally, we found that chromatin exhibits a spatiotemporal correlation over ~4 μm in space and tens of seconds in time, while chromatin dynamics are correlated over ~6 μm and last 40 s. Notably, chromatin structure and dynamics are closely related, which may constitute a mechanism to grant access to regions with high local chromatin concentration.},

Here, we suggest a previously unidentified method for xenogenizing (turning self to non-self) tumors by using fusogenic exosomes to introduce fusogenic viral antigens (VSV-G) onto the tumor cell surface. We found that xenogenized tumor cells were readily recognized and engulfed by dendritic cells; thereby, tumor antigens were efficiently presented to T lymphocytes. Moreover, exosome–VSV-G itself acts as a TLR4 agonist and stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells, leading to CD8 + T cell cross-priming. The administration of these exosomes in multiple tumor mouse models xenogenized tumor cells, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. The combinatorial treatment with anti–PD-L1 exhibited complete tumor regression (30\%) and better long-term overall survival. These results suggest that tumor xenogenization by fusogenic exosomes provides a previously unidentified novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy.},

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the sense of agency is associated with a brain network including the pre–supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal parietal cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation affected the sense of agency only when delivered over the pre-SMA and specifically when time-locked to action planning, rather than when the physical consequences of the actions appeared.

Crystallization in such a system is often under strong influence of competing orderings linked to those crystals. However, how such competition affects crystal nucleation and ordering toward the final crystalline state is largely unknown. This is primarily because the competition takes place locally and thus is masked by large positional fluctuations. We develop a unique method to correctly identify local symmetries by removing their distortions due to positional fluctuations. This allows us to experimentally access the spatiotemporal fluctuations of local symmetries at a single-particle level in crystallization of a charged colloidal system near the body-centered cubic–face-centered cubic border. Thus, we successfully reveal the crucial roles of competing ordering in the initial selection of polymorphs and the final grain boundary motion toward the most stable state from a microscopic perspective.},

Here, we show that VRK-1 increases organismal longevity by activating the cellular energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), via direct phosphorylation. We found that overexpression of vrk-1 in the soma of adult C. elegans increased life span and, conversely, inhibition of vrk-1 decreased life span. In addition, vrk-1 was required for longevity conferred by mutations that inhibit C. elegans mitochondrial respiration, which requires AMPK. VRK-1 directly phosphorylated and up-regulated AMPK in both C. elegans and cultured human cells. Thus, our data show that the somatic nuclear kinase, VRK-1, promotes longevity through AMPK activation, and this function appears to be conserved between C. elegans and humans.},

  abstract     = {Rigid electromagnetic actuators serve our society in a myriad of ways for more than 200 years. However, their bulky nature restricts close collaboration with humans. Here, we introduce soft electromagnetic actuators (SEMAs) by replacing solid metal coils with liquid-metal channels embedded in elastomeric shells. We demonstrate human-friendly, simple, stretchable, fast, durable, and programmable centimeter-scale SEMAs that drive a soft shark, interact with everyday objects, or rapidly mix a dye with water. A multicoil flower SEMA with individually controlled petals blooms or closes within tens of milliseconds, and a cubic SEMA performs programmed, arbitrary motion sequences. We develop a numerical model supporting design and opening potential routes toward miniaturization, reduction of power consumption, and increase in mechanical efficiency. SEMAs are electrically controlled shape-morphing systems that are potentially empowering future applications from soft grippers to minimally invasive medicine.},

  abstract     = {A major critical issue in systemically administered nanomedicines is nonspecific clearance by the liver sinusoidal endothelium, causing a substantial decrease in the delivery efficiency of nanomedicines into the target tissues. Here, we addressed this issue by in situ stealth coating of liver sinusoids using linear or two-armed poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)–conjugated oligo( l -lysine) (OligoLys). PEG-OligoLys selectively attached to liver sinusoids for PEG coating, leaving the endothelium of other tissues uncoated and, thus, accessible to the nanomedicines. Furthermore, OligoLys having a two-armed PEG configuration was ultimately cleared from sinusoidal walls to the bile, while OligoLys with linear PEG persisted in the sinusoidal walls, possibly causing prolonged disturbance of liver physiological functions. Such transient and selective stealth coating of liver sinusoids by two-arm-PEG-OligoLys was effective in preventing the sinusoidal clearance of nonviral and viral gene vectors, representatives of synthetic and nature-derived nanomedicines, respectively, thereby boosting their gene transfection efficiency in the target tissues.},

This paper evaluates the impact on tree cover loss of the first randomized control trial of such a program. Around 70, 000 landholdings were demarcated and registered in randomly chosen villages in Benin, a country with a high rate of deforestation driven by demand for agricultural land. We estimate that the program reduced the area of forest loss in treated villages, with no evidence of anticipatory deforestation or negative spillovers to other areas. Surveys indicate that possible mechanisms include an increase in tenure security and an improvement in the effectiveness of community forest management. Overall, our results suggest that formalizing customary land rights in rural areas can be an effective way to reduce forest loss while improving agricultural investments.},

However, it is still challenging to replicate the structural specificity and variability of cardiac tissues using traditional bioengineering approaches. In this study, a four-dimensional (4D) cardiac patch with physiological adaptability has been printed by beam-scanning stereolithography. By combining a unique 4D self-morphing capacity with expandable microstructure, the specific design has been shown to improve both the biomechanical properties of the patches themselves and the dynamic integration of the patch with the beating heart. Our results demonstrate improved vascularization and cardiomyocyte maturation in vitro under physiologically relevant mechanical stimulation, as well as increased cell engraftment and vascular supply in a murine chronic MI model. This work not only potentially provides an effective treatment method for MI but also contributes a cutting-edge methodology to enhance the structural design of complex tissues for organ regeneration.},

We found that the molecular information was sufficient to deduce the complex and detailed neuroanatomical organization of the brain. The unsupervised (non-expert, data-driven) classification revealed new area- and layer-specific subregions, for example in isocortex and hippocampus, and new subdivisions of striatum. The molecular atlas further supports the characterization of the spatial identity of neurons from their single-cell RNA profile, and provides a resource for annotating the brain using a minimal gene set—a brain palette. In summary, we have established a molecular atlas to formally define the spatial organization of brain regions, including the molecular code for mapping and targeting of discrete neuroanatomical domains.},

Intratumorally injected AIEgen-upconversion nanoparticles produce high-dose ROS under high-power NIR irradiation, which induces immunogenic cell death and antigen release. These nanoparticles can also capture the released antigens and deliver them to lymph nodes. Upon subsequent low-power NIR treatment of lymph nodes, low-dose ROS are generated to further trigger efficient T cell immune responses through activation of dendritic cells, preventing both local tumor recurrence and distant tumor growth.

Using clinical Bacillus subtilis as a model probiotic bacterium, biofilm-coated probiotics demonstrate substantially improved GI tract tolerance and mucoadhesion in mice and swine. In particular, coated probiotics exhibit a 125-fold higher oral bioavailability and a 17 times greater intestinal colonization than uncoated bacteria in the porcine model. With notable ability to survive and reside in the GI tract, coated bacteria further show a significantly enhanced decolonization effect in mice colonized with Staphylococcus aureus .

Here, we show that Icelandic dust emissions are sporadically an important source of INPs at mid to high latitudes by combining ice-nucleating active site density measurements of aircraft-collected Icelandic dust samples with a global aerosol model. Because Iceland is only one of many high-latitude dust sources, we anticipate that the combined effect of all these sources may strongly contribute to the INP population in the mid- and high-latitude northern hemisphere.

Evidence included managers evaluating an employee randomly assigned a male (versus female) name as more competent and advising a $3475.00 higher salary, equating to an 8\% pay gap. Importantly, those who thought bias was not happening in their field were the key drivers of it—a “high risk” group (including men and women) that, as shown, can be readily identified/assessed.

Here, BCN nanotubes with multiple active sites are synthesized for oxygen-assisted methanol conversion reaction. The catalyst shows a notable activity improvement for methanol conversion (29\%) with excellent selectivity to formaldehyde (54\%). Kinetic measurements indicate that carboxylic acid groups on BCN are responsible for the formation of dimethyl ether, while the redox catalysis to formaldehyde occurs on both ketonic carbonyl and boron hydroxyl (B─OH) sites. The ODH reaction pathway on the B─OH site is further revealed by in situ infrared, x-ray absorption spectra, and density functional theory.

  abstract     = {Population trends and breeding success variability of Adélie penguins, a bioindicator of Antarctic environments, have been attributed to changing sea-ice extents; however, causative mechanisms remain unclear. By electronically tagging 175 penguins in four seasons with contrasting sea-ice conditions, we show that ice-free environments enhance, not deteriorate, foraging efficiencies and breeding success. In an ice-free season, penguins traveled by swimming rather than walking, leading to larger foraging areas, shorter trip durations, and lower energy expenditure than three ice-covered seasons. Freed from the need to find cracks for breathing, dive durations decreased, and more krill were captured per unit dive time, which may also be associated with phytoplankton blooms and increased krill density in the sunlit ice-free water. Consequently, adult body mass, chick growth rates, and breeding success increased. Our findings explain the regional population trends and demonstrate a key link among sea ice, foraging behavior, and reproductive success in this iconic species.},

  abstract     = {The realization of the quantum spin Hall effect in HgTe quantum wells has led to the development of topological materials, which, in combination with magnetism and superconductivity, are predicted to host chiral Majorana fermions. However, the large magnetization in conventional quantum anomalous Hall systems makes it challenging to induce superconductivity. Here, we report two different emergent quantum Hall effects in (Hg, Mn)Te quantum wells. First, a previously unidentified quantum Hall state emerges from the quantum spin Hall state at an exceptionally low magnetic field of ~50 mT. Second, tuning toward the bulk p -regime, we resolve quantum Hall plateaus at fields as low as 20 to 30 mT, where transport is dominated by a van Hove singularity in the valence band. These emergent quantum Hall phenomena rely critically on the topological band structure of HgTe, and their occurrence at very low fields makes them an ideal candidate for realizing chiral Majorana fermions.},

Here, we describe a naturally occurring Campylobacter -associated diarrhea model in outdoor-housed rhesus macaques. Using this model, we developed novel next-generation H 2 O 2 -based Campylobacter vaccines that induced strong antibacterial antibodies to multiple Campylobacter proteins including flagellin and provided up to 83\% protection against severe C. coli –associated diarrhea. Whole-genome sequencing of circulating Campylobacter strains revealed little to no homology within lipooligosaccharide or capsular polysaccharide loci with the Campylobacter vaccine strains used in these studies, indicating that vaccine-mediated immunity was not restricted to a single homologous serotype. Together, these results demonstrate an important advance in vaccine development and a new approach to reducing Campylobacter -associated enteric disease.},

Current disease-modifying antirheumatic agents (DMARDs) operate through systemic immunosuppression. FLS-targeted approaches could potentially be combined with DMARDs to improve control of RA without increasing immunosuppression. Here, we assessed the potential of immunoglobulin-like domains 1 and 2 (Ig1&amp;2), a decoy protein that activates the receptor tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPRS) on FLS, for RA therapy. We report that PTPRS expression is enriched in synovial lining RA FLS and that Ig1&amp;2 reduces migration of RA but not osteoarthritis FLS. Administration of an Fc-fusion Ig1&amp;2 attenuated arthritis in mice without affecting innate or adaptive immunity. Furthermore, PTPRS was down-regulated in FLS by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–mediated pathway, and TNF inhibition enhanced PTPRS expression in arthritic joints. Combination of ineffective doses of TNF inhibitor and Fc-Ig1&amp;2 reversed arthritis in mice, providing an example of synergy between FLS-targeted and immunosuppressive DMARD therapies.},

Using this transcriptional map, we identified an immediate early gene expression program that is up-regulated following cocaine experience in vivo and dopamine receptor activation in vitro. Multiplexed induction of this gene program with a large-scale CRISPR-dCas9 activation strategy initiated a secondary synapse-centric transcriptional profile, altered striatal physiology in vitro, and enhanced cocaine sensitization in vivo. Together, these results define the transcriptional response to cocaine with cellular precision and demonstrate that drug-responsive gene programs can potentiate both physiological and behavioral adaptations to drugs of abuse.},

We developed photochemical and viral methodologies to induce death in single cells and combined this with intravital optical imaging. This approach allowed us to track multicellular phagocytic interactions with precise spatiotemporal resolution. Astrocytes and microglia engaged with dying neurons in an orchestrated and synchronized fashion. Each glial cell played specialized roles: Astrocyte processes rapidly polarized and engulfed numerous small dendritic apoptotic bodies, while microglia migrated and engulfed the soma and apical dendrites. The relative involvement and phagocytic specialization of each glial cell was plastic and controlled by the receptor tyrosine kinase Mertk . In aging, there was a marked delay in apoptotic cell removal. Thus, a precisely orchestrated response and cross-talk between glial cells during corpse removal may be critical for maintaining brain homeostasis.},

Whole-genome sequencing identified a variant in the tumor suppressor XAF1 (E134*/Glu134Ter/rs146752602) in a subset of R337H carriers. Haplotype-defining variants were verified in 203 patients with cancer, 582 relatives, and 42, 438 newborns. The compound mutant haplotype was enriched in patients with cancer, conferring risk for sarcoma ( P = 0.003) and subsequent malignancies ( P = 0.006). Functional analyses demonstrated that wild-type XAF1 enhances transactivation of wild-type and hypomorphic TP53 variants, whereas XAF1 -E134* is markedly attenuated in this activity. We propose that cosegregation of XAF1- E134* and TP53- R337H mutations leads to a more aggressive cancer phenotype than TP53- R337H alone, with implications for genetic counseling and clinical management of hypomorphic TP53 mutant carriers.},

Two major explanations of E-MORBs are that these basalts are generated by the melting of entrained recycled crust (pyroxenite) beneath ridges or by the melting of refertilized peridotites. These two hypotheses can be discriminated with compatible element abundances from Sc to Ge, here termed the ScGe elements. Here, we demonstrate that E-MORBs have systematically lower Ge/Si and Sc contents and slightly higher Fe/Mn and Nb/Ta ratios than depleted MORBs (D-MORBs) due to the mixing of low-degree pyroxenite melts. The Ge/Si ratio is a new tracer that effectively discriminates between melts derived from peridotite sources and melts derived from mixed pyroxenite-peridotite sources. These new data are used to estimate the distribution of pyroxenite in the mantle sources of global MORB segments.},

These alterations appear soon after drinking initiation in rats, persist into early abstinence in both species, and are associated with a robust decrease in extracellular space tortuosity explained by a microglial reaction. Mathematical modeling of the diffusivity changes unveils an increased spatial reach of extrasynaptically released transmitters like dopamine that may contribute to alcohol’s progressively enhanced addictive potency.},

  abstract     = {Recent work has highlighted the fact that lysosomes are a critical signaling hub of metabolic processes, providing fundamental building blocks crucial for anabolic functions. How lysosomal functions affect other cellular compartments is not fully understood. Here, we find that lysosomal recycling of the amino acids lysine and arginine is essential for proper ER quality control through the UPR ER . Specifically, loss of the lysine and arginine amino acid transporter LAAT-1 results in increased sensitivity to proteotoxic stress in the ER and decreased animal physiology. We find that these LAAT-1–dependent effects are linked to glycine metabolism and transport and that the loss of function of the glycine transporter SKAT-1 also increases sensitivity to ER stress. Direct lysine and arginine supplementation, or glycine supplementation alone, can ameliorate increased ER stress sensitivity found in laat-1 mutants. These data implicate a crucial role in recycling lysine, arginine, and glycine in communication between the lysosome and ER.},

To decipher the relative contributions of these factors on immune activation, here, we compared, in multiple cell and in vivo models, mRNA that encodes human erythropoietin incorporating either canonical uridine or N 1-methyl-pseudouridine (1mΨ), synthesized by either a standard process shown to have double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) impurities or a modified process that yields a highly purified mRNA preparation. Our data demonstrate that the lowest stimulation of immune endpoints was with 1mΨ made by the modified process, while mRNA containing canonical uridine was immunostimulatory regardless of process. These findings confirm that uridine modification and the reduction of dsRNA impurities are both necessary and sufficient at controlling the immune-activating profile of therapeutic mRNA.},

In particular, malignant glioma cells (GMs) release tremendous number of exosomes, nanovesicles of 30 to 200 nm in size, promoting tumor progression by the transport of pro-oncogenic molecules to neighboring cells. In the present study, we found that hypoxia-induced malignant GMs strongly enhanced MCT1 and CD147 expression, playing a crucial role in promoting calcium-dependent exosome release. Furthermore, it was first identified that hypoxic GMs-derived exosomes contained significantly high levels of MCT1 and CD147, which could be quantitatively detected by noninvasive localized surface plasmon resonance and atomic force microscopy biosensors, demonstrating that they could be precise surrogate biomarkers for tracking parent GMs’ metabolic reprogramming and malignant progression as liquid biopsies.},

This method enables us to isolate the AMOC climatic impacts in experiments with a full-physics climate model. Our results show that a weakened AMOC can explain ocean cooling south of Greenland that resembles the North Atlantic warming hole and a reduced Arctic sea ice loss in all seasons with a delay of about 6 years in the emergence of an ice-free Arctic in boreal summer. In the troposphere, a weakened AMOC causes an anomalous cooling band stretching from the lower levels in high latitudes to the upper levels in the tropics and displaces the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude jets poleward.},

Our previous studies in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) demonstrated that deleting the enzymatic SET domain of Set1A does not perturb bulk H3K4me3, indicating possible compensatory roles played by other COMPASS methyltransferases. Here, we generated a series of ESC lines harboring compounding mutations of COMPASS methyltransferases. We find that Set1B is functionally redundant to Set1A in implementing H3K4me3 at highly expressed genes, while Mll2 deposits H3K4me3 at less transcriptionally active promoters. While Set1A-B/COMPASS is responsible for broad H3K4me3 peaks, Mll2/COMPASS establishes H3K4me3 with narrow breadth. Additionally, Mll2 helps preserve global H3K4me3 levels and peak breadth in the absence of Set1A-B activity. Our results illustrate the biological flexibility of such enzymes in regulating transcription in a context-dependent manner to maintain stem cell identity.},

Here, we found extensive DNA demethylation in the CHH context around pericentromeric regions and DNA demethylation in the CG, CHG, and CHH contexts at discrete genomic regions during ectopic xylem tracheary element (TE) differentiation. While loss of pericentromeric methylation occurs passively, DNA demethylation at a subset of regions relies on active DNA demethylation initiated by DNA glycosylases ROS1, DML2, and DML3. The ros1 and rdd mutations impair ectopic TE differentiation and xylem development in the young roots of Arabidopsis seedlings. Active DNA demethylation targets and regulates many genes for TE differentiation. The defect of xylem development in rdd is proposed to be caused by dysregulation of multiple genes. Our study identifies a role of active DNA demethylation in vascular development and reveals an epigenetic mechanism for TE differentiation.},

The capacity to form nested hierarchical representations is hypothesized to be essential to uniquely human thought, but its origins in evolution, development, and culture are controversial. We used a nonlinguistic sequence generation task to test whether subjects generalize sequential groupings of items to a center-embedded, recursive structure. Children (3 to 5 years old), U.S. adults, and adults from a Bolivian indigenous group spontaneously induced recursive structures from ambiguous training data. In contrast, monkeys did so only with additional exposure. We quantify these patterns using a Bayesian mixture model over logically possible strategies. Our results show that recursive hierarchical strategies are robust in human thought, both early in development and across cultures, but the capacity itself is not unique to humans.},

Here, we develop a nanotube-based platform for direct delivery of siRNA and show high silencing efficiency in intact plant cells. We demonstrate that nanotubes successfully deliver siRNA and silence endogenous genes, owing to effective intracellular delivery and nanotube-induced protection of siRNA from nuclease degradation.

Here, we report that the MAP three kinase 1 (MTK1) SAPK kinase kinase (SAPKKK) functions as an oxidative-stress sensor that perceives the cellular redox state and transduces it into SAPK signaling. Following oxidative stress, MTK1 is rapidly oxidized and gradually reduced at evolutionarily conserved cysteine residues. These coupled oxidation-reduction modifications of MTK1 elicit its catalytic activity. Gene knockout experiments showed that oxidative stress–induced SAPK signaling is mediated by coordinated activation of the two SAPKKKs, MTK1 and apoptosis signal–regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which have different time and dose-response characteristics. The MTK1-mediated redox sensing system is crucial for delayed and sustained SAPK activity and dictates cell fate decisions including cell death and interleukin-6 production.

RNA editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter virus infection, but it is not yet known whether this process operates against coronaviruses. Here, we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from coronavirus-infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: adenosine-to-inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and cytosine-to-uracil changes from APOBEC deaminases. Mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of Coronaviridae from human hosts reveals mutational patterns consistent with those observed in the transcriptomic data. However, the reduced ADAR signature in these data raises the possibility that ADARs might be more effective than APOBECs in restricting viral propagation. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.},

  abstract     = {Developmental shifts in stage-specific gene expression can provide a ready mechanism of phenotypic change by altering the rate or timing of ontogenetic events. We found that the high-altitude Tibetan antelope ( Panthelops hodgsonii ) has evolved an adaptive increase in blood-O 2 affinity by truncating the ancestral ontogeny of globin gene expression such that a high-affinity juvenile hemoglobin isoform (isoHb) completely supplants the lower-affinity isoHb that is expressed in the adult red blood cells of other bovids. This juvenilization of blood properties represents a canalization of an acclimatization response to hypoxia that has been well documented in adult goats and sheep. We also found the genomic mechanism underlying this regulatory isoHb switch, revealing how a reversible acclimatization response became genetically assimilated as an irreversible adaptation to chronic hypoxia.},

However, large-area integration of ultrathin and delicate functional micro-objects with high yields in a programmable fashion still remains as a great challenge. Here, we present a simple, cost-effective, yet robust transfer printing technique via a shape-conformal stamp with actively actuated surface microstructures for programmable and scalable transfer printing with high reliability and efficiency. The shape-conformal stamp features the polymeric backing and commercially available adhesive layer with embedded expandable microspheres. Upon external thermal stimuli, the embedded microspheres expand to form surface microstructures and yield weak adhesion for reliable release. Systematic experimental and computational studies reveal the fundamental aspects of the extraordinary adhesion switchability of stamp. Demonstrations of this protocol in deterministic assemblies of diverse challenging inorganic micro-objects illustrate its extraordinary capabilities in transfer printing for developing high-performance flexible inorganic electronics.},

In contrast, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of TNBC critically requires CDK4/6 for proliferation, and yet, these TNBC are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition due to sequestration of CDK4/6 inhibitors into tumor cell lysosomes. This sequestration is caused by enhanced lysosomal biogenesis and increased lysosomal numbers in TNBC cells. We developed new CDK4/6 inhibitor compounds that evade the lysosomal sequestration and are efficacious against resistant TNBC. We also show that coadministration of lysosomotropic or lysosome-destabilizing compounds (an antibiotic azithromycin, an antidepressant siramesine, an antimalaria compound chloroquine) renders resistant tumor cells sensitive to currently used CDK4/6 inhibitors. Lastly, coinhibition of CDK2 arrested proliferation of CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant cells. These observations may extend the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors to TNBCs that are refractory to current anti-CDK4/6 therapies.},

While ezetimibe gained Food and Drug Administration approval in 2002, its mechanism of action has remained unclear. Here, we present two cryo–electron microscopy structures of NPC1L1, one in its apo form and the other complexed with ezetimibe. The apo form represents an open state in which the N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts loosely with the rest of NPC1L1, leaving the NTD central cavity accessible for cholesterol loading. The ezetimibe-bound form signifies a closed state in which the NTD rotates ~60°, creating a continuous tunnel enabling cholesterol movement into the plasma membrane. Ezetimibe blocks cholesterol transport by occluding the tunnel instead of competing with cholesterol binding. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol transport and ezetimibe inhibition, paving the way for more effective therapeutic development.},

We show that polymerization of liquid crystal (LC) emulsions leads to compositionally homogeneous and spherical microparticles that encode van der Waals interactions with complex symmetries (e.g., quadrupolar and dipolar) that reflect the internal organization of the LC. Experiments performed using kinetically controlled probe colloid adsorption and complementary calculations support our conclusion that LC ordering can program van der Waals interactions by ~20 k B T across the surfaces of microparticles. Because diverse LC configurations can be engineered by confinement, these results provide fresh ideas for programming van der Waals interactions for assembly of soft matter.},

For example, a single allosteric modulator, Rp-cAMPS, of the prototypical protein kinase A (PKA) switches from antagonist to agonist depending on MgATP levels. However, the mechanism underlying such pluripotent allostery has remained elusive for decades. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ensemble models, kinase assays, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that allosteric pluripotency arises from surprisingly divergent responses of highly homologous tandem domains. The differential responses perturb domain-domain interactions and remodel the free-energy landscape of inhibitory excited states sampled by the regulatory subunit of PKA. The resulting activation threshold values are comparable to the effective free energy of regulatory and catalytic subunit binding, which depends on metabolites, substrates, and mutations, explaining pluripotent allostery and warranting a general redefinition of allosteric targets to include specific subcellular environments.},

We experimentally investigate the origins of dendritic electrodeposition of Zn, Cu, and Li in a three-electrode electrochemical cell bounded at one end by a rotating disc electrode. We find that the classical picture of ion depletion–induced growth of dendrites is valid in dilute electrolytes but is essentially irrelevant in the concentrated (≥1 M) electrolytes typically used in rechargeable batteries. Using Zn as an example, we find that ion depletion at the mass transport limit may be overcome by spontaneous reorientation of Zn crystallites from orientations parallel to the electrode surface to dominantly homeotropic orientations, which appear to facilitate contact with cations outside the depletion layer. This chemotaxis-like process causes obvious texturing and increases the porosity of metal electrodeposits.},

Conventional protein delivery techniques fail to address this fundamental problem in that protein cargos are predominantly delivered inside cells via endocytosis, a remarkably effective cell defense mechanism developed by Mother Nature to prevent intact biomolecules from entering the cytoplasm. Here, we report a unique concept, noncovalent cholesterol tagging, enabling virtually any compact proteins to permeate through the cell membrane, completely bypassing endocytosis.

The nanodevice is built by combining an ultraviolet (UV) light–activatable aptamer module and a photosensitizer (PS) with up-conversion nanoparticle (UCNP) that enables the operation of the nanodevice with deep tissue–penetrable NIR light. The UCNPs can convert two distinct NIR excitations into orthogonal UV and green emissions for programmable photoactivation of the aptamer modules and PSs, respectively, allowing spatiotemporally controlled target recognition and photodynamic antitumor effect. Furthermore, when combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the nanodevice results in regression of untreated distant tumors.

We use settlement scaling theory to distinguish agglomeration-driven from technology-driven growth, and then we apply this framework to archaeological evidence from the Pre-Hispanic Northern Rio Grande Pueblos of New Mexico, USA. Results suggest that agglomeration-driven or “Smithian” growth was the dominant factor behind improvements in the material conditions of life over time in this society.

  abstract     = {About 40\% of patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have stage IV cancer at the time of diagnosis. The only viable treatment options for metastatic disease are systemic chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Nonetheless, chemoresistance remains a major cause of chemotherapy failure. New immunotherapeutic modalities such as anti–PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade have shown promise; however, response to such strategies is highly variable across patients. Here, we show that our unique poly(2-oxazoline)–based nanomicellar formulation (PM) of Resiquimod, an imidazoquinoline Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist, had a superior tumor inhibitory effect in a metastatic model of lung adenocarcinoma, relative to anti–PD-1 therapy or platinum-based chemotherapy. Investigation of the in vivo immune status following Resiquimod PM treatment showed that Resiquimod-based stimulation of antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment resulted in the mobilization of an antitumor CD8 + immune response. Our study demonstrates the promise of poly(2-oxazoline)-formulated Resiquimod for treating metastatic NSCLC.},

  abstract     = {Communication mechanisms underlying the sexual isolation of species are poorly understood. Using four subspecies of Drosophila mojavensis as a model, we identify two behaviorally active, male-specific pheromones. One functions as a conserved male antiaphrodisiac in all subspecies and acts via gustation. The second induces female receptivity via olfaction exclusively in the two subspecies that produce it. Genetic analysis of the cognate receptor for the olfactory pheromone indicates an important role for this sensory pathway in promoting sexual isolation of subspecies, in combination with auditory signals. Unexpectedly, the peripheral sensory pathway detecting this pheromone is conserved molecularly, physiologically, and anatomically across subspecies. These observations imply that subspecies-specific behaviors arise from differential interpretation of the same peripheral cue, reminiscent of sexually conserved detection but dimorphic interpretation of male pheromones in Drosophila melanogaster . Our results reveal that, during incipient speciation, pheromone production, detection, and interpretation do not necessarily evolve in a coordinated manner.},

Albeit changes in expression and activity of ADAR genes are thought to have been responsible for the dysregulated RNA editome in diseases, they are not always correlated, indicating the involvement of secondary regulators. Here, we uncover DAP3 as a potent repressor of editing and a strong oncogene in cancer. DAP3 mainly interacts with the deaminase domain of ADAR2 and represses editing via disrupting association of ADAR2 with its target transcripts. PDZD7 , an exemplary DAP3-repressed editing target, undergoes a protein recoding editing at stop codon [Stop →Trp (W)]. Because of editing suppression by DAP3, the unedited PDZD7 WT , which is more tumorigenic than edited PDZD7 Stop518W , is accumulated in tumors. In sum, cancer cells may acquire malignant properties for their survival advantage through suppressing RNA editome by DAP3.},

Quantum simulation can provide insights into these problems. Here, using a programmable quantum simulator with 16 all-to-all connected superconducting qubits, we investigate the dynamical phase transition in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model with a quenched transverse field. Clear signatures of dynamical phase transitions, merging different concepts of dynamical criticality, are observed by measuring the nonequilibrium order parameter, nonlocal correlations, and the Loschmidt echo. Moreover, near the dynamical critical point, we obtain a spin squeezing of −7.0 ± 0.8 dB, showing multipartite entanglement, useful for measurements with precision fivefold beyond the standard quantum limit. On the basis of the capability of entangling qubits simultaneously and the accurate single-shot readout of multiqubit states, this superconducting quantum simulator can be used to study other problems in nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems, such as thermalization, many-body localization, and emergent phenomena in periodically driven systems.},

We show that synaptic noise, in conjunction with weak feedforward excitation, generates variable motor output in the Aplysia feeding system. A command-like neuron (CBI-10) triggers rhythmic motor programs more variable than programs triggered by CBI-2. CBI-10 weakly excites a pivotal pattern-generating interneuron (B34) strongly activated by CBI-2. The activation properties of B34 substantially account for the degree of program variability. CBI-10– and CBI-2–induced EPSPs in B34 vary in amplitude across trials, suggesting that there is synaptic noise. Computational studies show that synaptic noise is required for program variability. Further, at network state transition points when synaptic conductance is low, maximum program variability is promoted by moderate noise levels. Thus, synaptic strength and noise act together in a nonlinear manner to determine the degree of variability within a feedforward network.},

Anticipation of future reward, such as an upcoming vacation, can often be more gratifying than the experience itself. Theories suggest the utility of anticipation underpins various behaviors, ranging from beneficial information-seeking to harmful addiction. However, how neural systems compute anticipatory utility remains unclear. We analyzed the brain activity of human participants as they performed a task involving choosing whether to receive information predictive of future pleasant outcomes. Using a computational model, we show three brain regions orchestrate anticipatory utility. Specifically, ventromedial prefrontal cortex tracks the value of anticipatory utility, dopaminergic midbrain correlates with information that enhances anticipation, while sustained hippocampal activity mediates a functional coupling between these regions. Our findings suggest a previously unidentified neural underpinning for anticipation’s influence over decision-making and unify a range of phenomena associated with risk and time-delay preference.},

CD4 + T cell accumulation and T H 1 skewing are reduced in the CNS but not spleens of infected CXCR3 −/− mice. Adoptive transfer of WT, but not CXCR3 −/− CD4 + T cells, into CXCR3 −/− mice phenocopies the pathology of infected WT mice.

LiQD Cornea is an alternative to conventional corneal transplantation and sealants. It is a cell-free, liquid hydrogel matrix for corneal regeneration, comprising short collagen-like peptides conjugated with polyethylene glycol and mixed with fibrinogen to promote adhesion within tissue defects. Gelation occurs spontaneously at body temperature within 5 min. Light exposure is not required—particularly advantageous because patients with corneal inflammation are typically photophobic. The self-assembling, fully defined, synthetic collagen analog is much less costly than human recombinant collagen and reduces the risk of immune rejection associated with xenogeneic materials. In situ gelation potentially allows for clinical application in outpatient clinics instead of operating theaters, maximizing practicality, and minimizing health care costs.},

We use an analytical model and multiple computational models to explore the instability modes of such a bi-beam construct, demonstrating how different combinations of hyperelastic and viscoelastic properties of both beams, as well as purposefully introduced geometric imperfections, could be used to create robust and highly predictable strain rate-dependent behaviors of bi-beams.

Results show that the sediments have experienced multiple episodes of burial and reexposure, with cumulative lag times exceeding 1 Ma in the downstream reaches of the Murray and Darling rivers. Combined with low sediment supply rates and old sediment blanketing the landscape, we posit that sediment recycling in the Murray-Darling is an important and ongoing process that will substantially delay and alter signals of external environmental forcing transmitted from the sediment’s hinterland.},

  abstract     = {Transcriptional bursting is the stochastic activation and inactivation of promoters, contributing to cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of transcriptional bursting kinetics (burst size and frequency) in mammalian cells remains elusive. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the intrinsic noise and mRNA levels for elucidating the transcriptional bursting kinetics in mouse embryonic stem cells. Informatics analyses and functional assays revealed that transcriptional bursting kinetics was regulated by a combination of promoter- and gene body–binding proteins, including the polycomb repressive complex 2 and transcription elongation factors. Furthermore, large-scale CRISPR-Cas9–based screening identified that the Akt/MAPK signaling pathway regulated bursting kinetics by modulating transcription elongation efficiency. These results uncovered the key molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional bursting and cell-to-cell gene expression noise in mammalian cells.},

We also confirm that the M-334 site and NS-234/236 sites are critical for TRA2A binding, mRNA splicing, viral replication, and pathogenicity. Our results reveal the underlying mechanisms of adaptation of avian influenza virus to human hosts, and suggest rational strategies to protect public health.},

  abstract     = {CRISPR-Cas9 systems are enriched in human pathogenic bacteria and have been linked to cytotoxicity by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that upon infection of human cells, Campylobacter jejuni secretes its Cas9 (CjeCas9) nuclease into their cytoplasm. Next, a native nuclear localization signal enables CjeCas9 nuclear entry, where it catalyzes metal-dependent nonspecific DNA cleavage leading to cell death. Compared to CjeCas9, native Cas9 of Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyCas9) is more suitable for guide-dependent editing. However, in human cells, native SpyCas9 may still cause some DNA damage, most likely because of its ssDNA cleavage activity. This side effect can be completely prevented by saturation of SpyCas9 with an appropriate guide RNA, which is only partially effective for CjeCas9. We conclude that CjeCas9 plays an active role in attacking human cells rather than in viral defense. Moreover, these unique catalytic features may therefore make CjeCas9 less suitable for genome editing applications.},

How the physical properties of vaccine carriers such as mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) influence this cascade is unclear. We fabricated 80-nm MSNs with different pore sizes (7.8 nm, 10.3 nm, and 12.9 nm) and loaded them with ovalbumin antigen. Results demonstrated these MSNs with different pore sizes were equally effective in the first three steps of the DUMP cascade, but those with larger pores showed higher cross-presentation efficiency (step 4). Consistently, large-pore MSNs loaded with B16F10 tumor antigens yielded the strongest antitumor effects.

Bioluminescence imaging revealed the successful delivery and transfection of AAV-luciferase.

AAV–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–loaded MNs improved heart function by enhancing VEGF expression, promoting functional angiogenesis, and activating the Akt signaling pathway.

This hypermethylation affects the binding of transcription factors including those involved in exit from the GC reaction and involves pathways such as B cell receptor, antigen presentation, CD40, and others. Normal GC B cells manifest a typical hypomethylation signature, which is caused by AID, the enzyme that mediates somatic hypermutation. However, AID-induced demethylation is markedly impaired in TET2-deficient GC B cells, suggesting that AID epigenetic effects are partially dependent on TET2.

In orally dosed MRL- lpr mice, P2Ns-GA–encapsulated CsA increased lymphatic drug delivery 4- to 18-fold over the ligand-free formulation and a commercial CsA capsule, respectively. Improved lymphatic bioavailability of CsA was paralleled by normalization of anti–double-stranded DNA immunoglobulin G titer, plasma cytokines, and glomerulonephritis.

  abstract     = {Understanding the relationship between brain activity and specific mental function is important for medical diagnosis of brain symptoms, such as epilepsy. Magnetoencephalography (MEG), which uses an array of high-sensitivity magnetometers to record magnetic field signals generated from neural currents occurring naturally in the brain, is a noninvasive method for locating the brain activities. The MEG is normally performed in a magnetically shielded room. Here, we introduce an unshielded MEG system based on optically pumped atomic magnetometers. We build an atomic magnetic gradiometer, together with feedback methods, to reduce the environment magnetic field noise. We successfully observe the alpha rhythm signals related to closed eyes and clear auditory evoked field signals in unshielded Earth’s field. Combined with improvements in the miniaturization of the atomic magnetometer, our method is promising to realize a practical wearable and movable unshielded MEG system and bring new insights into medical diagnosis of brain symptoms.},

MERS-CoV replication in type I and II pneumocytes of ChAdOx1 MERS–vaccinated animals was absent. A prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 MERS boosted antibody titers, and viral replication was completely absent from the respiratory tract tissue of these rhesus macaques. We also found that antibodies elicited by ChAdOx1 MERS in rhesus macaques neutralized six different MERS-CoV strains.

  abstract     = {Although growth factors (GFs) are key molecules for regenerative medicine, their use has been limited by issues associated with suboptimal delivery systems and incomplete understanding of their signaling dynamics. Here, we explored how proinflammatory signals affect GF regenerative potential. Using bone regeneration in mouse, we found that the regenerative capacity of two clinically relevant GFs (BMP-2 and PDGF-BB) is impaired by interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R1). Mechanistically, IL-1R1 activation in bone-forming cells desensitizes them to GFs and accelerates senescence. Moreover, administration of the GFs triggers IL-1 release by macrophages. To provide localized and sustained IL-1R1 inhibition, we engineered IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) to bind the extracellular matrix (ECM) very strongly and demonstrate that codelivering GFs with ECM-binding IL-1Ra induces superior regeneration. Thus, we highlight that GF regenerative activity is hindered by proinflammatory signals, and GF-based therapies should integrate immunomodulation. Particularly, ECM-binding IL-1Ra holds clinical translational potential by enhancing efficacy of GF therapies.},

Consequently, administration of STING agonists such as cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) has been identified as a promising approach to target these diseases. In cancer cells, STING signaling is frequently impaired by epigenetic silencing of STING; hence, conventional delivery of only its agonist cGAMP may be insufficient to trigger STING signaling. In this work, while expression of STING lacking the transmembrane (TM) domain is known to be unresponsive to STING agonists and is dominant negative when coexpressed with the full-length STING inside cells, we observed that the recombinant TM-deficient STING protein complexed with cGAMP could effectively trigger STING signaling when delivered in vitro and in vivo, including in STING-deficient cell lines. Thus, this bioinspired method using TM-deficient STING may present a universally applicable platform for cGAMP delivery.},

Optical spectroscopies are the dominant tools used to unravel the physical and chemical features of individual molecules and have substantially contributed to surface science and biotechnology. In particular, Raman spectroscopy can identify reaction intermediates and reveal underlying reaction mechanisms; however, SM Raman experiments are subject to intrinsically weak signal intensities and considerable signal attenuation within the spectral dispersion systems of the spectrometer. Here, to monitor the structural transformation of an SM on the millisecond time scale, a plasmonic nanocavity substrate has been used to enable Raman vibrational and fluorescence spectral signals to be simultaneously collected and correlated, which thus allows a detection of photo-induced bond cleavage between the xanthene and phenyl group of a single rhodamine B isothiocyanate molecule in real time. This technique provides a novel method for investigating light-matter interactions and chemical reactions at the SM level.},

Each nanoneedle works as a reaction chamber for parallel in situ amplification, visualization, and quantification of miRNAs as low as femtomolar, which is sufficient to detect miRNAs of a single-copy intracellular abundance with specificity to single-nucleotide variation. Using inCell-Biopsy, we analyze the temporal miRNA transcriptome over the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

In this study, we show that undercoordinated atoms induce bond formation and breaking, with much lower energy barriers than the STW-type bond rotation. We refer to them as mediator atoms due to their mediating role in the breaking and forming of bonds. Here, we report the direct observation of mediator atoms in graphene defect structures using AC-TEM and annular dark-field scanning TEM (ADF-STEM) and explain their catalytic role by tight-binding molecular dynamics (TBMD) simulations and image simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

While most of the investigated regions show well-aligned nanostructure and crystal structure, consistent with current bone models, we report a localized difference in orientation distribution between the nanostructure and the biomineral crystals in specific bands. Our results show a robust and systematic, but localized, variation in the alignment of the two signals, which can be interpreted as either an additional mineral fraction in bone, a preferentially aligned extrafibrillar fraction, or the result of transverse stacking of mineral particles over several fibrils.},

Whether muscle regulates T cell exhaustion remains incompletely understood. We report that mouse skeletal muscle increased interleukin (IL)–15 production during LCMV clone 13 chronic infection. Muscle-specific ablation of Il15 enhanced the CD8 + T cell exhaustion phenotype. Muscle-derived IL-15 was required to maintain a population of CD8 + CD103 + muscle-infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs). MILs resided in a less inflamed microenvironment, expressed more T cell factor 1 (Tcf1), and had higher proliferative potential than splenic T cells. MILs differentiated into functional effector T cells after reentering lymphoid tissues. Increasing muscle mass via muscle-specific inhibition of TGFβ signaling enhanced IL-15 production and antiviral CD8 + T cell responses. We conclude that skeletal muscle antagonizes T cell exhaustion by protecting T cell proliferative potential from inflammation and replenishing the effector T cell progeny pool in lymphoid organs.},

Previous efforts to engineer a minimal activator from λ Cro resulted in no activity in vivo in cells. In this study, we show that directed evolution results in a new Cro activator-repressor that functions as efficiently as λ cI in vivo. To achieve this, we develop phagemid-assisted continuous evolution (PACEmid). We find that a peptide as small as 63 amino acids functions efficiently as an activator and/or repressor. To our knowledge, this is the smallest protein activator that enables polymerase recruitment, highlighting the capacity of transcription factors to evolve from very short peptide sequences.},

The DH2018 differed from previous events in being preceded by extreme spring warming and brightening, but moderate rainfall deficits, yet registering the fastest transition between wet winter conditions and extreme summer drought. Using 11 vegetation models, we show that spring conditions promoted increased vegetation growth, which, in turn, contributed to fast soil moisture depletion, amplifying the summer drought. We find regional asymmetries in summer ecosystem carbon fluxes: increased (reduced) sink in the northern (southern) areas affected by drought. These asymmetries can be explained by distinct legacy effects of spring growth and of water-use efficiency dynamics mediated by vegetation composition, rather than by distinct ecosystem responses to summer heat/drought. The asymmetries in carbon and water exchanges during spring and summer 2018 suggest that future land-management strategies could influence patterns of summer heat waves and droughts under long-term warming.},

  abstract     = {The detection of different frequencies in sound is accomplished with remarkable precision by the basilar membrane (BM), an elastic, ribbon-like structure with graded stiffness along the cochlear spiral. Sound stimulates a wave of displacement along the BM with maximal magnitude at precise, frequency-specific locations to excite neural signals that carry frequency information to the brain. Perceptual frequency discrimination requires fine resolution of this frequency map, but little is known of the intrinsic molecular features that demarcate the place of response on the BM. To investigate the role of BM microarchitecture in frequency discrimination, we deleted extracellular matrix protein emilin 2, which disturbed the filamentous organization in the BM. Emilin2 −/− mice displayed broadened mechanical and neural frequency tuning with multiple response peaks that are shifted to lower frequencies than normal. Thus, emilin 2 confers a stiffness gradient on the BM that is critical for accurate frequency resolution.},

  abstract     = {Polymeric particles have recently been used to modulate the behavior of immune cells in the treatment of various inflammatory conditions. However, there is little understanding of how physical particle parameters affect their specific interaction with different leukocyte subtypes. While particle shape is known to be a crucial factor in their phagocytosis by macrophages, where elongated particles are reported to experience reduced uptake, it remains unclear how shape influences phagocytosis by circulating phagocytes, including neutrophils that are the most abundant leukocyte in human blood. In this study, we investigated the phagocytosis of rod-shaped polymeric particles by human neutrophils relative to other leukocytes. In contrast to macrophages and other mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils were found to exhibit increased internalization of rods in ex vivo and in vivo experimentation. This result suggests that alteration of particle shape can be used to selectively target neutrophils in inflammatory pathologies where these cells play a substantial role.},

  abstract     = {GABAergic interneurons are proposed to be critical for early activity and synapse formation by directly exciting, rather than inhibiting, neurons in developing hippocampus and neocortex. However, the role of GABAergic neurons in the generation of neonatal network activity has not been tested in vivo, and recent studies have challenged the excitatory nature of early GABA. By locally manipulating interneuron activity in unanesthetized neonatal mice, we show that GABAergic neurons are excitatory in CA1 hippocampus at postnatal day 3 (P3) and are responsible for most of the spontaneous firing of pyramidal cells at that age. Hippocampal interneurons become inhibitory by P7, whereas visual cortex interneurons are already inhibitory by P3 and remain so throughout development. These regional and age-specific differences are the result of a change in chloride reversal potential, because direct activation of light-gated anion channels in glutamatergic neurons drives CA1 firing at P3, but silences it at P7 in CA1, and at all ages in visual cortex. This study in the intact brain reveals that GABAergic interneuron excitation is essential for network activity in neonatal hippocampus and confirms that visual cortical interneurons are inhibitory throughout early postnatal development.},

Here, we profiled R-loops during somatic cell reprogramming and found that dynamic changes in R-loops are essential for reprogramming and occurred before changes in gene expression. Disrupting the homeostasis of R-loops by depleting RNaseH1 or catalytic inactivation of RNaseH1 at D209 (RNaseH1 D209N ) blocks reprogramming. Sox2, but not any other factor in the Yamanaka cocktail, overcomes the inhibitory effects of RNaseH1 activity loss on reprogramming. Sox2 interacts with the reprogramming barrier factor Ddx5 and inhibits the resolvase activity of Ddx5 on R-loops and thus facilitates reprogramming. Furthermore, reprogramming efficiency can be modulated by dCas9-mediated RNaseH1/RNaseH1 D209N targeting the specific R-loop regions. Together, these results show that R-loops play important roles in reprogramming and shed light on the regulatory module of Sox2/Ddx5 on R-loops during reprogramming.},

However, few fluidic mechanisms allow for basic logic operations on rewritable fluidic paths due to cross-contamination, which leads to random interference between “fluidic bits” or droplets. Here, we introduce a mechanism that allows for contact-free gating of individual droplets based on the scalable features of acoustic streaming vortices (ASVs). By shifting the hydrodynamic equilibrium positions inside interconnected ASVs with multitonal electrical signals, different functions such as controlling the routing and gating of droplets on rewritable fluidic paths are demonstrated with minimal biochemical cross-contamination. Electrical control of this ASV-based mechanism allows for unidirectional routing and active gating behaviors, which can potentially be scaled to functional fluidic processors that can regulate the flow of droplets in a manner similar to the current in transistor arrays.},

Specifically, we injected a tumor extract into the mouse spleen to remodel its tissue structure into an immunosuppressive and proregenerative microenvironment. We implanted autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic liver cells (either primary or immortalized), which survived and proliferated in the remodeled spleen, without exerting adverse responses. Notably, the allografted primary liver cells exerted typical hepatic functions to rescue the host mice from severe liver damages including 90\% hepatectomy. Our approach shows its competence in overcoming the key challenges in tissue regeneration, including insufficient transplants, immune rejection, and poor vascularization. It may be ready for translation into new therapies to regenerate large, complex human tissue/organs.},

Here, we identify that oncogene expression, similar to other replication stress–inducing agents, induces single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps that reduce cell fitness. DNA fiber analysis and electron microscopy reveal that activation of translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases restricts replication fork slowing, reversal, and fork degradation without inducing replication gaps despite the continuation of replication during stress. Consistent with gap suppression (GS) being fundamental to cancer, we demonstrate that a small-molecule inhibitor targeting the TLS factor REV1 not only disrupts DNA replication and cancer cell fitness but also synergizes with gap-inducing therapies such as inhibitors of ATR or Wee1. Our work illuminates that GS during replication is critical for cancer cell fitness and therefore a targetable vulnerability.},

Here, we demonstrate that flow in evaporating aqueous sessile droplets containing type I collagen—a self-assembling polymer—can be harnessed to engineer hydrated networks of aligned collagen fibers. We find that Marangoni flows direct collagen fiber assembly over millimeter-scale areas in a manner that depends on the rate of self-assembly, the relative humidity of the surrounding environment, and the geometry of the droplet. Skeletal muscle cells that are incorporated into and cultured within these evaporating droplets collectively orient and subsequently differentiate into myotubes in response to aligned networks of collagen.

  abstract     = {Recent Antarctic surface climate change has been characterized by greater warming trends in West Antarctica than in East Antarctica. Although this asymmetric feature is well recognized, its origin remains poorly understood. Here, by analyzing observation data and multimodel results, we show that a west-east asymmetric internal mode amplified in austral winter originates from the harmony of the atmosphere-ocean coupled feedback off West Antarctica and the Antarctic terrain. The warmer ocean temperature over the West Antarctic sector has positive feedback, with an anomalous upper-tropospheric anticyclonic circulation response centered over West Antarctica, in which the strength of the feedback is controlled by the Antarctic topographic layout and the annual cycle. The current west-east asymmetry of Antarctic surface climate change is undoubtedly of natural origin because no external factors (e.g., orbital or anthropogenic factors) contribute to the asymmetric mode.},

  abstract     = {Solutions to poverty and ecosystem degradation are often framed as conflicting. We ask whether Indonesia’s national anti-poverty program, which transfers cash to hundreds of thousands of poor households, reduced deforestation as a side benefit. Although the program has no direct link to conservation, we estimate that it reduced tree cover loss in villages by 30\% (95\% confidence interval, 10 to 50\%). About half of the avoided losses were in primary forests, and reductions were larger when participation density was higher. The economic value of the avoided carbon emissions alone compares favorably to program implementation costs. The program’s environmental impact appears to be mediated through channels widely available in developing nations: consumption smoothing, whereby cash substitutes for deforestation as a form of insurance, and consumption substitution, whereby market-purchased goods substitute for deforestation-sourced goods. The results imply that anti-poverty programs targeted at the very poor can help achieve global environmental goals under certain conditions.},

Information components of plant metabolomes were consistent with the OD theory but contradicted the main prediction of the MT theory for herbivory-induced dynamics of metabolome compositions. From micro- to macroevolutionary scales, jasmonate signaling was confirmed as the master determinant of OD, while ethylene signaling provided fine-tuning for herbivore-specific responses annotated via MS/MS molecular networks.},

Here, we report genome-wide data from 20 ancient sub-Saharan African individuals, including the first reported ancient DNA from the DRC, Uganda, and Botswana. These data demonstrate the contraction of diverse, once contiguous hunter-gatherer populations, and suggest the resistance to interaction with incoming pastoralists of delayed-return foragers in aquatic environments. We refine models for the spread of food producers into eastern and southern Africa, demonstrating more complex trajectories of admixture than previously suggested. In Botswana, we show that Bantu ancestry post-dates admixture between pastoralists and foragers, suggesting an earlier spread of pastoralism than farming to southern Africa. Our findings demonstrate how processes of migration and admixture have markedly reshaped the genetic map of sub-Saharan Africa in the past few millennia and highlight the utility of combined archaeological and archaeogenetic approaches.},

Analogous to atomic lattices, block copolymers (BCPs) spontaneously form a rich variety of 3D nanostructures and have the potential to substantially simplify 3D nanofabrication. Here, we show that the 3D superlattice formed by BCP micelles can be controlled by lithographically defined 2D templates matching a crystallographic plane in the 3D superlattice. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy tomography, we demonstrate precise control over the lattice symmetry and orientation. Excellent ordering and substrate registration can be achieved, propagating through 284-nanometer-thick films. BCP epitaxy also showed exceptional lattice tunability, with a continuous Bain transformation from a body-centered cubic to a face-centered cubic lattice. Lattice stability was mediated by molecular packing frustration, and surface-induced lattice reconstruction was observed, leading to the formation of a unique honeycomb lattice.},

Current genomic studies in mCRC have limited scope and lack matched PDXs. Therefore, the landscape of tumor heterogeneity and its impact on the evolution of metastasis and PDXs remain undefined. We performed whole-genome, deep exome, and targeted validation sequencing of multiple primary regions, matched distant metastases, and PDXs from 11 patients with mCRC. We observed intricate clonal heterogeneity and evolution affecting metastasis dissemination and PDX clonal selection. Metastasis formation followed both monoclonal and polyclonal seeding models. In four cases, metastasis-seeding clones were not identified in any primary region, consistent with a metastasis-seeding-metastasis model. PDXs underrepresented the subclonal heterogeneity of parental tumors. These suggest that single sample tumor sequencing and current PDX models may be insufficient to guide precision medicine.},

Twenty days after the treatment, we found that all key pathologic features found in the asthmatic lung, including chronic inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, and mechanical dysregulation, were normalized. We conducted tissue- and cell-based analyses to confirm that the therapeutic intervention was mediated comprehensively by anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects of the therapy.

We show that the strong hydrogen bonding in α-phase nylon-11 serves to enhance the molecular ordering, resulting in exceptional intensity and thermal stability of surface potential. This discovery has profound implications for the field of triboelectric energy harvesting, as the presence of an enhanced surface potential leads to higher mechanical energy harvesting performance.

We present numerical modeling results that show reef islands composed of gravel material are morphodynamically resilient landforms that evolve under SLR by accreting to maintain positive freeboard while retreating lagoonward. Such island adjustment is driven by wave overtopping processes transferring sediment from the beachface to the island surface. Our results indicate that such natural adaptation of reef islands may provide an alternative future trajectory that can potentially support near-term habitability on some islands, albeit with additional management challenges. Full characterization of SLR vulnerability at a given reef island should combine morphodynamic models with assessments of climate-related impacts on freshwater supplies, carbonate sediment supply, and future wave regimes.},

The uniqueness stems from the OAM transfer from light to material, as demonstrated in electronic transitions in atomic systems. In this study, we report on the OAM transfer to electrons in solid-state systems, which has been elusive to date. Using metamaterials (periodically textured metallic disks), we show that multipolar modes of the surface electromagnetic excitations (so-called spoof localized surface plasmons) are selectively induced by the terahertz vortex beam. Our results reveal selection rules governed by the conservation of the total angular momentum, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. The efficient transfer of light’s OAM to elementary excitations in solid-state systems at room temperature opens up new possibilities of OAM manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Photoperiod is a major environmental cue that determines the floral transition from vegetative to reproductive development in flowering plants. Arabidopsis thaliana responds to photoperiodic signals mainly through a central regulator CONSTANS (CO). Although it has been suggested that phosphorylation of CO contributes to its role in photoperiodic control of flowering, how this is regulated so far remains unknown. Here, we report that a glycogen synthase kinase-3 member, SHAGGY-like kinase 12 (SK12), plays an important role in preventing precocious flowering through phosphorylating CO. Loss of function of SK12 causes early flowering. SK12 expression in seedlings is decreased during the floral transition, and its expression in vascular tissues is required for repressing flowering. SK12 interacts with and phosphorylates CO at threonine 119, thus facilitating CO degradation. Our findings suggest that site-specific phosphorylation of CO by SK12 is critical for modulating the photoperiodic output for the floral induction in Arabidopsis .},

Even when molecular interactions between genes are known, it is unclear how these translate to organism-level interactions between alleles. We therefore characterized the interplay of genetic and environmental dependencies in determining fitness by quantifying ~4000 fitness interactions between expression variants of two metabolic genes, starting from various environmentally modulated expression levels. We detect a remarkable variety of interactions dependent on initial expression levels and demonstrate that they can be quantitatively explained by a mechanistic model accounting for catabolic flux, metabolite toxicity, and expression costs. Complex fitness interactions between mutations can therefore be predicted simply from their simultaneous impact on a few connected molecular phenotypes.},

To improve this therapy, we report a strategy for VDA-induced aggregation of gold nanoparticles to further destroy tumor vascular by photothermal effect. This strategy could effectively disrupt tumor vascular and cut off the nutrition supply after just one treatment. In the murine tumor model, this strategy results in notable tumor growth inhibition and gives rise to a 92.7\% suppression of tumor growth. Besides, enhanced vascular damage could also prevent cancer cells from distant metastasis. Moreover, compared with clinical therapies, this strategy still exhibits preferable tumor suppression and metastasis inhibition ability. These results indicate that this strategy has great potential in tumor treatment and could effectively enhance tumor vascular damage and avoid the side effects caused by frequent administration.},

The naturally formed amorphous Hf 2 S layer on the cleaved [Hf 2 S] 2+ ∙2e − surface reacts with oxygen to form an outermost amorphous HfO 2 layer with ~10-nm thickness, passivating the [Hf 2 S] 2+ ∙2e − electride. The excess electrons in the [Hf 2 S] 2+ ∙2e − electride are transferred through the thin HfO 2 passivation layer to water molecules under applied electric fields, demonstrating the first electrocatalytic reaction with excellent long-term sustainability and no degradation in performance. This self-passivation mechanism in reactive conditions can advance the development of stable electrides for energy-efficient applications.},

Proteomics studies showed reduced expression of virulence-associated proteins and increased levels of cognate antitoxin, VapB22 in the Δ vapC22 mutant strain. Furthermore, both the Δ vapC22 mutant and VapB22 overexpression strains of M. tuberculosis were susceptible to killing upon exposure to oxidative stress and showed attenuated growth in guinea pigs and mice. Host transcriptome analysis suggests upregulation of the transcripts involved in innate immune responses and tissue remodeling in mice infected with the Δ vapC22 mutant strain.

When exposed to astringent compounds, hydrophobic aggregates form inside the microporous network and transform it into a micro/nanoporous structure with enhanced ionic conductivity.

Plasmon nanofocusing can generate a nanolight source through the propagation and adiabatic compressions of plasmons on a tapered metallic nanostructure, which is independent of wavelength, as it is based on the propagation, rather than resonance, of plasmons. Here, we report the generation of a white nanolight source spanning over the entire visible range through plasmon nanofocusing and demonstrate spectral bandgap nanoimaging of carbon nanotubes.

Specifically, we were able to adjust the temperature required for the formation of DNA droplets by designing the sequences. In addition, the fusion, fission, and formation of Janus-shaped droplets were controlled by sequence design and enzymatic reactions. Furthermore, modifications of proteins with sequence-designed DNAs allowed for their capture into specific droplets. Overall, our results provide a platform for designing and controlling macromolecular droplets via the information encoded in component molecules and pave the way for various applications of sequence-designed DNA such as cell mimics, synthetic membraneless organelles, and artificial molecular systems.},

It plays an important role in optics and has enabled essential polarization elements such as wave plates. In bulk crystals, it is typically constrained to linear birefringence. In metamaterials with freeform meta-atoms, however, one can engineer the optical anisotropy such that light sees different indices for arbitrary—linear, circular, or elliptical—orthogonal eigen-polarization states. Using topology-optimized metasurfaces, we demonstrate this arbitrary birefringence. It has the unique feature that it can be continuously tuned from linear to elliptical birefringence, by changing the angle of incidence. In this way, a single metasurface can operate as many wave plates in parallel, implementing different polarization transformations. Angle-tunable arbitrary birefringence expands the scope of polarization optics, enables compact and versatile polarization operations that would otherwise require cascading multiple elements, and may find applications in polarization imaging, quantum optics, and other areas.},

Here, we report the Ca isotopic compositions for 74 carbonatites and associated silicate rocks from continental and oceanic settings, spanning from 3 billion years ago to the present day, together with O and C isotopic ratios for 37 samples. Calcium-, Mg-, and Fe-rich carbonatites have isotopically lighter Ca than mantle-derived rocks such as basalts and fall within the range of isotopically light Ca from ancient marine carbonates. This signature reflects the composition of the source, which is isotopically light and is consistent with recycling of surface carbonate materials into the mantle.},

Unfortunately, constraints on data availability limit opportunities to study long-term development patterns and how population growth relates to land-use change. Using hundreds of millions of property records, we undertake the finest-resolution analysis to date, in space and time, of urbanization patterns from 1810 to 2015. Temporally consistent metrics reveal distinct long-term urban development patterns characterizing processes such as settlement expansion and densification at fine granularity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these settlement measures are robust proxies for population throughout the record and thus potential surrogates for estimating population changes at fine scales.

Combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy with noncontact atomic force microscopy, moiré superstructures with twist angles in the bismuth homostructure and the modulation of topological edge states of bismuthene were observed and studied. First-principles calculations reproduced the moiré superlattice and indicated that the structure fluctuation is ascribed to the stacking modes between bismuthene and BP-Bi, which induce spatially distributed interface interactions in the bismuth homostructure. The modulation of topological edge states is directly related to the variation of interlayer interactions.

In contrast, transgenic mice overexpressing barr1 in adipocytes were protected against the metabolic deficits caused by a high-calorie diet. Barr1 deficiency led to a myogenic reprogramming of brown adipose tissue (BAT), causing elevated plasma myostatin (Mstn) levels, which in turn led to impaired insulin signaling in multiple peripheral tissues. Additional in vivo studies indicated that barr1-mediated suppression of Mstn expression by BAT is required for maintaining euglycemia. These findings convincingly identify barr1 as a critical regulator of BAT function. Strategies aimed at enhancing barr1 activity in BAT may prove beneficial for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.},

Functional, proximity-dependent labeling and cell fractionation studies revealed that CReP, through binding eIF2α, anchors translation initiation machinery at the ER and enables local protein synthesis in this compartment. This ER site was protected from the suppression of cytoplasmic protein synthesis by acute stress responses, e.g., phosphorylation of eIF2α(S51) or mTOR blockade.

A 3.5-Å cryoEM structure of one of the antibodies in complex with the BG505 SOSIP.v5.2 trimer demonstrated that while the epitope recognized overlapped the N332 glycan supersite by contacting the GDIR motif at the base of V3, primary contacts were located in the variable V1 loop.

Theoretical models suggest that prosociality is driven by several forms of reciprocity. Although we know a great deal about how each of these forms operates in isolation, they are rarely isolated in the real world. Rather, the topological features of human social networks are such that people are often confronted with multiple types of reciprocity simultaneously. Does our current understanding of human prosociality break down if we account for the fact that the various forms of reciprocity tend to co-occur in nature? Results of a large experiment show that each basis of human reciprocity is remarkably robust to the presence of other bases. This lends strong support to existing models of prosociality and puts theory and research on firmer ground in explaining the high levels of prosociality observed in human social networks.},

The particle is birefringent and held in a linearly polarized Gaussian optical trap. It undergoes oscillations that grow rapidly in amplitude as the air pressure is reduced, seemingly in contradiction to the equipartition of energy. This behavior is reproduced in direct simulations and captured in a simplified analytical model, showing that the underlying mechanism involves nonsymmetric coupling between rotational and translational degrees of freedom. When parametrically driven, these self-sustained oscillators exhibit an ultranarrow linewidth of 2.2 μHz and an ultrahigh mechanical quality factor in excess of 2 × 10 8 at room temperature. Last, nonequilibrium motion is seen to be a generic feature of optical vacuum traps, arising for any system with symmetry lower than that of a perfect isotropic microsphere in a Gaussian trap.},

  abstract     = {Electrons, commonly moving along the applied electric field, acquire in certain magnets a dissipationless transverse velocity. This spontaneous Hall effect, found more than a century ago, has been understood in terms of the time-reversal symmetry breaking by the internal spin structure of a ferromagnetic, noncolinear antiferromagnetic, or skyrmionic form. Here, we identify previously overlooked robust Hall effect mechanism arising from collinear antiferromagnetism combined with nonmagnetic atoms at noncentrosymmetric positions. We predict a large magnitude of this crystal Hall effect in a room temperature collinear antiferromagnet RuO 2 and catalog, based on symmetry rules, extensive families of material candidates. We show that the crystal Hall effect is accompanied by the possibility to control its sign by the crystal chirality. We illustrate that accounting for the full magnetization density distribution instead of the simplified spin structure sheds new light on symmetry breaking phenomena in magnets and opens an alternative avenue toward low-dissipation nanoelectronics.},

Two nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs) bind Arp2/3 complex during activation, but the order, specific interactions, and contribution of each NPF to activation are unresolved. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of recombinantly expressed human Arp2/3 complex with two WASP family NPFs bound and address the mechanism of activation. A cross-linking assay that captures the transition of the Arps into the activated filament-like conformation shows that actin binding to NPFs favors this transition. Actin-NPF binding to Arp2 precedes binding to Arp3 and is sufficient to promote the filament-like conformation but not activation. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the NPF-binding sites reveals their distinct roles in activation and shows that, contrary to budding yeast Arp2/3 complex, NPF-mediated delivery of actin at the barbed end of both Arps is required for activation of human Arp2/3 complex.},

RING1B is overexpressed in patients with luminal breast cancer (BC) and recruited to actively transcribed genes and enhancers co-occupied by the estrogen receptor α (ERα). Whether ERα-induced transcriptional programs are mediated by RING1B is not understood. We show that prolonged estrogen administration induces transcriptional output and chromatin landscape fluctuations. RING1B loss impairs full estrogen-mediated gene expression and chromatin accessibility for key BC transcription factors. These effects were mediated, in part, by RING1B enzymatic activity and nucleosome binding functions. RING1B is recruited in a cyclic manner to ERα, FOXA1, and GRHL2 cobound sites and regulates estrogen-induced enhancers and ERα recruitment. Last, ChIP exo revealed multiple binding events of these factors at single-nucleotide resolution, including RING1B occupancy approximately 10 base pairs around ERα bound sites. We propose RING1B as a key regulator of the dynamic, liganded-ERα transcriptional regulatory circuit in luminal BC.},

Dopa oxidation is thermodynamically favorable in seawater yet barely detectable in plaques; therefore, we investigated how plaques insulate Dopa-containing mfps against oxidation. Seawater sulfate triggers an mfp3 and mfp6 liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). By combining plaque cyclic voltammetry with electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and redox-exchange chemistry, we show that Dopa-containing mfp3 and mfp6 in phase-separated droplets remain stable despite rapid oxidation in the surrounding equilibrium solution. The results suggest that a cohort of oxidation-prone proteins is endowed with phase-dependent redox stability.

If landslides occur repeatedly in particular locations within a mountain range, then they will dominate the landscape evolution of that section and could leave a fingerprint in the topography. Here, we track erosion provenance using a novel combination of the isotopic and molecular composition of organic matter deposited in Lake Paringa, New Zealand. We find that the erosion provenance has shifted markedly after four large earthquakes over 1000 years. Postseismic periods eroded organic matter from a median elevation of 722 +329 / −293 m and supplied 43\% of the sediment in the core, while interseismic periods sourced from lower elevations (459 +256 / −226 m). These results are the first demonstration that repeated large earthquakes can consistently focus erosion at high elevations, while interseismic periods appear less effective at modifying the highest parts of the topography.},

In initially filamentous PE-lacking E. coli cells, nascent PE appears first in the periplasmic leaflet. As the total PE content increases from nearly zero to 75\%, cells progressively adopt a rod shape and PE appears in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the IM. The redistribution of PE influences the distribution of the other lipids between the leaflets. This correlates with the tendency of PE and cardiolipin to regulate antagonistically lipid order of the bilayer. The results suggest that PE asymmetry is metabolically controlled to balance temporally the net rates of synthesis and translocation, satisfy envelope growth capacity, and adjust bilayer chemical and physical properties.},

Pharmacological and macrophage-specific genetic ablation of β-catenin reprogrammed M2-like TAMs to M1-like TAMs both in vitro and in various in vivo models, which was linked with the suppression of primary and metastatic lung tumor growth. An in-depth analysis of the underlying signaling events revealed that β-catenin–mediated transcriptional activation of FOS-like antigen 2 (FOSL2) and repression of the AT-rich interaction domain 5A (ARID5A) drive gene regulatory switch from M1-like TAMs to M2-like TAMs. Moreover, we found that high expressions of β-catenin and FOSL2 correlated with poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer. In conclusion, β-catenin drives a transcriptional switch in the lung tumor microenvironment, thereby promoting tumor progression and metastasis.},

Uncontrolled pro-inflammatory states are often driven by continuous positive feedback loops between pro-inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress, which cannot be resolved in a targeted manner. Here, we report on the development of multidrug nanoparticles for the mitigation of uncontrolled inflammation. The nanoparticles are made by conjugating squalene, a natural lipid, to adenosine, an endogenous immunomodulator, and then encapsulating α-tocopherol, as antioxidant. This resulted in high drug loading, biocompatible, multidrug nanoparticles. By exploiting the endothelial dysfunction at sites of acute inflammation, these multidrug nanoparticles delivered the therapeutic agents in a targeted manner, conferring survival advantage to treated animals in models of endotoxemia. Selectively delivering adenosine and antioxidants together could serve as a novel therapeutic approach for safe treatment of acute paradoxal inflammation.},

The use of graphene allows the transfer of MR LED arrays onto a copper plate, and spatially separate MR arrays offer ideal device geometry suitable for deformable LED in various shapes without serious device performance degradation. Moreover, remote heteroepitaxy also allows the wafer to be reused, allowing reproducible production of MR LEDs using a single substrate without noticeable device degradation. The remote heteroepitaxial relation is determined by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, and the density functional theory simulations clarify how the remote heteroepitaxy is made possible through graphene.},

We unequivocally identify a three-wave structure during the initial compression and a two-wave structure during the decaying shock, involving all of the known structural types of iron (α-, γ-, and ε-phase). In the final stage, negative lattice pressures are generated by the propagation of rarefaction waves, leading to the formation of expanded phases and the recovery of γ-phase.

Here, these mechanisms are tested using ensemble simulations with an Earth system model in which volcanic aerosols from a Tambora-like eruption are confined either in the Northern or the Southern Hemisphere. We show that the primary drivers of the ENSO response are the shifts of the ITCZ together with extratropical circulation changes, which affect the tropics; the ODT mechanism does not operate in our simulations. Our study highlights the importance of initial conditions in the ENSO response to tropical volcanic eruptions and provides explanations for the predominance of posteruption El Niño events and for the occasional posteruption La Niña in observations and reconstructions.},

We used whole-cell electrophysiology, two-photon microscopy, and astrocyte gene rescue to demonstrate that an impairment in astrocytic glutamate uptake promotes NMDA spike generation in dendrites of cingulate cortex pyramidal neurons and enhances output firing of these neurons. Astrocyte compensation of the defective ATPase in the cingulate cortex rescued glutamate uptake, prevented abnormal NMDA spikes, and reduced sensitivity to cranial pain triggers.

  abstract     = {β-Arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 have emerged as important signaling molecules that modulate glucose fluxes in several peripheral tissues. The potential roles of neuronally expressed β-arrestins in regulating glucose homeostasis remain unknown. We here report that mice lacking β-arrestin-1 (barr1) selectively in AgRP neurons displayed impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity when consuming an obesogenic diet, while mice overexpressing barr1 selectively in AgRP neurons were protected against obesity-associated metabolic impairments. Additional physiological, biochemical, and electrophysiological data indicated that the presence of barr1 is essential for insulin-mediated hyperpolarization of AgRP neurons. As a result, barr1 expressed by AgRP neurons regulates efferent neuronal pathways that suppress hepatic glucose production and promote lipolysis in adipose tissue. Mice lacking β-arrestin-2 (barr2) selectively in AgRP neurons showed no substantial metabolic phenotypes. Our data suggest that agents able to enhance the activity of barr1 in AgRP neurons may prove beneficial as antidiabetic drugs.},

However, the underlying hydrogen-defect interactions leading to embrittlement are challenging to unravel. Here, we investigate an intriguing hydrogen effect to shed more light on these interactions. By designing an in situ electron channeling contrast imaging experiment of samples under no external stresses, we show that dislocations (atomic-scale line defects) can move distances reaching 1.5 μm during hydrogen desorption. Combining molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal that grain boundary hydrogen segregation can cause the required long-range resolved shear stresses, as well as short-range atomic stress fluctuations. Thus, such segregation effects should be considered widely in hydrogen research.},

We report a gradient of Meis homeodomain transcription factors along the mouse limb bud proximo-distal (PD) axis antiparallel to and shaped by the inhibitory action of distal fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Elimination of Meis results in premature limb distalization and HoxA expression, proximalization of PD segmental borders, and phocomelia. Our results show that Meis transcription factors interpret FGF signaling to convey positional information along the limb bud PD axis.

Traditionally ascribed to the “microplastics” family, their widespread occurrence in the natural environment is commonly reported in plastic pollution studies, based on the assumption that fibers largely derive from wear and tear of synthetic textiles. By compiling a global dataset from 916 seawater samples collected in six ocean basins, we show that although synthetic polymers currently account for two-thirds of global fiber production, oceanic fibers are mainly composed of natural polymers. µFT-IR characterization of ~2000 fibers revealed that only 8.2\% of oceanic fibers are synthetic, with most being cellulosic (79.5\%) or of animal origin (12.3\%). The widespread occurrence of natural fibers throughout marine environments emphasizes the necessity of chemically identifying microfibers before classifying them as microplastics. Our results highlight a considerable mismatch between the global production of synthetic fibers and the current composition of marine fibers, a finding that clearly deserves further attention.},

Ultrathin water-stable Al-MOF membranes are assembled by using the exfoliated nanosheets as building blocks. While achieving a water flux of up to 2.2 mol m −2 hour −1 bar −1 , the obtained 2D Al-MOF laminar membranes exhibit rejection rates of nearly 100\% on investigated inorganic ions.

By conducting in situ transmission electron microscopy nanomechanical testing, we observed the nucleation and growth of anti-twins in tungsten nanowires with diameters less than about 20 nm. During anti-twinning, a shear displacement of 1/3〈111〉 occurs on every successive {112} plane, in contrast to an opposite shear displacement of 1 / 6 〈 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 〉 by ordinary twinning. This asymmetry in the atomic-scale shear pathway leads to a much higher resistance to anti-twinning than ordinary twinning. However, anti-twinning can become active in nanosized BCC crystals under ultrahigh stresses, due to the limited number of plastic shear carriers in small crystal volumes. Our finding of the anti-twinning phenomenon has implications for harnessing unconventional deformation mechanisms to achieve high mechanical preformation by nanomaterials.},

Here, we report STK38, a kinase in the Hippo pathway, serves as a reader for histone H4 ufmylation to promote ATM activation in a kinase-independent manner. STK38 contains a potential UFM1 binding motif which recognizes ufmylated H4 and recruits the SUV39H1 to the double-strand breaks, resulting in H3K9 trimethylation and Tip60 activation to promote ATM activation.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional van der Waals heterojunctions (2D-vdWHs) stacked from atomically thick 2D materials are predicted to be a diverse class of electronic materials with unique electronic properties. These properties can be further tuned by sandwiching monolayers of planar organic molecules between 2D materials to form molecular 2D-vdWHs (M-2D-vdWHs), in which electricity flows in a cross-plane way from one 2D layer to the other via a single molecular layer. Using a newly developed cross-plane break junction technique, combined with density functional theory calculations, we show that M-2D-vdWHs can be created and that cross-plane charge transport can be tuned by incorporating guest molecules. The M-2D-vdWHs exhibit distinct cross-plane charge transport signatures, which differ from those of molecules undergoing in-plane charge transport.},

  abstract     = {Droplet microfluidics has become a powerful tool in precision medicine, green biotechnology, and cell therapy for single-cell analysis and selection by virtue of its ability to effectively confine cells. However, there remains a fundamental trade-off between droplet volume and sorting throughput, limiting the advantages of droplet microfluidics to small droplets (&lt;10 pl) that are incompatible with long-term maintenance and growth of most cells. We present a sequentially addressable dielectrophoretic array (SADA) sorter to overcome this problem. The SADA sorter uses an on-chip array of electrodes activated and deactivated in a sequence synchronized to the speed and position of a passing target droplet to deliver an accumulated dielectrophoretic force and gently pull it in the direction of sorting in a high-speed flow. We use it to demonstrate large-droplet sorting with ~20-fold higher throughputs than conventional techniques and apply it to long-term single-cell analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on their growth rate.},

However, the dominance of frictional forces at this scale makes classical mechanism problematic. Here, we report the design of a microscale piston, with a maximum dimension of 150 μm, fabricated with two-photon lithography onto the tip of 140-μm-diameter capillaries. An oil drop method is used to create a seal between the piston and the cylinder that prevents any leakage below 185-mbar pressure difference while providing lubricated friction between moving parts. This piston generates forces that increase linearly with pressure up to 130 μN without breaking the liquid seal. The practical value of the design is demonstrated with its integration with a microgripper that can grasp, move, and release 50-μm microspheres. Such a mechanism opens the way to micrometer-size catheter actuation.},

The amino-terminal peptide of SND1 predominantly associates with SEC61A, which anchors on ER membrane. The SN domain of SND1 catches and guides the nascent synthesized heavy chain (HC) of MHC-I to ER-associated degradation (ERAD), hindering the normal assembly of MHC-I in the ER lumen. In mice model bearing tumors, especially in transgenic OT-I mice, deletion of SND1 promotes the presentation of MHC-I in both B16F10 and MC38 cells, and the infiltration of CD8 + T cells is notably increased in tumor tissue. It was further confirmed that SND1 impaired tumor antigen presentation to cytotoxic CD8 + T cells both in vivo and in vitro. These findings reveal SND1 as a novel ER-associated protein facilitating immune evasion of tumor cells through redirecting HC to ERAD pathway that consequently interrupts antigen presentation.},

The genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution postulates that genes and language features coevolve, such that a population that is genetically predisposed to perceiving a particular linguistic feature would tend to adopt that feature in their language. Statistical studies that correlated a large number of genetic variants and linguistic features not only generated this hypothesis but also specifically pinpointed a linkage between ASPM and lexical tone. However, there is currently no direct evidence for this association and, therefore, the hypothesis. In an experimental study, we provide evidence to link ASPM with lexical tone perception in a sample of over 400 speakers of a tone language. In addition to providing the first direct evidence for the genetic-biasing hypothesis, our results have implications for further studies of linguistic anthropology and language disorders.},

It has been proposed that the environmental and immune pressures associated with different contexts of infection have different consequences for the associated bacterial populations, affecting drug susceptibility and the emergence of resistance. However, there is little concrete evidence for this model. We prospectively collected sputum samples from 18 newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve patients with tuberculosis and sequenced 795 colony-derived Mtb isolates. Mutant accumulation rates varied considerably between different bacilli isolated from the same individual, and where high rates of mutation were observed, the mutational spectrum was consistent with reactive oxygen species–induced mutagenesis. Elevated bacterial mutation rates were identified in isolates from HIV-negative but not HIV-positive individuals, suggesting that they were immune-driven. These results support the model that mutagenesis of Mtb in vivo is modulated by the host environment, which could drive the emergence of variants associated with drug resistance in a host-dependent manner.},

This approach, which we refer to as Fluorescent Labeling of Abundant Reactive Entities (FLARE), produces simple and robust stains that are modern equivalents of classic small-molecule histology stains.

Central to this endeavor is the capability to distribute and interconnect optical entangled states relying on different discrete and continuous quantum variables. Here, we report an entanglement swapping protocol connecting such entangled states. We generate single-photon entanglement and hybrid entanglement between particle- and wave-like optical qubits and then demonstrate the heralded creation of hybrid entanglement at a distance by using a specific Bell-state measurement.

Currently, this information is often derived from an empirical model (Henssge’s nomogram) describing posthumous body cooling under standard conditions. However, nonstandard conditions necessitate the use of subjective correction factors or preclude the use of Henssge’s nomogram altogether. To address this, we developed a powerful method for early PMI reconstruction using skin thermometry in conjunction with a comprehensive thermodynamic finite-difference model, which we validated using deceased human bodies. PMIs reconstructed using this approach, on average, deviated no more than ±38 minutes from their corresponding true PMIs (which ranged from 5 to 50 hours), significantly improving on the ±3 to ±7 hours uncertainty of the gold standard. Together, these aspects render this approach a widely applicable, i.e., forensically relevant, method for thermometric early PMI reconstruction.},

Mandrills ( Mandrillus sphinx ) live in matrilineal societies, in which females spend their entire lives not only with maternal half-sisters (MHS) but also with paternal half-sisters (PHS). We show that PHS have more differentiated social relationships compared to nonkin, suggesting the existence of kin recognition mechanisms. We further demonstrate that facial resemblance increases with genetic relatedness. However, PHS resemble each other visually more than MHS do, despite both kin categories sharing similar degrees of genetic relatedness.

Here, we develop a framework that enables us to examine how network structure, noise, and interference between consecutive packets jointly determine transmission performance in complex networks governed by linear dynamics. Mathematically, normal networks, which can be decomposed into separate low-dimensional information channels, suffer greatly from readout noise. Most details of their wiring have no impact on transmission quality. Non-normal networks, however, can largely cancel the effect of noise by transiently amplifying select input dimensions while ignoring others, resulting in higher net information throughput.

  abstract     = {The rheology of the metamorphosed oceanic crust may be a critical control on megathrust strength and deformation style. However, little is known about the strength and deformation style of metamorphosed basalt. Exhumed megathrust shear zones exposed on Kyushu, SW Japan, contain hydrous metabasalts deformed at temperatures between ~300° and ~500°C, spanning the inferred temperature-controlled seismic-aseismic transition. Field and microstructural observations of these shear zones, combined with quartz grain-size piezometry, indicate that metabasalts creep at shear stresses &lt;100 MPa at ~370°C and at shear stresses &lt;30 MPa at ~500°C. These values are much lower than those suggested by viscous flow laws for basalt. The implication is that relatively weak, hydrous, metamorphosed oceanic crust can creep at low viscosities over a wide shear zone and have a critical influence on plate interface strength and deformation style around the seismic-aseismic transition.},

  abstract     = {There is an unexplained terrestrial mass extinction at the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary (359 million years ago). The discovery in east Greenland of malformed land plant spores demonstrates that the extinction was coincident with elevated UV-B radiation demonstrating ozone layer reduction. Mercury data through the extinction level prove that, unlike other mass extinctions, there were no planetary scale volcanic eruptions. Importantly, the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary terrestrial mass extinction was coincident with a major climatic warming that ended the intense final glacial cycle of the latest Devonian ice age. A mechanism for ozone layer reduction during rapid warming is increased convective transport of ClO. Hence, ozone loss during rapid warming is an inherent Earth system process with the unavoidable conclusion that we should be alert for such an eventuality in the future warming world.},

We designed here a functional zwitterionic polymer that achieves a trade-off between nonspecific interactions providing the nonfouling property and a specific interaction for bioactive functionality. Built from phosphoserine, an immune-signaling molecule in nature, this zwitterionic polymer exhibits both nonfouling and immunomodulatory properties. Its conjugation to uricase is shown to proactively eradicate all unwanted immune response, outperforming the zwitterionic polymers. On the other hand, this polymer could significantly prolong the half-life of protein drugs in vivo, overcoming the innate drawback of phosphoserine in inducing accelerated clearance. Our demonstration of a nonfouling zwitterionic material with built-in immunomodulatory functionality provides new insights into the fundamental design of biomaterials, as well as far-reaching implications for broad applications such as drug delivery, implants, and cell therapy.},

The exceptionally long (60 residues) third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain (CDR H3) of NC-Cow1 forms a mini domain (knob) on an extended stalk that navigates through the dense glycan shield on Env to target a small footprint on the gp120 CD4 receptor binding site with no contact of the other CDRs to the rest of the Env trimer. These findings illustrate, in molecular detail, how an unusual vaccine-induced cow bnAb to HIV Env can neutralize with high potency and breadth.},

With light-sheet imaging of whole animals and detailed confocal studies on pigmented organs, we provide unprecedented insight into eyes, whole nervous systems, and subcellular structures in animal models ranging from worms and squids to axolotls and zebrafish.

Understanding environmental factors affecting the attachment and the early stages of the biofilm development will help develop methods of controlling the biofilm growth. Here, we show that biofilm formation is strongly affected by the flows in thin layers of bacterial suspensions controlled by surface waves. Deterministic wave patterns promote the growth of patterned biofilms, while wave-driven turbulent motion discourages patterned attachment of bacteria. Strong biofilms form under the wave antinodes, while inactive bacteria and passive particles settle under nodal points. By controlling the wavelength, its amplitude, and horizontal mobility of the wave patterns, one can shape the biofilm and either enhance the growth or discourage the formation of the biofilm. The results suggest that the deterministic wave-driven transport channels, rather than hydrodynamic forces acting on microorganisms, determine the preferred location for the bacterial attachment.},

Regulated by the special proteins on PM, the nanomotors target the thrombus site and then PM can be ruptured under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation to achieve desirable sequential drug release, including rapid release of thrombolytic urokinase (3 hours) and slow release of anticoagulant heparin (&gt;20 days). Meantime, the motion ability of nanomotors under NIR irradiation can effectively promote them to penetrate deeply in thrombus site to enhance retention ratio. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation results confirm that the synergistic effect of targeting ability from PM and motion ability from nanomotors can notably enhance the thrombolysis effect in both static/dynamic thrombus and rat model.},

The emergence of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, serving as an atomic-sized magnetometer, has promoted this technique to single-spin level, even under ambient conditions. Despite the enormous progress in spatial resolution, the current megahertz spectral resolution is still insufficient to resolve key heterogeneous molecular information. A major challenge is the short coherence times of the sample electron spins. Here, we address this challenge by using a magnetic noise–insensitive transition between states of different symmetry. We demonstrate a 27-fold narrower spectrum of single substitutional nitrogen (P1) centers in diamond with a linewidth of several kilohertz, and then some weak couplings can be resolved. Those results show both spatial and spectral advances of NV center–based EPR and provide a route toward analytical (EPR) spectroscopy at the single-molecule level.},

We used the RANGO system to a high-throughput chemical screening to identify novel direct-acting antiviral drug candidates targeting DV RdRp from the FDA-approved small-molecule library.

Previous attempts to explain the depth distribution of deep earthquakes in terms of the temperature at which possible triggering mechanisms are viable, fail to explain the spatial variability in seismicity. In addition to thermal constraints, proposed failure mechanisms for deep earthquakes all require that sufficient strain accumulates in the slab at a relatively high stress. Here, I show that simulations of subduction with nonlinear rheology and compositionally dependent phase transitions exhibit strongly variable strain rates in space and time, which is similar to observed seismicity. Therefore, in addition to temperature, variations in strain rate may explain why there are large gaps in deep seismicity (low strain rate), and variable peaks in seismicity (bending regions), and, possibly, why there is an abrupt cessation of seismicity below 660 km.},

We provide an improved reference-quality de novo genome for allotetraploid goldfish whose origin dates to ~15 million years ago. Comprehensive analyses identify changes in subgenomic evolution from asymmetrical oscillation in goldfish and common carp to diverse stabilization and balanced gene expression during continuous rediploidization. The homoeologs are coexpressed in most pathways, and their expression dominance shifts temporally during embryogenesis. Homoeolog expression correlates negatively with alternation of DNA methylation. The results show that allotetraploid cyprinids have a unique strategy for balancing subgenomic stabilization and diversification.

This high-intensity laser enables efficient generation of a multi-GeV electron beam with a high density and tens-nC charge in the first stage. Subsequently, both the laser and electron beams enter into a higher-density plasma region in the second stage. Numerical simulations demonstrate that more than 10 12 γ-ray photons/shot are produced with energy conversion efficiency above 10\% for photons above 1 MeV, and the peak brilliance is above 10 26 photons s −1 mm −2 mrad −2 per 0.1\% bandwidth at 1 MeV.

The creation of micropores (~3 μm 2 ) on the epidermal layer through a temporal pressure treatment results in the elevated expression of gap junctions, and reduced expression of occludin tight junctions. A 1 min treatment of 0.28-MPa allows nanoparticles (up to 500 nm) and macromolecules (up to 20 kDa) to reach a depth of 430-μm into the dermal layer. Using, as an example, the delivery of insulin through topical application after the pressure treatment yields up to 80\% drop in blood glucose in diabetic mice.},

  abstract     = {The mouse accessory olfactory system (AOS) supports social and reproductive behavior through the sensation of environmental chemosignals. A growing number of excreted steroids have been shown to be potent AOS cues, including bile acids (BAs) found in feces. As is still the case with most AOS ligands, the specific receptors used by vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) to detect BAs remain unknown. To identify VSN BA receptors, we first performed a deep analysis of VSN BA tuning using volumetric GCaMP6f/s Ca 2+ imaging. These experiments revealed multiple populations of BA-receptive VSNs with submicromolar sensitivities. We then developed a new physiology-forward approach for identifying AOS ligand-receptor interactions, which we call Fluorescence Live Imaging for Cell Capture and RNA sequencing, or FLICCR-seq. FLICCR-seq analysis revealed five specific V1R family receptors enriched in BA-sensitive VSNs. These studies introduce a powerful new approach for ligand-receptor matching and reveal biological mechanisms underlying mammalian BA chemosensation.},

Attempts to use observations to constrain the parameterizations of cloud processes in GCMs have failed to reduce the disagreement. We propose using observations sensitive to the relevant cloud processes rather than only to the atmospheric state and focusing on process realism in the absence of aerosol perturbations in addition to the process susceptibility to aerosols. We show that process-sensitive observations of precipitation can reduce the uncertainty on GCM estimates of rapid cloud adjustments to aerosols. The feasibility of an observational constraint depends on understanding the precipitation intensity spectrum in both observations and models and also on improving methods to compare the two.},

Many bacterial species were recently reported to exhibit several distinct swimming modes—the flagella may, for example, push the cell body or wrap around it. How do the different run modes shape the chemotaxis strategy of a multimode swimmer? Here, we investigate chemotactic motion of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida as a model organism. By simultaneously tracking the position of the cell body and the configuration of its flagella, we demonstrate that individual run modes show different chemotactic responses in nutrition gradients and, thus, constitute distinct behavioral states. On the basis of an active particle model, we demonstrate that switching between multiple run states that differ in their speed and responsiveness provides the basis for robust and efficient chemotaxis in complex natural habitats.},

We identify a combination of triple TFs Ascl1, Brn3b/3a, and Isl1 (ABI) as an efficient means to reprogram mouse and human fibroblasts into self-organized and networked induced SG (iSG) organoids. The iSG neurons exhibit molecular features, subtype diversity, electrophysiological and calcium response properties, and innervation patterns characteristic of peripheral sensory neurons. Moreover, we have defined retinal ganglion cell (RGC)–specific identifiers to demonstrate the ability for ABI to reprogram induced RGCs (iRGCs) from fibroblasts.

Here, we present genome-wide data from 101 individuals from 12 sites covering today’s France and Germany from the Mesolithic ( N = 3) to the Neolithic ( N = 98) (7000–3000 BCE). Using the genetic substructure observed in European hunter-gatherers, we characterize diverse patterns of admixture in different regions, consistent with both routes of expansion.

MRE11 mutations and aberrant expression are associated with carcinogenesis and cancer treatment outcomes. While, in recent years, progress has been made in understanding the role of Mre11 nuclease activities in DNA double-strand break repair, their role during replication has remained elusive. The nucleoside analog gemcitabine, widely used in cancer therapy, acts as a replication chain terminator; for a cell to survive treatment, gemcitabine needs to be removed from replicating DNA. Activities responsible for this removal have, so far, not been identified. We show that Mre11 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity removes gemcitabine from nascent DNA during replication. This contributes to replication progression and gemcitabine resistance. We thus uncovered a replication-supporting role for Mre11 exonuclease activity, which is distinct from its previously reported detrimental role in uncontrolled resection in recombination-deficient cells.},

We show that higher stability values of the motile phenotype (Go) are associated with reduced patient survival. Moreover, induced motile states are capable of driving GBM recurrence. We found that the Dormancy and Go phenotypes are equally represented in advanced GBM samples, with natural transitioning between the two. Furthermore, Go and Grow phenotype transitions are mostly driven by tumor-brain stimuli. These are difficult to regulate directly, but could be modulated by reprogramming tumor-associated cell types. Our framework provides a foundation for designing targeted perturbations of the tumor-brain environment, by assessing their impact on GBM phenotypic plasticity, and is corroborated by analyses of patient data.},

The pNPs first bind specifically to a membrane glycoprotein (i.e., CD105) overexpressed on angiogenetic endothelial cells in the tumor site and simultaneously transform into activated platelet-like nanofibers (apNFs) through ligand-receptor interactions. Next, the apNFs expose more binding sites and recruit and activate additional pNPs, forming artificial clots in both phantom and animal models. The pNPs are proven to be safe in mice without systemic coagulation.

We found that around half of infants were susceptible by age 1 and thus had many infections. Without the implemented vaccination campaigns, numbers of infections and hospitalizations could have been &gt;10 times higher and would predominantly affect those under 4. These results suggest that a first vaccine dose before age 1 and the second dose before age 4 could allow parents to vaccinate and protect children more effectively should a high level of vaccine hesitancy persist.

This was critical for stabilizing T eff cell functions and subverting immune-suppressive signals. T cell–specific deletion of Pcbp1 favored T reg cell differentiation, enlisted multiple inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules including PD-1, TIGIT, and VISTA on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and blunted antitumor immunity.

We show that individual transporters can function at rates varying by at least two orders of magnitude that persist for multiple turnovers. A gain-of-function mutant shows increased population of the fast-acting transporters, leading to a 10-fold increase in the mean transport rate. These findings, which are broadly consistent with earlier single-molecule measurements of Glt Ph conformational dynamics, suggest that Glt Ph transport is defined by kinetically distinct populations that exhibit long-lasting “molecular memory.”},

  abstract     = {To maintain brain homeostasis, a unique interface known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed between the blood circulation and the central nervous system (CNS). Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing 2a (Mfsd2a) is a specific marker of the BBB. However, the mechanism by which Mfsd2a influences the BBB is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that Mfsd2a is essential for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) export from endothelial cells in the brain. We found that Mfsd2a and Spinster homolog 2 (Spns2) form a protein complex to ensure the efficient transport of S1P. Furthermore, the S1P-rich microenvironment in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the vascular endothelium dominates the formation and maintenance of the BBB. We demonstrated that different concentrations of S1P have different effects on BBB integrity. These findings help to unravel the mechanism by which S1P regulates BBB and also provide previously unidentified insights into the delivery of neurological drugs in the CNS.},

Gaining insights into the inflammatory dysregulation that causes sepsis would help develop new therapeutic strategies against severe sepsis. In this study, we identified the crucial role of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the regulation of the Toll-like receptor 9–mediated proinflammatory pathway in severe sepsis progression. Hypothesizing that removing cfDNA would be beneficial for sepsis treatment, we used polyethylenimine (PEI) and synthesized PEI-functionalized, biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different charge densities as cfDNA scavengers. These nucleic acid–binding nanoparticles (NABNs) showed superior performance compared with their nucleic acid–binding polymer counterparts on inhibition of cfDNA-induced inflammation and subsequent multiple organ injury caused by severe sepsis. Furthermore, NABNs exhibited enhanced accumulation and retention in the inflamed cecum, along with a more desirable in vivo safety profile. Together, our results revealed a key contribution of cfDNA in severe sepsis and shed a light on the development of NABN-based therapeutics for sepsis therapy, which currently remains intractable.},

These 2-cell–like (2C-like) cells spontaneously transit back into the pluripotent state. We previously dissected the transcriptional dynamics of the transition from pluripotency to the totipotent 2C-like state and identified factors that modulate the process. However, how 2C-like cells transit back into the pluripotent state remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptional dynamics from the 2C-like state to pluripotent ESCs and identified an intermediate state. The intermediate state characterized by two-wave step up-regulation of pluripotent genes is different from the one observed during the 2C-like entry transition. Nonsense-mediated Dux mRNA decay plays an important role in the 2C-like state exit. Thus, our study not only provides a transcriptional roadmap for 2C-like–to–pluripotent state transition but also reveals a key molecular event driving the transition.},

Highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) drive the early particle growth and therefore substantially influence the survival of newly formed particles to CCN. Nitrogen oxide (NO x ) is known to suppress the NPF driven by HOMs, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, we examine the response of particle growth to the changes of HOM formation caused by NO x . We show that NO x suppresses particle growth in general, but the suppression is rather nonuniform and size dependent, which can be quantitatively explained by the shifted HOM volatility after adding NO x . By illustrating how NO x affects the early growth of new particles, a critical step of CCN formation, our results help provide a refined assessment of the potential climatic effects caused by the diverse changes of NO x level in forest regions around the globe.},

The systematic aggregated eco-province (SAGE) method identifies eco-provinces within a highly nonlinear ecosystem model. To accommodate the non-Gaussian covariance of the data, SAGE uses t-stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to reduce dimensionality. Over a hundred eco-provinces are identified with the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Using a connectivity graph with ecological dissimilarity as the distance metric, robust aggregated eco-provinces (AEPs) are objectively defined by nesting the eco-provinces. Using the AEPs, the control of nutrient supply rates on community structure is explored. Eco-provinces and AEPs are unique and aid model interpretation.

A gradient of charge carriers in the nanofilms under nonuniform light illumination is coupled with an electric tuning current to enhance the performance of the thermal sensing effect. As a proof of concept, we used silicon carbide (SiC) nanofilms that form nanoheterostructures on silicon (Si). The sensing performance based on the thermal excitation of charge carriers in SiC is enhanced by at least 100 times through photon excitation, with a giant temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of up to −50\%/K.

Preventative measures reduce injury incidence and/or severity, yet one-third of hospitalized patients with TBI die from secondary pathological processes that develop during supervised care. Neutrophils, which orchestrate innate immune responses, worsen TBI outcomes via undefined mechanisms. We hypothesized that formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a purported mechanism of microbial trapping, exacerbates acute neurological injury after TBI. NET formation coincided with cerebral hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia after experimental TBI, while elevated circulating NETs correlated with reduced serum deoxyribonuclease-1 (DNase-I) activity in patients with TBI. Functionally, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the downstream kinase peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) mediated NET formation and cerebrovascular dysfunction after TBI. Last, recombinant human DNase-I degraded NETs and improved neurological function. Thus, therapeutically targeting NETs may provide a mechanistically innovative approach to improve TBI outcomes without the associated risks of global neutrophil depletion.},

We find that the gain of an amino-terminal caveolin binding motif (CBM) in the α subunit of the Na/K–adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) (NKA) is required for the early stages of organogenesis in both mice and Caenorhabditis elegans . The evolutionary gain of the CBM occurred at the same time as the acquisition of the binding sites for Na + /K + . Loss of this CBM does not affect cell lineage specification or the initiation of organogenesis, but arrests further organ development. Mechanistically, this CBM is essential for the dynamic operation of Wnt and the timely up-regulation of transcriptional factors during organogenesis. These results indicate that the NKA was evolved as a dual functional protein that works in concert with Wnt as a hitherto unrecognized common mechanism to enable stem cell differentiation and organogenesis in multicellular organisms within the animal kingdom.},

Differentiating neurons delaminate from the neuroepithelium through the regulated process of apical abscission, which mediates an acute loss of polarity and primary cilium disassembly. Using high-resolution live-cell imaging in chick neural tube, we show that these cells retain an Arl13b + particle, which elongates and initiates intraflagellar trafficking as it transits toward the cell body, indicating primary cilium remodeling. Notably, disrupting cilia during and after remodeling inhibits axon extension and leads to axon collapse, respectively. Furthermore, cilium remodeling corresponds to a switch from a canonical to noncanonical cellular response to Shh.

In the absence of substrate, Lon adopts a left-handed, “open” spiral organization with autoinhibited proteolytic active sites. Upon the addition of substrate, Lon undergoes a reorganization to assemble an enzymatically active, right-handed “closed” conformer with active protease sites.

We show that simultaneous exposure to social experience and age-specific juvenile hormone (JH) induces chromatin-based reprogramming of fru M expression in Or47b neurons. Group housing and JH signaling increase fru M expression in Or47b neurons and active chromatin marks at fru M promoter. Conversely, social isolation or loss of JH signaling decreases fru M expression and increases repressive marks around fru M promoter. Our results suggest that fru M promoter integrates coincident hormone and pheromone signals driving chromatin-based changes in expression and ultimately neuronal and behavioral plasticity.},

Here, we recorded the menstrual cycle data in detail with uterine cavities observed and endometrial tissues detected after intervention, and the thicker endometria, decreased amount of fibrotic formation, increased number of endometrium glands, etc., suggested that both HA-GEL and huMSC/HA-GEL complexes could partially repair IUA caused by mechanical injury, but huMSC/HA-GEL complex transplantation had notable dual repair effects: a reliable antiadhesion property and the promotion of endometrial regeneration.},

We demonstrate that the hypoxic environment in tumors is markedly improved by in situ–generated oxygen through microalgae-mediated photosynthesis, resulting in notably radiotherapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the chlorophyll from microalgae produces reactive oxygen species during laser irradiation, further augmenting the photosensitizing effect and enhancing tumor cell apoptosis. Thus, the sequential combination of oxygen-generating algae system with radio- and phototherapies has the potential to create an innovative treatment strategy to improve the outcome of cancer management. Together, our findings demonstrate a novel approach that leverages the products of photosynthesis for treatment of tumors and provide proof-of-concept evidence for future development of algae-enhanced radio- and photodynamic therapy.},

To address this question, we use the reciprocal transplant approach to investigate the multitissue transcriptomes of chickens adapted to the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent lowland. While many genetic transcriptomic changes had occurred in the forward adaptation to the highland, plastic changes largely transform the transcriptomes to the preferred state when Tibetan chickens are brought back to the lowland. The same trend holds for egg hatchability, a key component of the chicken fitness. These findings, along with highly similar patterns in comparable experiments of guppies and Escherichia coli , demonstrate that organisms generally “remember” their ancestral environments via phenotypic plasticity and reveal a mechanism by which past experience affects future evolution.},

The DNA NC could efficiently load the Cas12a/crRNA RNP through complementation between the DNA NC and the crRNA. Addition of a cationic polymer layer condensed the DNA-templated core and allowed further coating of a charge reversal polymer layer, which makes the assembly negatively charged under a physiological pH but reverts to positive charge under an acidic environment. When Pcsk9 was selected as the target gene because of its important role in regulating the level of serum cholesterol, efficient Pcsk9 disruption was observed in vivo (~48\%), significantly reducing the expression of PCSK9 and gaining the therapeutic benefit of cholesterol control (~45\% of cholesterol reduction).},

Metabolically engineered M6 with the deletion of putA , proP , putP , and aceA , and proB mutation focused carbon flux to l -proline and released its feedback inhibition. It produced 15.7 g L −1 trans -4-hydroxy- l -proline with 10 g L −1 l -proline retained.

Finally, rationally designed l -proline hydroxylase gave 54.8 g L −1 trans -4-hydroxy- l -proline in 60 hours almost without l -proline remaining—the highest production to date.

We observe a pronounced neurovascular dissociation that occurs immediately after small-scale strokes, becomes the most severe a few days after, lasts into chronic periods, and varies with the level of ischemia. Neuronal deficits extend spatiotemporally, whereas restoration of cerebral blood flow occurs sooner and reaches a higher relative value.

Most of the coupled climate models simulate El Niño–like equatorial eastern Pacific warming after volcanic eruptions but with different amplitudes, which drive a large spread of summer monsoon weakening and corresponding precipitation reduction. Two factors are further identified for the diverse El Niño responses. Different volcanic forcings induce systematic differences in the Maritime Continent drying and subsequent westerly winds over equatorial western Pacific, varying El Niño intensity. The internally generated warm water volume over the equatorial western Pacific in the pre-eruption month also contributes to the diverse El Niño development.},

In xenograft tumors, intravital microscopy simultaneously monitored in situ single-cell activities of multiple kinases downstream of RTKs, revealing MAPKi increased TAMs and enhanced bypass signaling in TAM-proximal tumor cells.

Owing to reactive oxygen species (ROS)–responsive CO 2 generation, CRET-NPs were capable of generating a strong and long-lasting photoacoustic signal in the tumor tissue via thermal expansion–induced vaporization. In addition, the CRET phenomenon of the NPs enhanced ROS quantum yield of photosensitizer through both electron transfer for an oxygen-independent type I photochemical reaction and self-illumination for an oxygen-dependent type II photochemical reaction.

  abstract     = {While there has been impressive progress connecting bacterial behavior with electrodes, an attractive observation to facilitate advances in synthetic biology is that the growth of a bacterial colony can be determined from impedance changes over time. Here, we interface synthetic biology with microelectronics through engineered population dynamics that regulate the accumulation of charged metabolites. We demonstrate electrical detection of the bacterial response to heavy metals via a population control circuit. We then implement this approach to a synchronized genetic oscillator where we obtain an oscillatory impedance profile from engineered bacteria. We lastly miniaturize an array of electrodes to form “bacterial integrated circuits” and demonstrate its applicability as an interface with genetic circuits. This approach paves the way for new advances in synthetic biology, analytical chemistry, and microelectronic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Thermal turbulence is well known as a potent means to convey heat across space by a moving fluid. The existence of the boundary layers near the plates, however, bottlenecks its heat-exchange capability. Here, we conceptualize a mechanism of thermal vibrational turbulence that breaks through the boundary-layer limitation and achieves massive heat-transport enhancement. When horizontal vibration is applied to the convection cell, a strong shear is induced to the body of fluid near the conducting plates, which destabilizes thermal boundary layers, vigorously triggers the eruptions of thermal plumes, and leads to a heat-transport enhancement by up to 600\%. We further reveal that such a vibration-induced shear can very efficiently disrupt the boundary layers. The present findings open a new avenue for research into heat transport and will also bring profound changes in many industrial applications where thermal flux through a fluid is involved and the mechanical vibration is usually inevitable.},

DNA-coated colloids offer the possibility of realising programmable self-assembly, which, in principle, can assemble almost any structure in equilibrium, but remains challenging experimentally. Here, we propose an innovative system of linker-mediated mobile DNA-coated colloids (mDNACCs), in which mDNACCs are bridged by the free DNA linkers in solution, whose two single-stranded DNA tails can bind with specific single-stranded DNA receptors of complementary sequence coated on colloids. We formulate a mean-field theory efficiently calculating the effective interaction between mDNACCs, where the entropy of DNA linkers plays a nontrivial role. Particularly, when the binding between free DNA linkers in solution and the corresponding receptors on mDNACCs is strong, the linker-mediated colloidal interaction is determined by the linker entropy depending on the linker concentration.},

In this study, we observed that GSDMD protein was activated during intestinal inflammation in a model of chemically induced colitis. GSDMD deficiency exacerbated experimental colitis independent of changes in the microbiota and without affecting the production of antimicrobial peptides. GSDMD deficiency in macrophages, but not epithelial cells, was sufficient to drive this exacerbated experimental colitis. We further demonstrate that GSDMD functions in macrophages as a negative regulator to control cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)–dependent inflammation, thereby protecting against colitis. Moreover, the administration of cGAS inhibitor can rescue the colitogenic phenotype in GSDMD-deficient mice. Collectively, these findings provide the first demonstration of GSDMD’s role in controlling colitis and a detailed delineation of the underlying mechanism.},

Our model is the first to combine argon degassing with the thermal evolution of Earth in a self-consistent manner and to incorporate the effect of crustal recycling and reworking using the distributions of crustal formation and surface ages. Our results suggest that the history of argon degassing favors rapid crustal growth during the early Earth. The mass of continental crust, highly enriched in potassium, is estimated to have already reached &gt;80\% of the present-day level during the early Archean. The presence of such potassium-rich, likely felsic, crust has important implications for tectonics, surface environment, and the regime of mantle convection in the early Earth.},

We analyze microbiological, genomic, and epidemiological data from the largest-to-date sequenced pneumococcal carriage study in 955 infants from a refugee camp on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Using a unified framework, we simultaneously test prior hypotheses on rates of HGT and a key evolutionary covariate (duration of carriage) as determinants of resistance frequencies. We conclude that in this setting, there is little evidence of HGT playing a major role in determining resistance frequencies. Instead, observed resistance frequencies are best explained as the outcome of selection acting on a pool of variants, irrespective of the rate at which resistance determinants move between genetic lineages.},

Here, we have proposed a scalable preparation approach for RTP materials by the facile B─O click reaction between boronic acid–modified phosphors and polyhydroxy polymer matrix. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the phosphors were effectively immobilized, resulting in the suppressed nonradiative transitions and activated RTP emission. In comparison to the reported covalent binding time of several hours, such a B─O click reaction can be accomplished within 20 s under ambient environment. The developed strategy simplified the construction of polymer-based RTP polymeric materials by the introduction of facile click chemistry.

Faster-degrading, soft matrices promoted articular cartilage tissue formation of hMSCs by inducing their proliferation and maturation, while slower-degrading, stiff matrices promoted cells to differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes through Yes-associated protein (YAP)–dependent mechanotransduction. in vitro and in vivo chondrogenesis studies also suggest that down-regulation of the Wingless and INT-1 (WNT) signaling pathway is required for better quality articular cartilage-like tissue production.},

We present an 8500-year-long marsh record from the Mississippi Delta, showing that at rates of RSL rise exceeding 6 to 9 mm year −1 , marsh conversion into open water occurs in about 50 years. At rates of RSL rise exceeding ~3 mm year −1 , marsh drowning occurs within a few centuries. Because present-day rates of global sea-level rise already surpass this rate, submergence of the remaining ~15, 000 km 2 of marshland in coastal Louisiana is probably inevitable. RSL-driven tipping points for marsh drowning vary geographically, and those for the Mississippi Delta may be lower than elsewhere. Nevertheless, our findings highlight the need for consideration of longer time windows in determining the vulnerability of coastal marshes worldwide.},

Here, we analyze the genomes of worldwide domestic goats, wild caprid species, and historical remains, providing evidence of an ancient introgression event from a West Caucasian tur-like species to the ancestor of domestic goats. One introgressed locus with a strong signature of selection harbors the MUC6 gene, which encodes a gastrointestinally secreted mucin. Experiments revealed that the nearly fixed introgressed haplotype confers enhanced immune resistance to gastrointestinal pathogens. Another locus with a strong signal of selection may be related to behavior. The selected alleles at these two loci emerged in domestic goats at least 7200 and 8100 years ago, respectively, and increased to high frequencies concurrent with the expansion of the ubiquitous modern mitochondrial haplogroup A. Tracking these archaeologically cryptic evolutionary transformations provides new insights into the mechanisms of animal domestication.},

Single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing uncovered that MOF influences erythroid trajectory by dynamic recruitment to chromatin and its haploinsufficiency causes accumulation of a transient HSC population. A regulatory network consisting of MOF, RUNX1, and GFI1B is critical for erythroid fate commitment. GFI1B acts as a Mof activator which is necessary and sufficient for cell type-specific induction of Mof expression. Plasticity of Mof -depleted HSCs can be rescued by expression of a downstream effector, Gata1 , or by rebalancing acetylation via a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Accurate timing and dosage of Mof expression act as a rheostat for the feedforward transcription factor network that safeguards progression along the erythroid fate.},

Here, we use magnetic tweezers to measure the interaction between vinculin head and the talin R3 domain under physiological forces. For the first time, we resolve individual binding events as a short contraction of the unfolded talin polypeptide caused by the reformation of the vinculin-binding site helices, which dictates a biphasic mechanism that regulates this interaction. Force favors vinculin binding by unfolding talin and exposing the vinculin-binding sites; however, the coil-to-helix contraction introduces an energy penalty that increases with force, defining an optimal binding regime. This mechanism implies that the talin-vinculin-actin association could operate as a negative feedback mechanism to stabilize force on focal adhesions.},

  abstract     = {The ability to modulate neural activity in specific brain circuits remotely and systematically could revolutionize studies of brain function and treatments of brain disorders. Sound waves of high frequencies (ultrasound) have shown promise in this respect, combining the ability to modulate neuronal activity with sharp spatial focus. Here, we show that the approach can have potent effects on choice behavior. Brief, low-intensity ultrasound pulses delivered noninvasively into specific brain regions of macaque monkeys influenced their decisions regarding which target to choose. The effects were substantial, leading to around a 2:1 bias in choices compared to the default balanced proportion. The effect presence and polarity was controlled by the specific target region. These results represent a critical step towards the ability to influence choice behavior noninvasively, enabling systematic investigations and treatments of brain circuits underlying disorders of choice.},

  abstract     = {Optical pulling force (OPF) can make a nanoparticle (NP) move against the propagation direction of the incident light. Long-distance optical pulling is highly desired for nano-object manipulation, but its realization remains challenging. We propose an NP-in-cavity structure that can be pulled by a single plane wave to travel long distances when the spherical cavity wrapping the NP has a refractive index lower than the medium. An electromagnetic multipole analysis shows that NPs made of many common materials can receive the OPF inside a lower index cavity. Using a silica-Au core-shell NP that is encapsulated by a plasmonic nanobubble, we experimentally demonstrate that a single laser can pull the Au NP-in-nanobubble structure for ~0.1 mm. These results may lead to practical applications that can use the optical pulling of NP, such as optically driven nanostructure assembly and nanoswimmers.},

Despite overwhelming scientific, clinical, and public interest in this rapidly expanding field, fundamental inquiries into CAR T cell mechanistic functioning are still in their infancy. Because CAR T cells are manufactured from donor T lymphocytes, and because CARs incorporate well-characterized T cell signaling components, it has largely been assumed that CARs signal analogously to canonical T cell receptors (TCRs). However, recent studies demonstrate that many aspects of CAR signaling are unique, distinct from endogenous TCR signaling, and potentially even distinct among various CAR constructs. Thus, rigorous and comprehensive proteomic investigations are required for rational engineering of improved CARs. Here, we review what is known about proximal CAR signaling in T cells, compare it to conventional TCR signaling, and outline unmet challenges to improving CAR T cell therapy.},

MIR155HG is highly expressed by inflamed antigen-presenting cells, leading to the discovery that P155 interacts with the adenosine 5′-triphosphate binding domain of heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70), a chaperone required for antigen trafficking and presentation in dendritic cells (DCs). P155 modulates major histocompatibility complex class II–mediated antigen presentation and T cell priming by disrupting the HSC70-HSP90 machinery. Exogenously injected P155 improves two classical mouse models of DC-driven auto inflammation.

All- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) signaling is considered the key pathway that promotes Stra8 ( stimulated by retinoic acid 8 ) expression and, in turn, meiosis entry. This model, however, is debated because it is based on analyzing the effects of exogenous ATRA on ex vivo gonadal cultures, which not accurately reflects the role of endogenous ATRA. Aldh1a1 and Aldh1a2, two retinaldehyde dehydrogenases synthesizing ATRA, are expressed in the mouse ovaries when meiosis initiates. Contrary to the present view, here, we demonstrate that ATRA-responsive cells are scarce in the ovary. Using three distinct gene deletion models for Aldh1a1; Aldh1a2; Aldh1a3 , we show that Stra8 expression is independent of ATRA production by ALDH1A proteins and that germ cells progress through meiosis. Together, these data demonstrate that ATRA signaling is dispensable for instructing meiosis initiation in female germ cells.},

In the present study, we analyzed female fetuses ubiquitously lacking all ATRA nuclear receptors (RAR), obtained through a tamoxifen-inducible cre recombinase-mediated gene targeting approach. Unexpectedly, mutant oocytes robustly expressed meiotic genes, including the meiotic gatekeeper STRA8. In addition, ovaries from mutant fetuses grafted into adult recipient females yielded offspring bearing null alleles for all Rar genes. Thus, our results show that RAR are fully dispensable for meiotic initiation, as well as for the production of functional oocytes. Assuming that the effects of ATRA all rely on RAR, our study goes against the current model according to which meiosis is triggered by endogenous ATRA in the developing ovary. It therefore revives the search for the meiosis-inducing substance.},

Unexpectedly, we find that as temperature is increased, the crystal surface transforms from a disordered phase with proliferation of steps to a smooth phase with small step density.

Here, we visualize the distinct sulfur growth behaviors on Al, carbon, Ni current collectors and demonstrate that (i) liquid sulfur generated on Ni provides higher reversible capacity, faster kinetics, and better cycling life compared to solid sulfur; and (ii) Ni facilitates the phase transition (e.g., Li 2 S decomposition). Accordingly, light-weight, 3D Ni-based current collector is designed to control the deposition and catalytic conversion of sulfur species toward high-performance Li-S batteries.

  abstract     = {Fault-tolerant logic gates will consume a large proportion of the resources of a two-dimensional quantum computing architecture. Here we show how to perform a fault-tolerant non-Clifford gate with the surface code; a quantum error-correcting code now under intensive development. This alleviates the need for distillation or higher-dimensional components to complete a universal gate set. The operation uses both local transversal gates and code deformations over a time that scales with the size of the qubit array. An important component of the gate is a just-in-time decoder. These decoding algorithms allow us to draw upon the advantages of three-dimensional models using only a two-dimensional array of live qubits. Our gate is completed using parity checks of weight no greater than four. We therefore expect it to be amenable with near-future technology. As the gate circumvents the need for magic-state distillation, it may reduce the resource overhead of surface-code quantum computation considerably.},

We characterized the in vivo contributions of SWI/SNF and PcG complexes to proliferation-differentiation decisions, making use of the reproducible development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. RNA interference, lineage-specific gene knockout, and targeted degradation of SWI/SNF BAF components induced either overproliferation or acute proliferation arrest of precursor cells, depending on residual protein levels. Our data show that a high SWI/SNF BAF dosage is needed to arrest cell division during differentiation and to oppose PcG-mediated repression. In contrast, a low SWI/SNF protein level is necessary to sustain cell proliferation and hyperplasia, even when PcG repression is blocked. These observations show that incomplete inactivation of SWI/SNF components can eliminate a tumor-suppressor activity while maintaining an essential transcription regulatory function.},

Self and non-self-nucleic acids can trigger inflammation, through recognition by the cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthetase (cGAS) and subsequent activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein. Here, we show that RNA:DNA hybrids can be detected by cGAS and that the Lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) inhibits STING activation through two complementary mechanisms. First, LysRS interacts with RNA:DNA hybrids, delaying recognition by cGAS and impeding cGAMP production. Second, RNA:DNA hybrids stimulate LysRS-dependent production of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap 4 A) that in turn attenuates STING-dependent signaling. We propose a model whereby these mechanisms cooperate to buffer STING activation. Consequently, modulation of the LysRS-Ap 4 A axis in vitro or in vivo interferes with inflammatory responses. Thus, altogether, we establish LysRS and Ap 4 A as pharmacological targets to control STING signaling and treat inflammatory diseases.},

The valley-polarized PL of the MoS 2 using the antenna can reach up to ~47\%, with approximately three orders of PL magnitude enhancement within the plasmonic nanogap. Besides, the K and K′ valleys under opposite circularly polarized light excitation exhibit different emission intensities and directivities in the far field, which can be attributed to the modulation of the valley-dependent excitons by the chiral antenna in both the excitation and emission processes. The distinct features of the ultracompact hybrid suggest potential applications for valleytronic and photonic devices, chiral quantum optics, and high-sensitivity detection.},

The re-evaluated maximum flux and pulse energies integrated across water window wavelengths (284 eV to 540 eV) are 4×107 photons/s and 2 pJ, respectively, for harmonics generated in Neon and 4×106 photons/s, 0.2 pJ for harmonics generated in Helium. Thus, we incorrectly stated that the photon flux is an order of magnitude higher than previously reported, whereas the corrected numbers make our total flux comparable to previous measurements.

BHV-1 recognizes nectin-1 for cell entry via viral glycoprotein D (gD) but represents a low-affinity nectin-1 binding virus. The molecular basis underlying this low receptor-binding affinity, however, remains unknown. Here, the crystal structures of BHV-1 gD in the free and nectin-1–bound forms are presented. While showing an overall resembled nectin-1 binding mode to other alphaherpesvirus gDs, BHV-1 gD has a unique G-strand/α2-helix interloop that disturbs gD/nectin-1 interactions. Residue R188 residing in this loop is observed to otherwise cause strong steric hindrance with the bound receptor, making a large conformational change of the loop a prerequisite for nectin-1 engagement. Subsequently, substitution of R188 with glycine markedly enhances the affinity of the BHV-1-gD/nectin-1 interaction (by about fivefold). These structural and functional data delineate the receptor-recognition basis for BHV-1, which might facilitate BHV-1–based oncolytic design in the future.},

Oxygen is crucial to wound healing by regulating cell proliferation, migration, and neovascularization. However, current oxygen therapies, including hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) and topical gaseous oxygen (TGO), mainly employ gaseous oxygen delivery, which is much less effective in penetrating the skin. Here, we introduce an oxygen-producing patch, made of living microalgae hydrogel, which can produce dissolved oxygen. The superior performance of the patch that results from its dissolved oxygen delivery is &gt;100-fold much more efficient than TGO penetrating the skin. Further experiments indicate that the patch could promote cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro, and improve chronic wound healing and the survival of skin grafts in diabetic mice. We believe that the microalgae-gel patch can provide continuous dissolved oxygen to improve chronic wound healing.},

We observed substantially higher uptake in parenchyma of young (6 months) transgenic AD mice compared to age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Notably lower uptakes were observed in parenchyma and CSF of old (16 months) AD mice. Both young and old AD mice had an obviously slower CSF clearance than age-matched WT mice. This resembles recent reports of the hampered CSF clearance that leads to protein accumulation in the brain. These findings suggest that DGE MRI can identify altered glucose uptake and clearance in young AD mice upon the emergence of amyloid plaques. DGE MRI of brain parenchyma and CSF has potential for early AD stratification, especially at 3T clinical field strength MRI.},

Here, we report that the 17K protein, encoded by barley yellow dwarf viruses and related poleroviruses, delays G 2 /M transition and disrupts mitosis in both host (barley) and nonhost (fission yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana , and tobacco) cells through interrupting the function of Wee1-Cdc25-CDKA/Cdc2 via direct protein-protein interactions and alteration of CDKA/Cdc2 phosphorylation. When ectopically expressed, 17K disrupts the mitosis of cultured human cells, and HIV-1 Vpr inhibits plant cell growth. Furthermore, 17K and Vpr share similar secondary structural feature and common amino acid residues required for interacting with plant CDKA. Thus, our work reveals a distinct class of mitosis regulators that are conserved between plant and animal viruses and play active roles in viral pathogenesis.},

After reintroduction into coral host larvae, 3 of the 10 heat-evolved endosymbionts also increased the holobionts’ bleaching tolerance. Although lower levels of secreted reactive oxygen species (ROS) accompanied thermal tolerance of the heat-evolved algae, reduced ROS secretion alone did not predict thermal tolerance in symbiosis. The more tolerant symbiosis exhibited additional higher constitutive expression of algal carbon fixation genes and coral heat tolerance genes.

ATAC-seq in gliomas and glioblastomas identify hundreds of eccDNAs, including one containing the well-known EGFR gene amplicon from chr7. More than 18, 000 eccDNAs, many carrying known cancer driver genes, are identified in a pan-cancer analysis of ATAC-seq libraries from 23 tumor types. Somatically mosaic eccDNAs are identified by ATAC-seq even before amplification is recognized by genome-wide copy number variation measurements.

The second layer, however, exhibited geometries ranging from dense packing in a hexagonal honeycomb structure to quasi-crystalline particle arrangements depending on the dielectric constant of the liquid. The complex structures formed by the weaker interactions in the second particle layer were preserved, while the surface remained immersed in liquid. Fine-tuning the properties of the involved materials can thus be used to control the three-dimensional geometry of a superlattice including quasi-crystals.},

  abstract     = {CO gas molecule not only could selectively kill cancer cells but also exhibits limited anticancer efficacy because of the lack of active tumor-targeted accumulation capability. In this work, a multistage assembly/disassembly strategy is developed to construct a new intelligent nanomedicine by encapsulating a mitochondria-targeted and intramitochondrial microenvironment–responsive prodrug (FeCO-TPP) within mesoporous silica nanoparticle that is further coated with hyaluronic acid by step-by-step electrostatic assembly, realizing tumor tissue–cell–mitochondria–targeted multistage delivery and controlled release of CO in a step-by-step disassembly way. Multistage targeted delivery and controlled release of CO involve (i) the passive tumor tissue–targeted nanomedicine delivery, (ii) the active tumor cell–targeted nanomedicine delivery, (iii) the acid-responsive prodrug release, (iv) the mitochondria-targeted prodrug delivery, and (v) the ROS-responsive CO release. The developed nanomedicine has effectively augmented the efficacy and safety of CO therapy of cancer both in vitro and in vivo. The proposed multistage assembly/disassembly strategy opens a new window for targeted CO therapy.},

In this critical review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the properties of NP assemblies, particularly their animate properties. Key examples are used to illustrate critical concepts, and special emphasis is placed on animate property-dependent applications. Last, we discuss the barriers to further advances in this field.},

This phenomenon is caused by the compound nepetalactone, a volatile iridoid that also repels insects. Iridoids are present in many Lamiaceae species but were lost in the ancestor of the Nepetoideae, the subfamily containing Nepeta . Using comparative genomics, ancestral sequence reconstructions, and phylogenetic analyses, we probed the re-emergence of iridoid biosynthesis in Nepeta . The results of these investigations revealed mechanisms for the loss and subsequent re-evolution of iridoid biosynthesis in the Nepeta lineage. We present evidence for a chronology of events that led to the formation of nepetalactone biosynthesis and its metabolic gene cluster. This study provides insights into the interplay between enzyme and genome evolution in the origins, loss, and re-emergence of plant chemical diversity.},

We present the first evidence for two distinct mechanisms of structural color in palaeognath feathers. One extinct volant clade, Lithornithidae, shows evidence of elongate melanin-containing organelles uniquely associated with glossy/iridescent color, a structural color mechanism found in fossil outgroups and neognath birds. We also demonstrate a structural basis for the exceptional gloss in extant cassowary feathers. We propose gloss as an intermediate phenotype between matte and iridescent plumage, conferred by a thick and smooth feather rachis. Rachis-based structural color has not been previously investigated.

Designing a man-made system that mimicks the enzyme functionality in the dioxygen activation using both a different mechanism and structure of the active site represents a breakthrough in catalysis.

Much evidence, accumulated from multiple experimental models, has suggested that α-syn plays a role in PD pathogenesis, not only as a trigger of pathology but also as a mediator of disease progression through pathological spreading. Here, we have used a machine learning–based approach to identify unique signatures of neurodegeneration in monkeys induced by distinct α-syn pathogenic structures derived from patients with PD. Unexpectedly, our results show that, in nonhuman primates, a small amount of singular α-syn aggregates is as toxic as larger amyloid fibrils present in the LBs, thus reinforcing the need for preclinical research in this species. Furthermore, our results provide evidence supporting the true multifactorial nature of PD, as multiple causes can induce a similar outcome regarding dopaminergic neurodegeneration.},

In this study, we show that, apart from its function in HIV integration, LEDGF/p75 differentially regulates HIV transcription in latency and proviral reactivation. During latency, LEDGF/p75 suppresses proviral transcription via promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by recruiting PAF1 complex to the provirus. Following latency reversal, MLL1 complex competitively displaces PAF1 from the provirus through casein kinase II (CKII)–dependent association with LEDGF/p75. Depleting or pharmacologically inhibiting CKII prevents PAF1 dissociation and abrogates the recruitment of both MLL1 and Super Elongation Complex (SEC) to the provirus, thereby impairing transcriptional reactivation for latency reversal. These findings, therefore, provide a mechanistic understanding of how LEDGF/p75 coordinates its distinct regulatory functions at different stages of the post-integrated HIV life cycles. Targeting these mechanisms may have a therapeutic potential to eradicate HIV infection.},

The molecular basis for Rab1 binding and enzymatic modification have remained elusive because of lack of structural information of the low-affinity complex with AnkX. We combined thiol-reactive CDP-choline derivatives with recombinantly introduced cysteines in the AnkX active site to covalently capture the heterocomplex. The resulting crystal structure revealed that AnkX induces displacement of important regulatory elements of Rab1 by placing a β sheet into a conserved hydrophobic pocket, thereby permitting phosphocholine transfer to the active and inactive states of the GTPase. Together, the combination of chemical biology and structural analysis reveals the enzymatic mechanism of AnkX and the family of filamentation induced by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (FIC) proteins.},

Here, we demonstrate an approach to produce cell monolayers of human dermal fibroblasts with predesigned orientational patterns and topological defects using a photoaligned liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) that swells anisotropically in an aqueous medium. The patterns inscribed into the LCE are replicated by the tissue monolayer and cause a strong spatial variation of cells phenotype, their surface density, and number density fluctuations. Unbinding dynamics of defect pairs intrinsic to active matter is suppressed by anisotropic surface anchoring allowing the estimation of the elastic characteristics of the tissues. The demonstrated patterned LCE approach has potential to control the collective behavior of cells in living tissues, cell differentiation, and tissue morphogenesis.},

We incorporate a spiropyran (SP) force–activated mechanophore cross-linker in multiple-network elastomers. The random nature of the network structure of the polymer causes a progressive activation of the SP force probe with load, detectable by the change in color of the material. We first calibrate precisely the chromatic change in uniaxial tension. We then demonstrate that the nominal stress around a loaded crack can be detected for each pixel and that the measured values match quantitatively finite element simulations. This direct method to quantify stresses in soft materials with an internal force probe is an innovative tool that holds great potential to compare quantitatively stresses in different materials with simple optical observations.},

  abstract     = {Existing long α-helix mimicking necessitates the retention of most natural amino acid residues to maintain their biological activity. Here, we report the exploration of helical sulfono-γ-AApeptides with entire unnatural backbones for their ability to structurally and functionally mimic glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Our findings suggest that efficient construction of novel GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists could be achieved with nanomolar potencies. In addition, the resulting sulfono-γ-AApeptides were also proved to display remarkable stability against enzymatic degradation compared to GLP-1, augmenting their biological potential. This alternative strategy of α-helix mimicking, as a proof of concept, could provide a new paradigm to prepare GLP-1R agonists.},

  abstract     = {Mercury (Hg) biomagnification in aquatic food webs is a global concern; yet, the ways species traits and interactions mediate these fluxes remain poorly understood. Few pathways dominated Hg flux in the Colorado River despite large spatial differences in food web complexity, and fluxes were mediated by one functional trait, predation resistance. New Zealand mudsnails are predator resistant and a trophic dead end for Hg in food webs we studied. Fishes preferred blackflies, which accounted for 56 to 80\% of Hg flux to fishes, even where blackflies were rare. Food web properties, i.e., match/mismatch between insect production and fish consumption, governed amounts of Hg retained in the river versus exported to land. An experimental flood redistributed Hg fluxes in the simplified tailwater food web, but not in complex downstream food webs. Recognizing that species traits, species interactions, and disturbance mediate contaminant exposure can improve risk management of linked aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems.},

Instead of relying on exhaustive experimental investigations, we trained a machine learning (ML) algorithm, using a topological, path-based hash of the polymer repeating unit. We used a limited set of experimental gas permeability data for six different gases in ~700 polymeric constructs that have been measured to date to predict the gas-separation behavior of over 11, 000 homopolymers not previously tested for these properties. To test the algorithm’s accuracy, we synthesized two of the most promising polymer membranes predicted by this approach and found that they exceeded the upper bound for CO 2 /CH 4 separation performance. This ML technique, which is trained using a relatively small body of experimental data (and no simulation data), evidently represents an innovative means of exploring the vast phase space available for polymer membrane design.},

These B cells are characterized by simultaneous expression of proangiogenic cytokines including VEGF, CYR61, ADM, FGF2, PDGFA, and MDK. Consequently, supernatants from these clones efficiently promote endothelial cell tube formation. We identified CD49b and CD73 as surface markers identifying proangiogenic B cells. Circulating CD49b + CD73 + B cells showed significantly increased frequency in patients with melanoma and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), two diseases associated with angiogenesis.

Here, we show the emergence of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bands with a spatial extent of tens of nanometers in ferromagnetic superconducting diamond using scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

In the Drosophila ovary, Hh and Wnt pathways function in the niche to promote germline stem cell (GSC) progeny differentiation. Here, we show that glypican Dlp-mediated Hh and Wnt signaling interdependence operates in the niche to promote GSC progeny differentiation by preventing BMP signaling. Hh/Wnt-mediated dlp repression is essential for their signaling interdependence in niche cells and for GSC progeny differentiation by preventing BMP signaling. Mechanistically, Hh and Wnt downstream transcription factors directly bind to the same dlp regulatory region and recruit corepressors composed of transcription factor Croc and Egg/H3K9 trimethylase to repress Dlp expression. Therefore, our study reveals a novel mechanism for Hh/Wnt signaling–mediated direct dlp repression and a novel regulatory mechanism for Dlp-mediated Hh/Wnt signaling interdependence in the GSC differentiation niche.},

When transferred to mouse blastocysts, naïve hPSCs generated 0.1 to 4\% human cells, of all three germ layers, including large amounts of enucleated red blood cells, suggesting a marked acceleration of hPSC development in mouse embryos. Torin1 induced nuclear translocation of TFE3; TFE3 with mutated nuclear localization signal blocked the primed-to-naïve conversion.

However, the molecular nature of the pathogenic signals suppress adipose T regs and ILC2s in obesity remains unknown. Here, we identified the soluble isoform of interleukin (IL)–33 receptor ST2 (sST2) as an obesity-induced adipokine that attenuates IL-33 signaling and disrupts T reg /ILC2 homeostasis in adipose tissue, thereby exacerbates obesity-associated insulin resistance in mice. We demonstrated sST2 is a target of TNFα signaling in adipocytes that is countered by Zbtb7b. Fat-specific ablation of Zbtb7b augments adipose sST2 gene expression, leading to diminished fat-resident T regs /ILC2s, more pronounced adipose tissue inflammation and fibrosis, and impaired glucose homeostasis in mice. Mechanistically, Zbtb7b suppresses NF-κB activation in response to TNFα through destabilizing IκBα. These findings uncover an adipokine-immune signaling pathway that is engaged in obesity to drive the pathological changes of the immunometabolic landscape.},

  abstract     = {The malaria parasite’s complex journey through the Anopheles mosquito vector provides multiple opportunities for targeting Plasmodium with recombinant effectors at different developmental stages and different host tissues. We have designed and expressed transgenes that efficiently suppress Plasmodium infection by targeting the parasite with multiple independent endogenous and exogenous effectors at multiple infection stages to potentiate suppression and minimize the probability for development of resistance to develop. We have also addressed the fitness impact of transgene expression on the mosquito. We show that highly potent suppression can be achieved by targeting both pre-oocyst stages by transgenically overexpressing either the endogenous immune deficiency immune pathway transcription factor Rel2 or a polycistronic mRNA encoding multiple antiparasitic effectors and simultaneously targeting the sporozoite stages with an anti-sporozoite single-chain antibody fused to the antiparasitic protein Scorpine. Expression of the selected endogenous effector systems appears to pose a lower fitness cost than does the use of foreign genes.},

  abstract     = {Yearly, a quarter billion people are infected and a half a million killed by the mosquito-borne disease malaria. Lack of real-time observational tools for continuously assessing the unperturbed mosquito flight activity in situ limits progress toward improved vector control. We deployed a high-resolution entomological lidar to monitor a half-kilometer static transect adjacent to a Tanzanian village. We evaluated one-third million insect observations during five nights, four days, and one annular solar eclipse. We demonstrate in situ lidar classification of several insect families and their sexes based on their modulation signatures. We were able to compare the fine-scale spatiotemporal activity patterns of malaria vectors during ordinary days and an eclipse to disentangle phototactic activity patterns from the circadian mechanism. We observed an increased insect activity during the eclipse attributable to mosquitoes. These unprecedented findings demonstrate how lidar-based monitoring of distinct mosquito activities could advance our understanding of vector ecology.},

Macroscale in situ noninvasive spectroscopy studies of the painting in combination with synchrotron-radiation x-ray microspectroscopy investigations of a microsample and artificially aged mock-ups show that moisture and mobile chlorine compounds are key factors for promoting the oxidation of CdS, while light (photodegradation) plays a less important role. Furthermore, under exposure to humidity, parallel/secondary reactions involving dissolution, migration through the paint, and recrystallization of water-soluble phases of the paint are associated with the formation of cadmium sulfates.},

Naturally, with their increasing use, the risk of accidental damage to optical detection systems rises commensurately. Thus, various optical limiting mechanisms and devices have been proposed. However, restricted by the weak optical nonlinearity of natural materials, state-of-the-art optical limiters rely on bulk liquid or solid media, operating in the transmission mode. Device miniaturization becomes complicated with these designs while maintaining superior integrability and controllability. Here, we demonstrate a reflection-mode pulse limiter (sub–100 nm) using nanoscale refractory films made of Al 2 O 3 /TiN/Al 2 O 3 metallic quantum wells (MQWs), which provide large and ultrafast Kerr-type optical nonlinearities due to the quantum size effect of the MQW. Functional multilayers consisting of these MQWs could find important applications in nanophotonics, nonlinear optics, and meta-optics.},

Across the traits of diverse animals, Φ exhibits strong seasonal to interdecadal variations throughout the CCS, implying that resident species already experience large fluctuations in available aerobic habitat. For a key CCS species, northern anchovy, the long-term biogeographic distribution and decadal fluctuations in abundance are both highly coherent with aerobic habitat volume. Ocean warming and oxygen loss by 2100 are projected to decrease Φ below critical levels in 30 to 50\% of anchovies’ present range, including complete loss of aerobic habitat—and thus likely extirpation—from the southern CCS.

We observed that genetic, pharmacologic, or surgical removal of local sympathetic innervations promoted LPS-elicited innate immune response in the lung. Also, sympathetic ablation enhanced IL-33–elicited type 2 innate immunity. We further show that the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine, or specific agonists of the β2-adrenergic receptor, can inhibit the LPS- or IL-33–elicited immune response in a cell-intrinsic manner. Moreover, genetic deletion of the β2-adrenergic receptor produced immunomodulatory effects similar to those observed with sympathetic ablation. Together, this study elucidates the critical function of local sympathetic innervations in negatively modulating the lung innate immune responses.},

Normally, inactive in the cytoplasm, upon stimulation, IRF5 undergoes posttranslational modification(s), homodimerization, and nuclear translocation, where dimers mediate proinflammatory gene transcription. Here, we report the rational design of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) that disrupt IRF5 homodimerization. Biochemical and imaging analysis shows that IRF5-CPPs are cell permeable, noncytotoxic, and directly bind to endogenous IRF5. IRF5-CPPs were selective and afforded cell type– and species-specific inhibition. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells, inhibition of IRF5-mediated interferon-α production corresponded to a dose-dependent reduction in nuclear phosphorylated IRF5 [p(Ser 462 )IRF5], with no effect on pIRF5 levels. These data support that IRF5-CPPs function downstream of phosphorylation. Together, data support the utility of IRF5-CPPs as novel tools to probe IRF5 activation and function in disease.},

We find that, after photoexcitation at resonance to the A-exciton in WS 2 , the photoexcited holes rapidly transfer into the graphene layer while the photoexcited electrons remain in the WS 2 layer. The resulting charge-separated transient state is found to have a lifetime of ∼1 ps. We attribute our findings to differences in scattering phase space caused by the relative alignment of WS 2 and graphene bands as revealed by high-resolution ARPES.

And like potential constituents and consumers, receivers assess signals to inform their behavioral decisions.

Here, we show that females fail to make optimal mating decisions based on assessments of signal quality due to inconsistency in signal production. Natural levels of inconsistency markedly reduced female preference expression for a nonarbitrary signal of male quality. Inconsistency reshaped preferences even more profoundly than the better-known impediment of ambient noise. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of how inconsistent messaging degrades optimal decision-making in animals, with implications for understanding signal evolution.},

The hierarchical networks of transcription factors driving mammary gland development and function have been widely studied. However, the contribution of posttranscriptional gene expression reprogramming remains largely unexplored. The 3′ untranslated regions of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) contain combinatorial ensembles of cis-regulatory elements that define transcript-specific regulation of protein synthesis through their cognate RNA binding proteins. We analyze the contribution of the RNA binding cytoplasmic polyadenylation element–binding (CPEB) protein family, which collectively regulate mRNA translation for about 30\% of the genome. We find that CPEB2 is required for the integration of hormonal signaling by controlling the protein expression from a subset of ER/PR- regulated transcripts. Furthermore, CPEB2 is critical for the development of ER-positive breast tumors. This work uncovers a previously unknown gene expression regulation level in breast morphogenesis and tumorigenesis, coordinating sequential transcriptional and posttranscriptional layers of gene expression regulation.},

These measurements revealed an underlying functional modularity in which integrin class controlled adhesion size and ECM ligand specificity, while the number and type of connections between integrins and F-actin determined the force per individual integrin. In addition, we found that most integrins existed in a state of near-mechanical equilibrium, a result not predicted by existing models of cytoskeletal force transduction.

Here, we develop a dedicated platform for multiparametric exosome analysis—through simultaneous biophysical and biomolecular evaluation of the same vesicles—directly in clinical biofluids. Termed templated plasmonics for exosomes, the technology leverages in situ growth of gold nanoshells on vesicles to achieve multiselectivity. For biophysical selectivity, the nanoshell formation is templated by and tuned to distinguish exosome dimensions. For biomolecular selectivity, the nanoshell plasmonics locally quenches fluorescent probes only if they are target-bound on the same vesicle. The technology thus achieves multiplexed analysis of diverse exosomal biomarkers (e.g., proteins and microRNAs) but remains unresponsive to nonvesicle biomarkers. When implemented on a microfluidic, smartphone-based sensor, the platform is rapid, sensitive, and wash-free. It not only distinguished biomarker organizational states in native clinical samples but also showed that the exosomal subpopulation could more accurately differentiate patient prognosis.},

We investigated whether it was possible to let dipoles self-assemble into three-dimensional structures by encapsulating them in a shell with a specific shape. We found that the condition for self-assembly of a three-dimensional crystal is satisfied when the energies of dipoles in the parallel and antiparallel states are equal. Our experiments show that the most regular structures are formed using cylinders and cuboids and not by spheroids. This simple design rule will help the self-assembly community to realize three-dimensional crystals from objects in the micrometer range, which opens up the way toward previously unknown metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {Moist air is lighter than dry air at the same temperature, pressure, and volume because the molecular weight of water is less than that of dry air. We call this the vapor buoyancy effect. Although this effect is well documented, its impact on Earth’s climate has been overlooked. Here, we show that the lightness of water vapor helps to stabilize tropical climate by increasing the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). In the tropical atmosphere, buoyancy is horizontally uniform. Then, the vapor buoyancy in the moist regions must be balanced by warmer temperatures in the dry regions of the tropical atmosphere. These higher temperatures increase tropical OLR. This radiative effect increases with warming, leading to a negative climate feedback. At a near present-day surface temperature, vapor buoyancy is responsible for a radiative effect of 1 W/m 2 and a negative climate feedback of about 0.15 W/m 2 per kelvin.},

Phosphate turnover may influence assimilation fluxes by nitrifiers in the euphotic zone, which parallel those of the dark ocean. Collectively, marine nitrifiers assimilate up to 2 Pg C year −1 and 0.05 Pg P year −1 and thereby recycle roughly 5\% of mineralized C and P into marine biomass.

We have developed a fluorescence-imaging platform to simultaneously measure carboxysome number, position, and activity over time in a growing cyanobacterial population, allowing individual carboxysomes to be clustered on the basis of activity and spatial dynamics. We have demonstrated both BMC degradation, characterized by abrupt activity loss followed by polar recruitment of the deactivated complex, and a subclass of ultraproductive carboxysomes.

A series of mutational events added as many as 1.5 million nucleotides to the genome of the tobacco-adapted subspecies, M. p. nicotianae , and yielded profound increases in expression of an enzyme that efficiently detoxifies nicotine, both in aphid gut tissue and in the bacteriocytes housing the obligate aphid symbiont Buchnera aphidicola .

However, when a tunnel-containing hydrogel is immersed in water, spontaneous flow occurs through the tunnel without any pressure gradient. We confirmed this flow in a wide range of plant- and animal-derived hydrogels. The flow appears to be driven by axial concentration gradients originating from surface activities of the tunnel wall. Those activities include (i) hydrogel-water interaction and (ii) material exchange across the tunnel boundary. Unlike pressure-driven flow, this surface-induced flow has two distinct features: incident infrared energy substantially increases flow velocity, and narrower tunnels generate faster flow. Thus, surface activities in hydrogel-lined tunnels may confer kinetic energy on the enclosed fluid, with infrared as an energy source.},

Nevertheless, the molecular underpinnings of PS externalization and cellular mechanisms of PS-facilitated cell-cell fusion are unclear. Here, we report that TMEM16F, a Ca 2+ -activated phospholipid scramblase (CaPLSase), plays an essential role in placental trophoblast fusion by translocating PS to cell surface independent of apoptosis. The placentas from the TMEM16F knockout mice exhibit deficiency in trophoblast syncytialization and placental development, which lead to perinatal lethality. We thus identified a new biological function of TMEM16F CaPLSase in trophoblast fusion and placental development. Our findings provide insight into understanding cell-cell fusion mechanism of other cell types and on mitigating pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, and preeclampsia.},

The nature of this rapid acceleration, followed by a rapid slowdown and then succeeded by a second speedup, is puzzling to explain. Using an extensive observation dataset and numerical models of subduction, we show that the arrival of the Reunion mantle plume started a sequence of events that can explain this history of plate motion. The forces applied by the plume initiate an intra-oceanic subduction zone, which eventually adds enough additional force to drive the plates at the anomalously fast speeds. The two-stage closure of a double subduction system, including accretion of an island arc at 50 million years ago, may help reconcile geological evidence for a protracted India-Eurasia collision.},

Specifically, we used a facile method to induce the aggregation of stem cells into 3D spheroids, which benefited from hypoxia microenvironment–driven and enhanced secretion of proangiogenic bioactive factors. Furthermore, we artificially reconstructed 3D spheroids (i.e., ASSP) by integration of SSP-secreted factors into micro-/nanoparticles with cell membrane–derived surface coatings. The easily controllable sizes of the ASSP particles provided superior revascularization effects on the ischemic tissues in hindlimb ischemia models through local administration of ASSP microparticles and in myocardial infarction models via the systemic delivery of ASSP nanoparticles.

Follistatin (FST), a protein that binds myostatin and activin, may have the potential to enhance muscle formation while inhibiting inflammation. Here, we hypothesized that adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) delivery of FST enhances muscle formation and mitigates metabolic inflammation and knee OA caused by a high-fat diet in mice. AAV-mediated FST delivery exhibited decreased obesity-induced inflammatory adipokines and cytokines systemically and in the joint synovial fluid. Regardless of diet, mice receiving FST gene therapy were protected from post-traumatic OA and bone remodeling induced by joint injury. Together, these findings suggest that FST gene therapy may provide a multifactorial therapeutic approach for injury-induced OA and metabolic inflammation in obesity.},

  abstract     = {Superstructured colloidal materials exploit the synergies between components to develop new or enhanced functions. Cohesion is a primary requirement for scaling up these assemblies into bulk materials, and it has only been fulfilled in case-specific bases. Here, we demonstrate that the topology of nanonetworks formed from cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) enables robust superstructuring with virtually any particle. An intermixed network of fibrils with particles increases the toughness of the assemblies by up to three orders of magnitude compared, for instance, to sintering. Supramolecular cohesion is transferred from the fibrils to the constructs following a power law, with a constant decay factor for particle sizes from 230 nm to 40 μm. Our findings are applicable to other nanofiber dimensions via a rationalization of the morphological aspects of both particles and nanofibers. CNF-based cohesion will move developments of functional colloids from laboratory-scale toward their implementation in large-scale nanomanufacturing of bulk materials.},

Unlike most current soft robots that are designed as inherently and unimodally stable, our design leverages tunable snap-through bistability to fully explore the ability of soft robots to rapidly store and release energy within tens of milliseconds. We demonstrate this generic design principle with three high-performance soft machines: High-speed cheetah-like galloping crawlers with locomotion speeds of 2.68 body length/s, high-speed underwater swimmers (0.78 body length/s), and tunable low-to-high-force soft grippers with over 1 to 10 3 stiffness modulation (maximum load capacity is 11.4 kg).

We unveil the evolutionary structure of tree species assemblages across the Americas to assess whether an inability to move or an inability to evolve is the predominant constraint in plant diversification and biogeography. We find a fundamental divide in tree lineage composition between tropical and extratropical environments, defined by the absence versus presence of freezing temperatures. Within the Neotropics, we uncover a further evolutionary split between moist and dry forests. Our results demonstrate that American tree lineages tend to retain their ancestral environmental relationships and that phylogenetic niche conservatism is the primary force structuring the distribution of tree biodiversity.

The HDMP with ligand and self-assembling peptide sequence recognizes bacteria through ligand-receptor interactions and subsequently traps bacteria by an in situ adaptive self-assembly process and resulting nanofibrous networks; these trapped bacteria are unable to invade host cells. In four animal infection models, the infection rate was markedly decreased. Notably, administration of HDMP (5 mg/kg) nanoparticles increased the survival rate of mice with methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia by as much as 100\%, even more than that of vancomycin treatment (5 mg/kg, 83.3\%)–treated group, the golden standard of antibiotics.

However, its application to in vivo imaging has been limited. In this study, we optimized OS-SIM for in vivo neural imaging. We modified OS-SIM reconstruction algorithms to improve signal-to-noise ratio and correct motion-induced artifacts in live samples. Incorporating an adaptive optics (AO) module to OS-SIM, we found that correcting sample-induced optical aberrations was essential for achieving accurate structural and functional characterizations in vivo. With AO OS-SIM, we demonstrated fast, high-resolution in vivo imaging with optical sectioning for structural imaging of mouse cortical neurons and zebrafish larval motor neurons, and functional imaging of quantal synaptic transmission at Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions.},

The permafrost region covers ~42\% of the entire TP and contains ~37.21 Pg perennially frozen SOC at the baseline period (2006–2015). With continuous warming, the active layer is projected to further deepen, resulting in ~1.86 ± 0.49 Pg and ~3.80 ± 0.76 Pg permafrost carbon thawing by 2100 under moderate and high representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), respectively.

We disrupted flight by blocking the wing-expansion program, genetically disrupting flight, and by mechanical wing perturbations. We defined a new sleep regulatory circuit starting with specific wing sensory neurons, their target projection neurons in the ventral nerve cord, and the neurons they connect to in the central brain. In addition, we identified a critical neuropeptide ( burs ) and its receptor ( rickets ) that link wing expansion and sleep. Disrupting flight activates these sleep-promoting projection neurons, as indicated by increased cytosolic calcium levels, and stably increases the number of synapses in their axonal projections. These data reveal an unexpected role for flight in regulating sleep and provide new insight into how sensory processing controls sleep need.},

A characteristic MgH 2 phonon resonance is used to achieve unprecedented chemical specificity between the material states. Our results reveal that the hydride phase nucleates at grain boundaries, from where the hydrogenation progresses into the adjoining nanocrystallites. We measure a much faster nanoscopic hydride phase propagation in comparison to the macroscopic propagation dynamics.

SA, an important regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), is preferentially transported from pathogen-infected to uninfected parts via the apoplast. Apoplastic accumulation of SA, which precedes its accumulation in the cytosol, is driven by the pH gradient and deprotonation of SA. In cuticle-defective mutants, increased transpiration and reduced water potential preferentially routes SA to cuticle wax rather than to the apoplast. This results in defective long-distance transport of SA, which in turn impairs distal accumulation of the SAR-inducer pipecolic acid. High humidity reduces transpiration to restore systemic SA transport and, thereby, SAR in cuticle-defective mutants. Together, our results demonstrate that long-distance mobility of SA is essential for SAR and that partitioning of SA between the symplast and cuticle is regulated by transpiration.},

To mimic spatially controlled in vivo PAM distribution as may occur in chromatin, we investigate the effect of PAM antennae surrounding target DNA. We find that PAM antennae effectively sensitize the DNA cleavage by recruiting Cas9 molecules. Super-resolution tracking of single single-guide RNA/Cas9s reveals localized translocation of Cas9 among spatially proximal PAMs. We find that the introduction of the PAM antennae effectively modulates the microenvironment for enhanced target cleavage (up to ~50\%).

  abstract     = {The cardiac and hematopoietic progenitors (CPs and HPs, respectively) in the mesoderm ultimately form a well-organized circulation system, but mechanisms that reconcile their development remain elusive. We found that activating transcription factor 3 ( atf3 ) was highly expressed in the CPs, HPs, and mesoderm, in zebrafish. The atf3 −/− mutants exhibited atrial dilated cardiomyopathy and a high ratio of immature myeloid cells. These manifestations were primarily caused by the blockade of differentiation of both CPs and HPs within the anterior lateral plate mesoderm. Mechanistically, Atf3 targets cebpγ to repress slc2a1a -mediated glucose utilization. The high rate of glucose metabolism in atf3 −/− mutants inhibited the differentiation of progenitors by changing the redox state. Therefore, atf3 could provide CPs and HPs with metabolic adaptive capacity to changes in glucose levels. Our study provides new insights into the role of atf3 in the coordination of differentiation of CPs and HPs by regulating glucose metabolism.},

Hallmark features of AD—including generation of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, gliosis, and inflammation in the brain—are well defined; however, the cause of the disease remains elusive. Growing evidence implicates pathogens in AD development, with herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) gaining increasing attention as a potential causative agent. Here, we describe a multidisciplinary approach to produce physiologically relevant human tissues to study AD using human-induced neural stem cells (hiNSCs) and HSV-1 infection in a 3D bioengineered brain model. We report a herpes-induced tissue model of AD that mimics human disease with multicellular amyloid plaque–like formations, gliosis, neuroinflammation, and decreased functionality, completely in the absence of any exogenous mediators of AD. This model will allow for future studies to identify potential downstream drug targets for treating this devastating disease.},

This may change under greenhouse warming, but the mechanisms remain uncertain, thus limiting our ability to predict future changes in climate extremes. Using climate model simulations, we uncover the emergence of a mode of climate variability capable of generating unprecedented sea surface temperature and rainfall fluctuations across the IO. This mode, which is inhibited under present-day conditions, becomes active in climate states with a shallow thermocline and vigorous upwelling, consistent with the predictions of continued greenhouse warming. These predictions are supported by modeling and proxy evidence of an active mode during glacial intervals that favored such a state. Because of its impact on hydrological variability, the emergence of such a mode would become a first-order source of climate-related risks for the densely populated IO rim.},

Such processes are mimicked by impacting and pulling out a plate from the surface of a thickening cornstarch suspension. Here, using both experiments and simulations, we show that applying fast oscillatory shear transverse to the primary impact or extension directions tunes the degree of solidification. The forces acting on the impacting surface are modified by varying the dimensionless ratio of the orthogonal shear to the compression and extension flow rate. Simulations show varying this parameter changes the number of particle contacts governing solidification. To demonstrate this strategy in an untethered context, we show the sinking speed of a cylinder dropped onto the suspension varies markedly by changing this dimensionless ratio. These results suggest applying orthogonal shear while people are running on cornstarch would de-solidify the suspension and cause them to sink.},

We present a detailed record of vegetation and climate changes over the past 1.74 million years in a lake sediment core from the Zoige Basin, eastern Tibetan Plateau. Results show three intervals with different orbital- and millennial-scale features superimposed on a stepwise long-term cooling trend. The interval of 1.74–1.54 million years ago is characterized by an insolation-dominated mode with strong ~20, 000-year cyclicity and quasi-absent millennial-scale signal. The interval of 1.54–0.62 million years ago represents a transitional insolation-ice mode marked by ~20, 000- and ~40, 000-year cycles, with superimposed millennial-scale oscillations. The past 620, 000 years are characterized by an ice-driven mode with 100, 000-year cyclicity and less frequent millennial-scale variability. A pronounced transition occurred 620, 000 years ago, as glacial cycles intensified. These new findings reveal how the interaction of low-latitude insolation and high-latitude ice-volume forcing shaped the evolution of the Tibetan Plateau climate.},

Spike threshold adaptation enables such a discrimination but is ineffective in transmitting this information to the network. We show here that presynaptic axonal sodium channels read and transmit precise levels of input synchrony to the postsynaptic cell by modulating the presynaptic action potential (AP) amplitude. As a consequence, synaptic transmission is facilitated at cortical synapses when the presynaptic spike is produced by synchronous inputs. Using dual soma-axon recordings, imaging, and modeling, we show that this facilitation results from enhanced AP amplitude in the axon due to minimized inactivation of axonal sodium channels. Quantifying local circuit activity and using network modeling, we found that spikes induced by synchronous inputs produced a larger effect on network activity than spikes induced by asynchronous inputs. Therefore, this input synchrony–dependent facilitation may constitute a powerful mechanism, regulating synaptic transmission at proximal synapses.},

Loss of βPIX induced calpain cleavage of the endocytic adapter amphiphysin 1 to suppress clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME); direct competition of GIT1/2 for the calpain-binding site on paxillin mediates this effect. Decreased CME and thus integrin endocytosis induced abnormal integrin signaling, with elevated reactive oxygen species production. Blocking integrin signaling inhibited senescence in human fibroblasts and mouse lungs in vivo.

Impaired autophagy induced mitochondrial unfolding protein response and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, contributing to hyperinflammation. The mechanism by which VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers regulate autophagy in cystic fibrosis involves calcium transfer via mitochondrial calcium uniporter.

However, empirical studies suggest that their dynamic interplay generates the observed homophily of real-world social networks. By combining these mechanisms in a dynamic model, we confirm the longheld hypothesis that choice homophily and triadic closure cause induced homophily. We estimate how much observed homophily in friendship and communication networks is amplified due to triadic closure. We find that cumulative effects of homophily amplification can also lead to the widely documented core-periphery structure of networks, and to memory of homophilic constraints (equivalent to hysteresis in physics). The model shows that even small individual bias may prompt network-level changes such as segregation or core group dominance. Our results highlight that individual-level mechanisms should not be analyzed separately without considering the dynamics of society as a whole.},

Relapse is often triggered by retrieval of persistent alcohol memories upon exposure to alcohol-associated environmental cues, but little is known about the neuronal circuitry that supports the long-term storage of alcohol cue associations. We found that a small ensemble of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice was activated during cue-paired alcohol self-administration (SA) and that selective suppression of these neurons 1 month later attenuated cue-induced relapse to alcohol seeking. Inhibition of alcohol seeking was specific to these neurons as suppression of a non–alcohol-related or sucrose SA–activated mPFC ensemble did not affect relapse behavior. Hence, the mPFC neuronal ensemble activated during cue-paired alcohol consumption functions as a lasting memory trace that mediates cue-evoked relapse long after cessation of alcohol intake, thereby providing a potential target for treatment of alcohol relapse vulnerability.},

The site-specific rates of both direct (hydrogenolytic) and hydrogenative desulfurization routes on these active sites that consist of coordinatively unsaturated Ni and sulfhydryl groups were identical for all unsupported sulfides. The hydrogenative desulfurization rates were more than an order of magnitude higher on unsupported Ni-Mo sulfides than on Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts, while they were similar for the direct (hydrogenolytic) desulfurization. The higher activity is concluded to be caused by the lower average electronegativity, i.e., higher base strength and polarity, of Ni-Mo sulfides in the absence of the alumina support and the modified adsorption of reactants enabled by multilayer stacking. Beyond the specific catalytic reaction, the synthesis strategy points to promising scalable routes to sulfide materials broadly applied in hydrogenation and hydrotreating.},

However, a comprehensive evaluation of weather station data shows that some coastal subtropical locations have already reported a TW of 35°C and that extreme humid heat overall has more than doubled in frequency since 1979. Recent exceedances of 35°C in global maximum sea surface temperature provide further support for the validity of these dangerously high TW values. We find the most extreme humid heat is highly localized in both space and time and is correspondingly substantially underestimated in reanalysis products.

Here, we introduce an innovative method to program protein hydrogels and to induce shape changes in aqueous solutions at room temperature. We demonstrate our approach using hydrogels made from serum albumin, the most abundant protein in the blood plasma, which are synthesized in a cylindrical or flower shape. These gels are then programmed into a spring or a ring shape, respectively. The programming is performed through a marked change in stiffness (of up to 17-fold), induced by adsorption of Zn 2+ or Cu 2+ cations. We show that these programmed biomaterials can then morph back into their original shape, as the cations diffuse outside the hydrogel material. The approach demonstrated here represents an innovative strategy to program protein-based hydrogels to behave as actuators.},

In a symmetric potential, the three localized substates are degenerate and become mixed by the tunnel overlap to delocalized states separated by the tunnel splitting ν t . Although ν t can be inferred by several techniques, coherent superposition of the tunnel-split states and direct measurement of ν t have proven elusive. Here, we show that a nearby electron spin provides a handle on the tunnel transition, allowing for its excitation and readout. Unlike existing dynamical nuclear polarization techniques, our experiment transfers polarization from the electron spin to methyl proton spins with an efficiency that is independent of the magnetic field and does not rely on an unusually large tunnel splitting. Our results also demonstrate control of quantum states despite the lack of an associated transition dipole moment.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, Lewy body formation, and loss of dopaminergic neurons. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is thought to inhibit PD progression by removing damaged mitochondria and suppressing the accumulation of α-synuclein and other protein aggregates. The present study describes a protein-based therapy for PD enabled by the development of a cell-permeable Parkin protein (iCP-Parkin) with enhanced solubility and optimized intracellular delivery. iCP-Parkin recovered damaged mitochondria by promoting mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis and suppressed toxic accumulations of α-synuclein in cells and animals. Last, iCP-Parkin prevented and reversed declines in tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine expression concomitant with improved motor function induced by mitochondrial poisons or enforced α-synuclein expression. These results point to common, therapeutically tractable features in PD pathophysiology, and suggest that motor deficits in PD may be reversed, thus providing opportunities for therapeutic intervention after the onset of motor symptoms.},

We revisit these interpretations using new MAVEN magnetic field data. Weak fields are present over the 4.5-Ga old Borealis basin, with the transition to strong fields correlated with the basin edge. Magnetic fields, confined to a near-surface layer, are also detected above the 3.7-Ga old Lucus Planum. We conclude that a dynamo was present both before and after the formation of the basins Hellas, Utopia, Argyre, and Isidis. A long-lived, Earth-like dynamo is consistent with the absence of magnetization within large basins if the impacts excavated large portions of strongly magnetic crust and exposed deeper material with lower concentrations of magnetic minerals.},

This integration has previously hindered performance due to large bladder volume changes. Our solution integrates sensing-actuation elements that are bladder compatible but do not interfere with one another, achieving real-time bladder management. The system attains a highly desirable voiding target of 71 to 100\% of a rat’s bladder with a volume sensitivity of 0.7 μF/liter.

Recent studies substantiate the importance of HGT in modifying or expanding functions such as metal or reactive species detoxification and buttressing halotolerance. Yet, the potential of HGT to significantly alter the fate of species in a major eukaryotic assemblage remains to be established. We provide such an example for the ecologically important lineages encompassed by cryptophytes, rhizarians, alveolates, stramenopiles, and haptophytes (“CRASH” taxa). We describe robust evidence of prokaryotic HGTs in these taxa affecting functions such as polysaccharide biosynthesis. Numbers of HGTs range from 0.16 to 1.44\% of CRASH species gene inventories, comparable to the ca. 1\% prokaryote-derived HGTs found in the genomes of extremophilic red algae. Our results substantially expand the impact of HGT in eukaryotes and define a set of general principles for prokaryotic gene fixation in phytoplankton genomes.},

Approximately 43\% of the area where tiger breeding occurs and 57\% of the area in TCLs fell within the road-effect zone. Consequently, current road networks may be decreasing tiger and prey abundances by more than 20\%. Nearly 24, 000 km of new roads will be built in TCLs by 2050, stimulated through major investment projects such as China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

We find that autonomous directional locomotion emerges in the absence of asymmetric interaction with the environment and that a transition between modes of gel locomotion can be induced by adjusting the spatially uniform intensity of illumination or certain kinetic and mechanical system parameters. The internal wave dynamics and its structural modulation act as the impetus for signal-driven active locomotion in a manner similar to the way in which an animal’s locomotion is generated via driving by nerve pulses.

In this context, we developed a prodrug hydrogelator for local delivery of ICBs to boost the host’s immune system against tumor. We found that this carrier-free therapeutic system can serve as a reservoir for extended tumoral release of camptothecin and aPD1 antibody, resulting in an immune-stimulating tumor microenvironment for boosted PD-1 blockade immune response. Our in vivo results revealed that this combination chemoimmunotherapy elicits robust and durable systemic anticancer immunity, inducing tumor regression and inhibiting tumor recurrence and metastasis.

A useful guiding principle for the search of topological superconductors is to relate the topological invariants with the behavior of the pairing order parameter on the normal-state Fermi surfaces. The existing formulas, however, become inadequate for the prediction of the recently proposed classes of topological crystalline superconductors. In this work, we advance the theory of symmetry indicators for topological (crystalline) superconductors to cover all space groups. Our main result is the exhaustive computation of the indicator groups for superconductors under a variety of symmetry settings. We further illustrate the power of this approach by analyzing fourfold symmetric superconductors with or without inversion symmetry and show that the indicators can diagnose topological superconductors with surface states of different dimensionalities or dictate gaplessness in the bulk excitation spectrum.},

The inhibitor specifically suppressed COUP-TFII activity to regulate its target genes.

The lack of RasGRP1 in mice ( RasGRP1 −/− ) dramatically diminished LID without interfering with the therapeutic effects of l -DOPA.

  abstract     = {Disorder and many body interactions are known to impact transport and thermalization in competing ways, with the dominance of one or the other giving rise to fundamentally different dynamical phases. Here we investigate the spin diffusion dynamics of 13 C in diamond, which we dynamically polarize at room temperature via optical spin pumping of engineered color centers. We focus on low-abundance, strongly hyperfine-coupled nuclei, whose role in the polarization transport we expose through the integrated impact of variable radio-frequency excitation on the observable bulk 13 C magnetic resonance signal. Unexpectedly, we find good thermal contact throughout the nuclear spin bath, virtually independent of the hyperfine coupling strength, which we attribute to effective carbon-carbon interactions mediated by the electronic spin ensemble. In particular, observations across the full range of hyperfine couplings indicate the nuclear spin diffusion constant takes values up to two orders of magnitude greater than that expected from homo-nuclear spin couplings.},

In the present study, we report an engineered particle referred to as a “backpack” that can robustly adhere to macrophage surfaces and regulate cellular phenotypes in vivo. Backpacks evade phagocytosis for several days and release cytokines to continuously guide the polarization of macrophages toward antitumor phenotypes. We demonstrate that these antitumor phenotypes are durable, even in the strongly immunosuppressive environment of a murine breast cancer model. Conserved phenotypes led to reduced metastatic burdens and slowed tumor growths compared with those of mice treated with an equal dose of macrophages with free cytokine. Overall, these studies highlight a new pathway to control and maintain phenotypes of adoptive cellular immunotherapies.},

To date, the location and productivity potential of economically water scarce croplands remain unknown. We develop a monthly agrohydrological analysis to map agricultural regions affected by agricultural economic water scarcity. We find these regions account for up to 25\% of the global croplands, mostly across Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. Sustainable irrigation of economically water scarce croplands could feed an additional 840 million people while preventing further aggravation of blue water scarcity.},

Plough tracks were still visible, indicating sites where sediment was either removed or compacted. Locally, microbial activity was reduced up to fourfold in the affected areas. Microbial cell numbers were reduced by ~50\% in fresh “tracks” and by &lt;30\% in the old tracks.

To explore the functional behavior and dynamics of individual NSCs, we combined genetic lineage tracing, quantitative clonal analysis, intravital imaging, and global population assessments in the adult zebrafish telencephalon. Our results are compatible with a model where adult neurogenesis is organized in a hierarchy in which a subpopulation of deeply quiescent reservoir NSCs with long-term self-renewal potential generate, through asymmetric divisions, a pool of operational NSCs activating more frequently and taking stochastic fates biased toward neuronal differentiation. Our data further suggest the existence of an additional, upstream, progenitor population that supports the continuous generation of new reservoir NSCs, thus contributing to their overall expansion. Hence, we propose that the dynamics of vertebrate neurogenesis relies on a hierarchical organization where growth, self-renewal, and neurogenic functions are segregated between different NSC types.},

Using CRISPR-Cas9 homology-directed repair, we generated analog-sensitive kinase variants of CDK12 and CDK13 to probe their individual and shared biological and molecular roles. Single inhibition of CDK12 or CDK13 induced transcriptional responses associated with cellular growth signaling pathways and/or DNA damage, with minimal effects on cell viability. In contrast, dual kinase inhibition potently induced cell death, which was associated with extensive genome-wide transcriptional changes including widespread use of alternative 3′ polyadenylation sites. At the molecular level, dual kinase inhibition resulted in the loss of POLII CTD phosphorylation and greatly reduced POLII elongation rates and processivity. These data define substantial redundancy between CDK12 and CDK13 and identify both as fundamental regulators of global POLII processivity and transcription elongation.},

We delivered siRNA against integrin-β1 ( ITGB1 )—a gene that promotes invasion and metastasis—and siRNA against eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit b ( eIF-3b )—a survival gene. We demonstrated mRNA downregulation of both genes and the corresponding functional outcomes: knockdown of ITGB1 led to a significant inhibition of invasion, shown with an innovative 3D hydrogel model; and knockdown of eIF-3b resulted in significant cell death. This is the first example of diphtheria toxin being used to deliver siRNAs, and the first time a toxin-based siRNA delivery strategy has been shown to induce relevant genotypic and phenotypic effects in cancer cells.},

By combined study of colloidal dynamics in confinement, transport through a biological pore, and the folding kinetics of DNA hairpins, we demonstrate conclusively how a short-time, power-law regime of the first-passage time distribution reflects the number of intermediate states associated with each of these processes, despite their differing length scales, time scales, and interactions.

Exceptional Cambrian fossils allowed us to trace the earliest evidence of trade-offs in arthropod reproduction. † Chuandianella ovata , from the early Cambrian Chengjiang biota of China, brooded numerous (≤100 per clutch), small (Ø, ~0.5 mm) eggs under carapace flaps. The closely related † Waptia fieldensis , from the middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of Canada, also brooded young, but carried fewer (≤ 26 per clutch), larger (Ø, ~2.0 mm) eggs. The notable differences in clutch/egg sizes between these two species suggest an evolutionary trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring. The shift toward fewer, larger eggs might be an adaptive response to marine ecosystem changes through the early-middle Cambrian.

Surprisingly, the known vertebrate NB/NC transcriptional circuitry is a constrained feature also found in invertebrates. Therefore, evidence for vertebrate-specific innovations endowing vertebrate NC with multipotency is still missing. Here, we identified VENTX/NANOG and POU5/OCT4 as vertebrate-specific innovations. When VENTX was depleted in vivo and in directly-induced NC, the NC lost its early multipotent state and its skeletogenic potential, but kept sensory neuron and pigment identity, thus reminiscent of invertebrate NB precursors. In vivo, VENTX gain-of-function enabled NB specifiers to reprogram embryonic non-neural ectoderm towards early NC identity. We propose that skeletogenic NC evolved by acquiring VENTX/NANOG activity, promoting a novel multipotent progenitor regulatory state into the pre-existing sensory neuron/pigment NB program.},

Here, we demonstrate that the propagation of nonlinear waves can be as well harnessed to make flexible structures crawl. By combining experimental and theoretical methods, we show that such pulse-driven locomotion reaches a maximum efficiency when the initiated pulses are solitons and that our simple machine can move on a wide range of surfaces and even steer. Our study expands the range of possible applications of nonlinear waves and demonstrates that they offer a new platform to make flexible machines to move.},

Here, we developed exosome-mimetic extracellular nanovesicles (NVs) derived from iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)–incorporated MSCs (IONP-MSCs). The retention of injected IONP-MSC–derived NVs (IONP-NVs) within the infarcted heart was markedly augmented by magnetic guidance. Furthermore, IONPs significantly increased the levels of therapeutic molecules in IONP-MSCs and IONP-NVs, which can reduce the concern of low exosome productivity. The injection of IONP-NVs into the infarcted heart and magnetic guidance induced an early shift from the inflammation phase to the reparative phase, reduced apoptosis and fibrosis, and enhanced angiogenesis and cardiac function recovery. This approach can enhance the therapeutic potency of an MSC-derived NV therapy.},

The present study describes the design and synthesis of n-type OSCs based on challenging molecular features involving a π-electron core containing electronegative N atoms and substituents. The unique π-electron system simultaneously reinforces both electronic and structural interactions. The current n-type OSCs exhibit high electron mobilities with high reliability, atmospheric stability, and robustness against environmental and heat stresses and are superior to other existing n-type OSCs.

Moreover, spin wave branches show gaps that point to an unexpectedly large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the nearest-neighbor bond, with D 1 ≥ J 1 /2. A better understanding of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in this material should shed light on the multiferroicity of the related Ni 3 V 2 O 8 . At a higher temperature where Co 3 V 2 O 8 displays an antiferromagnetic spin density wave structure, there are no well-defined spin wave excitations, with most of the spectral weight observed in broad diffuse scattering centered at the (0, 0.5, 0) antiferromagnetic Bragg peak.},

The results presented here indicate that tendon stem/progenitor cells do not undergo osteochondrogenic differentiation when mTOR signaling is inactivated by gene knockout or rapamycin (RAPA) treatment. Meanwhile, it is necessary to deliver RAPA to the injured sites and avoid disturbing the normal tendon. A RAPA delivery system, developed using collagen hybrid peptide (CHP) to modify the surface of poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, targeted RAPA specifically to pathological tendon collagen. The CHP-PLGA-RAPA nanoparticles showed excellent pathological collagen affinity, sustained-release ability, and bioactivity. In a mouse model of tendon HO, CHP-PLGA-RAPA nanoparticles specifically bound to pathological tendon and strongly suppressed HO progression. The mTOR signaling pathway appears to be a viable therapeutic target for tendon HO, and CHP-PLGA nanoparticles may be valuable for the treatment of tendon-related diseases.},

Sulfur signatures in lazurite show dependence on the heat treatment of lapis lazuli from which it is derived. Peaks attributed to contributions from the trisulfur radical—responsible for the blue color of lazurite—increase in relative intensity with heat treatment paralleled by an intensified blue hue. Matching spectra were identified on lazurite particles from five historical paint samples, providing a marker for artists’ pigments that had been extracted from heat-treated lapis lazuli.},

Although elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is associated with the development and progression of glaucoma, the mechanisms for its regulation are not well understood. Here, we have designed CIBN/CRY2-based optogenetic constructs to study phosphoinositide regulation within distinct subcellular compartments. We show that stimulation of CRY2-OCRL, an inositol 5-phosphatase, increases aqueous humor outflow and lowers IOP in vivo, which is caused by a calcium-dependent actin rearrangement of the trabecular meshwork cells. Phosphoinositide stimulation also rescues defective aqueous outflow and IOP in a Lowe syndrome mouse model but not in IFT88 fl/fl mice that lack functional cilia. Thus, our study is the first to use optogenetics to regulate eye pressure and demonstrate that tight regulation of phosphoinositides is critical for aqueous humor homeostasis in both normal and diseased eyes.},

Therefore, we sought to enhance the clinical utility of eCAP WLBU2 in biological matrices relevant to respiratory infection.

In 3D tissue-engineered human blood vessel networks in vitro, short-term exposure (1 day) to M1 macrophages increased vessel formation, while long-term exposure (3 days) caused regression. When human tissue-engineered blood vessel networks were implanted into athymic mice, macrophages expressing markers of both M1 and M2 phenotypes wrapped around and bridged adjacent vessels and formed vessel-like structures themselves.

As previously reported in Science , the exercise improved black students’ grades and well-being in college. The present study assessed the adult outcomes of these same participants. Examining adult life at an average age of 27, black adults who had received the treatment (versus control) exercise 7 to 11 years earlier reported significantly greater career satisfaction and success, psychological well-being, and community involvement and leadership.

In addition, the adhesive and nanoporous tumor extracellular matrix hinders therapeutic dispersion. We first developed the use of magnetic resonance image (MRI)–guided focused ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles as a platform approach for transfecting brain tumors by targeting the delivery of systemically administered “brain-penetrating” nanoparticle (BPN) gene vectors across the BTB/BBB. Next, using an MRI-based transport analysis, we determined that after FUS-mediated BTB/BBB opening, mean interstitial flow velocity magnitude doubled, with “per voxel” flow directions changing by an average of ~70° to 80°. Last, we observed that FUS-mediated BTB/BBB opening increased the dispersion of directly injected BPNs through tumor tissue by &gt;100\%. We conclude that FUS-mediated BTB/BBB opening yields markedly augmented interstitial tumor flow that, in turn, plays a critical role in enhancing BPN transport through tumor tissue.},

We showed that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Vps34 kinase activity using SB02024 or SAR405 (Vps34i) decreased the tumor growth and improved mice survival in multiple tumor models by inducing an infiltration of NK, CD8 + , and CD4 + T effector cells in melanoma and CRC tumors. Such infiltration resulted in the establishment of a T cell−inflamed tumor microenvironment, characterized by the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, CCL5, CXCL10, and IFNγ. Vps34i treatment induced STAT1 and IRF7, involved in the up-regulation of CCL5 and CXCL10. Combining Vps34i improved the therapeutic benefit of anti–PD-L1/PD-1 in melanoma and CRC and prolonged mice survival.

Through solvent-free and environment-friendly VPLE processing, various linker analogs with functional groups but not for straightforward MOF crystallization are inserted into frameworks as daughter building blocks. Besides single exchange for preparing MOFs with dual linkers, VPLE can further be performed by multistage operations to obtain MOF materials with multiple linkers and functional groups. The halogen-incorporated ZIFs exhibit good porosity, tunable molecular affinity, and impressive CO 2 /N 2 and CH 4 /N 2 adsorption selectivities up to 31.1 and 10.8, respectively, which are two to six times higher than those of conventional adsorbents.

Here, we report an amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC)–based nanoassembly for tumor-targeted ferroptosis therapy, in which the totally degradable ACC substrate could synergize with the therapeutic interaction between doxorubicin (DOX) and Fe 2+ . The nanoplatform was simultaneously modified by dendrimers with metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)–sheddable PEG or targeting ligands, which offers the functional balance between circulation longevity and tumor-specific uptake. The therapeutic cargo could be released intracellularly in a self-regulated manner through acidity-triggered degradation of ACC, where DOX could amplify the ferroptosis effects of Fe 2+ by producing H 2 O 2 .

Using a global, eddying ocean model, we explore the relationship between the cross-slope transports of CDW and descending Dense Shelf Water (DSW). We find large spatial variability in CDW heat and volume transport around Antarctica, with substantially enhanced flow where DSW descends in canyons. The CDW and DSW transports are highly spatially correlated within ~20 km and temporally correlated on subdaily time scales. Focusing on the Ross Sea, we show that the relationship is driven by pulses of overflowing DSW lowering sea surface height, leading to net onshore CDW transport. The majority of simulated onshore CDW transport is concentrated in cold-water regions, rather than warm-water regions, with potential implications for ice-ocean interactions and global sea level rise.},

Here, we show that FOXO1 promotes lysosome function through the induction of the key transcription factor for lysosomal proteins, TFEB. Subdued FOXO1 reexpression in activated CD4 + T cells impairs lysosomal activity, causing an expansion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Expansion of the MVB compartment induces the sequestration of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), thereby suppressing protein turnover and enhancing glycolytic activity. As a consequence, older activated CD4 + T cells develop features reminiscent of senescent cells. They acquire an increased cell mass, preferentially differentiate into short-lived effector T cells, and secrete exosomes that harm cells in the local environment through the release of granzyme B.},

Here, we developed an optogenetically activatable Fas that works in a physiologically plausible manner. Fas activation in immature neurons of the dentate gyrus triggered mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and subsequent brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk) in neural stem cells was induced under prolonged Fas activation. Repetitive activation of this signaling network yielded proliferation of neural stem cells and a transient increase in spatial working memory in mice.

Under the working state, the redox catalyst is composed of a molten Li 2 CO 3 layer covering the solid LSF substrate. The molten layer facilitates the transport of active peroxide (O 2 2− ) species formed on LSF while blocking the nonselective sites. Spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations indicate that Fe 4+ →Fe 3+ transition is responsible for the peroxide formation, which results in both exothermic ODH and air reoxidation steps. With &gt;90\% ethylene selectivity, up to 59\% ethylene yield, and favorable heat of reactions, the core-shell redox catalyst has an excellent potential to be effective for intensified ethane conversion.

Our strategy exploits lateral dimension control to engineer shorter and less tortuous transport pathways for solvent molecules.

The methanol permeance was up to 2.9-fold higher than its large-flake GO (LFGO) counterpart, with high selectivity toward three organic dyes. More importantly, the SFGO-La 3+ membrane demonstrated robust stability for at least 24 hours under hydrodynamic stresses that are representative of realistic OSN operating conditions. These desirable attributes stem from the La 3+ cross-linking, which forms uniquely strong coordination bonds with oxygen-containing functional groups of SFGO.

Comparison of the 44°±15° Honeyeater Basalt paleolatitude with previously reported paleolatitudes requires that the average latitudinal drift rate of the East Pilbara was ≥2.5 cm/year during the ~170 Ma preceding 3180 Ma ago, a velocity comparable with those of modern plates. This result is the earliest unambiguous evidence yet uncovered for long-range lithospheric motion. Assuming this motion is due primarily to plate motion instead of true polar wander, the result is consistent with uniformitarian or episodic tectonic processes in place by 3.2 Ga ago.},

Grain boundary relaxation can be induced by deforming very fine nanograins below a critical size, typically several tens of nanometers. Here, we found that rapid heating may trigger intensive boundary relaxation of pure Cu nanograins with sizes up to submicrometers, a length scale with notable instability in metals. The rapidly heated Cu nanograins remain stable at temperatures as high as 0.6 T m (melting point), even higher than the recrystallization temperature of deformed coarse-grained Cu.

  abstract     = {Biomaterial delivery of bioactive agents and manipulation of stem cell fate are an attractive approach to promote tissue regeneration. Here, smoothened agonist sterosome is developed using small-molecule activators [20 S -hydroxycholesterol (OHC) and purmorphamine (PUR)] of the smoothened protein in the hedgehog pathway as carrier and cargo. Sterosome presents inherent osteoinductive property even without drug loading. Sterosome is covalently immobilized onto three-dimensional scaffolds via a bioinspired polydopamine intermediate to fabricate a hybrid scaffold for bone regeneration. Sterosome-immobilized hybrid scaffold not only provides a favorable substrate for cell adhesion and proliferation but also delivers bioactive agents in a sustained and spatially targeted manner. Furthermore, this scaffold significantly improves osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells through OHC/PUR-mediated synergistic activation of the hedgehog pathway and also enhances bone repair in a mouse calvarial defect model. This system serves as a versatile biomaterial platform for many applications, including therapeutic delivery and endogenous regenerative medicine.},

This system changes the paradigm of the solubility of inorganics in supercritical water. Using as an example NaOH, a low melting temperature salt, we show the possibility to precipitate it at a temperature above its melting one, leading to the instantaneous formation of the HyMoS. The molten salt is then capable of dissolving a large amount of inorganic salt, as exemplified with Na 2 SO 4 . This solvent system opens innovative ways with a potential to impact applications in many fields including materials synthesis, biomass conversion, recycling, green chemistry, catalysis, sustainable manufacturing and others. Beyond the impact on the hydrothermal community, this work also offers previously unexplored opportunities for the molten salt field with access to flow chemistry and insights regarding salt precipitation mechanism.},

While some observational evidence suggests that TC motion might have slowed significantly since the mid-20th century ( 1 ), the robustness of the observed trend and its relation to anthropogenic warming have not been firmly established ( 2 – 4 ). Using large-ensemble simulations that directly simulate TC activity, we show that future anthropogenic warming can lead to a robust slowing of TC motion, particularly in the midlatitudes. The slowdown there is related to a poleward shift of the midlatitude westerlies, which has been projected by various climate models. Although the model’s simulation of historical TC motion trends suggests that the attribution of the observed trends of TC motion to anthropogenic forcings remains uncertain, our findings suggest that 21st-century anthropogenic warming could decelerate TC motion near populated midlatitude regions in Asia and North America, potentially compounding future TC-related damages.},

Yet, the interrelations between contractility and mechanosensing, in particular, whether contractile force generation depends on mechanosensing, are not understood. We use theory and extensive experiments to study the time evolution of cellular contractile forces and show that they are generated by time-dependent actomyosin contractile displacements that are independent of the environment’s rigidity. Consequently, contractile forces are nonmechanosensitive. We further show that the force-generating displacements are directly related to the evolution of the actomyosin network, most notably to the time-dependent concentration of F-actin. The emerging picture of force generation and mechanosensitivity offers a unified framework for understanding contractility.},

However, the nonreciprocal frequency shifts demonstrated so far are not large enough for applications because they originate from interfacial effects. In addition, switching of the spin wave nonreciprocity in the electrical way remains a challenging issue. Here, we show a switchable giant nonreciprocal frequency shift of propagating spin waves in interlayer exchange–coupled synthetic antiferromagnets. The observed frequency shift is attributed to large asymmetric spin wave dispersion caused by a mutual dipolar interaction between two magnetic layers. Furthermore, we find that the sign of the frequency shift depends on relative configuration of two magnetizations, based on which we demonstrate an electrical switching of the nonreciprocity. Our findings provide a route for switchable and highly nonreciprocal spin wave–based applications.},

Here, we present a nonequilibrium synthesis strategy to address the immiscibility challenge in bimetallics. As a proof of concept, we synthesize a broad range of homogeneously alloyed Cu-based bimetallic nanoparticles regardless of the thermodynamic immiscibility. The nonequilibrated bimetallic nanoparticles are further investigated as electrocatalysts for carbon monoxide reduction at commercially relevant current densities (&gt;100 mA cm −2 ), in which Cu 0.9 Ni 0.1 shows the highest multicarbon product Faradaic efficiency of ~76\% with a current density of ~93 mA cm −2 .

Despite remarkable advances in the field of perovskite NCs, many nanostructures in inorganic NCs have not yet been realized in metal halide perovskites, and producing highly efficient blue-emitting perovskite NCs remains challenging and of great interest. Here, we report the discovery of highly efficient blue-emitting cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr 3 ) perovskite hollow NCs. By facile solution processing of CsPbBr 3 precursor solution containing ethylenediammonium bromide and sodium bromide, in situ formation of hollow CsPbBr 3 NCs with controlled particle and pore sizes is realized.

The top layer absorbs appropriate visible wavelengths to show specific colors, while the underlayer maximizes the reflection of near-to-short wavelength infrared (NSWIR) light to reduce solar heating. Consequently, the bilayer attains higher NSWIR reflectance (by 0.1 to 0.51) compared with commercial paint monolayers of the same color and stays cooler by as much as 3.0° to 15.6°C under strong sunlight. High NSWIR reflectance of 0.89 is realized in the blue bilayer.

This magnitude of emissions is 3.7\% of the gross gas extracted in the Permian, i.e., ~60\% higher than the national average leakage rate. The high methane leakage rate is likely contributed by extensive venting and flaring, resulting from insufficient infrastructure to process and transport natural gas.

Notably, DTBBQ incorporation not only enables formation of 5-nm-thick conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) nanosheets due to the steric hindrance effect of tert-butyl groups but also makes isolated cobalt sites with high oxidation state due to the presence of delocalized electron-withdrawing effect of alkene groups in DTBBQ via conjugated skeleton.

One of these mRNAs, CYP-29A3, oxidizes the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid to eicosanoids, key stress signaling molecules. While metl-5– deficient animals grow normally under homeostatic conditions, they are resistant to a variety of stresses. metl-5 mutant worms also show reduced bioactive lipid eicosanoids and dietary supplementation of eicosanoid products of CYP-29A3 restores stress sensitivity of metl-5 mutant worms. Thus, methylation of a specific residue of 18 S rRNA by METL-5 selectively enhances translation of cyp-29A3 to increase production of eicosanoids, and blocking this pathway increases stress resistance. This study suggests that ribosome methylation can facilitate selective translation, providing another layer of regulation of the stress response.},

  abstract     = {The superlative strength-to-weight ratio of carbon fibers (CFs) can substantially reduce vehicle weight and improve energy efficiency. However, most CFs are derived from costly polyacrylonitrile (PAN), which limits their widespread adoption in the automotive industry. Extensive efforts to produce CFs from low cost, alternative precursor materials have failed to yield a commercially viable product. Here, we revisit PAN to study its conversion chemistry and microstructure evolution, which might provide clues for the design of low-cost CFs. We demonstrate that a small amount of graphene can minimize porosity/defects and reinforce PAN-based CFs. Our experimental results show that 0.075 weight\% graphene-reinforced PAN/graphene composite CFs exhibits 225\% increase in strength and 184\% enhancement in Young’s modulus compared to PAN CFs. Atomistic ReaxFF and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations jointly elucidate the ability of graphene to modify the microstructure by promoting favorable edge chemistry and polymer chain alignment.},

Recent advances in additive manufacturing have made mass production of complex architectured materials technologically and economically feasible. Existing architecture design approaches such as bioinspiration, Edisonian, and optimization, however, generally rely on experienced designers’ prior knowledge, limiting broad applications of architectured materials. Particularly challenging is designing architectured materials with extreme properties, such as the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bounds on isotropic elasticity in an experience-free manner without prior knowledge. Here, we present an experience-free and systematic approach for the design of complex architectured materials with generative adversarial networks. The networks are trained using simulation data from millions of randomly generated architectures categorized based on different crystallographic symmetries. We demonstrate modeling and experimental results of more than 400 two-dimensional architectures that approach the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bounds on isotropic elastic stiffness with porosities from 0.05 to 0.75.},

The finite-temperature violation of the WF correlation is caused by a mismatch between the thermal and electrical summations of the Berry curvature and not by inelastic scattering. This interpretation is backed by our theoretical calculations, which reveals a competition between the temperature and the Berry curvature distribution. The data accuracy is supported by verifying the anomalous Bridgman relation. The anomalous Lorenz ratio is thus an extremely sensitive probe of the Berry spectrum of a solid.},

Using multiple in vitro and preclinical animal models of glioma and cholangiocarcinoma, we developed treatment strategies that use a synthetic lethality approach targeting the reduced DNA damage repair conferred by mutant IDH using poly(adenosine 5′-diphosphate) ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPis). The therapeutic effects are markedly enhanced by cotreatment with concurrent, localized radiation therapy.

Here, we found that robust function of NALCN in heterologous systems requires co-expression of UNC79, UNC80, and FAM155A. The resulting NALCN channel complex is constitutively active and conducts monovalent cations but is blocked by physiological concentrations of extracellular divalent cations. Our data support the notion that NALCN is directly responsible for the increased excitability observed in a variety of neurons in reduced extracellular Ca 2+ . Despite the smaller number of voltage-sensing residues in NALCN, the constitutive activity is modulated by voltage, suggesting that voltage-sensing domains can give rise to a broader range of gating phenotypes than previously anticipated. Our work points toward formerly unknown contributions of NALCN to neuronal excitability and opens avenues for pharmacological targeting.},

In particular, it interacts with membranes for intracellular transport of material in mammalian cells, yeast, or plant cells. Tubular membrane intermediates, pulled along microtubule tracks, are formed during this process and destabilize into vesicles. While the role of actin in tubule destabilization through scission is suggested, literature also provides examples of actin-mediated stabilization of membranous structures. To directly address this apparent contradiction, we mimic the geometry of tubular intermediates with preformed membrane tubes. The growth of an actin sleeve at the tube surface is monitored spatiotemporally. Depending on network cohesiveness, actin is able to entirely stabilize or locally maintain membrane tubes under pulling. On a single tube, thicker portions correlate with the presence of actin. These structures relax over several minutes and may provide enough time and curvature geometries for other proteins to act on tube stability.},

On the basis of a scaling argument emphasizing dynamic heterogeneity in cooled liquids and its alteration under material deformation, we deduce and validate a parameter-free scaling relation for both the structural relaxation time τ α from the intermediate scattering function and the “stretching exponent” β quantifying the extent of dynamic heterogeneity over the entire range of temperatures and shear rates that we can simulate.},

Last, using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM), we found that axons of SST + neurons in V1 often contact other axons that exhibit excitatory synapses onto the soma and proximal dendrites of the PV + neuron.

Here, we demonstrate a robust linear correlation between the Mg/Si ratios of kimberlites and their entrained mantle components and between Mg/Fe ratios of mantle-derived olivine cores and magmatic olivine rims in kimberlites worldwide. Combined with numerical modeling, these findings indicate that kimberlite melts with highly variable composition were broadly similar before lithosphere assimilation. This implies that kimberlites worldwide originated by partial melting of compositionally similar convective mantle sources under comparable physical conditions. We conclude that mantle assimilation markedly alters the major element composition of carbonate-rich melts and is a major process in the evolution of mantle-derived magmas.},

Here, we identify LHRS ( Lonicera hydroxylase rhodoxanthin synthase), a variant β-carotene hydroxylase (BCH)–type integral membrane diiron enzyme that mediates the conversion of β-carotene into rhodoxanthin. We identify residues that are critical to rhodoxanthin formation by LHRS. Substitution of only three residues converts a typical BCH into a multifunctional enzyme that mediates a multistep pathway from β-carotene to rhodoxanthin via a series of distinct oxidation steps in which the product of each step becomes the substrate for the next catalytic cycle.

  abstract     = {Gas-solid interfacial reaction is critical to many technological applications from heterogeneous catalysis to stress corrosion cracking. A prominent question that remains unclear is how gas and solid interact beyond chemisorption to form a stable interphase for bridging subsequent gas-solid reactions. Here, we report real-time atomic-scale observations of Ni-Al alloy oxidation reaction from initial surface adsorption to interfacial reaction into the bulk. We found distinct atomistic mechanisms for oxide growth in O 2 and H 2 O vapor, featuring a “step-edge” mechanism with severe interfacial strain in O 2 , and a “subsurface” one in H 2 O. Ab initio density functional theory simulations rationalize the H 2 O dissociation to favor the formation of a disordered oxide, which promotes ion diffusion to the oxide-metal interface and leads to an eased interfacial strain, therefore enhancing inward oxidation. Our findings depict a complete pathway for the Ni-Al surface oxidation reaction and delineate the delicate coupling of chemomechanical effect on gas-solid interactions.},

  abstract     = {Energy dissipation in water is very fast and more efficient than in many other liquids. This behavior is commonly attributed to the intermolecular interactions associated with hydrogen bonding. Here, we investigate the dynamic energy flow in the hydrogen bond network of liquid water by a pump-probe experiment. We resonantly excite intermolecular degrees of freedom with ultrashort single-cycle terahertz pulses and monitor its Raman response. By using ultrathin sample cell windows, a background-free bipolar signal whose tail relaxes monoexponentially is obtained. The relaxation is attributed to the molecular translational motions, using complementary experiments, force field, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. They reveal an initial coupling of the terahertz electric field to the molecular rotational degrees of freedom whose energy is rapidly transferred, within the excitation pulse duration, to the restricted translational motion of neighboring molecules. This rapid energy transfer may be rationalized by the strong anharmonicity of the intermolecular interactions.},

Inhibitory interneurons are suggested to promote this synchronization, but it is unclear whether distinct interneuron subtypes provide different contributions. To test this, we examined single-unit recordings from barrel cortex in vivo and used optogenetics to determine the contribution of parvalbumin (PV)– and somatostatin (SST)–positive interneurons to the synchronization of spike times across cortical layers. We found that PV interneurons preferentially promote the synchronization of spike times when instantaneous firing rates are low (12 Hz). Furthermore, using a computational model, we demonstrate that these effects can be explained by PV and SST interneurons having preferential contributions to feedforward and feedback inhibition, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that distinct subtypes of inhibitory interneurons have frequency-selective roles in the spatiotemporal synchronization of precise spike times.},

We introduce an open microfluidic tool expressly designed for same-cell phenotypic, protein, and mRNA profiling. We examine difficult-to-study—yet critically important—murine preimplantation embryo stages. In blastomeres dissociated from less well-studied two-cell embryos, we observe no significant GADD45a protein expression heterogeneity, apparent at the four-cell stage. In oocytes, we detect differences in full-length versus truncated DICER-1 mRNA and protein, which are insignificant by the two-cell stage. Single-embryo analyses reveal intraembryonic heterogeneity, differences between embryos of the same fertilization event and between donors, and reductions in the burden of animal sacrifice. Open microfluidic design integrates with existing workflows and opens new avenues for assessing the cellular-to-molecular heterogeneity inherent to preimplantation embryo development.},

Here, we study vitrification kinetics, in terms of the limiting fictive temperature, and atomic mobility related to the α-relaxation of an Au-based bulk metallic glass former by fast scanning calorimetry. We show that the time scale of the α-relaxation exhibits super-Arrhenius temperature dependence typical of fragile liquids. In contrast, vitrification kinetics displays milder temperature dependence at moderate undercooling, and thereby, vitrification takes place at temperatures lower than those associated to the α-relaxation. This finding challenges the paradigmatic view based on a one-to-one correlation between vitrification, leading to the glass transition, and the α-relaxation. We provide arguments that at moderate to deep undercooling, other atomic motions, which are not involved in the α-relaxation and that originate from the heterogeneous dynamics in metallic glasses, contribute to vitrification. Implications from the viewpoint of glasses fundamental properties are discussed.},

In transplant recipients, a variety of clinically important “indirect effects” are attributed to immune modulation by CMV, including increased mortality from fungal disease, allograft dysfunction and rejection in solid organ transplantation, and graft-versus-host-disease in stem cell transplantation. Monocytes, key cellular targets of CMV, are permissive to primary, latent and reactivated CMV infection. Here, pairing unbiased bulk and single cell transcriptomics with functional analyses we demonstrate that human monocytes infected with CMV do not effectively phagocytose fungal pathogens, a functional deficit which occurs with decreased expression of fungal recognition receptors. Simultaneously, CMV-infected monocytes upregulate antiviral, pro-inflammatory chemokine, and inflammasome responses associated with allograft rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Our study demonstrates that CMV modulates both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory monocyte phenotypes, explaining in part, its paradoxical “indirect effects” in transplantation.

We used Sting KO mice and a patient’s mutated STING cells to study the effect of STING deficiency on B cell development, differentiation, and BCR signaling. We found that STING deficiency promotes the differentiation of marginal zone B cells. STING is involved in BCR activation and negatively regulates the activation of CD19 and Btk but positively regulates the activation of SHIP. The activation of WASP and accumulation of F-actin were enhanced in Sting KO B cells upon BCR stimulation. Mechanistically, STING uses PI3K mediated by the CD19-Btk axis as a central hub for controlling the actin remodeling that, in turn, offers feedback to BCR signaling. Overall, our study provides a mechanism of how STING regulates BCR signaling via feedback from actin reorganization, which contributes to positive regulation of STING on the humoral immune response.},

We used paleoecological, historical, and survey data to track Acropora presence and dominance throughout the Caribbean from the prehuman period to present. Declines in dominance from prehuman values first occurred in the 1950s for Acropora palmata and the 1960s for Acropora cervicornis , decades before outbreaks of acroporid disease or bleaching. We compared trends in Acropora dominance since 1950 to potential regional and local drivers. Human population negatively affected and consumption of fertilizer for agriculture positively affected A. palmata dominance, the latter likely due to lower human presence in agricultural areas. The earlier, local roots of Caribbean Acropora declines highlight the urgency of mitigating local human impacts.},

Therefore, targeting Snail is expected to exert therapeutic benefit in patients with cancer. However, Snail has traditionally been considered “undruggable, ” and no effective pharmacological inhibitors have been identified. Here, we found a small-molecule compound CYD19 that forms a high-affinity interaction with the evolutionarily conserved arginine-174 pocket of Snail protein. In aggressive cancer cells, CYD19 binds to Snail and thus disrupts Snail’s interaction with CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, which consequently impairs CBP/p300-mediated Snail acetylation and then promotes its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, CYD19 restores Snail-dependent repression of wild-type p53, thus reducing tumor growth and survival in vitro and in vivo. In addition, CYD19 reverses Snail-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and impairs EMT-associated tumor invasion and metastasis. Our findings demonstrate that pharmacologically targeting Snail by CYD19 may exert potent therapeutic effects in patients with cancer.},

Genome-wide gene expression profiling and high-throughput live-cell imaging assays revealed that CREB1 enforced the GSH-recovering capacity (GRC) of MSCs through NRF2 by directly up-regulating NRF2 target genes responsible for GSH synthesis and redox cycling. MSCs with enhanced GSH levels and GRC mediated by CREB1-NRF2 have improved self-renewal, migratory, anti-inflammatory, and T cell suppression capacities. Administration of MSCs overexpressing CREB1-NRF2 target genes alleviated GVHD in a humanized mouse model, resulting in improved survival, decreased weight loss, and reduced histopathologic damages in GVHD target organs.

Moreover, we show via large-scale density functional theory calculations that DHU leads to almost complete closure of the electronic bandgap compared to the crystalline counterpart, making the material effectively a metal. This is in contrast to the conventional wisdom that disorder generally diminishes electronic transport and is due to the unique electron wave localization induced by the topological defects in the DHU state.},

Alteration of the mitochondrial electron flux and increased superoxide release from complex III has been proposed as an essential trigger for hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). We used mice expressing a tunicate alternative oxidase, AOX, which maintains electron flux when respiratory complexes III and/or IV are inhibited. Respiratory restoration by AOX prevented acute HPV and hypoxic responses of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC), acute hypoxia-induced redox changes of NADH and cytochrome c, and superoxide production. In contrast, AOX did not affect the development of chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and HIF-1α stabilization. These results indicate that distal inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in PASMC is an essential initial step for acute but not chronic oxygen sensing.},

We identified 117 candidate substrates, ~40\% of which are known CDK substrates. Previously unknown candidates were validated to be CDK2 substrates, including LSD1, DOT1L, and Rad54. The identification of many chromatin-associated proteins may have been facilitated by labeling conditions that preserved nuclear architecture and physiologic CDK2 regulation by endogenous cyclins. Candidate substrates include proteins that regulate histone modifications, chromatin, transcription, and RNA/DNA metabolism. Many of these proteins also coexist in multi-protein complexes, including epigenetic regulators, that may provide new links between cell division and other cellular processes mediated by CDK2. In situ phosphorylation thus revealed candidate substrates with a high validation rate and should be readily applicable to other nuclear kinases.},

  abstract     = {Many load-bearing tissues, such as muscles and cartilages, show high elasticity, toughness, and fast recovery. However, combining these mechanical properties in the same synthetic biomaterials is fundamentally challenging. Here, we show that strong, tough, and fast-recovery hydrogels can be engineered using cross-linkers involving cooperative dynamic interactions. We designed a histidine-rich decapeptide containing two tandem zinc binding motifs. Because of allosteric structural change-induced cooperative binding, this decapeptide had a higher thermodynamic stability, stronger binding strength, and faster binding rate than single binding motifs or isolated ligands. The engineered hybrid network hydrogels containing the peptide-zinc complex exhibit a break stress of ~3.0 MPa, toughness of ~4.0 MJ m −3 , and fast recovery in seconds. We expect that they can function effectively as scaffolds for load-bearing tissue engineering and as building blocks for soft robotics. Our results provide a general route to tune the mechanical and dynamic properties of hydrogels at the molecular level.},

  abstract     = {How neural form and function are connected is a central question of neuroscience. One prominent functional hypothesis, from the beginnings of neuroanatomical study, states that laterally extending dendrites of insect lamina monopolar cells (LMCs) spatially integrate visual information. We provide the first direct functional evidence for this hypothesis using intracellular recordings from type II LMCs in the hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum . We show that their spatial receptive fields broaden with decreasing light intensities, thus trading spatial resolution for higher sensitivity. These dynamic changes in LMC spatial properties can be explained by the density and lateral extent of their dendritic arborizations. Our results thus provide the first physiological evidence for a century-old hypothesis, directly correlating physiological response properties with distinctive dendritic morphology.},

  abstract     = {The molecular structure of the medieval watercolor known as folium has finally been solved in the 21st century. The interdisciplinary approach taken was the key to producing extracts that had been prepared following medieval instructions, and shows the blue/purple chromophore as the major dye in Chrozophora tinctoria fruits (shell). A multi-analytical characterization of its structure was made using HPLC-DAD-MS, GC-MS, NMR ( 1 H, 13 C, COSY, HSQC, HMBC, INADEQUATE), and computational studies. The results demonstrate that the blue compound corresponds to 6′-hydroxy-4, 4′-dimethoxy-1, 1′-dimethyl-5′-{[3, 4, 5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2 H -pyran-2-yl]oxy}-[3, 3′-bipyridine]-2, 2′, 5, 6(1 H , 1′ H )-tetraone, a hermidin derivative, which we named chrozophoridin. Experimental data and computational modeling studies show that this mono-glycosylated dimer is represented by two stable isomers (atropisomers). This is an indispensable piece of knowledge for the characterization of this medieval dye in works of art such as medieval manuscript illuminations and for testing its stability and contributes to the preservation of our cultural heritage.},

Here, we examined the consequences of sperm DNA damage on the embryonic genome by single-cell whole-genome sequencing of individual blastomeres from bovine embryos produced with sperm damaged by γ-radiation. Sperm DNA damage primarily leads to fragmentation of the paternal chromosomes followed by random distribution of the chromosomal fragments over the two sister cells in the first cell division. An unexpected secondary effect of sperm DNA damage is the induction of direct unequal cleavages, which include the poorly understood heterogoneic cell divisions. As a result, chaotic mosaicism is common in embryos derived from fertilizations with damaged sperm. The mosaic aneuploidies, uniparental disomies, and de novo structural variation induced by sperm DNA damage may compromise fertility and lead to rare congenital disorders when embryos escape developmental arrest.},

The formation of these structures follows a multistep process. First, the BCP self-assembles into amorphous micrometer-large vesicles. Then, the BCP confined in these mesosized vesicles crystallizes. This second step leads to the formation of objects with shapes ranging from closed 3D multi-tori spherical shells to 2D toroid mesh monolayers, depending on the solvent mixture composition. This approach demonstrates how topological constraints induced by the specific interactions between coil-crystalline BCP and solvents can be used to prepare mesostructures of complex morphologies.},

O -GlcNAc transferase (OGT), a key enzyme for protein O -GlcNAcylation, mediated IAV-induced cytokine production. Upon investigating the mechanisms driving this event, we determined that IAV induced OGT to bind to interferon regulatory factor–5 (IRF5), leading to O -GlcNAcylation of IRF5 on serine-430. O -GlcNAcylation of IRF5 is required for K63-linked ubiquitination of IRF5 and subsequent cytokine production. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that IRF5 is O -GlcNAcylated, and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines correlated with higher levels of blood glucose in IAV-infected patients. We identified a molecular mechanism by which HBP-mediated O -GlcNAcylation regulates IRF5 function during IAV infection, highlighting the importance of glucose metabolism in IAV-induced cytokine storm.},

The results for the interface between graphite and muscovite mica heterojunction demonstrate a robust negative friction coefficient both in loading and unloading processes. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the underlying mechanism is a synergetic and nontrivial redistribution of water molecules at the interface, leading to larger density and more ordered structure of the confined subnanometer-thick water film.

Crystal structures of three optimized E2 cores with human cross-genotype NAbs (AR3s) revealed how the modified tVR2 stabilizes E2 without altering key neutralizing epitopes. We then displayed these E2 cores on 24- and 60-meric nanoparticles and achieved substantial yield and purity, as well as enhanced antigenicity. In mice, these nanoparticles elicited more effective NAb responses than soluble E2 cores. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) defined distinct B cell patterns associated with nanoparticle-induced antibody responses, which target the conserved neutralizing epitopes on E2 and cross-neutralize HCV genotypes.},

However, extracellular enzymes in the deep sea are found mainly dissolved in ambient water rather than cell associated. In order to resolve this paradox, we conducted a global survey of peptidases and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), two key enzyme groups initiating organic matter assimilation, in an integrated metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics approach. The abundance, percentage, and diversity of genes encoding secretory processes, i.e., dissolved enzymes, consistently increased from epipelagic to bathypelagic waters, indicating that organic matter cleavage, and hence prokaryotic metabolism, is mediated mainly by particle-associated prokaryotes releasing their extracellular enzymes into diffusion-limited particles in the bathypelagic realm.},

This 3D vectorial holography allows the lensless reconstruction of a 3D vectorial holographic image with an ultrawide viewing angle of 94° and a high diffraction efficiency of 78\%, necessary for floating displays.

However, clinical interventions targeting commensal bacteria–specific CD4 + T cells are rare, because only a very limited number of commensal-derived epitopes have been identified. Here, we used a new approach to study epitopes and identify T cell receptors expressed by CD4 + Foxp3 + (T reg ) cells specific for commensal-derived antigens. Using this approach, we found that antigens from Akkermansia muciniphila reprogram naïve CD4 + T cells to the T reg lineage, expand preexisting microbe specific T regs , and limit wasting disease in the CD4 + T cell transfer model of colitis.

CSF P-tau and T-tau started to increase before the threshold for Amyloid PET positivity, while Tau PET started to increase after Amyloid PET positivity. Effects of Amyloid PET on Tau PET were mediated by CSF P-tau, and high CSF P-tau predicted increased Tau PET rates.

  abstract     = {Materials exhibiting reversible changes in optical properties upon light irradiation have shown great potential in diverse optoelectronic areas. In particular, the modulation of photochromic behavior on demand for such materials is of fundamental importance, but it remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report a facile and effective strategy to engineer controllable photochromic properties by varying the counterions in a series of zinc complexes consisting of a spirolactam-based photochromic ligand. Colorability and coloration rate can be finely tuned by conveniently changing their counterions. Through utilization of the reversible feature of the metal-ligand coordination bond between Zn 2+ and the spirolactam-based ligand, dynamic manipulation of photochromic behavior was achieved. Furthermore, we demonstrated the practical applications of the tunable photochromic properties for these complexes by creating photochromic films and developing multilevel security printing. These findings show opportunities for the development of smart materials with dynamically controllable responsive behavior in advanced optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Many viruses use their genome as template for self-assembly into an infectious particle. However, this reaction remains elusive because of the transient nature of intermediate structures. To elucidate this process, optical tweezers and acoustic force spectroscopy are used to follow viral assembly in real time. Using Simian virus 40 (SV40) virus-like particles as model system, we reveal a multistep assembly mechanism. Initially, binding of VP1 pentamers to DNA leads to a significantly decreased persistence length. Moreover, the pentamers seem able to stabilize DNA loops. Next, formation of interpentamer interactions results in intermediate structures with reduced contour length. These structures stabilize into objects that permanently decrease the contour length to a degree consistent with DNA compaction in wild-type SV40. These data indicate that a multistep mechanism leads to fully assembled cross-linked SV40 particles. SV40 is studied as drug delivery system. Our insights can help optimize packaging of therapeutic agents in these particles.},

We previously observed that dynamic touch elicits mechanical waves that propagate throughout the hand. Here, we show that these waves produce an efficient encoding of tactile information. The computation of an optimal encoding of thousands of naturally occurring tactile stimuli yielded a compact lexicon of primitive wave patterns that sparsely represented the entire dataset, enabling touch interactions to be classified with an accuracy exceeding 95\%. The primitive tactile patterns reflected the interplay of hand anatomy with wave physics. Notably, similar patterns emerged when we applied efficient encoding criteria to spiking data from populations of simulated tactile afferents. This finding suggests that the biomechanics of the hand enables efficient perceptual processing by effecting a preneuronal compression of tactile information.},

The bottlenecks of current carbon-based CDI materials are their limited desalination capacities and time-consuming cycles, caused by insufficient ion-accessible surfaces and retarded electron/ion transport. Here, we demonstrate porous carbon fibers (PCFs) derived from microphase-separated poly(methyl methacrylate)- block -polyacrylonitrile (PMMA- b -PAN) as an effective CDI material. PCF has abundant and uniform mesopores that are interconnected with micropores. This hierarchical porous structure renders PCF a large ion-accessible surface area and a high desalination capacity. In addition, the continuous carbon fibers and interconnected porous network enable fast electron/ion transport, and hence a high desalination rate. PCF shows desalination capacity of 30 mg NaCl g −1 PCF and maximal time-average desalination rate of 38.0 mg NaCl g −1 PCF min −1 , which are about 3 and 40 times, respectively, those of typical porous carbons. Our work underlines the promise of block copolymer–based PCF for mutually high-capacity and high-rate CDI.},

Here, we found a previously unidentified explanation, due to lack of maternal exercise. In this study, healthy maternal mice were assigned either to a sedentary lifestyle or to exercise daily, and fetal brown adipose tissue (BAT) development and offspring metabolic health were analyzed. Compared to the sedentary group, maternal exercise enhanced DNA demethylation of Prdm16 promoter and BAT development and prevented obesity of offspring when challenged with a high-energy diet. Apelin, an exerkine, was elevated in both maternal and fetal circulations due to exercise, and maternal administration of apelin mimicked the beneficial effects of exercise on fetal BAT development and offspring metabolic health. Together, maternal exercise enhances thermogenesis and the metabolic health of offspring mice, suggesting that the sedentary lifestyle during pregnancy contributes to the obesity epidemic in modern societies.},

Furthermore, PHF20L1 was found to serve as a potential MYC and hypoxia-driven oncogene, promoting glycolysis, proliferation, and metastasis of breast cancer cells by directly inhibiting tumor suppressors such as HIC1 , KISS1 , and BRCA1 . PHF20L1 expression was also strongly correlated with higher histologic grades of breast cancer and markedly up-regulated in several cancers. Meanwhile, Phf20l1 deletion not only induces growth retardation and mammary ductal outgrowth delay but also inhibits tumorigenesis in vivo.

However, the resolution of the under oil fluidic channels reported so far is still far from comparable with that of closed-channel microfluidics (millimeters versus micrometers). Here, enabled by exclusive liquid repellency and an under oil sweep technique, open microchannels can now be prepared under oil (rather than in air), which shrinks the channel dimensions up to three orders of magnitude compared to previously reported techniques. Spatial trapping of different cellular samples and advanced control of mass transport (i.e., enhanced upper limit of flow rate, steady flow with passive pumping, and reversible fluidic valves) were achieved with open-channel designs. We apply these functional advances to enable dynamic measurements of dispersion from a pathogenic fungal biofilm.

We use Pb-phosphate thermochronology with planetesimal-scale thermal models to constrain the minimum size of the LL ordinary chondrite parent body and its initial allotment of heat-producing 26 Al. Bulk phosphate 207 Pb/ 206 Pb dates of LL chondrites record a total duration of cooling ≥75 Ma, with an isothermal interior that cools over ≥30 Ma. Since the duration of conductive cooling scales with parent body size, these data require a ≥150-km radius parent body and a range of bulk initial 26 Al/ 27 Al consistent with the initial 26 Al/ 27 Al ratios of constituent LL chondrules.

  abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a fundamental role in the modulation of synaptic transmission. A pivotal example is provided by the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 4 (mGluR4), which inhibits glutamate release at presynaptic active zones (AZs). However, how GPCRs are organized within AZs to regulate neurotransmission remains largely unknown. Here, we applied two-color super-resolution imaging by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( d STORM) to investigate the nanoscale organization of mGluR4 at parallel fiber AZs in the mouse cerebellum. We find an inhomogeneous distribution, with multiple nanodomains inside AZs, each containing, on average, one to two mGluR4 subunits. Within these nanodomains, mGluR4s are often localized in close proximity to voltage-dependent Ca V 2.1 channels and Munc-18-1, which are both essential for neurotransmitter release. These findings provide previously unknown insights into the molecular organization of GPCRs at AZs, suggesting a likely implication of a close association between mGluR4 and the secretory machinery in modulating synaptic transmission.},

Here, we find a previously unknown role of nuclear actin in transcriptional regulation. The RNA-seq data reveal that nuclear actin is required for the serum-induced transcriptional program. Using super-resolution imaging, we found a remarkable enhancement of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) clustering upon serum stimulation, and this enhancement requires nuclear actin. Pol II clusters colocalized with the serum-response genes and nuclear actin filaments upon serum stimulation. Furthermore, N-WASP is required for serum-enhanced Pol II clustering. N-WASP phase-separated with Pol II and nuclear actin. In addition to serum stimulation, nuclear actin also enhanced Pol II clustering upon interferon-γ treatment. Together, our work unveils that nuclear actin promotes the formation of transcription factory on inducible genes, acting as a general mechanism underlying the rapid response to environmental cues.},

  abstract     = {In many viruses, including rotavirus (RV), the major pathogen of infantile gastroenteritis, capping of viral messenger RNAs is a pivotal step for efficient translation of the viral genome. In RV, VP3 caps the nascent transcripts synthesized from the genomic dsRNA segments by the RV polymerase VP1 within the particle core. Here, from cryo–electron microscopy, x-ray crystallography, and biochemical analyses, we show that VP3 forms a stable tetrameric assembly with each subunit having a modular domain organization, which uniquely integrates five distinct enzymatic steps required for capping the transcripts. In addition to the previously known guanylyl- and methyltransferase activities, we show that VP3 exhibits hitherto unsuspected RNA triphosphatase activity necessary for initiating transcript capping and RNA helicase activity likely required for separating the RNA duplex formed transiently during endogenous transcription. From our studies, we propose a new mechanism for how VP3 inside the virion core caps the nascent transcripts exiting from the polymerase.},

Here, we reveal how shear-thickening suspensions flow, shedding light onto as yet non-understood complex dynamics reported in the literature. When shear thickening is important, we show the existence of density fluctuations that appear as periodic waves moving in the direction of flow and breaking azimuthal symmetry. They come with strong normal stress fluctuations of the same periodicity. The flow includes small areas of normal stresses of the order of tens of kilopascals and areas of normal stresses of the order of hundreds of pascals. These stress inhomogeneities could play an important role in the damage caused by thickening fluids in the industry.},

In this spirit, we develop a recursive multidimensional symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network fitting with a suite of physics-inspired techniques. We apply it to 100 equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics , and it discovers all of them, while previous publicly available software cracks only 71; for a more difficult physics-based test set, we improve the state-of-the-art success rate from 15 to 90\%.},

We introduce these, describe how they can bias or inflate genotype-phenotype associations, and demonstrate methods that can be used to assess their presence. Using data on educational achievement and parental socioeconomic position as an exemplar, we demonstrate that both heritability and genetic correlation may be biased estimates of the causal contribution of genotype. These results highlight the limitations of genotype-phenotype estimates obtained from samples of unrelated individuals. Use of these methods in combination with family-based designs may offer researchers greater opportunities to explore the mechanisms driving genotype-phenotype associations and identify factors underlying bias in estimates.},

Furthermore, the monitoring of deep tissues is not applicable because of short-wavelength excitation prevailingly used so far. Here, we report a highly sensitive and selective nanosensor for near-infrared (NIR) K + imaging in living cells and animals. The nanosensor is constructed by encapsulating upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and a commercial K + indicator in the hollow cavity of mesoporous silica nanoparticles, followed by coating a K + -selective filter membrane. The membrane adsorbs K + from the medium and filters out interfering cations. The UCNPs convert NIR to ultraviolet light, which excites the K + indicator, thus allowing the detection of the fluctuations of K + concentration in cultured cells and intact mouse brains.},

Using a mouse model of genetic diversity, we find that the histotype spectrum of HZE ion–induced tumors is similar to the spectra of spontaneous and γ-ray–induced tumors and that the genomic loci controlling susceptibilities overlap between groups for some tumor types. Where it occurs, this overlap indicates shared tumorigenesis mechanisms regardless of the type of radiation exposure and supports the use of human epidemiological data from γ-ray exposures to predict cancer risks from galactic cosmic rays.},

Here, we observed that the deubiquitinase ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 1 (UCHL1) was significantly up-regulated in agonist-stimulated primary cardiomyocytes and in hypertrophic and failing hearts. Knockdown of UCHL1 in cardiomyocytes and mouse hearts significantly ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy induced by agonist or pressure overload. Conversely, overexpression of UCHL1 had the opposite effect in cardiomyocytes and rAAV9-UCHL1–treated mice. Mechanistically, UCHL1 bound, deubiquitinated, and stabilized epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and activated its downstream mediators. Systemic administration of the UCHL1 inhibitor LDN-57444 significantly reversed cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. These findings suggest that UCHL1 positively regulates cardiac hypertrophy by stabilizing EGFR and identify UCHL1 as a target for hypertrophic therapy.},

Our methods are robust to noise and thus applicable in practice, as we demonstrate in a photonic experiment.

  abstract     = {The mammalian cochlea relies on active electromotility of outer hair cells (OHCs) to resolve sound frequencies. OHCs use ionic channels and somatic electromotility to achieve the process. It is unclear, though, how the kinetics of voltage-gated ionic channels operate to overcome extrinsic viscous drag on OHCs at high frequency. Here, we report ultrafast electromechanical gating of clustered K v 7.4 in OHCs. Increases in kinetics and sensitivity resulting from cooperativity among clustered-K v 7.4 were revealed, using optogenetics strategies. Upon clustering, the half-activation voltage shifted negative, and the speed of activation increased relative to solitary channels. Clustering also rendered K v 7.4 channels mechanically sensitive, confirmed in consolidated K v 7.4 channels at the base of OHCs. K v 7.4 clusters provide OHCs with ultrafast electromechanical channel gating, varying in magnitude and speed along the cochlea axis. Ultrafast K v 7.4 gating provides OHCs with a feedback mechanism that enables the cochlea to overcome viscous drag and resolve sounds at auditory frequencies.},

Despite their significance, climate models consistently underestimate the amount of coarse dust in the atmosphere when compared to measurements. Here, we estimate the global load of coarse dust using a framework that leverages dozens of measurements of atmospheric dust size distributions. We find that the atmosphere contains 17 Tg of coarse dust, which is four times more than current climate models simulate. Our findings indicate that models deposit coarse dust out of the atmosphere too quickly. Accounting for this missing coarse dust adds a warming effect of 0.15 W·m −2 and increases the likelihood that dust net warms the climate system. We conclude that to properly represent the impact of dust on the Earth system, climate models must include an accurate treatment of coarse dust in the atmosphere.},

An optogenetically engineered exosome system (EXPLOR) that we previously developed was implemented for loading a large amount of srIκB into exosomes. We showed that intraperitoneal injection of purified srIκB-loaded exosomes (Exo-srIκBs) attenuates mortality and systemic inflammation in septic mouse models. In a biodistribution study, Exo-srIκBs were observed mainly in the neutrophils, and in monocytes to a lesser extent, in the spleens and livers of mice.

After confirming faster aggregation of Aβ-42 in comparison to Aβ-40, a stable set of oligomers with a diameter distribution of ~7 to 9 nm was prevalently observed uniquely for Aβ-42 even after fibril appearance. The interaction energies between a distinct class of amyloid aggregates (dodecamers) and graphene was then quantified using molecular dynamics simulations. Last, differences in Aβ-40 and Aβ-42 networks were resolved, wherein only Aβ-42 fibrils were aligned through lateral interactions over micrometer-scale lengths, a property that could be exploited in the design of biofunctional materials.},

In contrast to extensive knowledge on the thermal tolerance of coral-associated symbionts, the role of the coral host in bleaching patterns across species is poorly understood. Here, we applied a Bayesian analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data to determine the trophic niche overlap between corals and their symbionts and propose benchmark values that define autotrophy, heterotrophy, and mixotrophy. The amount of overlap between coral and symbiont niche was negatively correlated with polyp size and bleaching resistance. Our results indicated that as oceans warm, autotrophic corals lose their competitive advantage and thus are the first to disappear from coral reefs.},

Here, we report highly-efficient C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 adsorption separation in a phosphate-anion pillared metal-organic framework ZnAtzPO 4 exploiting the equilibrium-kinetic synergetic effect. The periodically expanded and contracted aperture decorated with electronegative groups within ZnAtzPO 4 enables effective trapping of C 2 H 4 and impedes the diffusion of C 2 H 6 , offering an extraordinary equilibrium-kinetic combined selectivity of 32.4. The adsorption heat of C 2 H 4 on ZnAtzPO 4 (17.3 to 30.0 kJ mol −1 ) is substantially lower than many thermodynamically selective adsorbents because its separation capability only partially relies on thermodynamics. The separation mechanism was explored by computational simulations, and breakthrough experiments confirmed the excellent C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 separation performance of ZnAtzPO 4 .},

Using optical tweezers, we demonstrate that the low processivity (ability to take multiple steps before dissociating) of human dynein limits its force generation due to premature microtubule dissociation. Using a high trap stiffness whereby the motor achieves greater force per step, we reveal that the motor’s true maximal force (“stall force”) is ~2 pN. Furthermore, an average force versus trap stiffness plot yields a hyperbolic curve that plateaus at the stall force. We derive an analytical equation that accurately describes this curve, predicting both stall force and zero-load processivity. This theoretical model describes the behavior of a kinesin motor under low-processivity conditions. Our work clarifies the true stall force and processivity of human dynein and provides a new paradigm for understanding and analyzing molecular motor force generation for weakly processive motors.},

We tested this using electrophysiological, behavioral, pharmacological, and optogenetic techniques alongside auditory stimulation in freely behaving rats. We found that systemic reduction in NE signaling lowered probability of sound-evoked awakenings (SEAs). The level of tonic LC activity during sleep anticipated SEAs. Optogenetic LC activation promoted arousal as evident in sleep-wake transitions, EEG desynchronization, and pupil dilation. Minimal LC excitation before sound presentation increased SEA probability. Optogenetic LC silencing using a soma-targeted anion-conducting channelrhodopsin (stGtACR2) suppressed LC spiking and constricted pupils. Brief periods of LC opto-silencing reduced the probability of SEAs. Thus, LC-NE activity determines the likelihood of sensory-evoked awakenings, and its reduction during sleep constitutes a key factor mediating behavioral unresponsiveness.},

However, conventional approaches have limitations, as they are material specific, difficult to scale up, possibly detrimental to the electrodes’ catalytic activity and stability, and incompatible with photoelectrochemical applications. To address these issues, we report a simple strategy for the realization of superaerophobic (photo)electrodes via the deposition of hydrogels on a desired electrode surface. For a proof-of-concept demonstration, we deposited a transparent hydrogel assembled from M13 virus onto (photo)electrodes for a hydrogen evolution reaction. The hydrogel overlayer facilitated the elimination of hydrogen bubbles and substantially improved the (photo)electrodes’ performances by maintaining high catalytic activity and minimizing the concentration overpotential.

We use this approach to wirelessly control adrenal hormone secretion in genetically intact rats. TRPV1-dependent calcium influx into the cells of adrenal cortex and medulla is sufficient to drive rapid release of corticosterone and (nor)epinephrine. As altered levels of these hormones have been correlated with mental conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression, our approach may facilitate the investigation of physiological and psychological impacts of stress.},

  abstract     = {Many-body topological invariants, as quantized highly nonlocal correlators of the many-body wave function, are at the heart of the theoretical description of many-body topological quantum phases, including symmetry-protected and symmetry-enriched topological phases. Here, we propose and analyze a universal toolbox of measurement protocols to reveal many-body topological invariants of phases with global symmetries, which can be implemented in state-of-the-art experiments with synthetic quantum systems, such as Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits. The protocol is based on extracting the many-body topological invariants from statistical correlations of randomized measurements, implemented with local random unitary operations followed by site-resolved projective measurements. We illustrate the technique and its application in the context of the complete classification of bosonic symmetry-protected topological phases in one dimension, considering in particular the extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger spin model, as realized with Rydberg tweezer arrays.},

  abstract     = {DNA damage tolerance (DDT) is crucial for genome integrity maintenance. DDT is mainly carried out by template switch recombination, an error-free mode of overcoming DNA lesions, or translesion DNA synthesis, which is error-prone. Here, we investigated the role of Mgs1/WRNIP1 in modulating DDT. Using budding yeast, we found that elimination of Mgs1 in cells lacking Rad5, an essential protein for DDT, activates an alternative mode of DNA damage bypass, driven by recombination, which allows chromosome replication and cell viability under stress conditions that block DNA replication forks. This salvage pathway is RAD52 and RAD59 dependent, requires the DNA polymerase δ and PCNA modification at K164, and is enabled by Esc2 and the PCNA unloader Elg1, being inhibited when Mgs1 is present. We propose that Mgs1 is necessary to prevent a potentially toxic recombination salvage pathway at sites of perturbed replication, which, in turn, favors Rad5-dependent template switching, thus helping to preserve genome stability.},

However, the biological function and molecular properties of SzRs have not been reported. Here, SzRs from Asgardarchaeota and from a yet unknown microorganism are expressed in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells, and ion transport assays and patch clamp analyses are used to demonstrate SzR as a novel type of light-driven inward H + pump. The mutation of a cytoplasmic glutamate inhibited inward H + transport, suggesting that it functions as a cytoplasmic H + acceptor. The function, trimeric structure, and H + transport mechanism of SzR are similar to that of xenorhodopsin (XeR), a light-driven inward H + pumping microbial rhodopsins, implying that they evolved convergently. The inward H + pump function of SzR provides new insight into the photobiological life cycle of the Asgardarchaeota.},

Numerical methods are important tools for optimization, but experiment remains the gold standard for studying nonlinear, but critical, mechanical properties such as toughness. To address the vastness of AM design space and the need for experiment, we develop a Bayesian experimental autonomous researcher (BEAR) that combines Bayesian optimization and high-throughput automated experimentation. In addition to rapidly performing experiments, the BEAR leverages iterative experimentation by selecting experiments based on all available results. Using the BEAR, we explore the toughness of a parametric family of structures and observe an almost 60-fold reduction in the number of experiments needed to identify high-performing structures relative to a grid-based search. These results show the value of machine learning in experimental fields where data are sparse.},

Here, we use the freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica to show that an isolated pharynx amputated from the planarian body self-directedly executes its entire sequence of feeding functions: food sensing, approach, decisions about ingestion, and intake. Gene-specific silencing experiments by RNA interference demonstrated that the pharyngeal nervous system (PhNS) is required not only for feeding functions of the pharynx itself but also for food-localization movements of individual animals, presumably via communication with the brain. These findings reveal an unexpected central role of the PhNS in the linkage between unique morphological phenotypes and feeding behavior in planarians.},

The low efficiency of homology-directed repair remains a major hurdle in CRISPR-Cas9–mediated precise genome editing, which is limited by low concentration of donor DNA template at the cleavage site. In this study, we have developed methodology to site-specifically conjugate oligonucleotides to recombinant Cas9 protein containing a genetically encoded noncanonical amino acid with orthogonal chemical reactivity. The Cas9-oligonucleotide conjugates recruited an unmodified donor DNA template to the target site through base pairing, markedly increasing homology-directed repair efficiency in both human cell culture and mouse zygotes. These chemically modified Cas9 mutants provide an additional tool, one that is complementary to chemically modified nucleic acids, for improving the utility of CRISPR-Cas9–based genome-editing systems.},

Actin, the most abundant protein in the cytoplasm, has its own dedicated NAT, NAA80, which acts posttranslationally and affects cytoskeleton assembly and cell motility. Here, we show that NAA80 does not associate with filamentous actin in cells, and its natural substrate is the monomeric actin-profilin complex, consistent with Nt-acetylation preceding polymerization. NAA80 Nt-acetylates actin-profilin much more efficiently than actin alone, suggesting that profilin acts as a chaperone for actin Nt-acetylation. We determined crystal structures of the NAA80-actin-profilin ternary complex, representing different actin isoforms and different states of the catalytic reaction and revealing the first structure of NAT-substrate complex at atomic resolution. The structural, biochemical, and cellular analysis of mutants shows how NAA80 has evolved to specifically recognize actin among all cellular proteins while targeting all six actin isoforms, which differ the most at the amino terminus.},

We analyze two main attributes of local political leaders: procedural fairness preferences and preferential treatment of relatives (nepotism). We also measure personality traits and social preferences, and conduct standardized surveys on local governance practices and villagers’ perceptions of their leaders’ performance. Our results indicate that traditional chiefs are as likely to implement fair, democratic decision-making procedures, and are as unlikely to be nepotistic. Moreover, elected leaders and chiefs express similar social preferences and personality traits. These findings align with villagers’ perceptions of most leaders in our sample as being popular and fair, and villagers’ responses reveal a discrepancy between planned and de facto implementation of democratic institutions.},

To achieve this goal, we developed a stable, highly uniform in size, and nontoxic nanomaterials made of tellurium-selenium (TeSe)–based lateral heterojunction. Systemic delivery of TeSe nanoparticles in mice showed highly specific accumulation in tumors relative to other healthy tissues. Upon exposure to light, TeSe nanoparticles nearly completely eradicated lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma in preclinical models.

The four-phase transition during the annealing process yields an α-phase CsPbI 2 Br stabilized by BPQDs. The BPQDS/CsPbI 2 Br core-shell structure concomitantly reinforces a stable CsPbI 2 Br crystallite and suppresses the oxidation of BPQDs. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency of 15.47\% can be achieved for 0.7 wt\% BPQDs embedded in CsPbI 2 Br film-based devices, with an enhanced cell stability, under ambient conditions.

The atomic-scale structure of the FeSe/SrTiO 3 interface is an important determinant of both the magnetic and interfacial electron-phonon interactions and is a key ingredient to understanding its high- T c superconductivity. We resolve the atomic-scale structure of the FeSe/SrTiO 3 interface through a complementary analysis of scanning transmission electron microscopy and in situ surface x-ray diffraction. We find that the interface is more strongly bonded for a particular registration, which leads to a coherently strained ML. We also determine structural parameters, such as the distance between ML FeSe and the oxide, Se─Fe─Se bond angles, layer-resolved distances between Fe─Se, and registry of the FeSe lattice relative to the oxide.

  abstract     = {Wetlands are a major source of methane (CH 4 ) and contribute between 30 and 40\% to the total CH 4 emissions. Wetland CH 4 emissions depend on temperature, water table depth, and both the quantity and quality of organic matter. Global warming will affect these three drivers of methanogenesis, raising questions about the feedbacks between natural methane production and climate change. Until present the large-scale response of wetland CH 4 emissions to climate has been investigated with land-surface models that have produced contrasting results. Here, we produce a novel global estimate of wetland methane emissions based on atmospheric inverse modeling of CH 4 fluxes and observed temperature and precipitation. Our data-driven model suggests that by 2100, current emissions may increase by 50\% to 80\%, which is within the range of 50\% and 150\% reported in previous studies. This finding highlights the importance of limiting global warming below 2°C to avoid substantial climate feedbacks driven by methane emissions from natural wetlands.},

  abstract     = {Dyskeratosis congenita is a cancer-prone inherited bone marrow failure syndrome caused by telomere dysfunction. A mouse model recently suggested that p53 regulates telomere metabolism, but the clinical relevance of this finding remained uncertain. Here, a germline missense mutation of MDM4 , a negative regulator of p53, was found in a family with features suggestive of dyskeratosis congenita, e.g., bone marrow hypocellularity, short telomeres, tongue squamous cell carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. Using a mouse model, we show that this mutation (p.T454M) leads to increased p53 activity, decreased telomere length, and bone marrow failure. Variations in p53 activity markedly altered the phenotype of Mdm4 mutant mice, suggesting an explanation for the variable expressivity of disease symptoms in the family. Our data indicate that a germline activation of the p53 pathway may cause telomere dysfunction and point to polymorphisms affecting this pathway as potential genetic modifiers of telomere biology and bone marrow function.},

In this study, through three-dimensional spheroid culture, a group of unique multipotent stem cells were identified from mouse dental papilla called multipotent dental pulp regenerative stem cells (MDPSCs). MDPSCs exhibited enhanced osteogenic/odontogenic differentiation capabilities and could form regenerative dentin and neurovascular-like structures that mimicked the native teeth in vivo. Further analysis revealed that CD24a was the bona fide marker for MDPSCs, and their expansion was highly dependent on the expression of a key transcriptional factor, Sp7 . Last, CD24a + cells could be detected in primary dental papilla in mice and human, suggesting that MDPSCs resided in their native niches.

  abstract     = {Engineering magnetic anisotropy in two-dimensional systems has enormous scientific and technological implications. The uniaxial anisotropy universally exhibited by two-dimensional magnets has only two stable spin directions, demanding 180° spin switching between states. We demonstrate a previously unobserved eightfold anisotropy in magnetic SrRuO 3 monolayers by inducing a spin reorientation in (SrRuO 3 ) 1 /(SrTiO 3 ) N superlattices, in which the magnetic easy axis of Ru spins is transformed from uniaxial 〈001〉 direction ( N &lt; 3) to eightfold 〈111〉 directions ( N ≥ 3). This eightfold anisotropy enables 71° and 109° spin switching in SrRuO 3 monolayers, analogous to 71° and 109° polarization switching in ferroelectric BiFeO 3 . First-principle calculations reveal that increasing the SrTiO 3 layer thickness induces an emergent correlation-driven orbital ordering, tuning spin-orbit interactions and reorienting the SrRuO 3 monolayer easy axis. Our work demonstrates that correlation effects can be exploited to substantially change spin-orbit interactions, stabilizing unprecedented properties in two-dimensional magnets and opening rich opportunities for low-power, multistate device applications.},

Here, we report that silicone liquids and gels have high surface stresses that can strongly resist deformation at cellular length scales. Biomedical silicones, including syringe lubricants and fillings from FDA-approved breast implants, readily adsorb matrix proteins and activate canonical rigidity sensing pathways through their surface stresses. In 3D culture models, liquid silicone droplets support robust cellular adhesion and the formation of multinucleated monocyte-derived cell masses that recapitulate phenotypic aspects of granuloma formation in the foreign body response. Together, our findings implicate surface stress as a cellular stimulant that should be considered in application of silicones for biomedical purposes.},

In this work, we propose and demonstrate that efficient electrothermal operation and phonon blocking can be achieved in solid-state thermionic junctions, paving the way for new phonon-engineered high-efficiency refrigerators and sensors. Our experimental demonstration uses semiconductor-superconductor (Sm-S) junctions where the electrothermal response arises from the superconducting energy gap and the phonon blocking results from the acoustic transmission bottleneck at the junction. We demonstrate a cooling platform where a silicon chip, suspended only from the Sm-S junctions, is cooled by ~40\% from the bath temperature. We also show how the observed effect can be used in radiation detectors and multistage electronic refrigerators suitable for cooling of quantum technology devices.},

By generating mutant zebrafish whose fast muscles are synaptically silenced, we examined the contribution of fast muscles in both larval and adult zebrafish. In the larval stage, mutants lacked the characteristic startle response to tactile stimuli: bending of the trunk (C-bend) followed by robust forward propulsion. Unexpectedly, adult mutants with silenced fast muscles showed robust C-bends and forward propulsion upon stimulation. Retrograde labeling revealed that motor neurons genetically programmed to form synapses on fast muscles are instead rerouted and innervate slow muscles, which led to partial conversion of slow and intermediate muscles to fast muscles. Thus, extended silencing of fast muscle synapses changed motor neuron innervation and caused muscle cell type conversion, revealing an unexpected mechanism of locomotory adaptation.},

Our computational wrapping approach provides a robust and reliable method for fabricating conformal devices for arbitrary curved surfaces with a computationally designed nonpolyhedral developable net. This computer-aided design transforms two-dimensional (2D)–based materials, such as Si wafers and steel sheets, into various targeted conformal structures that can fully wrap desired 3D structures without fracture or severe plastic deformation.

Mice lacking Hdac1 and Hdac2 in heart exhibit defective developmental switch from anaerobic to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), severe defects in mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial function, and complete embryonic lethality. Hdac1/Hdac2 promotes the transition to OXPHOS by enforcing transcriptional fidelity of metabolic gene programs. Mechanistically, Hdac1/Hdac2 deacetylates histone residues including H3K23, H3K14, and H4K16 to suppress cryptic transcriptional initiation within the coding regions of actively transcribed metabolic genes.

Here, we report that Wapl functions as a regulator of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to prevent aneuploidy in meiosis I. Depletion of Wapl accelerates meiotic progression, inactivates SAC, and causes meiotic defects such as aberrant spindle/chromosome structure and incorrect kinetochore-microtubule (K-MT) attachment, consequently leading to aneuploid eggs. Notably, we identify Bub3 as a binding partner of Wapl by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. We further determine that Wapl controls the SAC activity by maintaining Bub3 protein level and document that exogenous Bub3 restores the normal meiosis in Wapl-depleted oocytes. Together, our findings uncover unique, noncanonical roles for Wapl in mediating control of the SAC in female meiosis I.},

APL cells are resistant to LSD1 inhibition or knockout, but targeting LSD1 sensitizes them to physiological doses of RA without altering of PML-RAR levels, and extends survival of leukemic mice upon RA treatment. The combination of RA with LSD1 inhibition (or knockout) is also effective in other non-APL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Nonenzymatic activities of LSD1 are essential to block differentiation, while RA with targeting of LSD1 releases a differentiation gene expression program, not strictly dependent on changes in histone H3K4 methylation.

Soft matrix increases clustering of TNF receptors, thereby enhancing NF-κB activation and downstream gene expression. Actin polymerization and lipid rafts, but not myosin-II contractility, regulate mechanosensitive activation of MSCs by TNFα. We functionally demonstrate that human MSCs primed with TNFα in soft matrix enhance production of human monocytes in marrow of xenografted mice and increase trafficking of monocytes via CCL2.

  abstract     = {Understanding force generation in nonequilibrium systems is a notable challenge in statistical physics. We uncover a fluctuation-induced force between two plates immersed in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using direct numerical simulations. The force is a nonmonotonic function of plate separation. The mechanism of force generation reveals an intriguing analogy with fluctuation-induced forces: In a fluid, energy and vorticity are localized in regions of defined length scales. When varying the distance between the plates, we exclude energy structures modifying the overall pressure on the plates. At intermediate plate distances, the intense vorticity structures (worms) are forced to interact in close vicinity between the plates. This interaction affects the pressure in the slit and the force between the plates. The combination of these two effects causes a nonmonotonic attractive force with a complex Reynolds number dependence. Our study sheds light on how length scale–dependent distributions of energy and high-intensity vortex structures determine Casimir forces.},

Here, we show that molecular targeting of the FATP4 transporter is an effective approach to specifically transport long-chain fatty acid (LCFA)–conjugated peptides across the enterocytic membrane and, thus, enables oral delivery of drug peptides. We packaged LCFA-conjugated exendin-4 (LCFA-Ex4) into liposomes and coated with chitosan nanoparticles to form an orally deliverable Ex4 (OraEx4). OraEx4 protected LCFA-Ex4 from damage by the gastric fluid and released LCFA-Ex4 in the intestinal cavity, where LCFA-Ex4 was transported across the enterocyte membrane by the FAPT4 transporter. OraEx4 had a high bioavailability of 24.8\% with respect to subcutaneous injection and exhibited a substantial hypoglycemic effect in murine models of diabetes mellitus. Thus, molecular targeting of the FATP4 transporter enhances oral absorption of therapeutic peptides and provides a platform for oral peptide drug development.},

PSR causes female-to-male conversion by destroying the sperm’s hereditary material in young embryos to drive. Using RNA interference, we demonstrate that testis-specific expression of a PSR-linked gene, named haploidizer , facilitates this genome elimination–and–sex conversion effect. haploidizer encodes a putative protein with a DNA binding domain, suggesting a functional link with the sperm-derived chromatin.},

Here, we developed a nanoparticle (NP)–based pretargeted system for the therapeutic delivery of BEZ235 to CD20- and HLA-DR–expressing lymphoma cells for targeted therapy. The pretargeted system is composed of dibenzocyclooctyne-functionalized anti-CD20 and anti-Lym1 antibodies as the tumor-targeting components and azide-functionalized BEZ235-encapsulated NPs as the effector drug carrier. Using lymphoma cell lines with different CD20 and HLA-DR antigen densities as examples, we demonstrate that the dual antibody pretargeted strategy effectively raises the number of NPs retained on the target tumor cells and improves the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of BEZ235 through the inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway.

The liquid-to-gas phase transformation is typically triggered thermally or acoustically by low–boiling point liquids, or by inclusion of solid structures that pin the vapor/liquid contact line to facilitate heterogeneous nucleation. However, these approaches lack precise tunability in vaporization behavior. Here, we describe a previously unused approach to control vaporization behavior through an endoskeleton that can melt and blend into the liquid core to either enhance or disrupt cohesive intermolecular forces. This effect is demonstrated using perfluoropentane (C 5 F 12 ) droplets encapsulating a fluorocarbon (FC) or hydrocarbon (HC) endoskeleton. FC skeletons inhibit vaporization, whereas HC skeletons trigger vaporization near the rotator melting transition. Our findings highlight the importance of skeletal interfacial mixing for initiating droplet vaporization. Tuning molecular interactions between the endoskeleton and droplet phase is generalizable for achieving emulsion or other secondary phase transitions, in emulsions.},

We identify weak interactions involving intrinsically disordered domains of N and P that are implicated in this process, one of which is essential for phase separation. Fluorescence allows us to follow the modulation of the dynamics of N and P upon droplet formation, while NMR is used to investigate the thermodynamics of this process. RNA colocalizes to droplets, where it triggers assembly of N protomers into nucleocapsid-like particles that encapsidate the RNA.

Modeling suggests that stress changes induced by the earthquake were too small to account for the overpressure in the dike without additional bubble growth to pressurize the magma chamber. We find that the magma must be both H 2 O-saturated and at lower temperatures than those expected for newly intruded basalts. Too hot and the stress drop required to grow the bubbles is too large, too cold and the magma can no longer flow. These observations suggest that partially cooled and crystallized basaltic magmas are more susceptible to triggering from earthquakes.},

In this study, we investigated how the meiotic spindle orients through an obligatory rotation during meiotic division in mouse oocytes. We show that spindle rotation occurs at the completion of chromosome segregation, whereby the separated chromosome clusters each define a cortical actomyosin domain that produces cytoplasmic streaming, resulting in hydrodynamic forces on the spindle. These forces are initially balanced but become unbalanced to drive spindle rotation. This force imbalance is associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the distribution of the Arp2/3 complex and myosin-II on the cortex, brought about by feedback loops comprising Ran guanosine triphosphatase signaling, Arp2/3 complex activity, and myosin-II contractility. The torque produced by the unbalanced hydrodynamic forces, coupled with a pivot point at the spindle midzone cortical contract, constitutes a unique mechanical system for meiotic spindle rotation.},

Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.},

Contrary to previous claims, sulcal imprints reveal an ape-like brain organization and no features derived toward humans.

More unexpectedly, MAP6 localizes in the lumen of microtubules, induces the microtubules to coil into a left-handed helix, and forms apertures in the lattice, likely to relieve mechanical stress.

We combine high-resolution imaging of the interface with highly localized shear measurements at different velocities and temperatures to derive a quantitative picture of the lubricated friction around surface defects. We show that defects tend to promote local molecular order and increase friction forces by reducing the number of stable molecular configurations in their immediate vicinity.

A detailed mechanistic study of O 2 activation and the role of nitrogen heteroatoms were comprehensively investigated. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and control experiments provide strong evidence for the reaction mechanism proving the applicability of the CTFs to activate oxygen into superoxide species. This report highlights the importance of a self-templating procedure to introduce N functionalities for the development of metal-free catalytic materials.

  abstract     = {Transplantation of patient-derived Schwann cells is a promising regenerative medicine therapy for spinal cord injuries; however, therapeutic efficacy is compromised by inefficient cell delivery. We present a materials-based strategy that addresses three common causes of transplanted cell death: (i) membrane damage during injection, (ii) cell leakage from the injection site, and (iii) apoptosis due to loss of endogenous matrix. Using protein engineering and peptide-based assembly, we designed injectable hydrogels with modular cell-adhesive and mechanical properties. In a cervical contusion model, our hydrogel matrix resulted in a greater than 700\% improvement in successful Schwann cell transplantation. The combination therapy of cells and gel significantly improved the spatial distribution of transplanted cells within the endogenous tissue. A reduction in cystic cavitation and neuronal loss were also observed with substantial increases in forelimb strength and coordination. Using an injectable hydrogel matrix, therefore, can markedly improve the outcomes of cellular transplantation therapies.},

CS 2 molecules in their lowest few rotational states are adiabatically aligned and transversely accelerated by a nonresonant optical standing wave. The width of the measured transverse velocity distribution increases to 160 m/s with the field intensity, while its central peak position moves from 10 to −10 m/s. These changes are well reproduced by numerical simulations based on the rotational state–dependent alignment but cannot be modeled when ignoring these effects. Moreover, the molecular scattering by an off-resonant optical field amounts to manipulating the translational motion of molecules in a rotational state–specific way. Conversely, our results demonstrate that scattering from a nonresonant optical standing wave is a viable method for rotational state selection of nonpolar molecules.},

By extending the π-system of betalains, we designed a photostable and metal-free blue dye named BeetBlue that did not show toxicity to human hepatic and retinal pigment epithelial cells and does not affect zebrafish embryonal development. This chiral dye can be conveniently synthesized from betalamic acid obtained from hydrolyzed red beetroot juice or by enzymatic oxidation of l -dopa.

The textbook hydrolase active site, the catalytic triad, is modeled by positioning the three groups of the triad (-OH, -imidazole, and -CO 2 H) on a single, trifunctional surfactant molecule. To support this, we recreate the hydrogen bond donating arrangement of the oxyanion hole by imparting surfactant functionality to a guanidinium headgroup. Self-assembly of these amphiphiles in solution drives the collection of functional headgroups into close proximity around a hydrophobic nano-environment, affording hydrolysis of a model ester at rates that challenge α-chymotrypsin. Structural assessment via NMR and XRD, paired with MD simulation and QM calculation, reveals marked similarities of the co-micelle catalyst to native enzymes.},

Using an approach not previously investigated, we exploit surface-electrostatic NB formation and stabilization via application of external electric fields in gas-liquid systems, with the marked result of massively increased gas uptake into the liquid in NB form. The de facto gas solubility enhancement (over many months) ranges from 2.5-fold for oxygen to 30-fold for methane vis-à-vis respective Henry’s law values for gas solubility; the more hydrophobic the gas, the more spectacular the increase. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the origin of NBs’ movement lies in dielectrophoresis, while substantial NB stabilization arises from a surface-polarization interaction.},

The water transmission rate can be 15 times greater than that of best commercial breathable fabrics. This exceptional property is achieved by creating gradient wettability channels across a predominantly superhydrophobic substrate. The flow directionality is explained by the Gibbs pinning criterion. The permeability, mechanical property, and abrasion resistance (up to 10, 000 cycles) of the fabric were not affected by the treatment. In addition to functional clothing, this concept can be extended for developing materials for oil-water separation, wound dressing, geotechnical engineering, flexible microfluidics, and fuel cell membranes.},

We also constructed the first infectious DNA clones of a DNA mycovirus. Our results show that DNA-A and DNA-B are mutually interdependent for their replication and are associated with severely reduced colony growth and hypovirulence. DNA-C relies on DNA-A and DNA-B for replication and is necessary for the recovery of abnormal fungal phenotypes. DNA-C also enhances the accumulation of viral DNA in infected fungi and permits stable colonization and easy transmission via conidia. This is the first multipartite DNA virus isolated from a fungus.

Here, we investigate how long hibernation periods in cave bears would have directly affected their feeding biomechanics using CT-based biomechanical simulations of skulls of cave and extant bears. Our results demonstrate that although large paranasal sinuses were necessary for, and consistent with, long hibernation periods, trade-offs in sinus-associated cranial biomechanical traits restricted cave bears to feed exclusively on low energetic vegetal resources during the predormancy period. This biomechanical trade-off constitutes a new key factor to mechanistically explain the demise of this dominant Pleistocene megafaunal species as a direct consequence of climate cooling.},

Force-induced transcription up-regulation at the nuclear interior is associated with demethylation of histone H3 lysine-9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), whereas no transcription up-regulation near the nuclear periphery is associated with H3K9me3 that inhibits Pol II recruitment to the promoter site. H3K9me3 demethylation induces Pol II recruitment and increases force-induced transcription of egr-1 and Cav1 at the nuclear interior and activates mechano-nonresponsive gene FKBP5 near the nuclear periphery, whereas H3K9me3 hypermethylation has opposite effects.

Worm tissue δ 13 C of −44 to −58‰ are consistent with methane-fueled nutrition for both species, and shipboard stable isotope labeling experiments revealed active assimilation of 13 C-labeled methane into animal biomass, which occurs via the engulfment of methanotrophic bacteria across the crown epidermal surface. These worms represent a new addition to the few animals known to intimately associate with methane-oxidizing bacteria and may further explain their enigmatic mass occurrence at 150–million year–old fossil seeps. High-resolution seafloor surveys document significant coverage by these symbioses, beyond typical obligate seep fauna. These findings uncover novel consumers of methane in the deep sea and, by expanding the known spatial extent of methane seeps, may have important implications for deep-sea conservation.},

Using the 140-kDa purine biosynthetic enzyme PurL as a model system and a combination of biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies, we show that long-distance communication between ~25-Å distal active sites is initiated by an allosteric switch, residing in a conserved catalytic loop, adjacent to the synthetase active site. Further, combinatory experiments seeded from molecular dynamics simulations help to delineate transient states that bring out the central role of nonfunctional adaptor domains. We show that carefully orchestrated conformational changes, facilitated by interplay of dynamic interactions at the allosteric switch and adaptor-domain interface, control reactivity and concomitant formation of the ammonia tunnel. This study asserts that substrate channeling is modulated by allosteric hotspots that alter protein energy landscape, thereby allowing the protein to adopt transient conformations paramount to function.},

  abstract     = {Metal oxide semiconductor junctions are central to most electronic and optoelectronic devices, but ultrafast measurements of carrier transport have been limited to device-average measurements. Here, charge transport and recombination kinetics in each layer of a Ni-TiO 2 -Si junction is measured using the element specificity of broadband extreme ultraviolet (XUV) ultrafast pulses. After silicon photoexcitation, holes are inferred to transport from Si to Ni ballistically in ~100 fs, resulting in characteristic spectral shifts in the XUV edges. Meanwhile, the electrons remain on Si. After picoseconds, the transient hole population on Ni is observed to back-diffuse through the TiO 2 , shifting the Ti spectrum to a higher oxidation state, followed by electron-hole recombination at the Si-TiO 2 interface and in the Si bulk. Electrical properties, such as the hole diffusion constant in TiO 2 and the initial hole mobility in Si, are fit from these transient spectra and match well with values reported previously.},

  abstract     = {Stacking two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials with different interlayer atomic registry in a heterobilayer causes the formation of a long-range periodic superlattice that may bestow the heterostructure with properties such as new quantum fractal states or superconductivity. Recent optical measurements of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers have revealed the presence of hybridized interlayer electron-hole pair excitations at energies defined by the superlattice potential. The corresponding quasiparticle band structures, so-called minibands, have remained elusive, and no such features have been reported for heterobilayers composed of a TMD and another type of 2D material. We introduce a new x-ray capillary technology for performing microfocused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of ~1 μm, and directly observe minibands at certain twist angles in mini Brillouin zones (mBZs). We discuss their origin in terms of initial and final state effects by analyzing their dispersion in distinct mBZs.},

However, the mechanism underlying dynamic transition of P-TEFb from inactive to active state remains unclear. Here, we found that the SEC components are able to compartmentalize and concentrate P-TEFb via liquid-liquid phase separation from the soluble inactive HEXIM1 containing the P-TEFb complex. Specifically, ENL or its intrinsically disordered region is sufficient to initiate the liquid droplet formation of SEC. AFF4 functions together with ENL in fluidizing SEC droplets. SEC droplets are fast and dynamically formed upon serum exposure and required for rapid transcriptional induction. We also found that the fusion of ENL with MLL can boost SEC phase separation. In summary, our results suggest a critical role of multivalent phase separation of SEC in controlling transcriptional pause release.},

Evidence suggests that the complex forms either earlier in the endoplasmic reticulum or directly at the plasma membrane. Kv7.1 and KCNE1 mutations, responsible for long QT syndromes, impair association and traffic, thereby altering I Ks currents. We found that Kv7.1 and KCNE1 do not assemble in the first stages of their biogenesis. Data support an unconventional secretory pathway for Kv7.1-KCNE1 that bypasses Golgi. This route targets channels to endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane junctions, where Kv7.1-KCNE1 assemble. This mechanism helps to resolve the ongoing controversy about the subcellular compartment hosting the association. Our results also provide new insights into I Ks channel localization at endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane junctions, highlighting an alternative anterograde trafficking mechanism for oligomeric ion channels.},

Here, we present highly accurate ab initio potential energy curves based on state-of-the-art coupled-cluster and full configuration interaction computations for the ground and excited electronic states involved in the experimental investigations of Mg 2 . Our ground-state potential unambiguously confirms the existence of 19 vibrational levels, with ~1 cm −1 root mean square deviation between the calculated rovibrational term values and the available experimental and experimentally derived data. Our computations reproduce the latest laser-induced fluorescence spectrum and provide guidance for the experimental detection of the previously unresolved vibrational levels.},

First, news consumption of any sort is heavily outweighed by other forms of media consumption, comprising at most 14.2\% of Americans’ daily media diets. Second, to the extent that Americans do consume news, it is overwhelmingly from television, which accounts for roughly five times as much as news consumption as online. Third, fake news comprises only 0.15\% of Americans’ daily media diet.

However, their applications in vivo have been recognized as a challenge because of their susceptibility to nucleases and limited distribution to a target tissue. Here, we present the first example of oligonucleotide-based growth factor mimetics that exerts therapeutic effects at a target tissue after systemic injection. The aptamer was designed to dimerize a growth factor receptor for its activation and mitigated the progression of Fas-induced fulminant hepatitis in a mouse model. This unprecedented functionality of the aptamer can be reasonably explained by its high nuclease stability and migration to the liver parenchyma.

Here, we showed that NAD + -dependent class III HDAC sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) is highly expressed in resting B cells and down-regulated by stimuli inducing AID. B cell Sirt1 down-regulation, deprivation of NAD + cofactor, or genetic Sirt1 deletion reduced deacetylation of Aicda promoter histones, Dnmt1, and nuclear factor–κB (NF-κB) p65 and increased AID expression. This promoted class-switched and hypermutated T-dependent and T-independent antibody responses or led to generation of autoantibodies. Genetic Sirt1 overexpression, Sirt1 boost by NAD + , or allosteric Sirt1 enhancement by SRT1720 repressed AID expression and CSR/SHM. By deacetylating histone and nonhistone proteins (Dnmt1 and NF-κB p65), Sirt1 transduces metabolic cues into epigenetic changes to play an important B cell–intrinsic role in modulating antibody and autoantibody responses.},

Experimental evolution of clonal lines revealed that this viral production originates from the lysis of a minority of virus-susceptible cells, which are regenerated from resistant cells. Whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that this resistant-susceptible switch involved a large deletion on one chromosome. Mathematical modeling explained how the switch maintains stable microalga-virus population dynamics consistent with their observed growth pattern. Comparative genomics confirmed an ancient origin of this “accordion” chromosome despite a lack of sequence conservation.

Using combinatorial genetic perturbations, we show that independent pathways of cPRC1 and vPRC1 are responsible for maintenance of H2A monoubiquitylation and silencing of shared target genes. Individual loss of PRC2-dependent cPRC1 or PRC2-independent vPRC1 disrupts only one pathway and does not impair mESC self-renewal capacity. However, loss of both pathways leads to mESC differentiation and activation of a subset of lineage-specific genes co-occupied by relatively high levels of PRC1/PRC2.

Using enzymatic assays with purified human β-cardiac myosin, we provide evidence that both mutations cause hypercontractility by increasing the number of functionally accessible myosin heads. We also demonstrate that the myosin mutation R403Q, but not R663H, ablates the binding of myosin with the C0-C7 fragment of MyBP-C. Furthermore, addition of C0-C7 decreases the wild-type myosin basal ATPase single turnover rate, while the mutants do not show a similar reduction. These data suggest that a primary mechanism of action for these mutations is to increase the number of myosin heads functionally available for interaction with actin, which could contribute to hypercontractility.},

Current mathematical models are often formulated at the tissue or organ scale with the scope of a direct clinical usefulness. Consequently, these approaches remain empirical and do not allow gaining insight into the tumor properties at the scale of small cell aggregates. Here, experimental and numerical studies of the dynamics of tumor aggregates are performed to propose a physics-based mathematical model as a general framework to investigate tumor microenvironment. The quantitative data extracted from the cellular capsule technology microfluidic experiments allow a thorough quantitative comparison with in silico experiments. This dual approach demonstrates the relative impact of oxygen and external mechanical forces during the time course of tumor model progression.},

Here, we report on a platelet cell membrane–coated metal-organic framework (MOF) nanodelivery platform for the targeted delivery of siRNA in vivo. The MOF core is capable of high loading yields, and its pH sensitivity enables endosomal disruption upon cellular uptake. The cell membrane coating provides a natural means of biointerfacing with disease substrates. It is shown that high silencing efficiency can be achieved in vitro against multiple target genes. Using a murine xenograft model, significant antitumor targeting and therapeutic efficacy are observed. Overall, the biomimetic nanodelivery system presented here provides an effective means of achieving gene silencing in vivo and could be used to expand the applicability of siRNA across a range of disease-relevant applications.},

Here, we have determined the minimal requirements for the assembly of a functional boundary by dCTCF and two other C2H2 zinc finger proteins, Pita and Su(Hw). Although binding sites for these proteins are essential for the insulator activity of BX-C boundaries, these binding sites alone are insufficient to create a functional boundary. dCTCF cannot effectively bind to a single recognition sequence in chromatin or generate a functional insulator without the help of additional proteins. In addition, for boundary elements in BX-C at least four binding sites for dCTCF or the presence of additional DNA binding factors is required to generate a functional insulator.},

By introducing topological heterogeneity, we demonstrate a concept of topology isomerizable network (TIN) that can be programmed into many topological states. Using a photo-latent catalyst that controls the isomerization reaction, spatiotemporal manipulation of the topology is realized. The overall result is that the network polymer can be programmed into numerous polymers with distinctive and spatially definable (thermo-) mechanical properties. Among many opportunities for practical applications, the unique attributes of TIN can be explored for use as shape-shifting structures, adaptive robotic arms, and fracture-resistant stretchable devices, showing a high degree of design versatility.

SKP1 localizes to synapsed chromosome axes and evicts HORMAD proteins from these regions in meiotic spermatocytes. SKP1-deficient spermatocytes display premature desynapsis, precocious pachytene exit, loss of PLK1 and BUB1 at centromeres, but persistence of HORMAD, γH2AX, RPA2, and MLH1 in diplonema. Strikingly, SKP1-deficient spermatocytes show sharply reduced MPF activity and fail to enter MI despite treatment with okadaic acid. SKP1-deficient oocytes exhibit desynapsis, chromosome misalignment, and progressive postnatal loss. Therefore, SKP1 maintains synapsis in meiosis of both sexes. Furthermore, our results support a model where SKP1 functions as the long-sought intrinsic metaphase competence factor to orchestrate MI entry during male meiosis.},

Better understanding of fungus-mosquito interactions is critical for improvement of fungal efficacy.

However, regulatory mechanisms of fungal infection–related morphogenesis are poorly understood. Here, we show that a histone lysine methyltransferase KMT2 in Metarhizium robertsii (MrKMT2) is up-regulated upon cuticle induction. MrKMT2 plays crucial roles in regulating infection-related morphogenesis and pathogenicity by up-regulating the transcription factor gene Mrcre1 via H3K4 trimethylation during mosquito cuticle infection. MrCre1 further regulates the cuticle-induced gene Mrhyd4 to modulate infection structure (appressorium) formation and virulence. Overall, the MrKMT2-MrCre1-MrHyd4 regulatory pathway regulates infection-related morphogenesis and pathogenicity in M. robertsii . These findings reveal that the epigenetic regulatory mechanism plays a pivotal role in regulating fungal pathogenesis in insects, and provide new insights into molecular interactions between pathogenic fungi and insect hosts.},

The occurrence of flow slippage has a large impact on the liquid transport and the resulting energy dissipation, which are crucial for many applications. It is natural to expect that slippage takes place to reduce the dissipation. However, (i) how the density fluctuation is affected by the presence of the wall and (ii) how slippage takes place through forming a gas layer remained elusive. Here, we report possible answers to these fundamental questions: (i) Density fluctuation is intrinsically enhanced near the wall even in a quiescent state irrespective of the property of wall, and (ii) it is the density dependence of the viscosity that destabilizes the system toward gas-layer formation under shear flow. Our scenario of shear-induced gas-phase formation provides a natural physical explanation for wall slippage of liquid flow, covering the slip length ranging from a microscopic (nanometers) to macroscopic (micrometers) scale.},

The ability to make stable cavities of different sizes, as well as the huge range of accessible strains, allows us to systematically study the early stages of cavity expansion. Cavities grow in a scale-free manner, accompanied by irreversible bond breakage that is distributed around the growing cavity rather than being localized to a crack tip. Furthermore, cavities appear to grow at constant driving pressure. This has strong analogies with the plasticity that occurs surrounding a growing void in ductile metals. In particular, we find that, although elastomers are normally considered as brittle materials, small-scale cavity expansion is more like a ductile process.

Whereas kinases for Drp1-S616 phosphorylation are well-described, phosphatase(s) for its dephosphorylation remains unclear. Here, we show that dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) dephosphorylates Drp1-S616 independently of its known substrates ERK1/2. DUSP6 keeps Drp1-S616 phosphorylation levels low under normal conditions. The stability and catalytic function of DUSP6 are maintained through conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO1) and SUMO2/3 at lysine-234 (K234), which is disrupted during oxidation through transcriptional up-regulation of SUMO-deconjugating enzyme, SENP1, causing DUSP6 degradation by ubiquitin-proteasome. deSUMOylation underlies DUSP6 degradation, Drp1-S616 hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial fragmentation, and apoptosis induced by H 2 O 2 in cultured cells or brain ischemia/reperfusion in mice. Overexpression of DUSP6, but not the SUMOylation-deficient DUSP6 K234R mutant, protected cells from apoptosis. Thus, DUSP6 exerts a cytoprotective role by directly dephosphorylating Drp1-S616, which is disrupted by deSUMOylation under oxidation.},

Using a mouse model of malignant pleural effusion (MPE), we demonstrated that RT-MPs polarized microenvironmental M2 tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) to M1-TAMs and modulated antitumor interactions between TAMs and tumor cells. Following internalization of RT-MPs, TAMs displayed increased programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, enhancing follow-up combined anti–PD-1 therapy that confers an ablative effect against MPE and cisplatin-resistant MPE mouse models.

  abstract     = {Polar conductors/superconductors with Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction are potential material platforms for quantum transport and spintronic functionalities. One of their inherent properties is the nonreciprocal transport, where the rightward and leftward currents become inequivalent, reflecting spatial inversion/time-reversal symmetry breaking. Such a rectification effect originating from the polar symmetry has been recently observed at interfaces or bulk Rashba semiconductors, while its mechanism in a polar superconductor remains elusive. Here, we report the nonreciprocal transport in gate-induced two-dimensional superconductor SrTiO 3 , which is a Rashba superconductor candidate. In addition to the gigantic enhancement of nonreciprocal signals in the superconducting fluctuation region, we found kink and sharp peak structures around critical temperatures, which reflect the crossover behavior from the paraconductivity origin to the vortex origin, based on a microscopic theory. The present result proves that the nonreciprocal transport is a powerful tool for investigating the interfacial/polar superconductors without inversion symmetry, where rich exotic features are theoretically prognosticated.},

Physiologically, an enhanced metabolic state facilitates anabolic biosynthesis and mitosis to accelerate regeneration. However, the development of approaches to reprogram CBE, toward the treatment of substantial tissue injuries, has been limited thus far. Here, we show that induced repair in a rabbit model of weight-bearing bone defects is greatly enhanced using a bioenergetic-active material (BAM) scaffold compared to commercialized poly(lactic acid) and calcium phosphate ceramic scaffolds. This material was composed of energy-active units that can be released in a sustained degradation-mediated fashion once implanted. By establishing an intramitochondrial metabolic bypass, the internalized energy-active units significantly elevate mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) to supply increased bioenergetic levels and accelerate bone formation. The ready-to-use material developed here represents a highly efficient and easy-to-implement therapeutic approach toward tissue regeneration, with promise for bench-to-bedside translation.},

Primed BM-MSCs through HGF-eMSCs exhibited improved vasculogenic potential and cell viability, which ultimately enhanced vascular regeneration and restored cardiac function to the MI hearts. Histological analyses further demonstrated that the primed BM-MSCs survived longer within a cardiac patch and conferred cardioprotection evidenced by substantially higher numbers of viable cardiomyocytes in the MI hearts. These results provide compelling evidence that this in vivo priming strategy can be an effective means to enhance the cardiac repair of MI hearts.},

This paper clarifies this controversy and illustrates the impacts of woody biomass demand on forest harvests, prices, timber management investments and intensity, forest area, and the resulting carbon balance under different climate mitigation policies. Increased bioenergy demand increases forest carbon stocks thanks to afforestation activities and more intensive management relative to a no-bioenergy case. Some natural forests, however, are converted to more intensive management, with potential biodiversity losses. Incentivizing both wood-based bioenergy and forest sequestration could increase carbon sequestration and conserve natural forests simultaneously. We conclude that the expanded use of wood for bioenergy will result in net carbon benefits, but an efficient policy also needs to regulate forest carbon sequestration.},

In this study, stem cell EVs derived during differentiation are developed to use as cell-free therapeutic systems by inducing tissue-specific differentiation. EVs are isolated from human adipose-derived stem cells (HASCs) during white and beige adipogenic differentiation (D-EV and BD-EV, respectively) via tangential flow filtration. D-EV and BD-EV can successfully differentiate HASCs into white and beige adipocytes, respectively. D-EV are transplanted with collagen/methylcellulose hydrogels on the backs of BALB/c mice, and they produce numerous lipid droplets in injected sites. Treatments of BD-EV attenuate diet-induced obesity through browning of adipose tissue in mice. Furthermore, high-fat diet–induced hepatic steatosis and glucose tolerance are improved by BD-EV treatment. miRNAs are responsible for the observed effects of BD-EV. These results reveal that secreted EVs during stem cell differentiation into white adipocytes or beige adipocytes can promote cell reprogramming.},

We have designed a system to realize the above concept by deleting Pro 95 , a highly conserved residue in CDR-3 of the antibody light chain. The deletion of Pro 95 is a key contributor to catalytic function of the light chain. The S35 and S38 light chains have identical amino acid sequences except for Pro 95 . The former, with Pro 95 did not show any catalytic activity, whereas the latter, without Pro 95 , exhibited peptidase activity. To verify the generality of this finding, we tested another light chain, T99wt, which had Pro 95 and showed little catalytic activity. In contrast, a Pro 95 -deleted mutant enzymatically degraded the peptide substrate and amyloid-beta molecule. These two cases demonstrate the potential for a new method of creating catalytic antibodies from the corresponding mAbs.},

Chemistry at high shear forces can be intriguing, with relatively soft bonds becoming very stiff in specific force-loading geometries. Largely used in bionanotechnology, an important case is the streptavidin (SA)/biotin interaction. Although SA’s four subunits have the same affinity, we find that the forces required to break the SA/biotin bond depend strongly on the attachment geometry. With AFM-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), we measured unbinding forces of biotin from different SA subunits to range from 100 to more than 400 pN. Using a wide-sampling approach, we carried out hundreds of all-atom steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations for the entire system, including molecular linkers. Our strategy revealed the molecular mechanism that causes a fourfold difference in mechanical stability: Certain force-loading geometries induce conformational changes in SA’s binding pocket lowering the energy barrier, which biotin has to overcome to escape the pocket.},

Here, we model LCE microposts encompassing side-chain mesogens oriented along a magnetically programmed nematic director, and azobenzene cross-linkers, which determine the deformations of illuminated posts. On altering the nematic director orientation from vertical to horizontal, the post’s bending respectively changes from light-seeking to light-avoiding. Moreover, both modeling and subsequent experiments show that with the director tilted at 45°, the initially achiral post reversibly twists into a right- or left-handed chiral structure, controlled by the angle of incident light. We exploit this photoinduced chirality to design “chimera” posts (encompassing two regions with distinct director orientations) that exhibit simultaneous bending and twisting, mimicking motions exhibited by the human musculoskeletal system.},

We describe a reconstruction method where multiple scattering and diffraction effects in thick samples are modeled by multislice propagation and the 3D object function is retrieved through iterative optimization. We show that the same proposed method works for both full-field microscopy and for coherent scanning techniques like ptychography.

  abstract     = {Slow slip events (SSEs) accommodate a significant proportion of tectonic plate motion at subduction zones, yet little is known about the faults that actually host them. The shallow depth (&lt;2 km) of well-documented SSEs at the Hikurangi subduction zone offshore New Zealand offers a unique opportunity to link geophysical imaging of the subduction zone with direct access to incoming material that represents the megathrust fault rocks hosting slow slip. Two recent International Ocean Discovery Program Expeditions sampled this incoming material before it is entrained immediately down-dip along the shallow plate interface. Drilling results, tied to regional seismic reflection images, reveal heterogeneous lithologies with highly variable physical properties entering the SSE source region. These observations suggest that SSEs and associated slow earthquake phenomena are promoted by lithological, mechanical, and frictional heterogeneity within the fault zone, enhanced by geometric complexity associated with subduction of rough crust.},

Such a process underlies a wide range of technologies such as wireless communication, wireless charging, energy harvesting, and infrared detection. Existing rectifiers are mostly based on semiconductor diodes, with limited applicability to small-voltage or high-frequency inputs. Here, we present an alternative approach to current rectification that uses the intrinsic electronic properties of quantum crystals without using semiconductor junctions. We identify a previously unknown mechanism for rectification from skew scattering due to the inherent chirality of itinerant electrons in time-reversal invariant but inversion-breaking materials. Our calculations reveal large, tunable rectification effects in graphene multilayers and transition metal dichalcogenides. Our work demonstrates the possibility of realizing high-frequency rectifiers by rational material design and quantum wave function engineering.},

Of particular interest is whether labeling with a cancer-specific antibody ligand (“active targeting”) is superior to its unlabeled counterpart (“passive targeting”). Using models of breast cancer in three immune variants of mice, we demonstrate that intratumor retention of antibody-labeled nanoparticles was determined by tumor-associated dendritic cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages and not by antibody-antigen interactions. Systemic exposure to either nanoparticle type induced an immune response leading to CD8 + T cell infiltration and tumor growth delay that was independent of antibody therapeutic activity. These results suggest that antitumor immune responses can be induced by systemic exposure to nanoparticles without requiring a therapeutic payload. We conclude that immune status of the host and microenvironment of solid tumors are critical variables for studies in cancer nanomedicine and that nanoparticle technology may harbor potential for cancer immunotherapy.},

Here, we deploy a unique chemical boundary engineering (CBE) approach, augmenting the variety in available alloy design strategies, which enables us to create a material with an ultrafine hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure even after heating to high temperatures. When applied to plain steels with carbon content of only up to 0.2 weight\%, this approach yields ultimate strength levels beyond 2.0 GPa in combination with good ductility (&gt;20\%). Although demonstrated here for plain carbon steels, the CBE design approach is, in principle, applicable also to other alloys.},

Here, we address this puzzle regarding the tribochemical activities of sliding interfaces at the nanoscale. The results reveal that gaseous oxygen molecules disable the antifriction capacity of a-C:H by surface dehydrogenation of tribo-affected hydrocarbon bonds. In comparison, oxygen incorporation into the hydrocarbon matrix induces the formation of a low-density surface shear band, owing to which the friction state depends on the oxygen content. High friction of a-C:H film in humid environment originates from the “tumor-like” heterogeneous structures as formed in the highly oxidized tribolayer. Notably, an appropriate doping of silicon can completely shield the moisture effect by forming a silica-like tribolayer. These outcomes shed substantial lights upon the roadmap for achieving robust superlubricity of carbon films in a wide range of environments.},

The former is a well-known Mott insulator, which has recently been proposed to host a gapless spin-liquid ground state. The latter is a superconductor known to also host a competing charge density wave state. This raises the question of how these two components affect each other when stacked together. We find a superconductor with a T c of 2.7 Kelvin and anomalous properties, of which the most notable one is a signature of time-reversal symmetry breaking, abruptly appearing at the superconducting transition. This observation is consistent with a chiral superconducting state.},

However, nearly all of the previously reported ZEBSs showing signatures of the MZMs are observed in difficult-to-fabricate heterostructures at very low temperatures and additionally require applied magnetic field. Here, by using in situ scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we detect the ZEBSs upon the interstitial Fe adatoms deposited on two different high-temperature superconducting one-unit-cell iron chalcogenides on SrTiO 3 (001). The spectroscopic results resemble the phenomenological characteristics of the MZMs inside the vortex cores of topological superconductors.

In response, numerous surface treatments to counteract this effect have been explored, including perfluorinated coatings and surface hardening, but they all succumb to cavitation erosion eventually. Here, we report on biomimetic gas-entrapping microtextured surfaces (GEMS) that robustly entrap air when immersed in water regardless of the wetting nature of the substrate. Crucially, the entrapment of air inside the cavities repels cavitation bubbles away from the surface, thereby preventing cavitation damage. We provide mechanistic insights by treating the system as a potential flow problem of a multi-bubble system.

However, these methods are complex and alignment sensitive, and their use has been mostly confined to advanced metrology laboratories. Here, we have established a simple, compact, alignment-free, and potentially low-cost all-fiber photonics-based stabilization method for generating multiple ultrastable combs. The achieved performance includes 1-femtosecond timing jitter, few times 10 −15 -level frequency instability, and &lt;5-hertz linewidth, rivalling those of cavity-stabilized combs. This method features flexibility in configuration: As a representative example, two combs were stabilized with 180-hertz repetition rate difference and ~1-hertz relative linewidth and could be used as an ultrastable, octave-spanning dual-comb spectroscopy source. The demonstrated method constitutes a mechanically robust and reconfigurable tool for generating multiple ultrastable combs suitable for field applications.},

Using in situ neutron diffraction, we demonstrate the interaction of a rich variety of deformation mechanisms in high-entropy alloys at 15 K, which began with dislocation slip, followed by stacking faults and twinning, before transitioning to inhomogeneous deformation by serrations. Quantitative analysis showed that the cooperation of these different deformation mechanisms led to extreme work hardening. The low stacking fault energy plus the stable face-centered cubic structure at ultralow temperatures, enabled by the high-entropy alloying, played a pivotal role bridging dislocation slip and serration.

Zscan4-associated microsatellite regions are characterized by low nuclease sensitivity and high histone occupancy. In vitro, Zscan4 binds nucleosomes and protects them from disassembly upon torsional strain. Furthermore, Zscan4 depletion leads to elevated DNA damage in 2C mouse embryos in a transcription-dependent manner. Together, our results identify Zscan4 as a DNA sequence–dependent microsatellite binding factor and suggest a developmentally regulated mechanism, which protects fragile genomic regions from DNA damage at a time of embryogenesis associated with high transcriptional burden and genomic stress.},

Here, we demonstrate that ferromagnetic microparticles suspended at an air-water interface and energized by an external rotating magnetic field spontaneously form dynamic ensembles of synchronized spinners in a certain range of the excitation field parameters. Each spinner generates strong hydrodynamic flows, and collective interactions of the multiple spinners promote a formation of dynamic lattices. On the basis of experiments and simulations, we reveal structural transitions from liquid to nearly crystalline states in this novel active spinner material and demonstrate that dynamic spinner lattices are reconfigurable, capable of self-healing behavior and that the transport of embedded inert cargo particles can be remotely tuned by the parameters of the external excitation field. Our findings provide insights into the behavior of active spinner materials with reconfigurable structural order and tunable functionalities.},

However, the complexity of hierarchical structures, the requirement for mechanical properties, and the diversity of bone resident cells are the major challenges in constructing biomimetic bone tissue engineering scaffolds. Herein, a Haversian bone–mimicking scaffold with integrated hierarchical Haversian bone structure was successfully prepared via digital laser processing (DLP)–based 3D printing. The compressive strength and porosity of scaffolds could be well controlled by altering the parameters of the Haversian bone–mimicking structure. The Haversian bone–mimicking scaffolds showed great potential for multicellular delivery by inducing osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic differentiation in vitro and accelerated the ingrowth of blood vessels and new bone formation in vivo. The work offers a new strategy for designing structured and functionalized biomaterials through mimicking native complex bone tissue for tissue regeneration.},

A QSE-induced transition into an insulating phase in semimetallic nanofilms was predicted for bismuth a half-century ago and has regained new interest with regard to its surface states exhibiting nontrivial electronic topology. Here, we reveal an unexpected mechanism of the transition by high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations. Anomalous evolution and degeneracy of quantized energy levels indicate that increased Coulomb repulsion from the surface states deforms a quantum confinement potential with decreasing thickness. The potential deformation strongly modulates spatial distributions of quantized wave functions, which leads to acceleration of the transition beyond the original QSE picture. This discovery establishes a complete picture of the long-discussed transition and highlights a new class of size effects dominating nanoscale transport in systems with metallic surface states.},

The mechanisms through which stresses affect such properties are, in many cases, still under study, and their full understanding can pave the way to a full exploitation of stress as a primary control parameter. It is, for example, known that stresses promote particle mobility at small length scales, e.g., in colloidal glasses, gels, and metallic glasses, but this connection still remains essentially qualitative. Exploiting a preparation protocol that leads to colloidal glasses with an exceptionally directional built-in stress field, we characterize the stress-induced dynamics and show that it can be visualized as a collection of “flickering, ” mobile regions with linear sizes of the order of ≈20 particle diameters (≈2 μm here) that move cooperatively, displaying an overall stationary but locally ballistic dynamics.},

We observed strong volume effects especially in the limbic system but also in regions of the sensory, intermediate, and higher association networks. Sex-specific brain volume effects in the limbic system were linked to the frequency and intensity of social contact, such as indexed by loneliness, household size, and social support.

We studied both postulated channels by sequencing methylomes and genomes of Baltic three-spined sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ) along a salinity cline. Wild populations differing in salinity tolerance revealed differential methylation (pop-DMS) at genes enriched for osmoregulatory processes. A two-generation experiment demonstrated that 62\% of these pop-DMS were noninducible by salinity manipulation, suggesting that they are the result of either direct selection or associated genomic divergence at cis- or trans-regulatory sites. Two-thirds of the remaining inducible pop-DMS increased in similarity to patterns detected in wild populations from corresponding salinities. The level of similarity accentuated over consecutive generations, indicating a mechanism of transgenerational plasticity. While we can attribute natural DNA methylation patterns to the two information channels, their interplay with genomic variation in salinity adaptation is still unresolved.},

Controlling for interlaboratory variation, we compare radiocarbon data from Europe and the Mediterranean in the second to earlier first millennia BCE. Consistent with recent findings in the second millennium CE, these data suggest that some small, but critical, periods of variation for Mediterranean radiocarbon levels exist, especially associated with major reversals or plateaus in the atmospheric radiocarbon record.

Deletion of Gpr126 in osteoblasts resulted in a remarkable delay in osteoblast differentiation and mineralization during embryonic bone formation. Postnatal bone formation, bone mass, and bone strength were also significantly affected in Gpr126 osteoblast deletion mice because of defects in osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and ossification. Furthermore, type IV collagen functioned as an activating ligand of Gpr126 to regulate osteoblast differentiation and function by stimulating cAMP signaling. Moreover, the cAMP activator PTH(1–34), could partially restore the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and the body length phenotype induced by Gpr126 deletion.Together, our results demonstrated that COLIV-Gpr126 regulated body length and bone mass through cAMP-CREB signaling pathway.},

  abstract     = {To render high-fidelity wearable biomarker data, understanding and engineering the information delivery pathway from epidermally retrieved biofluid to a readout unit are critical. By examining the biomarker information delivery pathway and recognizing near-zero strained regions within a microfluidic device, a strain-isolated pathway to preserve biomarker data fidelity is engineered. Accordingly, a generalizable and disposable freestanding electrochemical sensing system (FESS) is devised, which simultaneously facilitates sensing and out-of-plane signal interconnection with the aid of double-sided adhesion. The FESS serves as a foundation to realize a system-level design strategy, addressing the challenges of wearable biosensing, in the presence of motion, and integration with consumer electronics. To this end, a FESS-enabled smartwatch was developed, featuring sweat sampling, electrochemical sensing, and data display/transmission, all within a self-contained wearable platform. The FESS-enabled smartwatch was used to monitor the sweat metabolite profiles of individuals in sedentary and high-intensity exercise settings.},

Here, we demonstrate an in situ synthetic strategy of bioactive zeolitic imidazolate framework-8–capped ceria nanoparticles (CeO 2 @ZIF-8 NPs) to achieve enhanced catalytic and antioxidative activities and improved stroke therapeutic efficacy. This nanosystem exhibits prolonged blood circulation time, reduced clearance rate, improved BBB penetration ability, and enhanced brain accumulation, where it effectively inhibits the lipid peroxidation in brain tissues in middle cerebral artery occlusion mice and reduces the oxidative damage and apoptosis of neurons in brain tissue. CeO 2 @ZIF-8 also suppresses inflammation- and immune response–induced injury by suppressing the activation of astrocytes and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, thus achieving satisfactory prevention and treatment in neuroprotective therapy. This study also sheds light on the neuroprotective action mechanisms of ZIF-8–capped nanomedicine against reperfusion-induced injury in ischemic stroke.},

Adenosine A 2A receptor (A 2A AR) is located in the lipid bilayers of cells, containing acyl chains derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). For the NMR studies, we prepared A 2A AR in lipid bilayers of nanodiscs, containing DHA chains and other acyl chains. The DHA chains in nanodiscs enhanced the activation of G proteins by A 2A AR. Our NMR studies revealed that the DHA chains redistribute the multiple conformations of A 2A AR toward those preferable for G protein binding. In these conformations, the rotational angle of transmembrane helix 6 is similar to that in the A 2A AR–G protein complex, suggesting that the population shift of the equilibrium causes the enhanced activation of G protein by A 2A AR. These findings provide insights into the control of neurotransmissions by A 2A AR and the effects of lipids on various GPCR functions.},

Their designations are often contentious. Opponents argue that monuments hurt local economies by limiting uses of public lands, while supporters counter that monuments create a new amenity-driven economy. We use panel data on all business establishments in the eight-state Mountain West region to estimate economic impacts of 14 monument designations over a 25-year period. We find that monuments increased the average number of establishments and jobs in areas near monuments; increased the average establishment growth rate; had no effect, positive or negative, on the number of jobs in establishments that existed pre-designation; and had no effect on mining and other industries that use public lands. On net, protecting lands as national monuments has been more help than hindrance to local economies in the American West.},

This fundamentally expected behavior can be used to deposit monolayers on supports or to reassemble into hierarchical materials to produce, by design, catalysts, nanodevices, films, drug delivery systems, and other products. Zeolites have been known as extraordinary catalysts and sorbents with three-dimensional structures but emerged as an unexpected new class of layered solids contributing previously unknown valuable features: catalytically active layers with pores inside or across. The self-evident question of layered zeolite exfoliation has remained unresolved for three decades. Here, we report the first direct exfoliation of zeolites into suspension of monolayers as proof of the concept, which enables diverse applications including membranes and hierarchical catalysts with improved access.},

Our studies originated from the observation of microvascular platelet retention in a rat cardiac surgery model. Ensuing work supported the proximity of platelet aggregates with perivascular mast cells (MCs) and demonstrated that platelet activation triggered systemic MC activation. We then identified platelet activating factor (PAF) as the platelet-derived mediator stimulating MCs and, using chimeric animals with platelets defective in PAF generation or MCs lacking PAF receptor, defined the role of this platelet-MC interaction for vascular leakage, shock, and tissue inflammation. In application of these findings, we demonstrated that inhibition of platelet activation in modeled cardiac surgery blunted MC-dependent inflammation and tissue injury. Together, our work identifies a previously undefined mechanism of inflammatory augmentation, in which platelets trigger local and systemic responses through activation of perivascular MCs.},

Our method involves lithographically defining hierarchical patterns of unique DNA oligonucleotides to which complementary strands, attached to cells and ligands-of-interest, hybridize. Highlighting our method’s power, we investigated how the spatial presentation of self-renewal ligand fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and differentiation signal ephrin-B2 instruct single adult neural stem cell (NSC) fate. We found that NSCs have a strong spatial bias toward FGF-2 and identified an unexpected subpopulation exhibiting high neuronal differentiation despite spatially occupying patterned FGF-2 regions.

Here, we report a general yet simple method to achieve strong adhesion of various conducting polymers on diverse insulating and conductive substrates in wet physiological environment.

Unexpectedly, one subset comprised POMC (proopiomelanocortin)–expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus, which are linked to appetite suppression. The POMC neurons were activated by one psychological stressor, physical restraint, but not another, a predator odor. Chemogenetic activation of POMC neurons induced a stress hormone response, mimicking a stressor. Moreover, their silencing markedly reduced the stress hormone response to physical restraint, but not predator odor.

Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS)–based lipidomics and redox lipidomics were used to conduct a detailed comparison of liquid-phase EV and MBV phospholipids. Combined with comprehensive RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the intravesicular cargo, we show that MBVs are a distinct and unique subpopulation of EV and a distinguishing feature of ECM-based biomaterials.

Investigation revealed that macrophages in the late wound drive fibrosis by phagocytizing dermal Wnt inhibitor SFRP4 to establish persistent Wnt activity. In accordance, phagocytosis abrogation resulted in transient Wnt activity and a more regenerative healing. Phagocytosis of SFRP4 was integrin-mediated and dependent on the interaction of SFRP4 with the EDA splice variant of fibronectin. In the human skin condition hidradenitis suppurativa, phagocytosis of SFRP4 by macrophages correlated with fibrotic wound repair.

  abstract     = {N 6 -methyladenine (6mdA) is a widespread DNA modification in bacteria. More recently, 6mdA has also been characterized in mammalian DNA. However, measurements of 6mdA abundance and profiles are often very dissimilar between studies, even when performed on DNA from identical mammalian cell types. Using comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of published data and novel experimental approaches, we reveal that efforts to assay 6mdA in mammals have been severely compromised by bacterial contamination, RNA contamination, technological limitations, and antibody nonspecificity. These complications render 6mdA an exceptionally problematic DNA modification to study and have resulted in erroneous detection of 6mdA in several mammalian systems. Together, our results strongly imply that the evidence published to date is not sufficient to support the presence of 6mdA in mammals.},

Here, we present data indicating that YAP1 may be a strong driver of the onset and progression of oral SCC (OSCC), a major subtype of HNSCC. Mice with tongue-specific deletion of Mob1a/b and thus endogenous YAP1 hyperactivation underwent surprisingly rapid and highly reproducible tumorigenesis, developing tongue carcinoma in situ within 2 weeks and invasive SCC within 4 weeks. In humans, precancerous tongue dysplasia displays YAP1 activation correlating with reduced patient survival. Combinations of molecules mutated in OSCC may increase and sustain YAP1 activation to the point of oncogenicity. Strikingly, siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of YAP1 blocks murine OSCC onset in vitro and in vivo. Our work justifies targeting YAP1 as therapy for OSCC and perhaps HNSCC, and our mouse model represents a powerful tool for evaluating these agents.},

Quantum error correction (QEC) encodes information in entangled states of many qubits and performs parity measurements to identify errors without destroying the encoded information. However, traditional QEC cannot handle leakage from the qubit computational space. Leakage affects leading experimental platforms, based on trapped ions and superconducting circuits, which use effective qubits within many-level physical systems. We investigate how two-transmon entangled states evolve under repeated parity measurements and demonstrate the use of hidden Markov models to detect leakage using only the record of parity measurement outcomes required for QEC. We show the stabilization of Bell states over up to 26 parity measurements by mitigating leakage using postselection and correcting qubit errors using Pauli-frame transformations. Our leakage identification method is computationally efficient and thus compatible with real-time leakage tracking and correction in larger quantum processors.},

This system has excellent recording performance, demonstrated via single unit and local-field potential recordings in isolated retina and in the motor cortex or striatum of awake moving mice. The modular design enables a variety of microwire types and sizes to be integrated with different types of pixel arrays, connecting the rapid progress of commercial multiplexing, digitisation and data acquisition hardware together with a three-dimensional neural interface.},

This framework reveals that previously published results based on a 1961–2005 attribution period frequently underestimate the influence of global warming on the probability of unprecedented extremes during the 2006–2017 period. This underestimation is particularly pronounced for hot and wet events, with greater uncertainty for dry events. The underestimation is reflected in discrepancies between probabilities predicted during the attribution period and frequencies observed during the out-of-sample verification period. These discrepancies are most explained by increases in climate forcing between the attribution and verification periods, suggesting that 21st-century global warming has substantially increased the probability of unprecedented hot and wet events. Hence, the use of temporally lagged periods for attribution—and, more broadly, for extreme event probability quantification—can cause underestimation of historical impacts, and current and future risks.},

However, how energy is coupled into these channels is debated, and especially, the relevance of electronic dissipation remains elusive. Here, we present friction experiments of a single-asperity sliding on a high- T c superconductor from 40 to 300 kelvin. Overall, friction decreases with temperature as generally expected for nanoscale energy dissipation. However, we also find a large peak around T c . We model these results by a superposition of phononic and electronic friction, where the electronic energy dissipation vanishes below T c . In particular, we find that the electronic friction constitutes a constant offset above T c , which vanishes below T c with a power law in agreement with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. While current point contact friction models usually neglect such friction contributions, our study shows that electronic and phononic friction contributions can be of equal size.},

Here, we have identified and optimized a series of compounds that block STAT3-dependent luciferase expression with nanomolar potency. Unexpectedly, our lead compounds did not bind to cellular STAT3 but to another prominent anticancer drug target, TrxR1. We further identified that TrxR1 inhibition induced Prx2 and STAT3 oxidation, which subsequently blocked STAT3-dependent transcription. Moreover, previously identified inhibitors of STAT3 were also found to inhibit TrxR1, and likewise, established TrxR1 inhibitors block STAT3-dependent transcriptional activity. These results provide new insights into the complexities of STAT3 redox regulation while highlighting a novel mechanism to block aberrant STAT3 signaling in cancer cells.},

Muon spin spectroscopy measurements give further independent evidence of local spin ordering and magnetic moments optically/electronically stored at the heterojunctions.

Specifically, banNVs were prepared by a nanotemplated synthesis of concatemer CpG, nanocondensation with cationic polypeptides, and then physical loading with hydrophobic R848 and Adpgk. The immunogenicity of the neoantigen was profoundly potentiated by efficient codelivery of neoantigen and dual synergistic adjuvants, which is accompanied by reduced acute systemic toxicity. BanNVs sensitized immune checkpoint programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) on T cells, therefore, a combination of banNVs with aPD-1 conspicuously induced the therapy response and led to complete regression of 70\% neoantigen-specific tumors without recurrence.

These “undead” neurons express a subset of olfactory receptors that is enriched for relatively recent receptor duplicates and includes some normally found in different chemosensory organs and life stages. Moreover, undead neuron axons integrate into the olfactory circuitry in the brain, forming novel receptor/glomerular couplings. Comparison of homologous olfactory lineages across drosophilids reveals natural examples of fate change from death to a functional neuron. Last, we provide evidence that PCD contributes to evolutionary differences in carbon dioxide–sensing circuit formation in Drosophila and mosquitoes. These results reveal the remarkable potential of alterations in PCD patterning to evolve new neural pathways.},

  abstract     = {Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. More than half of patients with NSCLC die after developing distant metastases, so rapid, minimally invasive prognostic biomarkers are needed to reduce mortality. We used proteomics to identify proteins differentially expressed on extracellular vesicles (EVs) of nonmetastatic 393P and metastatic 344SQ NSCLC cell lines and found that tetraspanin-8 (Tspan8) was selectively enriched on 344SQ EVs. NSCLC cell lines treated with EVs overexpressing Tspan8 also exhibited increased Matrigel invasion. Elevated Tspan8 expression on serum EVs of individuals with stage III premetastatic NSCLC tumors was also associated with reduced distant metastasis–free survival, suggesting that Tspan8 levels on serum EVs may predict future metastasis. This result suggests that a minimally invasive blood test to analyze EV expression of Tspan8 may be of potential value to guide therapeutic decisions for patients with NSCLC and merits further study.},

To understand the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in regulating tumor dormancy, we created an in vitro cell culture system with carefully controlled ECM substrates to observe entrance into and exit from dormancy with live imaging. We saw that cell populations capable of surviving entrance into long-term dormancy were heterogeneous, containing quiescent, cell cycle–arrested, and actively proliferating cells. Cell populations capable of entering dormancy formed an organized, fibrillar fibronectin matrix via α v β 3 and α 5 β 1 integrin adhesion, ROCK-generated tension, and TGFβ2 stimulation, and cancer cell outgrowth after dormancy required MMP-2–mediated fibronectin degradation. We propose this approach as a useful, in vitro method to study factors important in regulating dormancy, and we used it here to elucidate a role for fibronectin deposition and MMP activation.},

Using molecular catalysts, correlations between the reaction rate and energy efficiency have recently been identified. Improved catalysis requires circumventing the rate versus overpotential trade-offs implied by such “scaling relationships.” Described here is an ORR system—using a soluble iron porphyrin and weak acids—with the best reported combination of rate and efficiency for a soluble ORR catalyst. This advance is achieved not by “breaking” scaling relationships but rather by combining two of them. Key to this behavior is a polycationic ligand, which enhances anionic ligand binding and changes the catalyst E 1/2 . These results show how combining scaling relationships is a powerful way toward improved electrocatalysis.},

Both Yersinia toxins consist of an amino-terminal enzyme domain, an autoprotease domain activated by inositol hexakisphosphate, and a carboxyl-terminal translocation domain. YGT N -acetylglucosaminylates Rab5 and Rab31 at Thr 52 and Thr 36 , respectively, thereby inactivating the Rab proteins. YART ADP-ribosylates Rab5 and Rab31 at Gln 79 and Gln 64 , respectively. This activates Rab proteins by inhibiting GTP hydrolysis. We determined the crystal structure of the glycosyltransferase domain of YGT (YGT G ) in the presence and absence of UDP at 1.9- and 3.4-Å resolution, respectively. Thereby, we identified a previously unknown potassium ion–binding site, which explains potassium ion–dependent enhanced glycosyltransferase activity in clostridial and related toxins. Our findings exhibit a novel type of inverse regulation of Rab proteins by toxins and provide new insights into the structure-function relationship of glycosyltransferase toxins.},

The essential components driving cytoplasmic mRNA transport in neurons and mammalian cells are not known. We report the first reconstitution of a mammalian mRNA transport system revealing that the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) forms stable complexes with the axonally localized β-actin and β2B-tubulin mRNAs, which are linked to a kinesin-2 via the cargo adaptor KAP3. APC activates kinesin-2, and both proteins are sufficient to drive specific transport of defined mRNA packages. Guanine-rich sequences located in 3′UTRs of axonal mRNAs increase transport efficiency and balance the access of different mRNAs to the transport system.

Differentiation of monocytes into phDCs was concomitant with the formation of an “adhesion synapse, ” a biophysical junction enriched with platelet P-selectin and monocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1, followed by intracellular calcium fluxing and nuclear localization of nuclear factor κB. phDCs were more efficient than cytokine-derived DCs in generating tumor-specific T cell immunity.

The computational strategy includes prescreening of millions of compositions, prediction of alloy formation by density functional theory calculations, and examination of structural stability by a hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics method. Selected compositions can be efficiently and rapidly synthesized at high temperature (e.g., 1500 K, 0.5 s) with excellent thermal stability. We applied these MEA-NPs for catalytic NH 3 decomposition and observed outstanding performance due to the synergistic effect of multi-elemental mixing, their small size, and the alloy phase.

These phenotypes are also observed when young Rbp2 −/− mice are fed a high fat diet. Retinoids do not account for the phenotypes. Rather, RBP2 is a previously unidentified monoacylglycerol (MAG)-binding protein, interacting with the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and other MAGs with affinities comparable to retinol. X-ray crystallographic studies show that MAGs bind in the retinol binding pocket. When challenged with an oil gavage, Rbp2 −/− mice show elevated mucosal levels of 2-MAGs. This is accompanied by significantly elevated blood levels of the gut hormone GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide).

We observe a splitting of the zero-density lines of the two layers with increasing interlayer energy difference. This splitting is given by the ratio of single-layer quantum capacitance over interlayer capacitance C m and is therefore suited to extract C m . We explain the large observed value of C m by considering the finite dielectric thickness d g of each graphene layer and determine d g ≈ 2.6 Å. In a second experiment, we map out the entire density range with a Fabry-Pérot resonator. We can precisely measure the Fermi wavelength λ in each layer, showing that the layers are decoupled.

We provide new data from the southern highlands of Mexico, from the Early Formative period (1500–1000 BCE), that necessitate revising previous paradigms. Along with ballplayer imagery, we recently excavated the earliest highland Mesoamerican ballcourt, dating to 1374 BCE, at the site of Etlatongo, in the Mixtec region of Oaxaca. We conclude that Early Formative highland villagers played an important role in the origins of the formal Mesoamerican ballgame, which later evolved into a crucial component of subsequent states.},

We further identify that the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) is, in part, responsible for the uncertainties. Removing the IPO-related rainfall variations reduces the uncertainties in the near-term projection of the SASM rainfall by 13 to 15\% and 26 to 30\% in the MPI-ESM and CanESM2 ensembles, respectively.

  abstract     = {Recent in vivo studies reveal that several membrane proteins are driven to form nanoclusters by active contractile flows arising from localized dynamic patterning of F-actin and myosin at the cortex. Since myosin-II assemble as minifilaments with tens of myosin heads, one might worry that steric considerations would obstruct the emergence of nanoclustering. Using coarse-grained, agent-based simulations that account for steric constraints, we find that the patterns exhibited by actomyosin in two dimensions, do not resemble the steady-state patterns in our in vitro reconstitution of actomyosin on a supported bilayer. We perform simulations in a thin rectangular slab, separating the layer of actin filaments from myosin-II minifilaments. This recapitulates the observed features of in vitro patterning. Using super resolution microscopy, we find evidence for such stratification in our in vitro system. Our study suggests that molecular stratification may be an important organizing feature of the cortical cytoskeleton in vivo.},

Because of a paucity of single-cell studies of OA cartilage, little is known about the interpatient variability in its cellular composition and, more importantly, about the cell subpopulations that drive the disease. Here, we profiled healthy and OA cartilage samples using mass cytometry to establish a single-cell atlas, revealing distinct chondrocyte progenitor and inflammation-modulating subpopulations. These rare populations include an inflammation-amplifying (Inf-A) population, marked by interleukin-1 receptor 1 and tumor necrosis factor receptor II, whose inhibition decreased inflammation, and an inflammation-dampening (Inf-D) population, marked by CD24, which is resistant to inflammation. We devised a pharmacological strategy targeting Inf-A and Inf-D cells that significantly decreased inflammation in OA chondrocytes. Using our atlas, we stratified patients with OA in three groups that are distinguished by the relative proportions of inflammatory to regenerative cells, making it possible to devise precision therapeutic approaches.},

We link this to novel quartz-garnet crystallographic orientation data. The results reveal majoritic precursors stable at ≥175-kilometer depth and that quartz and mica may exsolve from garnet.

We identify 14, 311 Kcr sites across 3734 proteins in HeLa cells, providing by far the largest crotonylome dataset. We show that depletion of CDYL alters crotonylome landscape affecting diverse cellular pathways. Specifically, CDYL negatively regulated Kcr of RPA1, and mutation of the Kcr sites of RPA1 impaired its interaction with single-stranded DNA and/or with components of resection machinery, supporting a key role of RPA1 Kcr in homologous recombination DNA repair.

Although the impact of single-phase drops has been widely explored, the impact of compound drops has received little attention. Here, we demonstrate a self-lubrication mechanism for water-in-oil compound drops impacting on a solid surface. Unexpectedly, the core water drop rebounds from the surface below a threshold impact velocity, irrespective of the substrate wettability. This is interpreted as the result of lubrication from the oil shell that prevents contact between the water core and the solid surface. We combine side and bottom view high-speed imaging to demonstrate the correlation between the water core rebound and the oil layer stability. A theoretical model is developed to explain the observed effect of compound drop geometry. This work sets the ground for precise complex drop deposition, with a strong impact on two- and three-dimensional printing technologies and liquid separation.},

This inference method has been first successfully tested on synthetic motional data and then applied to two experiments. In the first experiment, cells migrate in a wound-healing model: When applied to this experiment, the inference method predicts the existence of cell-cell interactions, correctly mirroring the strong intercellular contacts that are present in the experiment. In the second experiment, dendritic cells migrate in a chemokine gradient. Our inference analysis does not provide evidence for interactions, indicating that cells migrate by sensing independently the chemokine source. According to this prediction, we speculate that mature dendritic cells disregard intercellular signals that could otherwise delay their arrival to lymph vessels.},

We used a multiphasic coxsackievirus B3 (CV) infection model with a first wave resulting in hepatic injury of the liver, followed by a second wave culminating in cardiac damage. This study shows that ISGylation sets nonhematopoietic cells into a resistant state, being indispensable for CV control, which is accomplished by synergistic activity of ISG15 on antiviral IFIT1/3 proteins. Concurrent with altered energy demands, ISG15 also adapts liver metabolism during infection. Shotgun proteomics, in combination with metabolic network modeling, revealed that ISG15 increases the oxidative capacity and promotes gluconeogenesis in liver cells. Cells lacking the activity of the ISG15-specific protease USP18 exhibit increased resistance to clinically relevant CV strains, therefore suggesting that stabilizing ISGylation by inhibiting USP18 could be exploited for CV-associated human pathologies.},

We used ECRG4 knockout (KO) mice to establish that the absence of ECRG4 leads to defective neutrophil recruitment with a delay in wound healing. An in vitro human promyelocyte model identified an ECRG4-mediated suppression of the hyaluronic acid receptor, CD44, a key receptor mediating inflammation resolution. In ECRG4 KO mouse leukocytes, there was an increase in CD44 expression, consistent with a model in which ECRG4 negatively regulates CD44 levels.

Through the generation of population-level paleogenomes from late Pleistocene Eurasian cave hyena and genomes from modern African spotted hyena, we reveal the cross-continental evolutionary relationships between these enigmatic hyena lineages. We find a deep divergence (~2.5 Ma) between African and Eurasian Crocuta populations, suggesting that ancestral Crocuta left Africa around the same time as early Homo . Moreover, we find discordance between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies and evidence for bidirectional gene flow between African and Eurasian Crocuta after the lineages split, which may have complicated prior taxonomic classifications. Last, we find a number of introgressed loci that attained high frequencies within the recipient lineage, suggesting some level of adaptive advantage from admixture.},

  abstract     = {One notable feature of bacterial motion is their ability to swim upstream along corners and crevices, by leveraging hydrodynamic interactions. This motion through anatomic ducts or medical devices might be at the origin of serious infections. However, it remains unclear how bacteria can maintain persistent upstream motion while exhibiting run-and-tumble dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli can travel upstream in microfluidic devices over distances of 15 mm in times as short as 15 min. Using a stochastic model relating the run times to the time that bacteria spend on surfaces, we quantitatively reproduce the evolution of the contamination profiles when considering a broad distribution of run times. The experimental data cannot be reproduced using the usually accepted exponential distribution of run times. Our study demonstrates that the run-and-tumble statistics determine macroscopic bacterial transport properties. This effect, which we name “super-contamination, ” could explain the fast onset of some life-threatening medical emergencies.},

While the formation of these molecules in the gas phase has been extensively studied, the complexity of organic aerosol (OA) and lack of suitable measurement techniques have hindered the investigation of their fate post-condensation, although further reactions have been proposed. We report here novel real-time measurements of these species in the particle phase, achieved using our recently developed extractive electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (EESI-TOF). Our results reveal that condensed-phase reactions rapidly alter OA composition and the contribution of HOMs to the particle mass. In consequence, the atmospheric fate of HOMs cannot be described solely in terms of volatility, but particle-phase reactions must be considered to describe HOM effects on the overall particle life cycle and global carbon budget.},

The fact that disturbance increases as primary forest fragment size decreases reflects higher land use pressures and improved access for resource extraction and/or conversion in smaller fragments. Large remaining forest fragments are found in the Amazon and Congo Basins and Insular Southeast Asia, with the majority of large extent/low loss fragments located in the Amazon. Tropical areas without large fragments, including Central America, West Africa, and mainland Southeast Asia, have higher loss within and outside of protected areas.

To achieve donor-specific immune tolerance and reduce the need for systemic immunosuppression, we developed a synthetic drug delivery system that mimics a strategy our bodies naturally use to recruit regulatory T cells (T reg ) to suppress inflammation. Specifically, a microparticle-based system engineered to release the T reg -recruiting chemokine CCL22 was used in a rodent hindlimb VCA model. These “Recruitment-MP” prolonged hindlimb allograft survival indefinitely (&gt;200 days) and promoted donor-specific tolerance. Recruitment-MP treatment enriched T reg populations in allograft skin and draining lymph nodes and enhanced T reg function without affecting the proliferative capacity of conventional T cells. With implications for clinical translation, synthetic human CCL22 induced preferential migration of human T reg in vitro. Collectively, these results suggest that Recruitment-MP promote donor-specific immune tolerance via local enrichment of suppressive T reg .},

One such factor is LukAB, a recently identified pore-forming toxin that targets human phagocytes by binding to the integrin component CD11b. LukAB exhibits strong tropism toward human, but not murine, CD11b. Here, phylogenetics and biochemical studies lead to the identification of an 11-residue domain required for the specificity of LukAB toward human CD11b, which is sufficient to render murine CD11b compatible with toxin binding. CRISPR-mediated gene editing was used to replace this domain, resulting in a “humanized” mouse. In vivo studies revealed that the humanized mice exhibit enhanced susceptibility to MRSA bloodstream infection, a phenotype mediated by LukAB.

Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we extract structural information from the very broad conformational ensemble of Tau: Tau in solution is highly dynamic and polymorphic, although “paper clip”–shaped by long-range contacts. Interaction with Hsp90 promotes an open Tau conformation, which we identify as the molecular basis for the formation of small Tau oligomers by exposure of the aggregation-prone repeat domain to other Tau molecules. At the same time, formation of Tau fibrils is inhibited. We therefore provide the nanometer-scale zoom into chaperoning an amyloid client, highlighting formation of oligomers as the consequence of this biologically relevant interaction.},

Although it has been hypothesized that invadopodia exert mechanical force that is implicated in cancer invasion, direct measurements remain elusive. Here, we use a recently developed interferometric force imaging technique that provides piconewton resolution to quantify invadopodial forces in cells of head and neck squamous carcinoma and to monitor their temporal dynamics. We compare the force exerted by individual protrusions to their ability to degrade ECM and investigate the mechanical effects of inhibiting invadopodia through overexpression of microRNA-375. By connecting the biophysical and biochemical characteristics of invadopodia, our study provides a new perspective on cancer invasion that, in the future, may help to identify biomechanical targets for cancer therapy.},

Each stage is made of two hydrophilic layers separated by a hydrophobic membrane. An imbalance in water activity in the two layers naturally causes a non-isothermal vapor flux across the membrane without requiring any mechanical ancillaries. One prototype of the device developed a specific cooling capacity of up to 170 W m −2 at a vanishing temperature difference, considering a 3.1 mol/kg calcium chloride solution.

We show that when the two organisms coexist, their population response to the antibiotic is opposite to that in isolation: Whereas in monoculture B. subtilis is tolerant and E. coli is sensitive to ampicillin, in coculture it is E. coli who can proliferate in the presence of the antibiotic, while B. subtilis cannot. This antithetic behavior is predicted by a mathematical model constrained only by the responses of the two species in isolation. Our results thus show that the collective response of mixed bacterial ecosystems to antibiotics can run counter to what single-species potency studies tell us about their efficacy.},

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) antibody may be either included into this cocktail for local injection or used via conventional intravenous injection. After injection of such cocktail into a solid tumor, in-situ gelation of ALG would lead to local retention and sustained release of therapeutics to reduce systemic toxicity. The chemotherapy-induced ICD with the help of immune adjuvant would trigger tumor-specific immune responses, which are further amplified by ICB to elicit potent systemic antitumor immune responses in destructing local tumors, eliminating metastases and inhibiting cancer recurrence.

  abstract     = {The unusual correlated state that emerges in URu 2 Si 2 below T HO = 17.5 K is known as “hidden order” because even basic characteristics of the order parameter, such as its dimensionality (whether it has one component or two), are “hidden.” We use resonant ultrasound spectroscopy to measure the symmetry-resolved elastic anomalies across T HO . We observe no anomalies in the shear elastic moduli, providing strong thermodynamic evidence for a one-component order parameter. We develop a machine learning framework that reaches this conclusion directly from the raw data, even in a crystal that is too small for traditional resonant ultrasound. Our result rules out a broad class of theories of hidden order based on two-component order parameters, and constrains the nature of the fluctuations from which unconventional superconductivity emerges at lower temperature. Our machine learning framework is a powerful new tool for classifying the ubiquitous competing orders in correlated electron systems.},

By the assistance of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, we reveal that an in situ–formed metal layer and a unique LiF-involved bilayer structure on the Li/electrolyte interface would be beneficial for effectively suppressing the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, the spansule-modified anode affords a high Coulombic efficiency of 98\% for over 1000 cycles at a current density of 2 mA cm −2 , which is the most stable LMA reported so far.

Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to assemble and transport polarizable microparticles in fluid media through combination of confinement and magnetic dipolar interactions. We use a homogeneous magnetic modulation to assemble dispersed particles into rotating dimeric state and frustrated binary lattices, and generate collective currents that arise from a novel, field-synchronized particle exchange process. These dynamic states are similar to cyclotron and skipping orbits in electronic and molecular systems, thus paving the way toward understanding and engineering similar processes at different length scales across condensed matter.},

It is currently unknown whether combining these strategies is beneficial. The preclinical evaluation for new TB vaccines is heavily skewed toward immunogenicity and efficacy; however, safety and efficacy are the dominant considerations in human use. To facilitate stage gating of TB vaccines, we developed a simple empirical model to systematically rank vaccination strategies by integrating multiple measurements of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. We assessed 24 vaccination regimens, composed of three BCG strains and eight combinations of delivery. The model presented here highlights that mucosal booster vaccination may cause adverse outcomes and provides a much needed strategy to evaluate and rank data obtained from TB vaccine studies using different routes, strains, or animal models.},

However, their practical application has been hindered by the manufacturing complexity and dimensional limits. Here, we develop a new class of ultrahigh areal number density solid-state MSCs (UHD SS–MSCs) on a chip via electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jet printing. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to exploit EHD jet printing in the MSCs. The activated carbon-based electrode inks are EHD jet-printed, creating interdigitated electrodes with fine feature sizes. Subsequently, a drying-free, ultraviolet-cured solid-state gel electrolyte is introduced to ensure electrochemical isolation between the SS–MSCs, enabling dense SS–MSC integration with on-demand (in-series/in-parallel) cell connection on a chip. The resulting on-chip UHD SS–MSCs exhibit exceptional areal number density [36 unit cells integrated on a chip (area = 8.0 mm × 8.2 mm), 54.9 cells cm −2 ] and areal operating voltage (65.9 V cm −2 ).},

Having generated recombinant measles (MeV) and canine distemper (CDV) viruses with truncated nucleocapsid (N) protein showing defects in replication kinetics, we have applied a viral evolution approach to the problem. Passaging of recombinants resulted in long-range compensatory mutations that restored RdRP bioactivity in minigenome assays and efficient replication of engineered viruses. Compensatory mutations clustered at an electronically compatible acidic loop in N-core and a basic face of the phosphoprotein X domain (P-XD). Co-affinity precipitations, biolayer interferometry, and molecular docking revealed an electrostatic-driven transiently forming interface between these domains. The compensatory mutations reduced electrostatic compatibility of these microdomains and lowered coprecipitation efficiency, consistent with a molecular checkpoint function that regulates paramyxovirus polymerase mobility through modulation of conformational stability of the P-XD assembly.},

Here, we bioprinted a sweat gland (SG)–like matrix to direct the conversion of MSC into functional SGs and facilitated SGs recovery in mice. By extracellular matrix differential protein expression analysis, we identified that CTHRC1 was a critical biochemical regulator for SG specification. Our findings showed that Hmox1 could respond to the 3D structure activation and also be involved in MSC differentiation. Using inhibition and activation assay, CTHRC1 and Hmox1 synergistically boosted SG gene expression profile. Together, these findings indicated that biochemical and structural cues served as two critical impacts of 3D-printed matrix on MSC fate decision into the glandular lineage and functional SG recovery.},

Here, we use three-dimensional numerical models to study the possibility of propagating convergent plate margins from preexisting intraoceanic subduction zones along passive margins [subduction propagation (SP)]. Three possible regimes are achieved: (i) subducting slab tearing along a STEP fault, (ii) lateral propagation–induced SI at passive margin, and (iii) aborted SI with slab break-off. Passive margin SP requires a significant preexisting lithospheric weakness and a strong slab pull from neighboring subduction zones. The Atlantic passive margin to the north of Lesser Antilles could experience SP if it has a notable lithospheric weakness. In contrast, the Scotia subduction zone in the Southern Atlantic will most likely not propagate laterally.},

However, recent experiments have observed gapless surface states, indicating the absence of out-of-plane surface magnetism, and thus, the quantized Hall resistance can only be achieved at the magnetic field above 6 T. We propose to induce out-of-plane surface magnetism of MnBi 2 Te 4 films via the magnetic proximity with magnetic insulator CrI 3 . A strong exchange bias of ∼40 meV originates from the long Cr- e g orbital tails that hybridize strongly with Te p orbitals. By stabilizing surface magnetism, the QAH effect can be realized in the MnBi 2 Te 4 /CrI 3 heterostructure. Moreover, the high–Chern number QAH state can be achieved by controlling external electric gates. Thus, the MnBi 2 Te 4 /CrI 3 heterostructure provides a promising platform to realize the electrically tunable zero-field QAH effect.},

Before PDT, the ROS-defensing system of the cancer cells was obstructed by an inhibitor to MTH1, which is a key for the remediation of ROS-caused DNA damage. As a result, both nuclei and mitochondrial DNA damages were increased, remarkably promoting cellular apoptosis. The therapeutic results demonstrated that the performance of PDT can be improved by the MTH1 inhibitor, leading to efficient cancer cell killing effect in the hypoxic tumor.

Our model incorporates several factors affecting drives with multiple gRNAs, including timing of cleavage, reduction in homology-directed repair efficiency due to imperfect homology, Cas9 activity saturation, gRNA activity level variance, and incomplete homology-directed repair. We find that homing drives have an optimal number of gRNAs, usually between two and eight, depending on the specific drive type and performance parameters. These results contradict the notion that resistance rates can be reduced to arbitrarily low levels by gRNA multiplexing and highlight the need for combined approaches to counter resistance evolution in CRISPR homing drives.},

  abstract     = {Wave concentration beyond the diffraction limit by transmission through subwavelength structures has proved to be a milestone in high-resolution imaging. Here, we show that a sound wave incident inside a solid over a diameter of 110 nm can be squeezed through a resonant meta-atom consisting of a nanowire with a diameter of 5 nm equal to λ/23, where λ is the incident acoustic wavelength, corresponding to a transmission efficiency of 500 or an energy densification of ~14, 000. This remarkable level of extraordinary acoustic transmission is achieved in the absence of ultrasonic attenuation by connecting a tungsten nanowire between two tungsten blocks, the block on the input side being furnished with concentric grooves. We also demonstrate that these “solid organ pipes” exhibit Rayleigh end corrections to their effective longitudinal resonant lengths notably larger than their in-air analogs. Grooves on the output side lead to in-solid directed acoustic beams, important for nanosensing.},

However, for particles with short-range attraction such as colloids and nanoparticles, which form brittle assemblies, the mechanism(s) of strain-relief is not known. Here, we found that for colloids with short-range attraction, monolayer films on substrates with square symmetry could accommodate large compressive misfit strains through locally dewetted hexagonally ordered stripes. Unexpectedly, over a window of compressive strains, cooperative particle rearrangements first resulted in a periodic strain-relief pattern, which then guided the growth of laterally ordered defect-free colloidal crystals. Particle-resolved imaging of monomer dynamics on strained substrates also helped uncover cooperative kinetic pathways for surface transport. These processes, which substantially influenced the film morphology, have remained unobserved in atomic heteroepitaxy studies hitherto. Leaning on our findings, we developed a heteroepitaxy approach for fabricating hierarchically ordered surface structures.},

We recently found the expression and maturation of rhodopsin are limited by the hydrophobicity of its seventh transmembrane domain (TM7), which contains polar residues that are essential for function. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that rhodopsin’s expression should be less tolerant of mutations in TM7 relative to those within hydrophobic TM domains. To test this hypothesis, we used deep mutational scanning to compare the effects of 808 missense mutations on the plasma membrane expression of rhodopsin in HEK293T cells. Our results confirm that a higher proportion of mutations within TM7 (37\%) decrease rhodopsin’s plasma membrane expression relative to those within a hydrophobic TM domain (TM2, 25\%). These results in conjunction with an evolutionary analysis suggest solvation energetics likely restricts the evolutionary sequence space of polar TM domains.},

Operando synchrotron transmission x-ray microscopy on the LiMn 2 O 4 cathode reveals that the WIS electrolyte suppresses the mechanical damage to the electrode network and dissolution of the electrode particles, in addition to delaying the water decomposition process. Because the viscosity of WIS is notably higher, the reaction heterogeneity of the electrodes is quantified with x-ray absorption spectroscopic imaging, visualizing the kinetic limitations of the WIS electrolyte. This work furthers the mechanistic understanding of electrode–WIS electrolyte interactions and paves the way to explore the strategy to mitigate their possible kinetic limitations in three-dimensional architectures.},

The distance between the rotation axis and the track (90 nm) was determined after adding a Cy3 label for SprB. A rotary motor spinning a pinion of radius 90 nm at 3 Hz would cause a spot on its periphery to move at 1.5 μm/s, the gliding speed. We suggest the pinion drives a flexible tread that carries SprB along a track fixed to the cell surface. Cells glide when this adhesin adheres to the solid substratum.},

Here, we report atomically sharp twin boundaries at AA′/AB stacking boundaries in chemical vapor deposition–synthesized few-layer hBN. We find that the twin boundary is composed of a 6′6′ configuration, showing conducting feature with a zero bandgap. Furthermore, the formation mechanism of the atomically sharp twin boundaries is suggested by an analogy with stacking combinations of AA′/AB based on the observations of extended Klein edges at the layer boundaries of AB-stacked hBN. The atomically sharp AA′/AB stacking boundary is promising as an ultimate 1D electron channel embedded in insulating pristine hBN.

We found that Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunits are differentially recruited to lineage specifier gene promoters across cell cycle in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Jarid2 and the catalytic subunit Ezh2 are markedly accumulated at target promoters during S and G 2 phases, while the transcriptionally activating subunits EPOP and EloB are enriched during G 1 phase. Fluctuations in the recruitment of PRC2 subunits promote changes in RNA synthesis and RNA polymerase II binding that are compromised in Jarid2 −/− mESCs. Overall, we show that differential recruitment of PRC2 subunits across cell cycle enables the establishment of a chromatin state that facilitates the induction of cell differentiation in G 1 phase.},

However, the identification of mouthpart homologs among Aneuretopsychidae remains controversial because of the lack of three-dimensional anatomical data. Here, we report the first Aneuretopsychidae from Late Cretaceous Burmese amber, which have short maxillary palpi and elongate mouthpart elements consisting of one pair of galeae and one hypopharynx. Their mouthparts are identical to those of Pseudopolycentropodidae (= Dualulidae, new synonym) but are not homologous to those of Siphonaptera. Our phylogenetic analysis provides robust evidence for the debated monophyly of Mesopsychoidea. Our results suggest that the long-proboscid condition has most likely evolved once in Mesopsychoidea, independently from fleas, and further reveal the variety and complexity of mid-Cretaceous pollinating insects.},

  abstract     = {Bones adapt to mechanical forces according to strict principles predicting straight shape. Most bones are, however, paradoxically curved. To solve this paradox, we used computed tomography–based, four-dimensional imaging methods and computational analysis to monitor acute and chronic whole-bone shape adaptation and remodeling in vivo. We first confirmed that some acute load-induced structural changes are reversible, adhere to the linear strain magnitude regulation of remodeling activities, and are restricted to bone regions in which marked antiresorptive actions are evident. We make the novel observation that loading exerts significant lasting modifications in tibial shape and mass across extensive bone regions, underpinned by (re)modeling independent of local strain magnitude, occurring at sites where the initial response to load is principally osteogenic. This is the first report to demonstrate that bone loading stimulates nonlinear remodeling responses to strain that culminate in greater curvature adjusted for load predictability without sacrificing strength.},

  abstract     = {Placental malaria (PM) is associated with severe inflammation leading to abortion, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction. Innate immunity responses play critical roles, but the mechanisms underlying placental immunopathology are still unclear. Here, we investigated the role of inflammasome activation in PM by scrutinizing human placenta samples from an endemic area and ablating inflammasome components in a PM mouse model. The reduction in birth weight in babies from infected mothers is paralleled by increased placental expression of AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Using genetic dissection, we reveal that inflammasome activation pathways are involved in the production and detrimental action of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the infected placenta. The IL-1R pharmacological antagonist Anakinra improved pregnancy outcomes by restoring fetal growth and reducing resorption in an experimental model. These findings unveil that IL-1β–mediated signaling is a determinant of PM pathogenesis, suggesting that IL-1R antagonists can improve clinical outcomes of malaria infection in pregnancy.},

Inverting generative models, or “analysis-by-synthesis”, presents a possible solution, but its mechanistic implementations have typically been too slow for online perception, and their mapping to neural circuits remains unclear. Here we present a neurally plausible efficient inverse graphics model and test it in the domain of face recognition. The model is based on a deep neural network that learns to invert a three-dimensional face graphics program in a single fast feedforward pass. It explains human behavior qualitatively and quantitatively, including the classic “hollow face” illusion, and it maps directly onto a specialized face-processing circuit in the primate brain. The model fits both behavioral and neural data better than state-of-the-art computer vision models, and suggests an interpretable reverse-engineering account of how the brain transforms images into percepts.},

While this mechanotransduction is known to depend on the regulation of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation on Y397 (FAKpY397), the mechanism remains elusive. To address this, we developed a mathematical model to test the hypothesis that FAKpY397-based mechanosensing arises from the dynamics of nanoscale integrin clustering, stiffness-dependent disassembly of integrin clusters, and FAKY397 phosphorylation within integrin clusters. Modeling results predicted that integrin clustering dynamics governs how cells convert substrate stiffness to FAKpY397, and hence governs how different cell types transduce mechanical signals. Existing experiments on MDCK cells and HT1080 cells, as well as our new experiments on 3T3 fibroblasts, confirmed our predictions and supported our model. Our results suggest a new pathway by which integrin clusters enable cells to calibrate responses to their mechanical microenvironment.},

Although the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are now being understood, physiological and pathological states of bone are still difficult to predict due to the complexity of intercellular signaling. We have now developed a novel in silico experimental platform, V-Bone, to integratively explore bone remodeling by linking complex microscopic molecular/cellular interactions to macroscopic tissue/organ adaptations. Mechano-biochemical couplings modeled in V-Bone relate bone adaptation to mechanical loading and reproduce metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and osteopetrosis. V-Bone also enables in silico perturbation on a specific signaling molecule to observe bone metabolic dynamics over time. We also demonstrate that this platform provides a powerful way to predict in silico therapeutic effects of drugs against metabolic bone diseases.

Here, we show that already a single dissipatively driven auxiliary particle can efficiently prepare the quantum simulator in a low-energy state of largely arbitrary Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach and show that it is robust against unwanted sources of decoherence. While our initialization protocol is largely independent of the physical realization of the simulation device, we provide an implementation example for a trapped ion quantum simulator.},

A central step in fucoxanthin biosynthesis that has been elusive so far is the conversion of violaxanthin to neoxanthin. Here, we show that in chromalveolates, this reaction is catalyzed by violaxanthin de-epoxidase–like (VDL) proteins and that VDL is also involved in the formation of other light-harvesting carotenoids such as peridinin or vaucheriaxanthin. VDL is closely related to the photoprotective enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase that operates in plants and most algae, revealing that in major phyla of marine algae, an ancient gene duplication triggered the evolution of carotenoid functions beyond photoprotection toward light harvesting.},

We find that heterogeneous mesenchymal stromal cells self-organize in 3D in a developmentally hierarchical manner. We demonstrate a link between structural organization and local regulation of specific molecular signaling pathways such as NF-κB and actin polymerization, which modulate osteo-endocrine functions. This study emphasizes the importance of resolving spatial heterogeneities within cellular aggregates to link organization and functional properties, enabling a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling organoid formation, relevant to organogenesis and tissue repair.},

We bioprinted a wide range of biologics with dimensions in an order-of-magnitude range including tissue spheroids (80 to 600 μm), tissue strands (~800 μm), or single cells (electrocytes, ~400 μm), and as applications, we illustrated the patterning of angiogenic sprouting spheroids and self-assembly of osteogenic spheroids.},

Through the far-field radiation that is inherent to the states’ existence, we characterize their properties, including linear dispersion and low loss. We find that the edge state pseudospin is encoded in unique circular far-field polarization and linked to unidirectional propagation, thus revealing a signature of the underlying photonic spin-orbit coupling.

  abstract     = {The essence of turbulent flow is the conveyance of energy through the formation, interaction, and destruction of eddies over a wide range of spatial scales—from the largest scales where energy is injected down to the smallest scales where it is dissipated through viscosity. Currently, there is no mechanistic framework that captures how the interactions of vortices drive this cascade. We show that iterations of the elliptical instability, arising from the interactions between counter-rotating vortices, lead to the emergence of turbulence. We demonstrate how the nonlinear development of the elliptical instability generates an ordered array of antiparallel secondary filaments. The secondary filaments mutually interact, leading to the formation of even smaller tertiary filaments. In experiments and simulations, we observe two and three iterations of this cascade, respectively. Our observations indicate that the elliptical instability could be one of the fundamental mechanisms by which the turbulent cascade develops.},

  abstract     = {Cytostasis is the most salient manifestation of the potent antimicrobial activity of nitric oxide (NO), yet the mechanism by which NO disrupts bacterial cell division is unknown. Here, we show that in respiring Escherichia coli, Salmonella , and Bacillus subtilis , NO arrests the first step in division, namely, the GTP-dependent assembly of the bacterial tubulin homolog FtsZ into a cytokinetic ring. FtsZ assembly fails in respiring cells because NO inactivates inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase in de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis and quinol oxidases in the electron transport chain, leading to drastic depletion of nucleoside triphosphates, including the GTP needed for the polymerization of FtsZ. Despite inhibiting respiration and dissipating proton motive force, NO does not destroy Z ring formation and only modestly decreases nucleoside triphosphates in glycolytic cells, which obtain much of their ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation and overexpress inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase. Purine metabolism dictates the susceptibility of early morphogenic steps in cytokinesis to NO toxicity.},

Here, we found that blood-stage malaria parasites predominantly induced CD4 + Foxp3 + CD25 + regulatory T cells to release soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 (sFGL2), which substantially enhanced the infection. This was attributed to the capacity of sFGL2 to inhibit macrophages from releasing monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and to sequentially reduce the recruitment of natural killer/natural killer T cells to the spleen and the production of interferon-γ. sFGL2 inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation in the Toll-like receptor 2 signaling pathway of macrophages dependent on FcγRIIB receptor to release MCP-1. Notably, sFGL2 were markedly elevated in the sera of patients with malaria, and recombinant FGL2 substantially suppressed Plasmodium falciparum from inducing macrophages to release MCP-1. Therefore, we highlight a previously unrecognized immune suppression strategy of malaria parasites and uncover the fundamental mechanism of sFGL2 to suppress host innate immune responses.},

Both welding and aligning of the LCE materials rely on thermal polymerization of preformed LCE films with reactive acrylate groups. This method provides an easy way to robustly fabricate arbitrary 3D desirable geometries with strongly stable reversible actuations and multifunctionalities, which greatly enlarges and benefits the future applications and manufacturing of LCE soft robots.},

Here, we report the construction of a molecular defect-containing bilayer graphene (MDBG) with an inner cavity by organic synthesis. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy unambiguously characterize the structure of MDBG. Compared with its same-sized, defect-free counterpart, the MDBG exhibits a notable blue shift of optical absorption and emission, as well as a 9.6-fold brightening of its photoluminescence, which demonstrates that a single defect can markedly alter the optical properties of bilayer graphene.},

Here, we synthesize stratigraphic records covering 12, 000 years of dynamics of this system at 144 localities across three dune fields in northern China. We find side-by-side coexistence of active and stabilized states, and occasional sharp shifts in time between those contrasting states. Those shifts occur asynchronously despite the fact that the entire landscape has been subject to the same gradual changes in monsoon rainfall and other conditions. At larger scale, the spatial heterogeneity in dune dynamics averages out to produce relatively smooth change.

For concreteness, we report on the extreme example of the Cu x (PbSe) 5 (BiSe 3 ) 6 superconductor. Thermal conductivity measurements down to 50 mK not only give unambiguous evidence for the existence of nodes but also reveal that the energy scale corresponding to the scattering rate is orders of magnitude larger than the superconducting energy gap.

Although proangiogenic actions of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been extensively studied, the mechanistic role of NO in this action remains obscure. Here, we used a gelatin hydrogel that releases NO upon crosslinking by a transglutaminase reaction (“NO gel”). Then, the source-specific behaviors of bone marrow versus adipose tissue-derived hMSCs (BMSCs versus ADSCs) were monitored in the NO gels. NO inhibition resulted in significant decreases in their angiogenic activities. The NO gel induced pericyte-like characteristics in BMSCs in contrast to EC differentiation in ADSCs, as evidenced by tube stabilization versus tube formation, 3D colocalization versus 2D coformation with EC tube networks, pericyte-like wound healing versus EC-like vasculogenesis in gel plugs, and pericyte versus EC marker production. These results provide previously unidentified insights into the effects of NO in regulating hMSC source-specific angiogenic mechanisms and their therapeutic applications.},

  abstract     = {Spin and valley degrees of freedom in materials without inversion symmetry promise previously unknown device functionalities, such as spin-valleytronics. Control of material symmetry with electric fields (ferroelectricity), while breaking additional symmetries, including mirror symmetry, could yield phenomena where chirality, spin, valley, and crystal potential are strongly coupled. Here we report the synthesis of a halide perovskite semiconductor that is simultaneously photoferroelectricity switchable and chiral. Spectroscopic and structural analysis, and first-principles calculations, determine the material to be a previously unknown low-dimensional hybrid perovskite (R)-(−)-1-cyclohexylethylammonium/(S)-(+)-1 cyclohexylethylammonium) PbI 3 . Optical and electrical measurements characterize its semiconducting, ferroelectric, switchable pyroelectricity and switchable photoferroelectric properties. Temperature dependent structural, dielectric and transport measurements reveal a ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirms its chirality. The development of a material with such a combination of these properties will facilitate the exploration of phenomena such as electric field and chiral enantiomer–dependent Rashba-Dresselhaus splitting and circular photogalvanic effects.},

Although its benefits have been demonstrated, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is underutilized in gastric cancer management, because of the lack of biomarkers for patient selection and a limited understanding of resistance mechanisms. Here, we performed whole-genome, whole-exome, and RNA sequencing on 84 clinical samples (including matched pre- and posttreatment tumors) from 35 patients whose responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were rigorously defined. We observed increased microsatellite instability and mutation burden in nonresponse tumors. Through comparisons of response versus nonresponse tumors and pre- versus posttreatment samples, we found that C10orf71 mutations were associated with treatment resistance, which was supported by drug response data and potentially through inhibition of cell cycle, and that MYC amplification correlated with treatment sensitivity, whereas MDM2 amplification showed the opposite pattern. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy also reshapes tumor-immune signaling and microenvironment. Our study provides a critical basis for developing precision neoadjuvant regimens.},

Nitrogen isotope fractionation resulting from NH 3 volatilization at high pH has the potential to fill this gap. To validate this idea, we analyzed samples from the Nördlinger Ries, a Miocene impact crater lake that displayed pH values up to 9.8 as inferred from mineralogy and aqueous modeling. Our data show a peak in δ 15 N of +17‰ in the most alkaline facies, followed by a gradual decline to around +5‰, concurrent with the proposed decline in pH, highlighting the utility of nitrogen isotopes as a proxy for high-pH conditions. In combination with independent mineralogical indicators for high alkalinity, nitrogen isotopes can provide much-needed quantitative constraints on ancient atmospheric P co 2 (partial pressure of CO 2 ) and thus climatic controls on early Earth and Mars.},

During the subsequent deglaciation, sea level rose rapidly and ultimately flooded the Bering Strait, linking the Arctic and Pacific Oceans. Observational records of the Bering Strait flooding have suggested two apparently contradictory scenarios for the timing of the reconnection. We reconcile these enigmatic datasets using gravitationally self-consistent sea-level simulations that vary the timing and geometry of ice retreat between the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets to the southwest of the Bering Strait to fit observations of a two-phased flooding history. Assuming the datasets are robust, we demonstrate that their reconciliation requires a substantial melting of the Cordilleran and western Laurentide Ice Sheet from 13, 000 to 11, 500 years ago. This timing provides a freshwater source for the widely debated Younger Dryas cold episode (12, 900 to 11, 700 years ago).},

To reconstruct changes in ocean circulation during this period, we used a numerical model to simulate the flow trajectory of Columbia River megafloods and compiled records of sea surface temperature, paleo-salinity, and deep-water radiocarbon from marine sediment cores in the Northeast Pacific. The North Pacific sea surface cooled and freshened during the early deglacial (19.0-16.5 ka) and Younger Dryas (12.9-11.7 ka) intervals, coincident with the appearance of subsurface water masses depleted in radiocarbon relative to the sea surface. We infer that Pacific meltwater fluxes contributed to net Northern Hemisphere cooling prior to North Atlantic Heinrich Events, and again during the Younger Dryas stadial. Abrupt warming in the Northeast Pacific similarly contributed to hemispheric warming during the Bølling and Holocene transitions. These findings underscore the importance of changes in North Pacific freshwater fluxes and circulation in deglacial climate events.},

This breakthrough was achieved because of the successful 3D integration of so-called OTS selector devices with innovative phase-change memories, both based on chalcogenide materials. This paves the way for storage class memories as well as neuromorphic circuits. We elucidate the mechanism behind OTS switching by new state-of-the-art materials using electrical, optical, and x-ray absorption experiments, as well as ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The model explaining the switching mechanism occurring in amorphous OTS materials under electric field involves the metastable formation of newly introduced metavalent bonds. This model opens the way for design of improved OTS materials and for future types of applications such as brain-inspired computing.},

However, measuring the Hall or spin-Hall response is often a challenge and practically limited to the ground state. An experimental technique for tracing the topological character in a differential fashion would provide useful insights. In this work, we show that circular dichroism angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy provides a powerful tool that can resolve the topological and quantum-geometrical character in momentum space. In particular, we investigate how to map out the signatures of the momentum-resolved Berry curvature in two-dimensional materials by exploiting its intimate connection to the orbital polarization. A spin-resolved detection of the photoelectrons allows one to extend the approach to spin-Chern insulators. The present proposal can be extended to address topological properties in materials out of equilibrium in a time-resolved fashion.},

We model here topoisomerase-mediated passages of double-stranded DNA segments through each other using the formalism of grid diagrams. We show that this grid diagram–based modeling approach captures the essence of the preferential unknotting mechanism, based on topoisomerase selectivity of hooked DNA juxtapositions as the sites of intersegmental passages.

The hybridization of two Majorana vortex modes cannot simply explain this phenomenon. We construct a three-dimensional tight-binding model simulating the physics of over a hundred Majorana vortex modes in FeTe x Se 1− x . Our simulation shows that the Majorana hybridization and disordered vortex distribution can explain the decreasing fraction of the zero-bias peaks observed in the experiment; the statistics of the energy peaks off zero energy in our Majorana simulation are in agreement with the experiment.

Synchrotron x-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated the presence of previously predicted F 4 ¯ 3 m -PrH 9 and unexpected P 6 3 / mmc -PrH 9 phases. Experimental studies of electrical resistance in the PrH 9 sample showed the emergence of a possible superconducting transition ( T c ) below 9 K and T c dependent on the applied magnetic field.

Here, we explore direct microcomb atomic spectroscopy, using a cascaded, two-photon 1529-nm atomic transition in a rubidium micromachined cell. Fine and simultaneous repetition rate and carrier-envelope offset frequency control of the soliton enables direct sub-Doppler and hyperfine spectroscopy. Moreover, the entire set of microcomb modes are stabilized to this atomic transition, yielding absolute optical-frequency fluctuations at the kilohertz level over a few seconds and &lt;1-MHz day-to-day accuracy.

  abstract     = {Although multilevel sociality is a universal feature of human social organization, its functional relevance remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of multilevel sociality on cumulative cultural evolution by using wireless sensing technology to map inter- and intraband social networks among Agta hunter-gatherers. By simulating the accumulation of cultural innovations over the real Agta multicamp networks, we demonstrate that multilevel sociality accelerates cultural differentiation and cumulative cultural evolution. Our results suggest that hunter-gatherer social structures [based on (i) clustering of families within camps and camps within regions, (ii) cultural transmission within kinship networks, and (iii) high intercamp mobility] may have allowed past and present hunter-gatherers to maintain cumulative cultural adaptation despite low population density, a feature that may have been critical in facilitating the global expansion of Homo sapiens .},

However, this classification has remained controversial largely due to lack of genetic evidence, directly impairing scientific conservation management. Data from 65 whole genomes, 49 Y-chromosomes, and 49 mitochondrial genomes provide the first comprehensive genetic evidence for species divergence in red pandas, demonstrating substantial inter-species genetic divergence for all three markers and correcting species-distribution boundaries. Combined with morphological evidence, these data thus clearly define two phylogenetic species in red pandas. We also demonstrate different demographic trajectories in the two species: A. styani has experienced two population bottlenecks and one large population expansion over time, whereas A. fulgens has experienced three bottlenecks and one very small expansion, resulting in very low genetic diversity, high linkage disequilibrium, and high genetic load.},

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently emerged as a promising cancer biomarker, and EV phenotyping shows high potential for monitoring treatment responses. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring patient treatment responses based on the plasma EV phenotypic evolution using a multiplex EV phenotype analyzer chip (EPAC). EPAC incorporates the nanomixing-enhanced microchip and the multiplex surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotag system for direct EV phenotyping without EV enrichment. In a preclinical model, we observe the EV phenotypic heterogeneity and different phenotypic responses to the treatment. Furthermore, we successfully detect cancer-specific EV phenotypes from melanoma patient plasma. We longitudinally monitor the EV phenotypic evolution of eight melanoma patients receiving targeted therapy and find specific EV profiles involved in the development of drug resistance, reflecting the potential of EV phenotyping for monitoring treatment responses.},

The greenhouse gas concentrations were sufficient to offset a fainter Sun. Climate moderation by the carbon cycle suggests average surface temperatures between 0° and 40°C, consistent with occasional glaciations. Isotopic mass fractionation of atmospheric xenon through the Archean until atmospheric oxygenation is best explained by drag of xenon ions by hydrogen escaping rapidly into space. These data imply that substantial loss of hydrogen oxidized the Earth.

However, it is poorly understood how the macroscopic behavior emerges in complex materials with strong electronic correlations. While measurements of the dynamics of excited electronic populations have been able to give some insight, they have largely neglected the intricate dynamics of quantum coherence. Here, we apply multidimensional coherent spectroscopy to a prototypical cuprate and report unprecedented coherent dynamics persisting for ~500 fs, originating directly from the quantum superposition of optically excited states separated by 20 to 60 meV. These results reveal that the states in this energy range are correlated with the optically excited states at ~1.5 eV and point to nontrivial interactions between quantum many-body states on the different energy scales. In revealing these dynamics and correlations, we demonstrate that multidimensional coherent spectroscopy can interrogate complex quantum materials in unprecedented ways.},

We use tools from deep learning to develop a new approach, adversarial Monte Carlo meta-learning, for constructing optimal statistical procedures. Statistical problems are framed as two-player games in which Nature adversarially selects a distribution that makes it difficult for a statistician to answer the scientific question using data drawn from this distribution. The players’ strategies are parameterized via neural networks, and optimal play is learned by modifying the network weights over many repetitions of the game. Given sufficient computing time, the statistician’s strategy is (nearly) optimal at the finite observed sample size, rather than in the hypothetical scenario where sample size grows to infinity. In numerical experiments and data examples, this approach performs favorably compared to standard practice in point estimation, individual-level predictions, and interval estimation.},

Here, we sought to characterize spatial correlates of neurons within the region during free exploration in two-dimensional environments. We report that a large percentage of retrosplenial cortex neurons have spatial receptive fields that are active when environmental boundaries are positioned at a specific orientation and distance relative to the animal itself. We demonstrate that this vector-based location signal is encoded in egocentric coordinates, is localized to the dysgranular retrosplenial subregion, is independent of self-motion, and is context invariant. Further, we identify a subpopulation of neurons with this response property that are synchronized with the hippocampal theta oscillation. Accordingly, the current work identifies a robust egocentric spatial code in retrosplenial cortex that can facilitate spatial coordinate system transformations and support the anchoring, generation, and utilization of allocentric representations.},

This selection process is based on the electron-mediated coupling between two nuclear spins and their difference in resonance frequency. We introduce a generalized and versatile pulsed NMR experiment that allows populating singlet states on a broad scale of coupling patterns. This approach allowed us to filter signals from proton pairs in the Alzheimer’s disease–related b-amyloid 40 peptide and in metabolites in brain matter. In particular, for glutamine/glutamate, we have discovered a long-lived state in tissue without the typically required singlet sustaining by radiofrequency irradiation.

Here, we model the diversity of “stem” (basal) and “crown” (modern) members of groups using a “birth-death model, ” the results of which qualitatively match many large-scale patterns seen in the fossil record. Typically, the stem group diversifies rapidly until the crown group emerges, at which point its diversity collapses, followed shortly by its extinction. Mass extinctions can disturb this pattern and create long stem groups such as the dinosaurs. Crown groups are unlikely to emerge either cryptically or just before mass extinctions, in contradiction to popular hypotheses such as the “phylogenetic fuse”. The patterns revealed provide an essential context for framing ecological and evolutionary explanations for how major groups originate, and strengthen our confidence in the reliability of the fossil record.},

Yet, because tropical fisheries are often data-poor, mechanisms that might buffer fishers to declines are not understood. This data scarcity undermines fisheries management, making tropical fishing livelihoods particularly vulnerable to changes in marine resources. We use high-resolution fisheries data from Seychelles to understand how fishing strategy (catch diversification) influences catch rates and revenues of individual fishing vessels. We show that average catch weight decreased by 65\% over 27 years, with declines in all nine species groups coinciding with increases in fishing effort. However, for individual vessels, catch diversity was associated with larger catches and higher fishing revenues and with slower catch declines from 1990 to 2016. Management strategies should maximize catch diversity in data-poor tropical fisheries to help secure nutritional security while protecting fishing livelihoods.},

Single-cell transcriptional and surface protein analyses revealed that peripheral MAIT cells from HIV-1–infected subjects were highly activated with the up-regulation of interferon (IFN)–stimulated genes as compared to healthy individuals. Sustained IFN-α treatment suppressed MAIT cell responses to Escherichia coli by triggering high-level interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by monocytes, which subsequently inhibited the secretion of IL-12, a crucial costimulatory cytokine for MAIT cell activation. Blocking IFN-α or IL-10 receptors prevented MAIT cell dysfunction induced by HIV-1 exposure in vitro. Moreover, blocking the IL-10 receptor significantly improved anti– Mycobacterium tuberculosis responses of MAIT cells from HIV-1–infected patients. Our findings demonstrate the central role of the IFN-I/IL-10 axis in MAIT cell dysfunction during HIV-1 infection, which has implications for the development of anti–IFN-I/IL-10 strategies against bacterial coinfections in HIV-1–infected patients.},

The lowest pressure and temperature ( P-T ) conditions that yielded diamond were 12 GPa (at ~2000 K) and 900 K (at ~20 GPa), respectively. This represents a substantially reduced transformation barrier compared with diamond synthesis from conventional (hydro)carbon allotropes, owing to the similarities in the structure and full sp 3 hybridization of diamondoids and bulk diamond. At 20 GPa, diamondoid-to-diamond conversion occurs rapidly within &lt;19 μs. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that once dehydrogenated, the remaining diamondoid carbon cages reconstruct themselves into diamond-like structures at high P-T .

  abstract     = {T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) can recognize and engage with target cancer cells with redirected specificity for cancer immunotherapy. However, there is a lack of ideal CARs for solid tumor antigens, which may lead to severe adverse effects. Here, we developed a light-inducible nuclear translocation and dimerization (LINTAD) system for gene regulation to control CAR T activation. We first demonstrated light-controllable gene expression and functional modulation in human embryonic kidney 293T and Jurkat T cell lines. We then improved the LINTAD system to achieve optimal efficiency in primary human T cells. The results showed that pulsed light stimulations can activate LINTAD CAR T cells with strong cytotoxicity against target cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our LINTAD system can serve as an efficient tool to noninvasively control gene activation and activate inducible CAR T cells for precision cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Human health is affected by indoor air quality. One distinctive aspect of the indoor environment is its very large surface area that acts as a poorly characterized sink and source of gas-phase chemicals. In this work, air-surface interactions of 19 common indoor air contaminants with diverse properties and sources were monitored in a house using fast-response, on-line mass spectrometric and spectroscopic methods. Enhanced-ventilation experiments demonstrate that most of the contaminants reside in the surface reservoirs and not, as expected, in the gas phase. They participate in rapid air-surface partitioning that is much faster than air exchange. Phase distribution calculations are consistent with the observations when assuming simultaneous equilibria between air and large weakly polar and polar absorptive surface reservoirs, with acid-base dissociation in the polar reservoir. Chemical exposure assessments must account for the finding that contaminants that are fully volatile under outdoor air conditions instead behave as semivolatile compounds indoors.},

When their arrival gives rise to successful invasions, outsider species establish within the resident community, which can markedly alter the ecosystem. Seemingly less influential, the potential impact of unsuccessful invaders that interact only transiently with the community has remained largely ignored. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that these transient invasions can induce a lasting transition to an alternative stable state, even when the invader species itself does not survive the transition. First, we develop a mechanistic understanding of how environmental changes caused by these transient invaders can drive a community shift in a simple, bistable model system. Beyond this, we show that transient invaders can also induce switches between stable states in more complex communities isolated from natural soil samples. Our results demonstrate that short-term interactions with an invader species can induce lasting shifts in community composition and function.},

In this analysis, we use a conventional risk-modeling framework to develop and apply a new methodology for assessing the supply risk to the U.S. manufacturing sector. Specifically, supply risk is defined as the confluence of three factors: the likelihood of a foreign supply disruption, the dependency of U.S. manufacturers on foreign supplies, and the ability of U.S. manufacturers to withstand a supply disruption. The methodology is applied to 52 commodities for the decade spanning 2007–2016. The results indicate that a subset of 23 commodities, including cobalt, niobium, rare earth elements, and tungsten, pose the greatest supply risk. This supply risk is dynamic, shifting with changes in global market conditions.},

Previously, we applied CRISPR-Cas9–mediated “single-cut” genome editing to correct diverse genetic mutations in animal models of DMD. However, high doses of adeno-associated virus (AAV) are required for efficient in vivo genome editing, posing challenges for clinical application. In this study, we packaged Cas9 nuclease in single-stranded AAV (ssAAV) and CRISPR single guide RNAs in self-complementary AAV (scAAV) and delivered this dual AAV system into a mouse model of DMD. The dose of scAAV required for efficient genome editing were at least 20-fold lower than with ssAAV. Mice receiving systemic treatment showed restoration of dystrophin expression and improved muscle contractility. These findings show that the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9–mediated genome editing can be substantially improved by using the scAAV system. This represents an important advancement toward therapeutic translation of genome editing for DMD.},

Evolutionary theory predicts that the rate of extrapair paternity (EPP) should vary according to socioecological conditions. In humans, however, geneticists contend that EPP is negligible and relatively invariable. This conclusion is based on a limited set of studies, almost all of which describe European-descent groups. Using a novel, double-blind method designed in collaboration with a community of Himba pastoralists, we find that the rate of EPP in this population is 48\%, with 70\% of couples having at least one EPP child. Both men and women were very accurate at detecting cases of EPP. These data suggest that the range of variation in EPP across human populations is substantially greater than previously thought. We further show that a high rate of EPP can be accompanied by high paternity confidence, which highlights the importance of disaggregating EPP from the notion of “cuckoldry.”},

Molecular dynamics simulations allow estimation of the binding energy of GRP1 PH domain to PIP 3 -containing membranes. The free energy of interaction of the PH domain with more than two PIP 3 molecules is comparable to experimental values, suggesting that PH domain binding involves local clustering of PIP molecules within membranes. We describe a mechanism of PH binding proceeding via an encounter state to two bound states which differ in the orientation of the protein relative to the membrane, these orientations depending on the local PIP concentration. These results suggest that nanoscale clustering of PIP molecules can control the strength and orientation of PH domain interaction in a concentration-dependent manner.},

The Lmna f/f ; TC mice with progerin expression induced by Tie2-Cre exhibit defective microvasculature and neovascularization, accelerated aging, and shortened life span. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of murine lung endothelial cells revealed a substantial up-regulation of inflammatory response. Molecularly, progerin interacts and destabilizes deacylase Sirt7; ectopic expression of Sirt7 alleviates the inflammatory response caused by progerin in endothelial cells. Vascular endothelium–targeted Sirt7 gene therapy, driven by an ICAM2 promoter, improves neovascularization, ameliorates aging features, and extends life span in Lmna f/f ; TC mice.

Here, we introduce a light-inducible switch on PROTACs, thereafter termed as opto-PROTAC, to enable the degradation of protein targets in a spatiotemporal manner. By adding a photolabile caging group on pomalidomide as a parental compound and two additional PROTACs, dBET1 and dALK, we demonstrated light-inducible protein degradation. These opto-PROTACs display no activities in the dark, while the restricted degradation can be induced at a specific time and rate by ultraviolet A irradiation.

We report that the structured DNA binding domain (DBD) of PU.1 regulates gene expression via antagonistic dimeric states that are reciprocally controlled by cognate DNA on the one hand and by its proximal anionic IDR on the other. The two conformers are mediated by distinct regions of the DBD without structured contributions from the tethered IDRs. Unlike DNA-bound complexes, the unbound dimer is markedly destabilized. Dimerization without DNA is promoted by progressive phosphomimetic substitutions of IDR residues that are phosphorylated in immune activation and stimulated by anionic crowding agents. These results suggest a previously unidentified, nonstructural role for charged IDRs in conformational control by mitigating electrostatic penalties that would mask the interactions of highly cationic DBDs.},

Guided by the conviction that DR evolved as an adaptive, pro-longevity physiological response to food scarcity, biomedical science has interpreted DR as an activator of pro-longevity molecular pathways. Current evolutionary theory predicts that organisms invest in their soma during DR, and thus when resource availability improves, should outcompete rich-fed controls in survival and/or reproduction. Testing this prediction in Drosophila melanogaster ( N &gt; 66, 000 across 11 genotypes), our experiments revealed substantial, unexpected mortality costs when flies returned to a rich diet following DR. The physiological effects of DR should therefore not be interpreted as intrinsically pro-longevity, acting via somatic maintenance. We suggest DR could alternatively be considered an escape from costs incurred under nutrient-rich conditions, in addition to costs associated with DR.},

  abstract     = {Whether Arctic amplification has contributed to a wavier circulation and more frequent extreme weather in midlatitudes remains an open question. For two to three decades starting from the mid-1980s, accelerated Arctic warming and a reduced meridional near-surface temperature gradient coincided with a wavier circulation. However, waviness remains largely unchanged in model simulations featuring strong Arctic amplification. Here, we show that the previously reported trend toward a wavier circulation during autumn and winter has reversed in recent years, despite continued Arctic amplification, resulting in negligible multidecadal trends. Models capture the observed correspondence between a reduced temperature gradient and increased waviness on interannual to decadal time scales. However, model experiments in which a reduced temperature gradient is imposed do not feature increased wave amplitude. Our results strongly suggest that the observed and simulated covariability between waviness and temperature gradients on interannual to decadal time scales does not represent a forced response to Arctic amplification.},

  abstract     = {Optical wavefront shaping is a powerful tool for controlling photons in strongly scattering media. Its speed, however, has been the bottleneck for in vivo applications. Moreover, unlike spatial focusing, temporal focusing from a continuous-wave source has rarely been exploited yet is highly desired for nonlinear photonics. Here, we present a novel real-time frequency-encoded spatiotemporal (FEST) focusing technology. FEST focusing uses a novel programmable two-dimensional optical frequency comb with an ultrafine linewidth to perform single-shot wavefront measurements, with a fast single-pixel detector. This technique enables simultaneous spatial and temporal focusing at microsecond scales through thick dynamic scattering media. This technology also enabled us to discover the large-scale temporal shift, a new phenomenon that, with the conventional spatial memory effect, establishes a space-time duality. FEST focusing opens a new avenue for high-speed wavefront shaping in the field of photonics.},

A method to engineer sets of cellulose-based materials with similar compositions, yet distinct mechanical and rheological properties, was established. In parallel, a digital workflow was developed to embed gradient information into design models with integrated fabrication path planning. The payoff of integrating these physical and digital tools is the ability to achieve the same stiffness gradient in multiple ways, opening design possibilities previously limited by the rigid coupling of material and geometry.},

Here, we report that activation of the IRE1α kinase pathway can rescue the cell surface expression of ΔF508-CFTR and p.H723R-pendrin through a Golgi-independent unconventional protein secretion (UPS) route. In mammalian cells, inhibition of IRE1α kinase, but not inhibition of IRE1α endonuclease and the downstream effector XBP1, inhibited CFTR UPS. Treatment with the IRE1α kinase activator, (E)-2-(2-chlorostyryl)-3, 5, 6-trimethyl-pyrazine (CSTMP), rescued cell surface expression and functional activity of ΔF508-CFTR and p.H723R-pendrin. Treatment with a nontoxic dose of CSTMP to ΔF508-CFTR mice restored CFTR surface expression and CFTR-mediated anion transport in the mouse colon. These findings suggest that UPS activation via IRE1α kinase is a strategy to treat diseases caused by defective cell surface trafficking of membrane proteins, including ΔF508-CFTR and p.H723R-pendrin.},

Assimilated meteorological data are used here to assess future offshore wind potential for China. Analysis on a provincial basis indicates that the aggregate potential wind resource is 5.4 times larger than the current coastal demand for power. Recent experiences with markets in both Europe and the United States suggest that potential offshore resources in China could be exploited to cost-competitively provide 1148.3 TWh of energy in a high-cost scenario, 6383.4 TWh in a low-cost option, equivalent to between 36 and 200\% of the total coastal energy demand after 2020. The analysis underscores notable benefits for offshore wind for China, with prospects for major reductions in greenhouse emissions with ancillary benefits for air quality.},

The remarkable existence of self-assembled quantum well (QW) structures in solution-processed 2D perovskites offers a diverse range of optoelectronic properties, which remain largely unexplored. Here, we experimentally observe ultrafast relaxation of free carriers in 20 ps due to the quantum confinement of free carriers in a self-assembled QW structures that form excitons. Furthermore, hybridizing the 2D perovskites with metamaterials on a rigid and a flexible substrate enables modulation of terahertz fields at 50-GHz modulating speed, which is the fastest for a solution-processed semiconductor-based photonic device. Hence, an exciton-based ultrafast response of 2D perovskites opens up large avenues for a wide range of scalable dynamic photonic devices with potential applications in flexible photonics, ultrafast wavefront control, and short-range wireless terahertz communications.},

The effect is known as electromagnetically induced transparency in atomic media and optomechanically induced transparency in systems that consist of coupled optical and mechanical resonators. In this work, we introduce the concept of photothermally induced transparency (PTIT). It happens when an optical resonator exhibits nonlinear behavior due to optical heating of the resonator or its mirrors. Similar to the established mechanisms for induced transparency, PTIT can suppress the coupling between an optical resonator and a traveling optical field. We further show that the dispersion of the resonator can be modified to exhibit slow or fast light. Because of the relatively slow thermal response, we observe the bandwidth of the PTIT to be 2π × 15.9 Hz, which theoretically suggests a group velocity of as low as 5 m/s.},

When using nanoporous membranes as leaves, the maximum osmotic pressures of saline feeds (10 to 30 bar) allowing pure water uptake precisely correspond to expected capillary pressures based on the Young-Laplace equation. Hydrogel-based leaves allow for stable operation and desalination of hypersaline solutions with osmotic pressures approaching 400 bar, fivefold greater than the pressure limits of conventional reverse osmosis. Our findings support the applicability of the cohesion-tension theory to desalination in mangroves, provide a new platform to study plant hydraulics, and create possibilities for engineered membrane separations using large, passively generated capillary pressures.},

We measured phenotypic plasticity of the carbon fixation rates of the common bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis . Our results revealed a 1.8- to 5-fold increase in the maximum CO 2 uptake rate of Microcystis at elevated p CO 2 , which exceeds CO 2 responses reported for other phytoplankton species. The observed plasticity was incorporated into a mathematical model to predict dynamic changes in cyanobacterial abundance. The model was successfully validated by laboratory experiments and predicts that acclimation to high p CO 2 will intensify Microcystis blooms in eutrophic lakes.

We confirmed in vitro that knockdown of IKZF1 decreases the expression of fucosyltransferase FUT8, resulting in increased levels of fucosylated glycans, and suggest that RUNX1 and RUNX3, together with SMARCB1, regulate expression of glycosyltransferase MGAT3. We also show that variants affecting the expression of genes involved in the regulation of glycoenzymes colocalize with variants affecting risk for inflammatory diseases.

We found that MSN significantly stimulated breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, requiring the phosphorylation of MSN and a nucleoprotein NONO-assisted nuclear localization of phosphorylated MSN with protein kinase C (PKC) and then the phosphorylation activation of CREB signaling by PKC. Our study also demonstrated that targeting MSN, NONO, or CREB significantly inhibited breast tumor growth in vivo.

However, it remains poorly understood whether and how the 3D genome architecture is dynamically restructured by external signals. Here, we report that LATS kinases phosphorylated CTCF in the zinc finger (ZF) linkers and disabled its DNA-binding activity. Cellular stress induced LATS nuclear translocation and CTCF ZF linker phosphorylation, and altered the landscape of CTCF genomic binding partly by dissociating it selectively from a small subset of its genomic binding sites. These sites were highly enriched for the boundaries of chromatin domains containing LATS signaling target genes. The stress-induced CTCF phosphorylation and locus-specific dissociation from DNA were LATS-dependent. Loss of CTCF binding disrupted local chromatin domains and down-regulated genes located within them. The study suggests that external signals may rapidly modulate the 3D genome by affecting CTCF genomic binding through ZF linker phosphorylation.},

  abstract     = {Weyl points are zero-dimensional band degeneracy in three-dimensional momentum space that has nonzero topological charges. The presence of the topological charges protects the degeneracy points against perturbations and enables a variety of fascinating phenomena. It is so far unclear whether such charged objects can occur in higher dimensions. Here, we introduce the concept of charged nodal surface, a two-dimensional band degeneracy surface in momentum space that is topologically charged. We provide an effective Hamiltonian for this charged nodal surface and show that such a Hamiltonian can be implemented in a tight-binding model. This is followed by an experimental realization in a phononic crystal. The measured topologically protected surface arc state of such an acoustic semimetal reproduces excellently the full-wave simulations. Creating high-dimensional charged geometric objects in momentum space promises a broad range of unexplored topological physics.},

Unfortunately, their claim that the water intensity of energy production using hydraulic fracturing has increased in all regions is incorrect. More comprehensive data show that, while the water intensity of production may have increased in regions such as the Permian basin, it has decreased by 74\% in the Marcellus and by 19\% in the Eagle Ford region. This error likely stems from an improper method for estimating energy production from wells: The authors use the median well to represent regional production, which systematically underestimates aggregate production volumes. Across all regions, aggregate data suggest that the water intensity of oil and natural gas production using hydraulic fracturing has increased by 19\%. There also appears to be an error in estimates for water consumption in the Permian basin.},

Although strong cohesion between MTTs is critical to resist forces applied by ciliary beating and the mitotic spindle, how the centriole maintains its structural integrity is not known. Using cryo–electron tomography and subtomogram averaging of centrioles from four evolutionarily distant species, we found that MTTs are bound together by a helical inner scaffold covering ~70\% of the centriole length that maintains MTTs cohesion under compressive forces. Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM) indicated that POC5, POC1B, FAM161A, and Centrin-2 localize to the scaffold structure along the inner wall of the centriole MTTs. Moreover, we established that these four proteins interact with each other to form a complex that binds microtubules.

In some receptors, the ligand binding domain is composed of multiple repeated sequences. The insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) contains 15 β strand–rich repeat domains. The overall structure and the mechanism by which IGF2R binds IGF2 and releases it are unknown. We used cryo-EM to determine the structures of the IGF2R at pH 7.4 with IGF2 bound and at pH 4.5 in the ligand-dissociated state. The results reveal different arrangements of the receptor in different pH environments mediated by changes in the interactions between the repeated sequences.

The co-inheritance of mutations causing fetal γ-globin production in adult life hereditary persistence of fetal Hb (HPFH) reduces the clinical severity of SCD. HPFH mutations in the HBG γ-globin promoters disrupt binding sites for the repressors BCL11A and LRF. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to mimic HPFH mutations in the HBG promoters by generating insertions and deletions, leading to disruption of known and putative repressor binding sites. Editing of the LRF-binding site in patient-derived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) resulted in γ-globin derepression and correction of the sickling phenotype. Xenotransplantation of HSPCs treated with gRNAs targeting the LRF-binding site showed a high editing efficiency in repopulating HSPCs.

Here we study stripe-ordered La-214, i.e., cuprates in which charge orders are most pronounced and zero-field SC transition temperatures T c 0 are lowest. This enables us to explore the vortex phases in a previously inaccessible energy scale window. By combining linear and nonlinear transport techniques sensitive to vortex matter, we determine the T − H phase diagram, directly detect H c2 , and reveal novel properties of the high-field ground state. Our results demonstrate that quantum fluctuations and disorder play a key role as T → 0 , while the high-field ground state is likely a metal, not an insulator, due to the presence of stripes.},

We have found that the records close to the monsoon moisture source show large glacial-interglacial variability, which then decreases landward. These changes likely reflect a stronger oxygen isotope fractionation associated with progressive rainout of AM moisture during glacial periods, possibly due to a larger temperature gradient and suppressed plant transpiration.

Here, it is demonstrated that a thiophene-based semicrystalline polymer exhibits a clear maximum of P through wide-range carrier doping by the electrolyte gating technique. The maximum value appears around the macroscopic insulator-to-metal transition upon doping, which is firmly confirmed by the temperature dependence of σ and magnetoresistance measurements. The effect of disorder on charge transport is suppressed in the metallic state, resulting in the conventional S -σ relation described by the Mott equation.

Until now, there is no proof by neutron diffraction techniques owing to its very small ordered Cu magnetic moment. Here, we demonstrate the potential of spherical neutron polarimetry, first, in detecting magnetic structure changes, which are not or weakly manifest in the peak intensity and, second, in deducing the spin arrangement of the so far hypothetic AF3 phase.

Previous photoconduction demonstrations show that a vertical electric field can effectively reduce the bandgap of thin-film BP, expanding the device operational wavelength range in mid-infrared. Here, we report the widely tunable mid-infrared light emission from a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/BP/hBN heterostructure device. With a moderate displacement field up to 0.48 V/nm, the photoluminescence (PL) peak from a ~20-layer BP flake is continuously tuned from 3.7 to 7.7 μm, spanning 4 μm in mid-infrared. The PL emission remains perfectly linear-polarized along the armchair direction regardless of the bias field. Moreover, together with theoretical analysis, we show that the radiative decay probably dominates over other nonradiative decay channels in the PL experiments.

Here, a facile approach involving anisotropic etching with an aqueous solution of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) was developed for preparing uniform high–aspect ratio hierarchical MFI nanosheets. In addition, the mechanism associated with the formation of MFI nanosheets was proposed. In the next step, a dynamic air-liquid interface–assisted self-assembly method and single-mode microwave heating were used for b -oriented MFI nanosheets monolayer deposition and controlled in-plane solution-based epitaxial growth, respectively, ensuring the formation of well-intergrown b -oriented MFI layers with sub–100-nm thickness. Moreover, our study indicated that b -oriented ultrathin MFI layers could be fabricated on diverse substrates demonstrating excellent anticorrosion capacity, ionic sieving properties, and n -/ i -butane isomer separation performance.},

Structure-based liquid operations have been widely used both in nature and in artificial materials. However, current strategies depend mainly on fixed structures to realize unidirectional water movement, while multiple manipulation of droplets is still challenging. Here, we propose a magnetic-actuated robot with adjustable structures to achieve programmable multiple manipulations of droplets. The adjustable structure redistributes the resisting forces from the front and rear ends of the droplets, which determine the droplet behaviors. We can transport, split, release, and rotate the droplets using the robot. This robot is universally applicable for manipulation of various fluids in rough environments. These findings offer an efficient strategy for automated manipulation of droplets.},

However, their charge transport properties are inferior to materials like graphene. On the other hand, the charge generation efficiency of graphene is too low to be used in many optoelectronic applications. Here, we demonstrate the development of ultrathin phototransistors and photonic synapses using a graphene-PQD (G-PQD) superstructure prepared by growing PQDs directly from a graphene lattice. We show that the G-PQDs superstructure synchronizes efficient charge generation and transport on a single platform. G-PQD phototransistors exhibit excellent responsivity of 1.4 × 10 8 AW –1 and specific detectivity of 4.72 × 10 15 Jones at 430 nm. Moreover, the light-assisted memory effect of these superstructures enables photonic synaptic behavior, where neuromorphic computing is demonstrated by facial recognition with the assistance of machine learning. We anticipate that the G-PQD superstructures will bolster new directions in the development of highly efficient optoelectronic devices.},

A simple yet universal solution is very challenging. Here, we manage to address this challenge utilizing a simple shape memory polymer (SMP) block. The embedding of objects into the SMP enables the gripping while the shape recovery upon stimulation facilitates the releasing. Systematic studies show that friction, suction, and interlocking effects dominate the grip force individually or collectively. This universal SMP gripper design provides a versatile solution to grip and manipulate multiscaled (from centimeter scale down to 10-μm scale) 3D objects with arbitrary shapes, in individual, deterministic, or massive, selective ways. These extraordinary capabilities are demonstrated by the gripping and manipulation of macroscaled objects, mesoscaled steel sphere arrays and microparticles, and the selective and patterned transfer printing of micro light-emitting diodes.},

Here, we analyze the spontaneous mutations accumulated in a neutral manner over thousands of generations by Mycobacterium smegmatis and its MMR-deficient derivative (Δ nucS ). The base pair substitution rates per genome per generation are 0.004 and 0.165 for wild type and Δ nucS , respectively. By comparing the activity of different bacterial MMR pathways, we demonstrate that both MutS/L- and NucS-based systems display similar specificity and mutagenesis bias, revealing a functional evolutionary convergence. However, NucS is not able to repair indels in vivo.

This distinctive phenomenon is used to develop a strategy to synthesize Cu species–intercalated layered TMD compounds. A series of Cu-intercalated 2H-NbS 2 compounds were obtained with homogeneous distribution of Cu intercalates in the form of monovalent Cu (I), occupying the tetrahedral sites coordinated by S atoms within the interlayer space of NbS 2 . The Fermi level of NbS 2 shifts up because of the intercalation of Cu, resulting in the improvement of electrical conductivity in the z -direction. On the other hand, intercalation of Cu into vdW gaps of NbS 2 systematically suppresses the superconducting transition temperature ( T c ) and superconducting volume fraction.},

Here, we developed multiscale and structured silicon (Si) materials as nongenetic optical transducers capable of modulating the activities of both single bacterial cells and biofilms at high spatiotemporal resolution. Upon optical stimulation, we capture a previously unidentified form of rapid, photothermal gradient–dependent, intercellular calcium signaling within the biofilm. We also found an unexpected coupling between calcium dynamics and biofilm mechanics, which could be of importance for biofilm resistance.

The composition of cells selected from BMA was distinct on each scaffold. Naïve constructs exhibited robust proangiogenic potential in vitro, while preconditioned scaffolds contained more mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) and exhibited an osteogenic phenotype. Upon implantation into an orthotopic calvarial defect, BMA-derived ECs were present in vessels in preconditioned implants, resulting in robust perfusion and greater vessel density over the first 14 days compared to naïve implants. After 10 weeks, human ECs and differentiated MSCs were detected in de novo tissues derived from naïve and preconditioned scaffolds. These results demonstrate that bioreactor-based preconditioning augments the bone-forming potential of BMA.},

Using a genetic knock-in mouse model (FAAH C/A ) that biologically recapitulates the human polymorphism associated with problematic drug use, we find that in adolescent female mice, but not male mice, this FAAH polymorphism enhances the mesolimbic dopamine circuitry projecting from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and alters cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB 1 R) levels at inhibitory and excitatory terminals in the VTA. These developmental changes collectively increase vulnerability of adolescent female FAAH C/A mice to THC preference that persists into adulthood. Together, these findings suggest that this endocannabinoid genetic variant is a contributing factor for increased susceptibility to cannabis dependence in adolescent females.},

In a single SW event, multiple sequences appeared discretely in dendritic trees, but overall, sequences occurred preferentially in some dendritic branches.

  abstract     = {Brain lateralization is commonly interpreted as crucial for human brain function and cognition. However, as comparative studies among primates are rare, it is not known which aspects of lateralization are really uniquely human. Here, we quantify both pattern and magnitude of brain shape asymmetry based on endocranial imprints of the braincase in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Like previous studies, we found that humans were more asymmetric than chimpanzees, however so were gorillas and orangutans, highlighting the need to broaden the comparative framework for interpretation. We found that the average spatial asymmetry pattern, previously considered to be uniquely human, was shared among humans and apes. In humans, however, it was less directed, and different local asymmetries were less correlated. We, thus, found human asymmetry to be much more variable compared with that of apes. These findings likely reflect increased functional and developmental modularization of the human brain.},

  abstract     = {Studying the origin of avian thermoregulation is complicated by a lack of reliable methods for measuring body temperatures in extinct dinosaurs. Evidence from bone histology and stable isotopes often relies on uncertain assumptions about the relationship between growth rate and body temperature, or the isotopic composition (δ 18 O) of body water. Clumped isotope (Δ 47 ) paleothermometry, based on binding of 13 C to 18 O, provides a more robust tool, but has yet to be applied across a broad phylogenetic range of dinosaurs while accounting for paleoenvironmental conditions. Applying this method to well-preserved fossil eggshells demonstrates that the three major clades of dinosaurs, Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, and Theropoda, were characterized by warm body temperatures. Dwarf titanosaurs may have exhibited similar body temperatures to larger sauropods, although this conclusion is provisional, given current uncertainties in taxonomic assignment of dwarf titanosaur eggshell. Our results nevertheless reveal that metabolically controlled thermoregulation was the ancestral condition for Dinosauria.},

Equally important to trends in the mean climate are changes in interannual variability, but changes in precipitation fluctuations are highly uncertain and the associated processes are unknown. Here, we use various state-of-the-art global climate model simulations to show that interannual variability of Arctic precipitation will likely increase markedly (up to 40\% over the 21st century), especially in summer. This can be attributed to increased poleward atmospheric moisture transport variability associated with enhanced moisture content, possibly modulated by atmospheric dynamics. Because both the means and variability of Arctic precipitation will increase, years/seasons with excessive precipitation will occur more often, as will the associated impacts.},

Although a promising treatment for late-onset OTC deficiency, adeno-associated virus (AAV) neonatal gene therapy would only provide short-term therapeutic effects as the non-integrated genome gets lost during hepatocyte proliferation. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair can correct a G-to-A mutation in 10\% of OTC alleles in the livers of newborn OTC spf ash mice. However, an editing vector able to correct one mutation would not be applicable for patients carrying different OTC mutations, plus expression would not be fast enough to treat a hyperammonemia crisis. Here, we describe a dual-AAV vector system that accomplishes rapid short-term expression from a non-integrated minigene and long-term expression from the site-specific integration of this minigene without any selective growth advantage for OTC-positive cells in newborns. This CRISPR-Cas9 gene-targeting approach may be applicable to all patients with OTC deficiency, irrespective of mutation and/or clinical state.},

Our analyses of site frequency spectra indicate that these populations derive 2 to 19\% of their genetic ancestry from an archaic population that diverged before the split of Neanderthals and modern humans. Using a method that can identify segments of archaic ancestry without the need for reference archaic genomes, we built genome-wide maps of archaic ancestry in the Yoruba and the Mende populations. Analyses of these maps reveal segments of archaic ancestry at high frequency in these populations that represent potential targets of adaptive introgression.

Here, we use seasonally resolved stalagmite rainfall proxy data from the modern northern limit of the ITCZ in southern Belize, combined with records from across the Neotropics and subtropics, to fingerprint ITCZ variability during the Common Era. Our data are consistent with models that suggest ITCZ expansion and weakening during globally cold climate intervals and contraction and intensification during global warmth. As a result, regions currently in the margins of the ITCZ in both hemispheres are likely transitioning to more arid and highly variable conditions, aggravating current trends of increased social unrest and mass migration.},

We demonstrate the amplification of a two-octave spectrum to 25 μJ of energy in two broadband amplification channels and their temporal compression to 6 and 18 fs at 1 and 2 μm, respectively. In this scheme, due to the intrinsic temporal synchronization between the pump and seed pulses, the temporal jitter is restricted to long-term drift. We show that the intrinsic stability of the synthesizer allows subcycle detection of an electric field at 0.15 PHz. The complex electric field of the 0.15-PHz pulses and their free induction decay after interaction with water molecules are resolved by electro-optic sampling over 2 ps.

Here, we investigate the nonradiative recombination processes due to native point defects in methylammonium lead halide (MAPbI 3 ) perovskites using ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics within surface-hopping framework. Regardless of whether the defects introduce a shallow or deep band state, we find that charge recombination in MAPbI 3 is not enhanced, contrary to predictions from SRH theory. We demonstrate that this strong tolerance against defects, and hence the breakdown of SRH, arises because the photogenerated carriers are only coupled with low-frequency phonons and electron and hole states overlap weakly. Both factors appreciably decrease the nonadiabatic coupling. We argue that the soft nature of the inorganic lattice with small bulk modulus is key for defect tolerance, and hence, the findings are general to other MHPs.},

Here, we show that transgenic overexpression or pharmacological activation of ML1 in vivo facilitates sarcolemma repair and alleviates the dystrophic phenotypes in both skeletal and cardiac muscles of mdx mice (a mouse model of DMD). Hallmark dystrophic features of DMD, including myofiber necrosis, central nucleation, fibrosis, elevated serum creatine kinase levels, reduced muscle force, impaired motor ability, and dilated cardiomyopathies, were all ameliorated by increasing ML1 activity. ML1-dependent activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) corrects lysosomal insufficiency to diminish muscle damage.

  abstract     = {A nearly free electron metal and a Mott insulating state can be thought of as opposite ends of the spectrum of possibilities for the motion of electrons in a solid. Understanding their interaction lies at the heart of the correlated electron problem. In the magnetic oxide metal PdCrO 2 , nearly free and Mott-localized electrons exist in alternating layers, forming natural heterostructures. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, quantitatively supported by a strong coupling analysis, we show that the coupling between these layers leads to an “intertwined” excitation that is a convolution of the charge spectrum of the metallic layer and the spin susceptibility of the Mott layer. Our findings establish PdCrO 2 as a model system in which to probe Kondo lattice physics and also open new routes to use the a priori nonmagnetic probe of photoemission to gain insights into the spin susceptibility of correlated electron materials.},

  abstract     = {Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) can improve the diffusivity of nanoparticles (NPs) in biological hydrogels, while extended PEG chains severely impede cellular uptake of NPs. Inspired by invasive germs with flagellum-driven mucus-penetrating and fimbriae-mediated epithelium-adhering abilities, we developed germ-mimetic NPs (GMNPs) to overcome multiple barriers in mucosal and tumor tissues. In vitro studies and computational simulations revealed that the tip-specific extended PEG chains on GMNP functioned similarly to flagella, facilitating GMNP diffusion (up to 83.0-fold faster than their counterparts). Meanwhile, the packed PEG chains on the bodies of GMNP mediated strong adhesive interactions with cells similarly to the fimbriae, preserving cellular uptake efficiency. The in vivo results proved the superior tumor permeability and improved oral bioavailability provided by the GMNP (21.9-fold over administration of crystalline drugs). These findings offer useful guidelines for the rational design of NPs by manipulating surface polymer conformation to realize multiple functions and to enhance delivery efficacy.},

Here, we evaluated the potential for hu1B7 and an extended half-life hu1B7 variant to prevent death, leukocytosis and other clinical symptoms in a newborn baboon model that mimics many aspects of human disease. We administered a single antibody dose to newborn baboons five weeks prior to experimental infection. While all animals were heavily colonized with Bordetella pertussis , prophylaxed animals showed significantly greater survival ( P &lt; 0.005), delayed and suppressed leukocytosis ( P &lt; 0.01) and enhanced clinical outcomes, including coughing ( P &lt; 0.01), as compared to controls.

Despite the central importance of ROC, the diversity and complexity of this class of species has been a longstanding obstacle to developing a comprehensive understanding of how the composition of our atmosphere, and the associated environmental implications, will evolve.

After putting dimethylacetamide-wetted textiles, including TiO 2 , SnO 2 , BaTiO 3 , and Li 0.33 La 0.56 TiO 3 , on lithium plates, the self-driven chemical reactions induce defects in oxides. These defects initiate an interfacial insulation-to-conductive phase transition, which triggers the domino-cascade reduction from the interface to the whole textile. Correspondingly, the conductivity of the textile sharply increased from 0 to 40 S/m over a period of 1 min. The modified oxide textiles exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance when substituting the metallic current collectors of lithium batteries. This room temperature reduction method can protect the nanostructures while inducing defects in oxide ceramic textiles, appealing for numerous applications.},

We have determined multiple structures of the yersiniabactin importer YbtPQ from uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) at inward-open conformation in both apo and substrate-bound states by cryo–electron microscopy. YbtPQ does not adopt any known fold of ABC importers but surprisingly adopts the fold of type IV ABC exporters. To our knowledge, it is the first time an exporter fold of ABC importer has been reported. We have also observed two unique features in YbtPQ: unwinding of a transmembrane helix in YbtP upon substrate release and tightly associated nucleotide-binding domains without bound nucleotides. Together, our study suggests that siderophore ABC importers have a distinct transport mechanism and should be classified as a separate subfamily of ABC importers.},

Nanoscale analogs of such materials are thus required for this key area. Here, we describe a microfluidics/nanofluidics-based strategy for generating monodisperse nanosized water-in-oil emulsions with controllable sizes ranging from 2500 ± 110 nm down to 51 ± 6 nm. We demonstrate that these nanoemulsions can act as templates to form protein nanogels stabilized by supramolecular fibrils from three different proteins. We further show that these nanoparticles have the ability to penetrate mammalian cell membranes and deliver intracellular cargo.

A dual pH-sensitive nanocarrier loading curcumin (CUR) and anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody (aPD-1) may bind to circulating PD-1 + T cells and then follow their infiltration into the tumor. Furthermore, the nanodrug bound to PD-1 + T cells may be released in the tumor microenvironment, leaving aPD-1 to block PD-1 on T cells and generating a CUR-encapsulated cationic nanodrug that can be easily taken up by tumor cells/tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Thus, not only the antitumor T cells mediate efficient CUR delivery to tumor but also the efficient CUR delivery promotes the tumor infiltration of antitumor T cells, thereby resulting in effective activation of antitumor immunity.},

Some cyanobacteria overcome this challenge by expressing paralogous photosynthetic proteins and by synthesizing and incorporating ~8\% chlorophyll f into their Photosystem I (PSI) complexes, enabling them to grow under far-red light (FRL). We solved the structure of FRL-acclimated PSI from the cyanobacterium Fischerella thermalis PCC 7521 by single-particle, cryo–electron microscopy to understand its structural and functional differences. Four binding sites occupied by chlorophyll f are proposed. Subtle structural changes enable FRL-adapted PSI to extend light utilization for oxygenic photosynthesis to nearly 800 nm. This structure provides a platform for understanding FRL-driven photosynthesis and illustrates the robustness of adaptive and acclimation mechanisms in nature.},

By exploiting the highly oriented crystal structure, we use energy-momentum spectroscopies to demonstrate that an exciton-like sideband in 2D HOIPs exhibits a multipolar radiation pattern with highly directed emission. Electromagnetic and quantum-mechanical analyses indicate that this emission originates from an out-of-plane magnetic dipole transition arising from the 2D character of electronic states. Symmetry arguments and temperature-dependent measurements suggest a dynamic symmetry-breaking mechanism that is active over a broad temperature range. These results challenge the paradigm of electric dipole–dominated light-matter interactions in optoelectronic materials, provide new perspectives on the origins of unexpected sideband emission in HOIPs, and tease the possibility of metamaterial-like scattering phenomena at the quantum-mechanical level.},

  abstract     = {The Kimberley region in Western Australia hosts one of the world’s most substantial bodies of indigenous rock art thought to extend in a series of stylistic or iconographic phases from the present day back into the Pleistocene. As with other rock art worldwide, the older styles have proven notoriously difficult to date quantitatively, requiring new scientific approaches. Here, we present the radiocarbon ages of 24 mud wasp nests that were either over or under pigment from 21 anthropomorphic motifs of the Gwion style (previously referred to as “Bradshaws”) from the middle of the relative stylistic sequence. We demonstrate that while one date suggests a minimum age of c. 17 ka for one motif, most of the dates support a hypothesis that these Gwion paintings were produced in a relatively narrow period around 12, 000 years ago.},

Insects can produce more force by increasing stroke amplitude and/or flapping frequency, but the kinematic response of a given species is thought to be consistent. We examined bumblebees ( Bombus impatiens ) carrying both light and heavy loads and found that stroke amplitude increased in proportion to load size, but did not predict metabolic rate. Rather, metabolic rate was strongly tied to frequency, which was determined not by load size but by the bee’s average loading state and loading history, with heavily loaded bees displaying smaller changes in frequency and smaller increases in metabolic rate to support additional loading. This implies that bees can increase force production through alternative mechanisms; yet, they often choose the energetically costly option of elevating frequency, suggesting associated performance benefits that merit further investigation.},

According to previous reports, the activation of homologous recombination during specific cell phases depends on the kinase activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). However, the precise regulatory mechanism and target substrates of CDK1 for this regulation have not been completely determined. Here, we report that the budding yeast CDK1, Cdc28, phosphorylates the major homologous recombination regulators Rad51 and Rad52. This phosphorylation occurs in the G 2 /M phase by Cdc28 in combination with G 2 /M phase cyclins. Nonphosphorylatable mutations in Rad51 and Rad52 impair the DNA binding affinity of Rad51 and the affinity between Rad52 rings that leads to their interaction. Collectively, our data provide detailed insights into the regulatory mechanism of cell cycle–dependent homologous recombination activation in eukaryotic cells.},

With our current technology, we achieve a rejection of background and stray light of up to 5.8 and also report an image contrast improvement up to a factor of 11, which is resilient to both environmental noise and transmission losses. The quantum illumination protocol differs from usual quantum schemes in that the advantage is maintained even in the presence of noise and loss.

The displacement of chloride ions at five different locations in the model reflected the detailed anion-conduction pathway, and the activity-related key residues—Cys 105 , Ser 60 , Gln 224 , and Phe 90 —were identified by mutation assays and spectroscopy. Comparisons with other proteins, including a closely related outward sodium ion pump, revealed key motifs and provided structural insights into light-driven ion transport across membranes by the NQ subfamily of rhodopsins.

The half-skyrmion carries a topological charge of 0.5 due to the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which leads to the half-skyrmion Hall effect. The Hall angle of half-skyrmions is independent of current density and can be reduced to as small as 4° by tuning the thickness of the Co layer. The Hall angle is so small that the elongation path of half-skyrmion approximately delineates the invisible current flow as demonstrated in both a continuous film and a curved track.

Despite the explanatory success of those models, it is now thought that a better understanding needs to incorporate the perception of the individual, i.e., how internal and external information are acquired and processed. In particular, vision has appeared to be a central feature to gather external information and influence the collective organization of the group. Here, we show that a vision-based model of collective behavior is sufficient to generate organized collective behavior in the absence of spatial representation and collision. Our work suggests a different approach for the development of purely vision-based autonomous swarm robotic systems and formulates a mathematical framework for exploration of perception-based interactions and how they differ from physical ones.},

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) plays a central role in the sterile inflammatory response that results from AMI. Thus, IL-1β blockage is a promising strategy for treatment of AMI. However, conventional IL-1β blockers lack targeting specificity. This increases the risk of serious side effects. To address this problem herein, we fabricated platelet microparticles (PMs) armed with anti–IL-1β antibodies to neutralize IL-1β after AMI and to prevent adverse cardiac remodeling. Our results indicate that the infarct-targeting PMs could bind to the injured heart, increasing the number of anti–IL-1β antibodies therein. The anti–IL-1β platelet PMs (IL1-PMs) protect the cardiomyocytes from apoptosis by neutralizing IL-1β and decreasing IL-1β–driven caspase-3 activity. Our findings indicate that IL1-PM is a promising cardiac detoxification agent that removes cytotoxic IL-1β during AMI and induces therapeutic cardiac repair.},

RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated increases of endoderm-specific gene expression in hPSCs cultured on soft substrate (Young’s modulus, 3 ± 0.45 kPa) in comparison with hard substrate (Young’s modulus, 165 ± 6.39 kPa). Further analyses revealed that multiple long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were up-regulated on soft substrate; among them, LINC00458 was identified as a stiffness-dependent lncRNA specifically required for hPSC differentiation toward an early endodermal lineage. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments confirmed that LINC00458 is functionally required for hPSC endodermal lineage specification induced by soft substrates.

Applying a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments, we first determined how CRISPR-Cas9 activity profiles relate to Cas9 specificity. We then used artificially weakened anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins either coexpressed with or directly fused to Cas9 to fine-tune its activity toward selected levels, thereby achieving an effective kinetic insulation of ON- and OFF-target editing events. We demonstrate highly specific genome editing in mammalian cells using diverse single-guide RNAs prone to potent OFF-targeting. Last, we show that our strategy is compatible with different modes of delivery, including transient transfection and adeno-associated viral vectors. Together, we provide a highly versatile approach to reduce CRISPR-Cas OFF-target effects via kinetic insulation.},

When NS2A-mediated RNAi suppression was disabled, the resulting mutant DENV2 induced Dicer-dependent production of abundant DENV2-derived siRNAs in differentiated mammalian cells. VSR-disabled DENV2 showed severe replication defects in mosquito and mammalian cells and in mice that were rescued by RNAi deficiency. Moreover, NS2As of multiple flaviviruses act as VSRs in vitro and during viral infection in both organisms.

The increasing trend in kinetic energy is particularly prominent in the global tropical oceans, reaching depths of thousands of meters. The deep-reaching acceleration of the ocean circulation is mainly induced by a planetary intensification of surface winds since the early 1990s. Although possibly influenced by wind changes associated with the onset of a negative Pacific decadal oscillation since the late 1990s, the recent acceleration is far larger than that associated with natural variability, suggesting that it is principally part of a long-term trend.},

  abstract     = {Nerve density is associated with prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness and prognosis. Thus far, no visualization methods have been developed to assess nerve density of PCa in vivo. We compounded propranolol-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nerve peptide nanoparticles (PSN NPs), which achieved the nerve density visualization of PCa with high sensitivity and high specificity, and facilitated assessment of nerve density and aggressiveness of PCa using magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic particle imaging. Moreover, PSN NPs facilitated targeted therapy for PCa. PSN NPs increased the survival rate of mice with orthotopic PCa to 83.3\% and decreased nerve densities and proliferation indexes by more than twofold compared with the control groups. The present study, thus, developed a technology to visualize the nerve density of PCa and facilitate targeted neural drug delivery to tumors to efficiently inhibit PCa progression. Our study provides a potential basis for clinical imaging and therapeutic interventions targeting nerves in PCa.},

However, the devices needed for long-distance links are different from those envisioned for local processing. We present the first hybrid quantum memory-enabled network by demonstrating the interconnection and simultaneous operation of two types of quantum memory: an atomic ensemble-based memory and an all-optical Loop memory. Interfacing the quantum memories at room temperature, we observe a well-preserved quantum correlation and a violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Furthermore, we demonstrate the creation and storage of a fully-operable heralded photon chain state that can achieve memory-built-in combining, swapping, splitting, tuning, and chopping single photons in a chain temporally. Such a quantum network allows atomic excitations to be generated, stored, and converted to broadband photons, which are then transferred to the next node, stored, and faithfully retrieved, all at high speed and in a programmable fashion.},

  abstract     = {The classic picture of flagellum biosynthesis in Escherichia coli , inferred from population measurements, depicts a deterministic program where promoters are sequentially up-regulated and are maintained steadily active throughout exponential growth. However, complex regulatory dynamics at the single-cell level can be masked by bulk measurements. Here, we discover that in individual E. coli cells, flagellar promoters are stochastically activated in pulses. These pulses are coordinated within specific classes of promoters and comprise “on” and “off” states, each of which can span multiple generations. We demonstrate that in this pulsing program, the regulatory logic of flagellar assembly dictates which promoters skip pulses. Surprisingly, pulses do not require specific transcriptional or translational regulation of the flagellar master regulator, FlhDC, but instead appears to be essentially governed by an autonomous posttranslational circuit. Our results suggest that even topologically simple transcriptional networks can generate unexpectedly rich temporal dynamics and phenotypic heterogeneities.},

Microsatellite genotyping of germinated seeds indicates that exchanges of genetic material occurred between the Middle East (eastern) and North Africa (western) date palm gene pools, with older seeds exhibiting a more eastern nuclear genome on a gradient from east to west of genetic contributions. Ancient seeds were significantly longer and wider than modern varieties, supporting historical records of the large size of the Judean date. These findings, in accord with the region’s location between east and west date palm gene pools, suggest that sophisticated agricultural practices may have contributed to the Judean date’s historical reputation.

As compared to Pb NK65 S , Pb NK65 F parasites differentially expressed 46 genes, most of which are predicted to play roles in immune evasion. Pb NK65 F infections resulted in an early interferon-γ response and a later expansion of germinal centers, resulting in high levels of infected red blood cell–specific T H 1-type immunoglobulin G2b (IgG2b) and IgG2c antibodies. Thus, the Pb ApiAP2 transcription factor functions as a critical parasite virulence factor in malaria infections.},

However, OR reactions are often confused by irreversible oxygen oxidation. Here, based on high-efficiency mapping of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering of both the transition metal and oxygen, we distinguish the lattice OR in Na 0.6 [Li 0.2 Mn 0.8 ]O 2 and compare it with Na 2/3 [Mg 1/3 Mn 2/3 ]O 2 . Both systems display strong lattice OR activities but with distinct electrochemical stability. The comparison shows that the substantial capacity drop in Na 0.6 [Li 0.2 Mn 0.8 ]O 2 stems from non-lattice oxygen oxidations, and its voltage decay from an increasing Mn redox contribution upon cycling, contrasting those in Na 2/3 [Mg 1/3 Mn 2/3 ]O 2 . We conclude that lattice OR is not the ringleader of the stability issue. Instead, irreversible oxygen oxidation and the changing cationic reactions lead to the capacity and voltage fade. We argue that lattice OR and other oxygen activities should/could be studied and treated separately to achieve viable OR-based electrodes.},

This collateral type of resistance is often a characteristic of cancer recurrence. Yet, mechanisms that drive this collateral resistance and their drug-specific trajectories are still poorly understood. Using resistance selection and small-scale pharmacological screens, we find that cancer cells with primary acquired resistance to the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel often develop tolerance to epidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), leading to formation of more stable resistant cell populations. We show that paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells follow distinct selection paths under EGFR-TKIs by enriching the stemness program, developing a highly glycolytic adaptive stress response, and rewiring an apoptosis control pathway. Collectively, our work demonstrates the alterations in cellular state stemming from paclitaxel failure that result in collateral resistance to EGFR-TKIs and points to new exploitable vulnerabilities during resistance evolution in the second-line treatment setting.},

Compared to wild-type mice, we find that 15q dup is associated with whole-brain functional hypoconnectivity and diminished fMRI responses to odors of stranger mice. Ex vivo diffusion MRI reveals widespread anomalies in white matter ultrastructure in 15q dup mice, suggesting a putative anatomical substrate for these functional hypoconnectivity. We show that d -cycloserine (DCS) treatment partially normalizes these anormalies in the frontal cortex of 15q dup mice and rescues some social behaviors.

Robotic manipulation of locomotion can also address previously inaccessible questions about organismal biology otherwise limited to observations of naturally occurring behaviors. Here, we present a biohybrid robot that uses onboard microelectronics to induce swimming in live jellyfish. Measurements demonstrate that propulsion can be substantially enhanced by driving body contractions at an optimal frequency range faster than natural behavior. Swimming speed can be enhanced nearly threefold, with only a twofold increase in metabolic expenditure of the animal and 10 mW of external power input to the microelectronics. Thus, this biohybrid robot uses 10 to 1000 times less external power per mass than other aquatic robots reported in literature. This capability can expand the performance envelope of biohybrid robots relative to natural animals for applications such as ocean monitoring.},

These EC results answer concerns that previous diffusive emission estimates, which excluded bubbling, may underestimate total emissions. We assert that bubbling dominates sea-air CH 4 fluxes in only small constrained areas: A ~100-m 2 area of the East Siberian Sea showed sea-air CH 4 fluxes exceeding 600 mg m −2 day −1 ; in a similarly sized area of the Laptev Sea, peak CH 4 fluxes were ~170 mg m −2 day −1 .

Since these systems are, to a large extent, transparent, they extend the possible areas of QC application to previously unreachable corners, e.g., photonics. We combined efficient bridging ligands with uranyl pentagonal bonding centers and, unexpectedly, brought the unique attributes of f-element coordination chemistry to an interdisciplinary area of aperiodic formations.

  abstract     = {The subset sum problem (SSP) is a typical nondeterministic-polynomial-time (NP)–complete problem that is hard to solve efficiently in time with conventional computers. Photons have the unique features of high propagation speed, strong robustness, and low detectable energy level and therefore can be promising candidates to meet the challenge. Here, we present a scalable chip built-in photonic computer to efficiently solve the SSP. We map the problem into a three-dimensional waveguide network through a femtosecond laser direct writing technique. We show that the photons sufficiently dissipate into the networks and search for solutions in parallel. In the case of successive primes, our approach exhibits a dominant superiority in time consumption even compared with supercomputers. Our results confirm the ability of light to realize computations intractable for conventional computers, and suggest the SSP as a good benchmarking platform for the race between photonic and conventional computers on the way toward “photonic supremacy.”},

  abstract     = {In cancer, the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway suppresses T cell stimulation and mediates immune escape. Upon stimulation, PD-1 becomes phosphorylated at its immune receptor tyrosine–based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and immune receptor tyrosine–based switch motif (ITSM), which then bind the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of SH2-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2), initiating T cell inactivation. The SHP2–PD-1 complex structure and the exact functions of the two SH2 domains and phosphorylated motifs remain unknown. Here, we explain the structural basis and provide functional evidence for the mechanism of PD-1-mediated SHP2 activation. We demonstrate that full activation is obtained only upon phosphorylation of both ITIM and ITSM: ITSM binds C-SH2 with strong affinity, recruiting SHP2 to PD-1, while ITIM binds N-SH2, displacing it from the catalytic pocket and activating SHP2. This binding event requires the formation of a new inter-domain interface, offering opportunities for the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches.},

We have recently shown that the field gradients necessary to manipulate matter via dielectrophoresis can be induced at the surface of a polarizable active (“self-propelling”) metallodielectric Janus particle (JP) under an externally applied electric field, acting essentially as a mobile floating microelectrode. Here, we successfully demonstrated that the application of an external electric field can singularly trap and transport bacteria and can selectively electroporate the trapped bacteria. Selective electroporation, enabled by the local intensification of the electric field induced by the JP, was obtained under both continuous alternating current and pulsed signal conditions. This approach is generic and applicable to bacteria and JP, as well as a wide range of cell types and micromotor designs. Hence, it constitutes an important and novel experimental tool for single-cell analysis and targeted delivery.},

Understanding fundamental behavior of hydrogen at the atomic scale is key to improve the properties of metal-metal hydride systems. However, currently, there is no robust technique capable of visualizing hydrogen atoms. Here, we demonstrate that hydrogen atoms can be imaged unprecedentedly with integrated differential phase contrast, a recently developed technique performed in a scanning transmission electron microscope. Images of the titanium-titanium monohydride interface reveal stability of the hydride phase, originating from the interplay between compressive stress and interfacial coherence. We also uncovered, 30 years after three models were proposed, which one describes the position of hydrogen atoms with respect to the interface. Our work enables previously unidentified research on hydrides and is extendable to all materials containing light and heavy elements, including oxides, nitrides, carbides, and borides.},

The CA-robot is designed to explore formulations in an open-ended way with no explicit optimization target. By applying the CA-robot to the study of self-propelling multicomponent oil-in-water protocell droplets, we are able to observe an order of magnitude more variety in droplet behaviors than possible with a random parameter search and given the same budget. We demonstrate that the CA-robot enabled the observation of a sudden and highly specific response of droplets to slight temperature changes. Six modes of self-propelled droplet motion were identified and classified using a time-temperature phase diagram and probed using a variety of techniques including NMR. This work illustrates how CAs can make better use of a limited experimental budget and significantly increase the rate of unpredictable observations, leading to new discoveries with potential applications in formulation chemistry.},

We then identified isotretinoin and bexarotene, two FDA-approved RXRA agonists, which exert cardioprotective effects. The therapeutic effects of these drugs only occur when administered during early, but not late, phase of AIC or as pretreatment. Mechanistically, these spatially- and temporally-predominant benefits of RXRA activation can be ascribed to repair of damaged endothelial cell-barrier via regulating tight-junction protein Zonula occludens-1.

The molecular motion is harnessed to mediate the adsorbed protein layer and then ultimately to direct the fate of human bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs). When influenced by the rotary motion of light-driven molecular motors grafted on surfaces, the adsorbed protein layer primes hBM-MSCs to differentiate into osteoblasts, while without rotation, multipotency is better maintained. We have shown that the signaling effects of the molecular motion are mediated by the adsorbed cell-instructing protein layer, influencing the focal adhesion–cytoskeleton actin transduction pathway and regulating the protein and gene expression of hBM-MSCs.

Still, stimulation effects substantially vary across studies and individuals, thereby restricting the large-scale application of TMS in research or clinical settings. We revealed that low-frequency stimulation had opposite impact on the functional connectivity of sensory and cognitive brain regions. Biophysical modeling then identified a neuronal mechanism underlying these region-specific effects. Stimulation of the frontal cortex decreased local inhibition and disrupted feedforward and feedback connections. Conversely, identical stimulation increased local inhibition and enhanced forward signaling in the occipital cortex. Last, we identified functional integration as a macroscale network parameter to predict the region-specific effect of stimulation in individual subjects. In summary, we revealed how TMS modulation critically depends on the connectivity profile of target regions and propose an imaging marker to improve sensitivity of noninvasive brain stimulation for research and clinical applications.},

Single-cell whole-genome sequencing demonstrates that &gt;25\% of BRCA2 carrier ( BRCA2 mut/+ ) luminal progenitor (LP) cells exhibit sub-chromosomal copy number variations, which are rarely observed in non-carriers. Correspondingly, primary BRCA2 mut/+ breast epithelia exhibit DNA damage together with attenuated replication checkpoint and apoptotic responses, and an age-associated expansion of the LP compartment. We provide evidence that these phenotypes do not require loss of the wild-type BRCA2 allele. Collectively, our findings suggest that BRCA2 haploinsufficiency and associated DNA damage precede histologic abnormalities in vivo.

While interruption of signaling is typically attributed to biological processes, potential abiotic controls remain less studied. Here, we show that higher organic carbon (OC) contents in soils repress flavonoid signals by up to 70\%. Furthermore, the magnitude of repression is differentially dependent on the chemical structure of the signaling molecule, the availability of metal ions, and the source of the plant-derived OC. Up to 63\% of the signaling repression occurs between dissolved OC and flavonoids rather than through flavonoid sorption to particulate OC. In plant experiments, OC interrupts the signaling between a legume and a nitrogen-fixing microbial symbiont, resulting in a 75\% decrease in nodule formation. Our results suggest that soil OC decreases the lifetime of flavonoids underlying plant-microbe interactions.},

  abstract     = {Biodiversity’s contribution to human welfare has become a key argument for maintaining and enhancing biodiversity in managed ecosystems. The functional relationship between biodiversity ( b ) and economic value ( V ) is, however, insufficiently understood, despite the premise of a positive-concave bV relationship that dominates scientific and political arenas. Here, we review how individual links between biodiversity, ecosystem functions ( F ), and services affect resulting bV relationships. Our findings show that bV relationships are more variable, also taking negative-concave/convex or strictly concave and convex forms. This functional form is driven not only by the underlying bF relationship but also by the number and type of ecosystem services and their potential trade-offs considered, the effects of inputs, and the type of utility function used to represent human preferences. Explicitly accounting for these aspects will enhance the substance and coverage of future valuation studies and allow more nuanced conclusions, particularly for managed ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, a catalyst functions by direct interaction with reactants. In a new noncontact catalytic system (NCCS), an intermediate produced by one catalytic reaction serves as an intermediary to enable an independent reaction to proceed. An example is the selective oxidation of ethylbenzene, which could not occur in the presence of either solubilized Au nanoclusters or cyclooctene, but proceeded readily when both were present simultaneously. The Au-initiated selective epoxidation of cyclooctene generated cyclooctenyl peroxy and oxy radicals that served as intermediaries to initiate the ethylbenzene oxidation. This combined system effectively extended the catalytic effect of Au. The reaction mechanism was supported by reaction kinetics and spin trap experiments. NCCS enables parallel reactions to proceed without the constraints of stoichiometric relationships, offering new degrees of freedom in industrial hydrocarbon co-oxidation processes.},

Markedly different from previous researches based on bulk solution synthesis, here, we report the synthesis of enzyme-embedded MOFs in a microfluidic laminar flow. The continuously changed concentrations of MOF precursors in the gradient mixing on-chip resulted in structural defects in products. This defect-generating phenomenon enables multimodal pore size distribution in MOFs and therefore allows improved access of substrates to encapsulated enzymes while maintaining the protection to the enzymes. Thus, the as-produced enzyme-MOF composites showed much higher (~one order of magnitude) biological activity than those from conventional bulk solution synthesis. This work suggests that while microfluidic flow synthesis is currently underexplored, it is a promising strategy in producing highly active enzyme-MOF composites.},

We first determined whether this approach can enhance CD47-targeted immunotherapy using a tumor acidity–responsive nanoparticle delivery system (NP-siCD47/CCL25) to sequentially release CCL25 protein and CD47 small interfering RNA in tumor. NP-siCD47/CCL25 significantly increased infiltration of CCR9 + CD8 + T cells and down-regulated CD47 expression in tumor, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis through a T cell–dependent immunity. Furthermore, the antitumor effect of NP-siCD47/CCL25 was synergistically enhanced when used in combination with programmed cell death protein–1/programmed death ligand-1 blockades. This study offers a strategy to enhance immunotherapy by promoting CCR9 + CD8 + T cell tumor infiltration.},

Because of their random nature and low abundance, somatic mutations are difficult to detect except in single cells or clonal cell lineages. Here, we show that in single hepatocytes from human liver, an organ exposed to high levels of genotoxic stress, somatic mutation frequencies are high and increase substantially with age. Considerably lower mutation frequencies were observed in liver stem cells (LSCs) and organoids derived from them. Mutational spectra in hepatocytes showed signatures of oxidative stress that were different in old age and in LSCs. A considerable number of mutations were found in functional parts of the liver genome, suggesting that somatic mutagenesis could causally contribute to the age-related functional decline and increased incidence of disease of human liver. These results underscore the importance of stem cells in maintaining genome sequence integrity in aging somatic tissues.},

A peptide antigen was coupled with poly-hydrophobic amino acid sequences serving as self-adjuvanting moieties using solid-phase synthesis, to produce fully defined single molecular entities. Under aqueous conditions, these molecules self-assembled into distinct nanoparticles and chain-like aggregates. Following subcutaneous immunization in mice, these particles successfully induced opsonic epitope-specific antibodies without the need of external adjuvant. Mice immunized with entities bearing 15 leucine residues were able to clear bacterial load from target organs without triggering the release of soluble inflammatory mediators.

The organohydrogel was introduced into the design of soft-matter machines, yielding a soft gripper with adaptive grasping through stiffness matching with various objects under pneumatic-thermal hybrid actuation. Meanwhile, a programmable adhesion of octopus-inspired robotic tentacles on a wide range of surface morphologies was realized.

We report comparative δ 11 B analyses of 10 species with divergent calcification responses (positive, parabolic, threshold, and negative) to OA. Although the pH CF is closely coupled to calcification responses only in 3 of the 10 species, all 10 species elevate pH CF above pH sw under elevated pCO 2 . This result suggests that these species may expend additional energy regulating pH CF under future OA. This strategy of elevating pH CF above pH sw appears to be a polyphyletic, if not universal, response to OA among marine calcifiers—although not always the principal factor governing a species’ response to OA.},

We find that corrective information not only fails to reduce targeted Zika misperceptions but also reduces the accuracy of other beliefs about the disease.

Here, we report that poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) can form complexes with BPA through reversible boronate esters in aqueous solution, and the complex termed PVA-BPA can be internalized into cancer cells through LAT1-mediated endocytosis, thereby enhancing cellular uptake and slowing the untoward efflux. In in vivo study, compared with clinically used fructose-BPA complexes, PVA-BPA exhibited efficient tumor accumulation and prolonged tumor retention with quick clearance from bloodstream and normal organs.

  abstract     = {Poly(triazine imide) (PTI), a crystalline g-C 3 N 4 , hosting two-dimensional nanoporous structure with an electron density gap of 0.34 nm, is highly promising for high-temperature hydrogen sieving because of its high chemical and thermal robustness. Currently, layered PTI is synthesized in potentially unsafe vacuum ampules in milligram quantities. Here, we demonstrate a scalable and safe ambient pressure synthesis route leading to several grams of layered PTI platelets in a single batch with 70\% yield with respect to the precursor. Solvent exfoliation under anhydrous conditions led to single-layer PTI nanosheets evidenced by the observation of triangular g-C 3 N 4 nanopores. Gas permeation studies confirm that PTI nanopores can sieve He and H 2 from larger molecules. Last, high-temperature H 2 sieving from PTI nanosheet–based membranes, prepared by the scalable filter coating technique, is demonstrated with H 2 permeance reaching 1500 gas permeation units, with H 2 /CO 2 , H 2 /N 2 , and H 2 /CH 4 selectivities reaching 10, 50, and 60, respectively, at 250°C.},

  abstract     = {Disassembly of intercellular junctions is a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, how the junctions disassemble remains largely unknown. Here, we report that E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 targets p120-catenin, a core component of adherens junction (AJ) complex, for monoubiquitination during transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)–induced EMT, thereby leading to AJ dissociation. Upon TGFβ treatment, activated extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylates T900 of p120-catenin to promote its interaction with Smurf1 and subsequent monoubiquitination. Inhibition of T900 phosphorylation or ubiquitination of p120-catenin abrogates TGFβ-induced AJ dissociation and consequent tight junction (TJ) dissociation and cytoskeleton rearrangement, hence markedly blocking lung metastasis of murine breast cancer. Moreover, the T900 phosphorylation level of p120-catenin is positively correlated with malignancy of human breast cancer. Hence, our study reveals the underlying mechanism by which TGFβ induces dissociation of AJs during EMT and provides a potential strategy to block tumor metastasis.},

Systemically administered PEGOL-60 crosses impaired CNS barriers and specifically targets activated microglia/macrophages at the injured site in diverse animal models for cerebral palsy, glioblastoma, and age-related macular degeneration, demonstrating its potential to overcome impaired blood-brain, blood-tumor-brain, and blood-retinal barriers and target key cells in the CNS. PEGOL-60 also exhibits powerful intrinsic anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in inflamed microglia in vitro.

By sensing swarm and cargo coordinates, each particle’s speed is actuated according to a control policy based on multiagent assignment and path planning strategies that navigate stochastic particle trajectories to targets around cargo. Colloidal swarms are shown to dynamically cage cargo at their center via inward radial forces while simultaneously translating via directional forces. Speed, power, and efficiency of swarm tasks display emergent coupled dependences on swarm size and pair interactions and approach asymptotic limits indicating near-optimal performance. This scheme exploits unique interactions and stochastic dynamics in colloidal swarms to capture and transport microscopic cargo in a robust, stable, error-tolerant, and dynamic manner.},

Conventional magnetically ordered states are present for all currently known candidate materials, however, because non-Kitaev terms in the Hamiltonians obscure the Kitaev physics. Current experimental studies of the KQSL are focused on 4 d or 5 d transition metal–based honeycombs, in which strong spin-orbit coupling can be expected, yielding Kitaev interaction that dominates in an applied magnetic field. In contrast, for 3 d -based layered honeycomb magnets, spin-orbit coupling is weak, and thus, Kitaev physics should be substantially less accessible. Here, we report our studies on BaCo 2 (AsO 4 ) 2 , for which we find that the magnetic order associated with the non-Kitaev interactions can be fully suppressed by a relatively low magnetic field, yielding a nonmagnetic material and implying the presence of strong magnetic frustration and weak non-Kitaev interactions.},

Building on molecular programming concepts, we design a DNA circuit that converts, thresholds, amplifies, and reports the presence of a specific microRNA, down to the femtomolar concentration. Using a leak absorption mechanism, we were able to suppress nonspecific amplification, classically encountered in other exponential amplification reactions. As a result, we demonstrate that this isothermal amplification scheme is adapted to digital counting of microRNAs: By partitioning the reaction mixture into water-in-oil droplets, resulting in single microRNA encapsulation and amplification, the method provides absolute target quantification. The modularity of our approach enables to repurpose the assay for various microRNA sequences.},

However, these claims fail to demonstrate glucose Raman peaks, which has raised questions regarding the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy for glucose sensing. Here, we demonstrate the first direct observation of glucose Raman peaks from in vivo skin. The signal intensities varied proportional to the reference glucose concentrations in three live swine glucose clamping experiments. Tracking spectral intensity based on linearity enabled accurate prospective prediction in within-subject and intersubject models.

In most subduction zones, a layer of anomalously low seismic wave velocities [low-velocity layer (LVL)] is observed in the vicinity of ETS and suggests high pore-fluid pressures that weaken the megathrust. Using repeated seismic scattering observations in the Cascadia subduction zone, we observe a change in the seismic velocity associated with the LVL after ETS events, which we interpret as a response to fluctuations in pore-fluid pressure.

However, the geochemistry of recently discovered iron-rich micrometeorites from 2.7 billion–year–old limestones could serve as a proxy for ancient gas concentrations. When micrometeorites entered the atmosphere, they melted and preserved a record of atmospheric interaction. We model the motion, evaporation, and kinetic oxidation by CO 2 of micrometeorites entering a CO 2 -rich atmosphere. We consider a CO 2 -rich rather than an O 2 -rich atmosphere, as considered previously, because this better represents likely atmospheric conditions in the anoxic Archean. Our model reproduces the observed oxidation state of micrometeorites at 2.7 Ga for an estimated atmospheric CO 2 concentration of &gt;70\% by volume. Even if the early atmosphere was thinner than today, the elevated CO 2 level indicated by our model result would help resolve how the Late Archean Earth remained warm when the young Sun was ~20\% fainter.},

Although this approach successfully achieves a series of bandgap emissions based on the different layer thicknesses, it still suffers from a conventional temperature-induced device degradation mechanism during high-voltage operations. To understand the underlying mechanism, we further elucidate temperature-induced device degradation by investigating the crystal structural and spectral evolution dynamics via in situ temperature-dependent single-crystal x-ray diffraction, photoluminescence (PL) characterization, and density functional theory calculation. The PL peak becomes asymmetrically broadened with a marked intensity decay, as temperature increases owing to [PbBr 6 ] 4− octahedra tilting and the organic chain disordering, which results in bandgap decrease. This study indicates that careful heat management under LED operation is a key factor to maintain the sharp and intense emission.},

The results show significant differences in infant- and child-rearing practices, in subsistence strategies, and in landscape use between burial locations. From this, we posit that the presence of communities with distinct lifestyles and cultural backgrounds is a primary reason for Late Neolithic variability in burial location in Western Europe and provides evidence of an early “them and us” scenario.

While Hilbert spaces with higher dimensionality, e.g., spatial modes of light, allow higher information capacity per photon, such spatial mode entanglement transport requires custom multimode fiber and is limited by decoherence-induced mode coupling. Here, we circumvent this by transporting multidimensional entangled states down conventional single-mode fiber (SMF). By entangling the spin-orbit degrees of freedom of a biphoton pair, passing the polarization (spin) photon down the SMF while accessing multiple orbital angular momentum (orbital) subspaces with the other, we realize multidimensional entanglement transport. We show high-fidelity hybrid entanglement preservation down 250 m SMF across multiple 2 × 2 dimensions, confirmed by quantum state tomography, Bell violation measures, and a quantum eraser scheme.

Although CD11b + Gr-1 + Sca-1 + cells have impaired migratory capacity and superoxide anion–producing activity, they secrete increased levels of several cytokines and chemokines compared to Sca-1 − counterparts. The generation of CD11b + Gr-1 + Sca-1 + cells is dependent on IFN-γ in vivo, and in vitro stimulation of bone marrow cells or granulocyte-macrophage progenitors with IFN-γ generated CD11b + Gr-1 + Sca-1 + cells. Depletion of CD11b + Gr-1 + Sca-1 + cells by administrating anti–Sca-1 antibody strongly increased survival rates in an S. aureus infection model by reducing organ damage and inflammatory cytokines. However, adoptive transfer of CD11b + Gr-1 + Sca-1 + cells decreased survival rates by worsening the pathogenesis of S. aureus infection. Together, we found a previously unidentified pathogenic CD11b + Gr-1 + Sca-1 + population that plays an essential role in mortality during bacterial infection.},

  abstract     = {Protists are ubiquitous in soil, where they are key contributors to nutrient cycling and energy transfer. However, protists have received far less attention than other components of the soil microbiome. We used amplicon sequencing of soils from 180 locations across six continents to investigate the ecological preferences of protists and their functional contributions to belowground systems. We complemented these analyses with shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 46 soils to validate the identities of the more abundant protist lineages. We found that most soils are dominated by consumers, although parasites and phototrophs are particularly abundant in tropical and arid ecosystems, respectively. The best predictors of protist composition (primarily annual precipitation) are fundamentally distinct from those shaping bacterial and archaeal communities (namely, soil pH). Some protists and bacteria co-occur globally, highlighting the potential importance of these largely undescribed belowground interactions. Together, this study allowed us to identify the most abundant and ubiquitous protists living in soil, with our work providing a cross-ecosystem perspective on the factors structuring soil protist communities and their likely contributions to soil functioning.},

It was demonstrated that the resultant hydrogel film could serve as a functional tissue patch with an excellent adhesion property on one surface for repairing injured tissues and an anti-adhesion property on the other surface for preventing adverse adhesion. Besides, because of the responsive structural color, the patch was imparted with self-reporting mechanical capability, which could provide a real-time color-sensing feedback to monitor the heartbeat activity. Moreover, the catechol groups on PDA imparted the patch with high tissue adhesiveness and self-healing capability in vivo.

Here, we report that both the number and spacing significantly influence the velocity of microtubules driven by nonprocessive kinesin-14 (Ncd), whereas neither the number nor the spacing changes the velocity in the case of highly processive kinesin-1. This result was realized by the optimum nanopatterning method of kinesins that enables immobilization of a single kinesin on a nanopillar.

In animal models of injury and aging, nerve growth factor (NGF) enhances cholinergic cell survival and function, contributing to improved memory. In the presence of AD pathology, however, NGF-related therapeutics have yet to fulfill their regenerative potential. We propose that stimulating the TrkA receptor, without p75 NTR activation, is key for therapeutic efficacy. Supporting this hypothesis, the selective TrkA agonist D3 rescued neurotrophin signaling in TgCRND8 mice, whereas NGF, interacting with both TrkA and p75 NTR , did not. D3, delivered intravenously and noninvasively to the basal forebrain using MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS)–mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability activated TrkA-related signaling cascades and enhanced cholinergic neurotransmission. Recent clinical trials support the safety and feasibility of MRIgFUS BBB modulation in AD patients. Neuroprotective agents targeting TrkA, combined with MRIgFUS BBB modulation, represent a promising strategy to counter neurodegeneration in AD.},

Consequently, the polymer with a low nanofiller loading (0.2 volume\%) generates a high discharged energy density of ca. 5 J/cm 3 with high efficiency at 150°C. The experimental data reveal microstructure changes in the nanocomposites, which, at 0.2 volume\% nanofiller loading, reduce constraints on dipole motions locally in the glassy state of the polymer, reduce the mean free path for the mobile charges, and enhance the deep trap level.},

The compression-induced dedifferentiated adipocytes (CiDAs) have a distinct transcriptome profile, long-term self-renewal, and serial clonogenicity, but do not form teratomas. We then show that CiDAs notably enhance human mammary adenocarcinoma proliferation both in vitro and in a xenograft model, owing to myofibrogenesis of CiDAs in the tumor-conditioned environment. Collectively, our results highlight unique physical interplay in the tumor ecosystem; tumor-induced physical stresses stimulate de novo generation of CiDAs, which feedback to tumor growth.},

Previous studies based on molecular dynamics simulations have suggested that polarity-inverted membranes, azotosomes, made up of small nitrogen-containing molecules, are kinetically persistent and may function on cryogenic liquid hydrocarbon worlds, such as Saturn’s moon Titan. We here take the next step and evaluate the thermodynamic viability of azotosome formation. Quantum mechanical calculations predict that azotosomes are not viable candidates for self-assembly akin to lipid bilayers in liquid water.

We measured 216 features derived from cell and nucleus morphology for more than 30, 000 breast cancer cells. We find that single cell–derived clones (SCCs) established from the same parental cells exhibit distinct and heritable morphological traits associated with genomic (ploidy) and transcriptomic phenotypes. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we find that the morphological classes of SCCs predict distinct tumorigenic and metastatic potentials in vivo using multiple mouse models of breast cancer.

Using experiments and simulations that span a wide range of Reynolds number, we show that small-scale universality governs the spectral structure of a class of flows with no apparent ties to the idealized flows: transitional pipe flows. Our results not only extend the universality of Kolmogorov’s framework beyond expectation but also establish an unexpected link between transitional pipe flows and Kolmogorovian turbulence.},

Our approach naturally supports multiscale community detection and the selection of an optimal scale using model comparison. We study the properties of the algorithm using synthetic data and apply it to daily returns of constituents of the S&amp;P100 index and climate data from U.S. cities.},

  abstract     = {Tight control on the selectivity of nanoparticles’ interaction with biological systems is paramount for the development of targeted therapies. However, the large number of tunable parameters makes it difficult to identify optimal design “sweet spots” without guiding principles. Here, we combine superselectivity theory with soft matter physics into a unified theoretical framework and we prove its validity using blood brain barrier cells as target. We apply our approach to polymersomes functionalized with targeting ligands to identify the most selective combination of parameters in terms of particle size, brush length and density, as well as tether length, affinity, and ligand number. We show that the combination of multivalent interactions into multiplexed systems enable interaction as a function of the cell phenotype, that is, which receptors are expressed. We thus propose the design of a “bar-coding” targeting approach that can be tailor-made to unique cell populations enabling personalized therapies.},

  abstract     = {On 22 December 2018, a devastating tsunami struck Sunda Strait, Indonesia without warning, leaving 437 dead and thousands injured along the western Java and southern Sumatra coastlines. Synthetic aperture radar and broadband seismic observations demonstrate that a small, &lt;~0.2 km 3 landslide on the southwestern flank of the actively erupting volcano Anak Krakatau generated the tsunami. The landslide did not produce strong short-period seismic waves; thus, precursory ground shaking did not provide a tsunami warning. The source of long-period ground motions during the landslide can be represented as a 12° upward-dipping single-force directed northeastward, with peak magnitude of ~6.1 × 10 11 N and quasi-sinusoidal time duration of ~70 s. Rapid quantification of a landslide source process by long-period seismic wave inversions for moment-tensor and single-force parameterizations using regional seismic data available within ~8 min can provide a basis for future fast tsunami warnings, as is also the case for tsunami earthquakes.},

  abstract     = {Heusler compounds are exciting materials for future spintronics applications because they display a wide range of tunable electronic and magnetic interactions. Here, we use a femtosecond laser to directly transfer spin polarization from one element to another in a half-metallic Heusler material, Co 2 MnGe. This spin transfer initiates as soon as light is incident on the material, demonstrating spatial transfer of angular momentum between neighboring atomic sites on time scales &lt; 10 fs. Using ultrafast high harmonic pulses to simultaneously and independently probe the magnetic state of two elements during laser excitation, we find that the magnetization of Co is enhanced, while that of Mn rapidly quenches. Density functional theory calculations show that the optical excitation directly transfers spin from one magnetic sublattice to another through preferred spin-polarized excitation pathways. This direct manipulation of spins via light provides a path toward spintronic devices that can operate on few-femtosecond or faster time scales.},

Results are presented for H 2 O and D 2 O clusters using femtosecond pump pulses centered at 133 or 80 nm. In both excitation schemes, hydrogen or proton transfer is observed to yield a prehydrated electron within 30 to 60 fs, followed by its solvation in 0.3 to 1.0 ps and its decay through geminate recombination on a ∼10-ps time scale. These results are interpreted by comparison with detailed multiconfigurational non-adiabatic ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations. Our results provide the first comprehensive picture of the primary steps of radiation chemistry and radiation damage and demonstrate new approaches for their study with unprecedented time resolution.},

We report theoretical design and experimental realization of a iron-based vdW material, Fe 4 GeTe 2 , showing a nearly room temperature ferromagnetic order, together with a large magnetization and high conductivity. These properties are well retained even in cleaved crystals down to seven layers, with notable improvement in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our findings highlight Fe 4 GeTe 2 and its nanometer-thick crystals as a promising candidate for spin source operation at nearly room temperature and hold promise to further increase T c in vdW ferromagnets by theory-guided material discovery.},

In our work, we provide experimental evidence of such a direct, ultrafast, and coherent spin transfer between two magnetic subsystems of an alloy of Fe and Ni. Our experimental findings are fully supported by time-dependent density functional theory simulations and, hence, suggest the possibility of coherently controlling spin dynamics on subfemtosecond time scales, i.e., the birth of the research area of attomagnetism.},

Using this platform, we investigated red blood cell (RBC) transit at the single cell and at physiological hematocrits. We showed normal RBCs deformed via in vivo–like stretching and tumbling with negligible interactions with the vessel wall. By comparison, Plasmodium falciparum –infected RBCs exhibited virtually no deformation and rapidly accumulated in the capillary-sized region. Comparison of wild-type parasites to those lacking either cytoadhesion ligands or membrane-stiffening knobs showed highly distinctive spatial and temporal kinetics of accumulation, linked to velocity transition in ACVs. Our findings shed light on mechanisms of microcirculatory obstruction in malaria and establish a new platform to study hematologic and microvascular diseases.},

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we describe multiple microglia activation states, one of which was enriched for interferon associated signaling. Although blood-derived macrophages acutely infiltrated the demyelinated lesion, microglia progressively monopolized the lesion environment where they surrounded infiltrating macrophages. In the microglia-devoid sciatic nerve, the infiltrating macrophage response was sustained. In the CNS, the preferential proliferation of microglia and sparse microglia death contributed to microglia dominating the lesion. Microglia ablation reversed the spatial restriction of macrophages with the demyelinated spinal cord, highlighting an unrealized macrophages-microglia interaction. The restriction of peripheral inflammation by microglia may be a previously unidentified mechanism by which the CNS maintains its “immune privileged” status.},

Direct imaging of the Re–Re bond breaking process reveals a new bonding state with the bond order less than one and a high-amplitude vibrational stretch, preceding the bond dissociation.

By dividing labor, cooperative groups increase efficiency, thereby raising group fitness even if these behaviors reduce individual fitness. We find that antibiotic production in colonies of Streptomyces coelicolor is coordinated by a division of labor. We show that S. coelicolor colonies are genetically heterogeneous because of amplifications and deletions to the chromosome. Cells with chromosomal changes produce diversified secondary metabolites and secrete more antibiotics; however, these changes reduced individual fitness, providing evidence for a trade-off between antibiotic production and fitness. Last, we show that colonies containing mixtures of mutants and their parents produce significantly more antibiotics, while colony-wide spore production remains unchanged.

  abstract     = {High alcohol consumption is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality, yet few genetic loci have been robustly associated with alcohol intake. Here, we use U.K. Biobank ( n = 125, 249) and GERA ( n = 47, 967) datasets to determine genetic factors associated with extreme population-level alcohol consumption and examine the functional validity of outcomes using model organisms and in silico techniques. We identified six loci attaining genome-wide significant association with alcohol consumption after meta-analysis and meeting our criteria for replication: ADH1B (lead SNP: rs1229984), KLB (rs13130794), BTF3P13 (rs144198753), GCKR (rs1260326), SLC39A8 (rs13107325), and DRD2 (rs11214609). A conserved role in phenotypic responses to alcohol was observed for all genetic targets available for investigation ( ADH1B, GCKR, SLC39A8 , and KLB ) in Caenorhabditis elegans . Evidence of causal links to lung cancer, and shared genetic architecture with gout and hypertension was also found. These findings offer insight into genes, pathways, and relationships for disease risk associated with high alcohol consumption.},

Despite extensive efforts that have been paid to develop aromatic frameworks, the construction of polycyclic aromatics that share a bridgehead atom with more than three rings has never been accomplished. Here, an unprecedented family of aromatics, in which a metal center shared by 4 five-membered aromatic rings, has been achieved by using the metalla-click reactions with excellent yields and remarkable regioselectivity. The distinctive tetracyclic aromatics exhibit a broad absorption in the ultraviolet-visible near-infrared region and excellent thermal stability in air, enabling their potential applications in photoelectric materials and biomedicine. This study now makes it possible to incorporate four aromatic rings with one common sharing metal center by a straightforward strategy that would promote further development of previously unknown polycyclic complex motifs in aromatic chemistry.},

Systemic administration of inRas37 exerted a potent antitumor activity in a subset of RAS MUT tumor xenografts in mice, but little efficacy in RAS MUT tumors with concurrent downstream PI3K mutations, which were overcome by combination with a PI3K inhibitor. The YAP1 protein was up-regulated as an adaptive resistance-inducing response to inRas37 in RAS MUT -dependent colorectal tumors; accordingly, a combination of inRas37 with a YAP1 inhibitor manifested synergistic antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. Our study offers a promising pan-RAS–targeting antibody and the corresponding therapeutic strategy against RAS MUT tumors.},

The sudden appearance of large numbers of atmospheric nanoparticles is commonly attributed to secondary formation from gas-phase precursors, but in many cases, the evidence for this is equivocal. We report the detection of a mode of fungal fragments with a mobility diameter of roughly 30 nm released in episodic bursts in ambient air over an agricultural area in northern Oklahoma. These events reached concentrations orders of magnitude higher than other reports of biological particles and show similarities to unclarified events reported previously in the Amazon.

The analysis of photometric data and spectro-scopic activity diagnostics does not explain the signal in terms of a stellar activity cycle, but follow-up is required in the coming years for confirming its planetary origin. We show that the existence of the planet can be ascertained, and its true mass can be determined with high accuracy, by combining Gaia astrometry and radial velocities. Proxima c could become a prime target for follow-up and characterization with next-generation direct imaging instrumentation due to the large maximum angular separation of ~1 arc second from the parent star.

We demonstrate that cyanobacteria living in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments produce methane at substantial rates under light, dark, oxic, and anoxic conditions, linking methane production with light-driven primary productivity in a globally relevant and ancient group of photoautotrophs. Methane production, attributed to cyanobacteria using stable isotope labeling techniques, was enhanced during oxygenic photosynthesis. We suggest that the formation of methane by cyanobacteria contributes to methane accumulation in oxygen-saturated marine and limnic surface waters. In these environments, frequent cyanobacterial blooms are predicted to further increase because of global warming potentially having a direct positive feedback on climate change. We conclude that this newly identified source contributes to the current natural methane budget and most likely has been producing methane since cyanobacteria first evolved on Earth.},

The TrC was proved in human prostate cancer cells with different malignancy potential, and in human bladder cancer and melanoma cells that were sorted into subpopulations based solely on their phagocytic capacity. The more phagocytic subpopulations showed elevated aggressiveness ex vivo and in vivo. The uptake potential was preserved, and differences in gene expression and in epigenetic signature were detected. In all cases, enhanced phagocytic and aggressiveness phenotypes were correlated with greater cell deformability and predicted by a computational model. Our multidisciplinary study provides the proof of concept that phagocytic measurements can be applied for cancer diagnostics and precision medicine.},

Here, we use time-resolved x-ray diffraction to examine the ultrafast melting of polycrystalline gold thin films using an optical laser pump followed by a delayed hard x-ray probe pulse. We observe the formation of an intermediate new diffraction peak, which we attribute to material trapped between the solid and melted states, that forms 50 ps after laser excitation and persists beyond 500 ps. The peak width grows rapidly for 50 ps and then narrows distinctly at longer time scales. We attribute this to a melting band originating from the grain boundaries and propagating into the grains. Our observation of this intermediate state has implications for the use of ultrafast lasers for ablation during pulsed laser deposition.},

The failure of classical techniques for investigating the dynamics of highly turbid suspensions has contributed toward the limited experimental information available up until now. Exploiting the recent developments in the technique of differential dynamic microscopy (DDM), we report the first experimental study of the anisotropic collective dynamics of colloidal ellipsoids with a magnetic hematite core over a wide concentration range approaching kinetic arrest. In addition, we have investigated the effect of an external magnetic field on the resulting anisotropic collective diffusion. We combine DDM with small-angle x-ray scattering and rheological measurements to locate the glass transition and to relate the collective short- and long-time diffusion coefficients to the structural correlations and the evolution of the zero shear viscosity as the system approaches an arrested state.},

We correlate this space- and time-resolved information with measurements of the friction force. The balance of capillary and adhesion force between the drop and the contamination on the substrate determines the friction force of drops during self-cleaning. These friction forces are in the range of micro-Newtons. We show that hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles hardly influence superhydrophobicity provided that the particle size exceeds the pore size or the thickness of the contamination falls below the height of the protrusions. These detailed insights into self-cleaning allow the rational design of superhydrophobic surfaces that resist contamination as demonstrated by outdoor environmental (&gt;200 days) and industrial standardized contamination experiments.},

Here, we propose a programmable modular design that directly constructs 3D reconfigurable microstructures capable of sophisticated 3D-to-3D shape transformations by assembling 4D micro-building blocks. 4D direct laser writing is used to print two-photon polymerizable, stimuli-responsive hydrogels to construct building blocks at micrometer scales. Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters, used to define robotic arm kinematics, are introduced as guidelines for how to assemble the micro-building blocks and plan the 3D motion of assembled chain blocks.

Further, experiments among North Americans and Pakistani bankers, street merchants, and samples engaging in exchange (versus market) economy show that rationality and reasonableness lead people to different conclusions about what constitutes good judgment in Dictator Games, Commons Dilemma, and Prisoner’s Dilemma: Lay rationality is reductionist and instrumental, whereas reasonableness integrates preferences with particulars and moral concerns.},

Here, we report the discovery of Fe-rich aluminous bridgmanite coexisting with metallic iron in a shock vein of the Suizhou meteorite. This is the first direct evidence in nature of the Fe disproportionation reaction, which so far has only been observed in some high-pressure experiments.

For amorphous phase-change materials (PCMs) used in nonvolatile memories, relaxation processes are, however, difficult to characterize because of the lack of bulk samples. Here, instead of bulk samples, we use powder mechanical spectroscopy for powder samples to detect the prominent excess wings—a characteristic feature of β-relaxations—in a series of amorphous PCMs at temperatures below glass transitions. By contrast, β-relaxations are vanishingly small in amorphous chalcogenides of similar composition, which lack the characteristic features of PCMs. This conclusion is corroborated upon crossing the border from PCMs to non-PCMs, where β-relaxations drop substantially. Such a distinction implies that amorphous PCMs belong to a special kind of covalent glasses whose locally fast atomic motions are preserved even below the glass transitions. These findings suggest a correlation between β-relaxation and crystallization kinetics of PCMs, which have technological implications for phase-change memory functionalities.},

We show that (i) cuttlefish have also evolved stereopsis (i.e., the ability to extract depth information from the disparity between left and right visual fields); (ii) when stereopsis information is intact, the time and distance covered before striking at a target are shorter; (iii) stereopsis in cuttlefish works differently to vertebrates, as cuttlefish can extract stereopsis cues from anticorrelated stimuli.

Here, we show that the reconciliation of these exotic properties necessitates modularizing three-dimensional genome into tree data structures on top of, and in striking contrast to, the linear topology of DNA double helix. These functional modules need to be connected and isolated by an open backbone that results in porous and heterogeneous packing in a quasi–self-similar manner, as revealed by our electron and optical imaging.

Regional climate projections suggest that Amazon fire regimes will intensify under both low- and high-emission scenarios. Our results indicate that projected climatic changes will double the area burned by wildfires, affecting up to 16\% of the region’s forests by 2050. Although these fires could emit as much as 17.0 Pg of CO 2 equivalent to the atmosphere, avoiding new deforestation could cut total net fire emissions in half and help prevent fires from escaping into protected areas and indigenous lands.

Here, we present a porous supramolecular framework ( π-1 ) stabilized only by intermolecular π-π stacking interactions. π-1 shows good thermal and chemical stability not only in various organic solvents but also in aqueous solution in a broad pH range. Furthermore, featuring one-dimensional channels with dangling thiolate groups, π-1 exhibits excellent Hg 2+ removal performance, with adsorption capacity as high as 786.67 mg g −1 and an adsorption ratio as high as 99.998\%. In addition, π-1 also shows high adsorption selectivity to Hg 2+ in the presence of a series of interfering ions.},

  abstract     = {Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a congenital forebrain defect often associated with embryonic lethality and lifelong disabilities. Currently, therapeutic and diagnostic options are limited by lack of knowledge of potential disease-causing mutations. We have identified a new mutation in the PRDM15 gene (C844Y) associated with a syndromic form of HPE in multiple families. We demonstrate that C844Y is a loss-of-function mutation impairing PRDM15 transcriptional activity. Genetic deletion of murine Prdm15 causes anterior/posterior (A/P) patterning defects and recapitulates the brain malformations observed in patients. Mechanistically, PRDM15 regulates the transcription of key effectors of the NOTCH and WNT/PCP pathways to preserve early midline structures in the developing embryo. Analysis of a large cohort of patients with HPE revealed potentially damaging mutations in several regulators of both pathways. Our findings uncover an unexpected link between NOTCH and WNT/PCP signaling and A/P patterning and set the stage for the identification of new HPE candidate genes.},

However, genetic factors controlling fat mass and adiposity remain largely undetermined. We applied whole-exome sequencing in young obese subjects and identified rare gain-of-function mutations in CTNNB1/ β-catenin associated with increased obesity risk. Specific ablation of β-catenin in mature adipocytes attenuated high-fat diet–induced obesity and reduced sWAT mass expansion with less proliferated Pdgfrα + preadipocytes and less mature adipocytes. Mechanistically, β-catenin regulated the transcription of serum amyloid A3 ( Saa3 ), an adipocyte-derived chemokine, through β-catenin–TCF (T-Cell-Specific Transcription Factor) complex in mature adipocytes, and Saa3 activated macrophages to secrete several factors, including Pdgf-aa, which further promoted the proliferation of preadipocytes, suggesting that β-catenin/Saa3/macrophages may mediate mature adipocyte-preadipocyte cross-talk and fat expansion in sWAT. The identification of β-catenin as a key regulator in fat expansion and human adiposity provides the basis for developing drugs targeting Wnt/β-catenin pathway to combat obesity.},

With the advent of scalable, single-molecule DNA sequencing, genomics and transcriptomics have since propelled medicine through improved sensitivity and lower costs, but proteomics has lagged behind. Currently, proteomics relies mainly on mass spectrometry (MS), but instead of truly sequencing, it classifies a protein and typically requires about a billion copies of a protein to do it. Here, we offer a survey that illuminates a few alternatives with the brightest prospects for identifying whole proteins and displacing MS for sequencing them. These alternatives all boast sensitivity superior to MS and promise to be scalable and seem to be adaptable to bioinformatics tools for calling the sequence of amino acids that constitute a protein.},

We computationally and experimentally identify a major role of these physical factors, specifically chromatin packing scaling, in regulating phenotypic plasticity, determining responsiveness to external stressors by influencing both intercellular transcriptional malleability and heterogeneity.

Glutamate is elevated before T2-visible white matter lesions appear in MS. We previously reported that myelin-reactive T cells provoke microglia to release glutamate from the system x c − transporter promoting myelin degradation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, we explore the target for glutamate in mature oligodendrocytes. Most glutamate-stimulated calcium influx into oligodendrocyte somas is AMPA receptor (AMPAR)–mediated, and genetic deletion of AMPAR subunit GluA4 decreased intracellular calcium responses. Inducible deletion of GluA4 on mature oligodendrocytes attenuated EAE and loss of myelinated axons was selectively reduced compared to unmyelinated axons. These data link AMPAR signaling in mature oligodendrocytes to the pathophysiology of myelinated axons, demonstrating glutamate regulation as a potential neuroprotective strategy in MS.},

Administration of anti-Nrp1 antibody reverted the psoriasis phenotype. Using transcriptional and chromatin profiling of epidermal cells following Vegfa overexpression together with Flt1 or Nrp1 deletion, we identified the gene regulatory network regulated by Vegfa / Nrp1 / Flt1 during psoriasis development and uncovered a key role of Fosl1 in regulating the chromatin remodeling mediated by Vegfa overexpression in keratinocytes.

We show that this predicted change is caused by narrowing of the meridional span of the underlying El Niño–related sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies that leads to intensification of the meridional gradient of the SST anomalies, strengthening boundary-layer moisture convergence over the equatorial eastern Pacific, and enhancing local positive precipitation anomalies. The eastward shift and extension of these anomalies also intensify and extend eastward negative precipitation anomalies over the tropical western North Pacific, by strengthening equatorward advection of low mean moist enthalpy.

It is found that the annual burned area increased when a positive Arctic Oscillation (AO) takes place in early months of the year, despite peak fire season occurring 1 to 2 months later. A local high-pressure system linked to the AO drives a high-temperature anomaly in late winter, causing premature snowmelt. This causes earlier ground surface exposure and drier ground in spring due to enhanced evaporation, promoting fire spreading. Recently, southeastern Siberia has experienced warming and snow retreat; therefore, southeastern Siberia requires appropriate fire management strategies to prevent massive carbon release and accelerated global warming.},

However, the necessity for nonwetting to achieve dropwise condensation is unclear. This article reports stable dropwise condensation on a smooth, solid, hydrophilic surface (θ a = 38°) having low contact angle hysteresis (&lt;3°). We show that the distribution of nano- to micro- to macroscale droplet sizes (about 100 nm to 1 mm) for coalescing droplets agrees well with the classical distribution on hydrophobic surfaces and elucidate that the wettability-governed dropwise-to-filmwise transition is mediated by the departing droplet Bond number. Our findings demonstrate that achieving stable dropwise condensation is not governed by surface intrinsic wettability, as assumed for the past eight decades, but rather, it is dictated by contact angle hysteresis.},

To understand how this evolutionary conflict is resolved, we compared the evolutionary potential of module- and colony-level traits in two species of the bryozoan Stylopoma , grown and bred in a common garden experiment. We find quantitatively distinct differences in the evolutionary potential of modular and colony traits. Contrary to solitary organisms, individual traits are not heritable from mother to daughter modules, but colony traits are strongly heritable from parent to offspring colonies. Colony-level evolution therefore dominates because no evolutionary change can accumulate among its modules.},

Here, we explore a sea level target that is closer to coastal planning and associated adaptation measures than a temperature target. We find that a sea level target provides an optimal temperature overshoot profile through a physical constraint of SLR. The allowable temperature overshoot leads to lower mitigation costs and more effective long-term sea level stabilization compared to a temperature target leading to the same SLR by 2200. With the same mitigation cost as the temperature target, a SLR target could bring surface warming back to the targeted temperatures within this century, lead to a reduction of surface warming of the next century, and reduce and slow down SLR in the centuries thereafter.},

We developed a multiplexed and high-content screening assay using primary neurons and identified 67 small-molecule modulators of neuronal mitostasis (MnMs). Most MnMs that increased mitochondrial content, length, and/or health also increased mitochondrial function without altering neurite outgrowth. A subset of MnMs protected mitochondria in primary neurons from Aβ(1–42) toxicity, glutamate toxicity, and increased oxidative stress. Some MnMs were shown to directly target mitochondria. The top MnM also increased the synaptic activity of hippocampal neurons and proved to be potent in vivo, increasing the respiration rate of brain mitochondria after administering the compound to mice. Our results offer a platform that directly queries mitostasis processes in neurons, a collection of small-molecule modulators of mitochondrial dynamics and function, and candidate molecules for mitotherapeutics.},

The prevalence of this syndrome varies across ZIKV endemic regions, suggesting that its occurrence could depend on cofactors. Here, we evaluate the relevance of protein malnutrition for the emergence of CZS. Epidemiological data from the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas suggest a relationship between undernutrition and cases of microcephaly. To experimentally examine this relationship, we use immunocompetent pregnant mice, which were subjected to protein malnutrition and infected with a Brazilian ZIKV strain. We found that the combination of protein restriction and ZIKV infection leads to severe alterations of placental structure and embryonic body growth, with offspring displaying a reduction in neurogenesis and postnatal brain size. RNA-seq analysis reveals gene expression deregulation required for brain development in infected low-protein progeny.

Here, we aim to shed light on the evolutionary roots of this process by studying the effects of variation in opportunities for social learning on the exploratory tendency of immature orangutans ( Pongo spp.) in nature. We based our analyses on mixed cross-sectional, longitudinal data of exploration by immatures and their mothers. Current exploration rates were correlated with levels of past experienced sociability, but not with current food abundance or with maternal condition, and only partly with genetic similarity. We conclude that the dependence of cognitive development on socially triggered exploration, which underlies the construction of cognitive skills such as intelligence, existed before the emergence of the human lineage.},

However, the simple confinement of electrolyte solutions inside nanometer-sized pores leads to lower ion conductivity as viscosity increases. Here, we demonstrate that the Li-ion conductivity of nanocomposites consisting of a mesoporous silica monolith with an ionic liquid electrolyte filler can be several times higher than that of the pure ionic liquid electrolyte through the introduction of an interfacial ice layer. Strong adsorption and ordering of the ionic liquid molecules render them immobile and solid-like as for the interfacial ice layer itself. The dipole over the adsorbate mesophase layer results in solvation of the Li + ions for enhanced conduction.

One of the key mechanisms to regulate life-span extension is the induction of protein chaperones for protein homeostasis. Ectopic activation of the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPR ER ) specifically in neurons is sufficient to enhance organismal stress resistance and extend life span. Here, we find that this activation not only promotes chaperones but also facilitates ER restructuring and ER function. This restructuring is concomitant with lipid depletion through lipophagy. Activation of lipophagy is distinct from chaperone induction and is required for the life-span extension found in this paradigm. Last, we find that overexpression of the lipophagy component, ehbp-1 , is sufficient to deplete lipids, remodel ER, and promote life span. Therefore, UPR induction in neurons triggers two distinct programs in the periphery: the proteostasis arm through protein chaperones and metabolic changes through lipid depletion mediated by EH domain binding protein 1 (EHBP-1).},

Here, we present the crystal structure of dARC1 CA and examine the relationship between dARC1, mammalian ARC, and the CA protein of circulating retroviruses. We show that while the overall architecture is highly related to that of orthoretroviral and spumaretroviral CA, there are substantial deviations in both amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, potentially affecting recruitment of partner proteins and particle assembly. The degree of sequence and structural divergence suggests that Ty3/Gypsy Gag has been exapted on two separate occasions and that, although mammalian ARC and dARC1 share functional similarity, the structures have undergone different adaptations after appropriation into the tetrapod and insect genomes.},

The heat sensor protein TRPM2 (transient receptor potential channel M2) plays crucial roles in the heat response, but its function and specific mechanism in brain development remain largely unclear. Here, we observe that TRPM2 is expressed in neural stem cells. In hyperthermia, TRPM2 knockdown and knockout reduce the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and, accordingly, increase premature cortical neuron differentiation. In terms of the mechanism, TRPM2 regulates neural progenitor self-renewal by targeting SP5 (specificity protein 5) via inhibiting the phosphorylation of β-catenin and increasing β-catenin expression. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of TRPM2 or SP5 partly rescues defective NPC proliferation in the TRPM2-deficient embryonic brain. Together, the data suggest that TRPM2 has a critical function in maintaining the NPC pool during heat stress, and the findings provide a framework for understanding how the disruption of the TRPM2 gene may contribute to neurological disorders.},

Pharmacological administration of an Epac-specific inhibitor suppressed OIR-induced neovascularization in wild-type mice, recapitulating the phenotype of genetic Epac1 knockout.

Inspired by the classical approaches in particle agglomeration theories, we found an approach that places minimum amounts of a high-modulus binder between neighboring particles, leaving increased space for material expansion and ion diffusion. These expansion-tolerant electrodes with loadings up to 15 mg cm −2 yield high gravimetric (&gt;1200 mA·hour g −1 ) and areal (19 mA·hour cm −2 ) capacities.

High-resolution imaging and three-dimensional image reconstruction revealed that localization of phosphorylated Zap70 to the immune synapse (IS) and subsequent LAT phosphorylation are critically dependent on formin-mediated actin polymerization. Using knockout mice, we identify mDia1 and mDia3, which are highly expressed in T cells and which localize to the IS upon TCR activation, as the critical formins mediating this process. Our findings therefore describe previously unsuspected roles for mDia1 and mDia3 in the spatiotemporal control of Zap70-dependent LAT phosphorylation at the IS through regulation of filamentous actin, and underscore their physiological importance in TCR signaling.},

We leveraged the strong affinity interactions between heparin microparticles (HMPs) and BMP-2 to improve protein delivery to bone defects. We first developed a computational model to investigate BMP-2–HMP interactions and demonstrated improved in vivo BMP-2 retention using HMPs. We then evaluated BMP-2–loaded HMPs as a treatment strategy for healing critically sized femoral defects in a rat model that displays heterotopic ossification with clinical BMP-2 doses (0.12 mg/kg body weight). HMPs increased BMP-2 retention in vivo, improving spatial localization of bone formation in large bone defects and reducing heterotopic ossification.

Here, we propose to produce a new type of energy, bio-coal, via a fast pyrolysis coupled with atmospheric distillation process. The high heating values of the as-prepared bio-coals from the representative biomass are within 25.4 to 28.2 MJ kg −1 , which are comparable to that of the commercial coals. Life cycle assessment further shows that the bio-coal production process could achieve net positive energy, financial, and environmental benefits. By using available biomass wastes as feedstock, China is expected to have a total bio-coal production of 402 million tons of standard coal equivalent, which is equal to 13\% of national coal consumption. It would grant China an opportunity to additionally cut 738 million tons of CO 2 emission by substituting an equal amount of coal with bio-coal in 2030.},

We found that persulfidation (CysSSH) protects Cys from irreversible oxidative loss of function by the formation of CysSSO 1-3 H derivatives that can subsequently be reduced back to native thiols. Reductive reactivation of oxidized persulfides by the thioredoxin system was demonstrated in albumin, Prx2, and PTP1B. In cells, this mechanism protects and regulates key proteins of signaling pathways, including Prx2, PTEN, PTP1B, HSP90, and KEAP1. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we show that (i) CysSSH and CysSSO 3 H species are abundant in mouse liver and enzymatically regulated by the glutathione and thioredoxin systems and (ii) deletion of the thioredoxin-related protein TRP14 in mice altered CysSSH levels on a subset of proteins, predicting a role for TRP14 in persulfide signaling. Furthermore, selenium supplementation, polysulfide treatment, or knockdown of TRP14 mediated cellular responses to EGF, suggesting a role for TrxR1/TRP14-regulated oxidative persulfidation in growth factor responsiveness.},

We obtained VNIR reflectance spectra of natural olivine that was altered and oxidized in the laboratory. We show that olivine becomes coated, within days, with alteration products, primarily hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). With increasing alteration, the VNIR 1000-nm absorption, characteristic of olivine, also weakens within days. Our results indicate that lava flows lacking VNIR features due to hematite are no more than several years old. Therefore, Venus is volcanically active now.},

Yet, programmed ribosomal frameshifting sequences within the coding region promote a high rate of reading frame change at predetermined sites thus enriching genomic information density. Frameshifting is typically stimulated by the presence of 3′ messenger RNA (mRNA) structures, but how these mRNA structures enhance −1 frameshifting remains debatable. Here, we apply single-molecule and ensemble approaches to formulate a mechanistic model of ribosomal −1 frameshifting. Our model suggests that the ribosome is intrinsically susceptible to frameshift before its translocation and this transient state is prolonged by the presence of a precisely positioned downstream mRNA structure. We challenged this model using temperature variation in vivo, which followed the prediction made based on in vitro results. Our results provide a quantitative framework for analyzing other frameshifting enhancers and a potential approach to control gene expression dynamically using programmed frameshifting.},

Osteohistology reveals these were immature individuals 13 to 15 years of age, exhibiting growth rates similar to extant birds and mammals, and that annual growth was dependent on resource abundance. Together, our results support the synonomization of “ Nanotyrannus ” into Tyrannosaurus and fail to support the hypothesized presence of a sympatric tyrannosaurid species of markedly smaller adult body size. Our independent data contribute to mounting evidence for a rapid shift in body size associated with ontogenetic niche partitioning late in T. rex ontogeny and suggest that this species singularly exploited mid- to large-sized theropod niches at the end of the Cretaceous.},

The metabolic protective effects of PMFE are gut microbiota dependent, as demonstrated by antibiotic treatment and fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT). The modulation of gut microbiota altered BCAA levels in the host serum and feces, which were significantly associated with metabolic features and actively responsive to therapeutic interventions with PMFE. Notably, PMFE greatly enriched the commensal bacterium Bacteroides ovatus , and gavage with B. ovatus reduced BCAA concentrations and alleviated MetS in HFD mice. PMFE may be used as a prebiotic agent to attenuate MetS, and target-specific microbial species may have unique therapeutic promise for metabolic diseases.},

Here, we uncovered the checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2)–FOXK (FOXK1 and FOXK2) axis playing an important role in DNA damage–mediated autophagy at the transcriptional regulation layer. Mechanistically, following DNA damage, CHK2 phosphorylates FOXK and creates a 14-3-3γ binding site, which, in turn, traps FOXK proteins in the cytoplasm. Because FOXK functions as the transcription suppressor of ATGs, DNA damage–mediated FOXKs’ cytoplasmic trapping induces autophagy. In addition, we found that a cancer-derived FOXK mutation induces FOXK hyperphosphorylation and enhances autophagy, resulting in chemoresistance. Cotreatment with cisplatin and chloroquine overcomes the chemoresistance caused by FOXK mutation. Overall, our study highlights a mechanism whereby DNA damage triggers autophagy by increasing autophagy genes via CHK2-FOXK–mediated transcriptional control, and misregulation of this pathway contributes to chemoresistance.},

PRSS levels in the serum of 156 patients with mCRC were analyzed, and poor efficacy of cetuximab therapy was observed in patients with aberrant PRSS expression.

Climate model simulations independently support this and attribute the driving process to be larger increases in evapotranspiration than in precipitation. This extra soil drying is projected to amplify the frequency and intensity of summer heatwaves. Most feedbacks operate locally, except for a notable teleconnection where extra moisture transpired over Europe is transported to central Siberia. Model results illustrate that this teleconnection offsets Siberian soil moisture losses from local spring greening. Our results highlight that climate change adaptation planning must account for the extra summer water and heatwave stress inherited from warming-induced earlier greening.},

Our structural analysis reveals the inferior activity could stem from the reduced overlap of atomic wave functions between metal and P with the increase in P contents, which consequently results in too strong P-H interaction. To this end, we used N-induced lattice contraction to generally boost the HER catalysis of P-rich TMPs including CoP 2 , FeP 2 , NiP 2 , and MoP 2 . Refined structural characterization and theoretical analysis indicate the N-P strong interaction could increase the atomic wave function overlap and eventually modulate the H adsorption strength.

  abstract     = {Volcanic ocean islands generally form on swells—seafloor that is shallower than expected for its age over areas hundreds to more than a thousand kilometers wide—and ultimately subside to form atolls and guyots (flat-topped seamounts). The mechanisms of island drowning remain enigmatic, however, and the subaerial lifespan of volcanic islands varies widely. We examine swell bathymetry and island drowning at 14 hotspots and find a correspondence between island lifespan and residence time atop swell bathymetry, implying that islands drown as tectonic plate motion transports them past mantle sources of swell uplift. This correspondence argues strongly for dynamic uplift of the lithosphere at ocean hotspots. Our results also explain global variations in island lifespan, which influence island topography, biodiversity, and climate.},

  abstract     = {Regulatory T cell (T reg ) activation and expansion occur during neonatal life and inflammation to establish immunosuppression, yet the mechanisms governing these events are incompletely understood. We report that the transcriptional regulator c-Myc (Myc) controls immune homeostasis through regulation of T reg accumulation and functional activation. Myc activity is enriched in T regs generated during neonatal life and responding to inflammation. Myc-deficient T regs show defects in accumulation and ability to transition to an activated state. Consequently, loss of Myc in T regs results in an early-onset autoimmune disorder accompanied by uncontrolled effector CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses. Mechanistically, Myc regulates mitochondrial oxidative metabolism but is dispensable for fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Indeed, T reg -specific deletion of Cox10, which promotes oxidative phosphorylation, but not Cpt1a, the rate-limiting enzyme for FAO, results in impaired T reg function and maturation. Thus, Myc coordinates T reg accumulation, transitional activation, and metabolic programming to orchestrate immune homeostasis.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of endothermy represents a major transition in vertebrate history, yet how and why endothermy evolved in birds and mammals remains controversial. Here, we combine a heat transfer model with theropod body size data to reconstruct the evolution of metabolic rates along the bird stem lineage. Results suggest that a reduction in size constitutes the path of least resistance for endothermy to evolve, maximizing thermal niche expansion while obviating the costs of elevated energy requirements. In this scenario, metabolism would have increased with the miniaturization observed in the Early-Middle Jurassic (~180 to 170 million years ago), resulting in a gradient of metabolic levels in the theropod phylogeny. Whereas basal theropods would exhibit lower metabolic rates, more recent nonavian lineages were likely decent thermoregulators with elevated metabolism. These analyses provide a tentative temporal sequence of the key evolutionary transitions that resulted in the emergence of small, endothermic, feathered flying dinosaurs.},

  abstract     = {The social bond between parents and offspring is characterized by coadaptation and balance between altruistic and selfish tendencies. However, its underlying genetic mechanism remains poorly understood. Using transcriptomic screens in the subsocial European earwig, Forficula auricularia , we found the expression of more than 1600 genes associated with experimentally manipulated parenting. We identified two genes, Th and PebIII , each showing evidence of differential coexpression between treatments in mothers and their offspring. In vivo RNAi experiments confirmed direct and indirect genetic effects of Th and PebIII on behavior and fitness, including maternal food provisioning and reproduction, and offspring development and survival. The direction of the effects consistently indicated a reciprocally altruistic function for Th and a reciprocally selfish function for PebIII . Further metabolic pathway analyses suggested roles for Th- restricted endogenous dopaminergic reward, PebIII- mediated chemical communication and a link to insulin signaling, juvenile hormone, and vitellogenin in parent-offspring coadaptation and social evolution.},

Here, we report the first achievement of an all-epitaxial, distributed Bragg reflector (DBR)–free electrically injected surface-emitting green laser by exploiting the photonic band edge modes formed in dislocation-free gallium nitride nanocrystal arrays, instead of using conventional DBRs. The device operates at ~523 nm and exhibits a threshold current of ~400 A/cm 2 , which is over one order of magnitude lower compared to previously reported blue laser diodes. Our studies open a new paradigm for developing low-threshold surface-emitting laser diodes from the ultraviolet to the deep visible (~200 to 600 nm), wherein the device performance is no longer limited by the lack of high-quality DBRs, large lattice mismatch, and substrate availability.},

  abstract     = {Directional cell motility relies on the ability of single cells to establish a front-rear polarity and can occur in the absence of external cues. The initiation of migration has often been attributed to the spontaneous polarization of cytoskeleton components, while the spatiotemporal evolution of cell-substrate interaction forces has yet to be resolved. Here, we establish a one-dimensional microfabricated migration assay that mimics the complex in vivo fibrillar environment while being compatible with high-resolution force measurements, quantitative microscopy, and optogenetics. Quantification of morphometric and mechanical parameters of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and RPE1 epithelial cells reveals a generic stick-slip behavior initiated by contractility-dependent stochastic detachment of adhesive contacts at one side of the cell, which is sufficient to trigger cell motility in 1D in the absence of pre-established polarity. A theoretical model validates the crucial role of adhesion dynamics, proposing that front-rear polarity can emerge independently of a complex self-polarizing system.},

  abstract     = {Increased human activity threatens inland water quality in China. Major efforts have been made to alleviate water pollution since 2001. Understanding how water quality responds to these forces can help to guide future efforts to maintain water security and sustainability. We here analyzed the nationwide variability of inland water quality across China from 2003 to 2017 and its responses to anthropogenic discharges. We show that water quality has been improved markedly or was maintained at favorable levels over the country because of reduced discharges in the industrial, rural, and urban residential sectors. However, growing discharges from the agricultural sector threaten these gains. Moreover, the present status of water pollution is relatively severe in north and northeast China. Our findings suggest that China’s water quality would further benefit from more flexible strategies for mitigation measures, which respond to regional differences in the factors that influence water pollution levels in specific regions.},
