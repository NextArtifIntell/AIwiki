  abstract     = {The ATPase-catalysed conversion of ATP to ADP is a fundamental process in biology. During the hydrolysis of ATP, the α3β3 domain undergoes conformational changes while the central stalk (γ/D) rotates unidirectionally. Experimental studies have suggested that different catalytic mechanisms operate depending on the type of ATPase, but the structural and energetic basis of these mechanisms remains unclear. In particular, it is not clear how the positions of the catalytic dwells influence the energy transduction. Here we show that the observed dwell positions, unidirectional rotation and movement against the applied torque are reflections of the free-energy surface of the systems. Instructively, we determine that the dwell positions do not substantially affect the stopping torque. Our results suggest that the three resting states and the pathways that connect them should not be treated equally. The current work demonstrates how the free-energy landscape determines the behaviour of different types of ATPases. Despite the fundamental role of ATPase in catalysing ATP hydrolysis, the structural and energetic aspects of this process are not fully understood. Coarse-grained computational models have now been used to calculate the free-energy surfaces of different types of ATPases. The catalytic dwell is shown not to be crucial for movement against applied torque.},

  abstract     = {Self-assembly is a powerful method to obtain large discrete functional molecular architectures. When using a single building block, self-assembly generally yields symmetrical objects in which all the subunits relate similarly to their neighbours. Here we report the discovery of a family of self-constructing cyclic macromolecules with stable folded conformations of low symmetry, which include some with a prime number (13, 17 and 23) of units, despite being formed from a single component. The formation of these objects amounts to the production of polymers with a perfectly uniform length. Design rules for the spontaneous emergence of such macromolecules include endowing monomers with a strong potential for non-covalent interactions that remain frustrated in competing entropically favoured yet conformationally restrained smaller cycles. The process can also be templated by a guest molecule that itself has an asymmetrical structure, which paves the way to molecular imprinting techniques at the level of single polymer chains. The majority of discrete structures obtained by self-assembly possess high symmetry, and thus low complexity: all subunits relate to their neighbours in a similar manner. Now, the spontaneous formation of complex low-symmetry assemblies produced from a single building block has been demonstrated using a systems chemistry approach. The single building block oligomerizes to form specific homomeric cyclic macromolecules that adopt a folded conformation.},

  abstract     = {Carbocations can be categorized into classical carbenium ions and non-classical carbonium ions. These intermediates are ubiquitous in reactions of both fundamental and practical relevance, finding application in the petroleum industry as well as the discovery of new drugs and materials. Conveying stereochemical information to carbocations is therefore of interest to a range of chemical fields. While previous studies targeted systems proceeding through classical ions, enantiocontrol over their non-classical counterparts has remained unprecedented. Here we show that strong and confined chiral acids catalyse enantioselective reactions via the non-classical 2-norbornyl cation. This reactive intermediate is generated from structurally different precursors by leveraging the reactivity of various functional groups to ultimately deliver the same enantioenriched product. Our work demonstrates that tailored catalysts can act as suitable hosts for simple, non-functionalized carbocations via a network of non-covalent interactions. We anticipate that the methods described herein will provide catalytic accessibility to valuable carbocation systems. In 1949, Winstein and Trifan proposed that the 2-norbornyl cation adopts a bridged, non-classical structure. Now, the generation of an asymmetric environment around the three-centre two-electron bond of such an ion has been reported, enabling highly enantioselective catalytic addition reactions to a simple, non-functionalized non-classical cation.},

Here we develop a step towards protocell-mediated nitric-oxide-induced vasodilation by constructing a new synthetic cell model based on bio-derived coacervate vesicles with high haemocompatibility and increased blood circulation times. The hybrid protocells are prepared by the spontaneous self-assembly of haemoglobin-containing erythrocyte membrane fragments on the surface of preformed polysaccharide–polynucleotide coacervate micro-droplets containing glucose oxidase. We use the sequestered enzymes to program a spatially coupled glucose oxidase/haemoglobin reaction cascade, which in the presence of glucose and hydroxyurea generates a protocell-mediated flux of nitric oxide that we exploit for in vitro and in vivo blood vessel vasodilation. Taken together, our results provide new opportunities for the development of endogenously organized cell-like entities (biocompatible micro-bots) geared specifically towards active interfacing with individual living cells and cell communities. The self-assembly of haemoglobin-containing erythrocyte membrane fragments onto the surface of preformed coacervates has been used to make hybrid synthetic cells that can initiate nitric-oxide-induced vasodilation. These synthetic cells encapsulate enzymes that generate a flux of nitric oxide, as well as exhibiting high haemocompatibility and increased blood circulation times.},

  abstract     = {Delocalized Frenkel excitons—coherently shared excitations among chromophores—are responsible for the remarkable efficiency of supramolecular light-harvesting assemblies within photosynthetic organisms. The translation of nature’s design principles to applications in optoelectronic devices has been limited by the fragility of the supramolecular structures used and the delicate nature of Frenkel excitons, particularly under mildly changing solvent conditions and elevated temperatures and upon deposition onto solid substrates. Here, we overcome those functionalization barriers through composition of stable supramolecular light-harvesting nanotubes enabled by tunable (~4.3–4.9 nm), uniform (±0.3 nm) cage-like scaffolds. High-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy, combined with scanning electron microscopy, broadband femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and near-field scanning optical microscopy revealed that excitons within the cage-like scaffolds are robust, even under extreme heat stress, and control over nanocomposite dimensions is maintained on solid substrates. Our bio-inspired nanocomposites provide a general framework for the development of next-generation organic devices made from stable supramolecular materials. Nature successfully uses supramolecular assemblies for efficient and robust solar energy harvesting; however, mimicking such material systems for applications in optoelectronic devices has been hampered by stability issues such as the fragility of the supramolecular structures used and the delicate nature of Frenkel excitons. Now, enabled by tunable cage-like scaffolds, stable supramolecular light-harvesting nanotubes have been composed that are robust even under heat stress.},

Here, we describe a high-performance recyclable photocatalytic core–shell nanofibre system that integrates a cobalt catalyst and a photosensitizer in close proximity for hydrogen production from water using visible light. The composition, microstructure and dimensions—and thereby the catalytic activity—of the nanofibres were controlled through living crystallization-driven self-assembly. In this seeded growth strategy, block copolymers with crystallizable core-forming blocks and functional coronal segments were coassembled into low-dispersity, one-dimensional architectures. Under optimized conditions, the nanofibres promote the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water with an overall quantum yield for solar energy conversion to hydrogen gas of ~4.0% (with a turnover number of &amp;gt;7,000 over 5 h, a frequency of &amp;gt;1,400 h−1 and a H2 production rate of &amp;gt;0.327 μmol h−1 with 1.34 μg of catalytic polymer (that is, &amp;gt;244,300 μmol h−1 g−1 of catalytic polymer)). Artificial systems capable of photocatalytic hydrogen production are not typically based on precisely controlled scaffolds. Now, statistical seeded crystallization of block copolymers—bearing either a pendant cobalt catalyst or a photosensitizer—from solution has been shown to yield recyclable, colloidally stable nanofibres that can be tailored to promote photocatalytic hydrogen production from water.},

  abstract     = {The versatility of carbon is revealed in its all-carbon forms (allotropes), which feature unique properties (consider the differences between diamond, graphite, graphene and fullerenes). Beyond natural sources, there are many opportunities to expand the realm of carbon chemistry through the study of new carbon forms. In this work, the synthesis of oligo-/polyynes is used to model the elusive carbyne. The chemical stabilization of oligoynes by sterically encumbered endgroups, particularly the 3,5-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)pyridyl group, is key to assemble an extended series of stable oligoynes. The final member of this series is the longest monodisperse polyyne isolated and characterized so far, featuring 24 contiguous alkyne units (48 carbons). Spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analysis show that endgroups influence the properties of oligoyne derivatives, but this effect diminishes as length increases toward the polyyne/carbyne limit. For instance, with ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, molecular symmetry clearly documents the evolution of characteristics from oligoynes to polyynes (in which endgroup effects are absent). The combined experimental data are used to refine predictions for the D∞h structure of carbyne. Synthetic oligo-/polyynes with unprecedented length are used to model the elusive carbon allotrope carbyne. Spectroscopic and physical analyses show that endgroups influence the properties of shorter derivatives, but these effects predictably diminish in longer molecules. Molecular symmetry documents the evolution of characteristics from oligoynes to polyynes and offers predictions for the D∞h structure of carbyne.},

However, developing synthetic, inanimate embodiments of a chemomechanical framework to generate non-reciprocal interactions of tunable strength and directionality has been challenging. Here we show how chemotactic signalling between microscale oil droplets of different chemistries in micellar surfactant solutions can result in predator–prey-like non-reciprocal chasing interactions. The interactions and dynamic self-organization result from the net directional, micelle-mediated transport of oil between emulsion droplets of differing composition and are powered by the free energy of mixing. We systematically elucidated chemical design rules to tune the interactions between droplets by varying the oil and surfactant chemical structure and concentration. Through the integration of experiment and simulation, we also investigated the active behaviour and dynamic reorganization of multidroplet clusters. Our findings demonstrate how chemically minimal systems can be designed with controllable, non-reciprocal chemotactic interactions to generate emergent self-organization and collective behaviours reminiscent of biological systems. Interactions that generate directed movement in response to a chemical stimulus occur in nature but have been difficult to realize in synthetic systems. Now, it has been shown that asymmetric micelle-mediated exchange of haloalkanes can be used to create tunable chasing interactions between chemically distinct microdroplets. Collective interactions lead to the formation of droplet assemblies with emergent self-organization and collective behaviours.},

By contrast, silicon–carbonyl complexes, organosilicon reagents poised to be eco-friendly alternatives for transition-metal carbonyls, have remained largely elusive. They have mostly been explored theoretically and/or through low-temperature matrix isolation studies, but their instability had typically precluded isolation under ambient conditions. Here we present the synthesis, isolation and full characterization of stable silyl-substituted silicon–carbonyl complexes, along with bonding analysis. Initial reactivity investigations showed examples of CO liberation, which could be induced either thermally or photochemically, as well as substitution and functionalization of the CO moiety. Importantly, the complexes exhibit strong Si–CO bonding, with CO→Si σ-donation and Si→CO π-backbonding, which is reminiscent of transition-metal carbonyls. This similarity between the abundant semi-metal silicon and rare transition metals may provide new opportunities for the development of silicon-based catalysis. Silyl-substituted silicon–carbonyl complexes that are stable at room temperature have been prepared by exposure of highly reactive bis(silyl)silylenes to carbon monoxide. The compounds show structural features and reactivity that are reminiscent of their ubiquitous transition-metal–carbonyl counterparts, including π-backbonding and ligand liberation as well as substitution and functionalization reactions.},

Analogous experiments in animals are challenging, however, due to substantial scattering and autofluorescence in tissue at visible (350–700 nm) and near-infrared (700–1,000 nm) wavelengths. Here, we enable real-time, non-invasive multicolour imaging experiments in animals through the design of optical contrast agents for the shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1,000–2,000 nm) region and complementary advances in imaging technologies. We developed tunable, SWIR-emissive flavylium polymethine dyes and established relationships between structure and photophysical properties for this class of bright SWIR contrast agents. In parallel, we designed an imaging system with variable near-infrared/SWIR excitation and single-channel detection, facilitating video-rate multicolour SWIR imaging for optically guided surgery and imaging of awake and moving mice with multiplexed detection. Optimized dyes matched to 980 nm and 1,064 nm lasers, combined with the clinically approved indocyanine green, enabled real-time, three-colour imaging with high temporal and spatial resolutions. Conducting high-resolution, multiplexed imaging in living mammals is challenging because of considerable scattering and autofluorescence in tissue at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Now, real-time, non-invasive multicolour imaging experiments in live animals have been achieved through the design of optical contrast agents for the shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1,000–2,000 nm) region and the introduction of excitation multiplexing with single-channel SWIR detection.},

  abstract     = {Mono- or few-layer sheets of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represent an attractive platform of two-dimensional materials that hold promise for tailor-made functionality and pores, through judicious design of the COF building blocks. But although a wide variety of layered COFs have been synthesized, cleaving their interlayer stacking to obtain COF sheets of uniform thickness has remained challenging. Here, we have partitioned the interlayer space in COFs by incorporating pseudorotaxane units into their backbones. Macrocyclic hosts based on crown ethers were embedded into either a ditopic or a tetratopic acylhydrazide building block. Reaction with a tritopic aldehyde linker led to the formation of acylhydrazone-based layered COFs in which one basal plane is composed of either one layer, in the case of the ditopic macrocyclic component, or two adjacent layers covalently held together by its tetratopic counterpart. When a viologen threading unit is introduced, the formation of a host–guest complex facilitates the self-exfoliation of the COFs into crystalline monolayers or bilayers, respectively. Layered COFs are attractive precursors for two-dimensional materials but they are difficult to cleave into mono- or few-layer sheets. Pseudorotaxane moieties have now been embedded into layered COFs to facilitate their cleavage into sheets of uniform thickness. Crown-ether macrocycles within the COF backbone bind to ionic viologen guests, leading to electrostatic repulsion between layers.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic glycoengineering with unnatural sugars provides a powerful tool to label cell membranes with chemical tags for subsequent targeted conjugation of molecular cargos via efficient chemistries. This technology has been widely explored for cancer labelling and targeting. However, as this metabolic labelling process can occur in both cancerous and normal cells, cancer-selective labelling needs to be achieved to develop cancer-targeted therapies. Unnatural sugars can be either rationally designed to enable preferential labelling of cancer cells, or specifically delivered to cancerous tissues. In this Review Article, we will discuss the progress to date in design and delivery of unnatural sugars for metabolic labelling of tumour cells and subsequent development of tumour-targeted therapy. Metabolic cell labelling for cancer immunotherapy will also be discussed. Finally, we will provide a perspective on future directions of metabolic labelling of cancer and immune cells for the development of potent, clinically translatable cancer therapies. Metabolic labelling with unnatural sugars can be used to selectively label tumours with chemical tags. These tags then enable the targeted delivery of molecular cargo including diagnostic and therapeutic agents. This Review Article discusses progress in the design and delivery of unnatural sugars for metabolic labelling of tumour cells and the subsequent development of tumour-targeted chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Peptides that contain β-amino acids display stable secondary structures, such as helices and sheets, and are often referred to as foldamers. Cyclic β2,3-amino acids (cβAAs), such as 2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (2-ACHC), are strong helix/turn inducers due to their restricted conformations. Here we report the ribosomal synthesis of foldamer peptides that contain multiple, up to ten, consecutive cβAAs via genetic code reprogramming. We also report the de novo discovery of macrocyclic cβAA-containing peptides capable of binding to a protein target. As a demonstration, potent binders with low-to-subnanomolar KD values were identified for human factor XIIa (hFXIIa) and interferon-gamma receptor 1, from a library of their 1012 members. One of the anti-hFXIIa macrocyclic peptides that exhibited a high inhibitory activity and serum stability was co-crystallized with hFXIIa. The X-ray structure revealed that it adopts an antiparallel β-sheet structure induced by a (1S,2S)-2-ACHC residue via the formation of two γ-turns. This work demonstrates the potential of this platform to explore the previously inaccessible sequence space of cβAA-containing peptides. Cyclic β-amino acids can add useful properties to peptides, such as inducing turn structures or providing resistance to proteases. To harness these properties up to ten consecutive cyclic β-amino acids have now been ribosomally incorporated via genetic code reprogramming into a foldamer peptide library that has been screened for potent binders against a protein target, human factor XIIa.},

  abstract     = {The industrial reduction of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia is an energy-intensive process that consumes a considerable proportion of the global energy supply. As a consequence, species that can bind N2 and cleave its strong N–N bond under mild conditions have been sought for decades. Until recently, the only species known to support N2 fixation and functionalization were based on a handful of metals of the s and d blocks of the periodic table. Here we present one-pot binding, cleavage and reduction of N2 to ammonium by a main-group species. The reaction—a complex multiple reduction–protonation sequence—proceeds at room temperature in a single synthetic step through the use of solid-phase reductant and acid reagents. A simple acid quench of the mixture then provides ammonium, the protonated form of ammonia present in fertilizer. The elementary reaction steps in the process are elucidated, including the crucial N–N bond cleavage process, and all of the intermediates of the reaction are isolated. The vast majority of species capable of converting dinitrogen to ammonia rely on transition metals. Now, a boron compound has been shown to mediate the one-pot binding, cleavage and reduction of N2 to ammonium salts under mild conditions through a complex cascade mechanism involving multiple reduction–protonation sequences.},

Scaling up the size of the DNA origami would enable many potential applications, which include metamaterial construction and surface-based biophysical assays. Here we demonstrate that a six-helix bundle DNA origami nanostructure in the submicrometre scale (meta-DNA) could be used as a magnified analogue of single-stranded DNA, and that two meta-DNAs that contain complementary ‘meta-base pairs’ can form double helices with programmed handedness and helical pitches. By mimicking the molecular behaviours of DNA strands and their assembly strategies, we used meta-DNA building blocks to form diverse and complex structures on the micrometre scale. Using meta-DNA building blocks, we constructed a series of DNA architectures on a submicrometre-to-micrometre scale, which include meta-multi-arm junctions, three-dimensional (3D) polyhedrons, and various 2D/3D lattices. We also demonstrated a hierarchical strand-displacement reaction on meta-DNA to transfer the dynamic features of DNA into the meta-DNA. This meta-DNA self-assembly concept may transform the microscopic world of structural DNA nanotechnology. A six-helix bundle DNA structure called meta-DNA has now been assembled and shown to possess some structural properties similar to those of single-stranded DNA. Two meta-DNAs containing complementary ‘meta-base pairs’ are shown to form double helices. Meta-DNA building blocks are also used to construct a series of DNA architectures and to perform a hierarchical strand-displacement reaction.},

To achieve this, heterogeneous water oxidation catalysis needs to be mastered and properly understood. The search continues for a catalyst that is stable at the surface of electro(photo)anodes and can efficiently perform this reaction at the desired neutral pH. Here, we show how oligomeric Ru complexes can be anchored on the surfaces of graphitic materials through CH–π interactions between the auxiliary ligands bonded to Ru and the hexagonal rings of the graphitic surfaces, providing control of their molecular coverage. These hybrid molecular materials behave as molecular electroanodes that catalyse water oxidation to dioxygen at pH 7 with high current densities. This strategy for the anchoring of molecular catalysts on graphitic surfaces can potentially be extended to other transition metals and other catalytic reactions. Efficient and stable water oxidation catalysts are important if photoelectrochemical cells are to be used to provide clean and sustainable solar fuels. A water oxidation catalyst that operates at neutral pH has now been developed that features ruthenium coordination oligomers anchored onto the surfaces of graphitic materials through CH–π interactions.},

However, in contrast to the common classes of nitride complexes (M≡N) and organic nitrenes (R–N), structurally and spectroscopically well defined ‘authentic’ metallonitrenes with a monovalent atomic nitrogen ligand remain elusive. Here we report that the photolysis of a platinum(ii) pincer azide complex enabled the crystallographic, spectroscopic, magnetic and computational characterization of a metallonitrene that is best described as a singly bonded atomic nitrogen diradical ligand bound to platinum(ii). The photoproduct exhibits selective C–H, B–H and B–C nitrogen atom insertion reactivity. Despite the subvalent metallonitrene character, mechanistic analysis for aldehyde C–H amidation shows nucleophilic reactivity of the N-diradical ligand. Ambiphilic reactivity of the metallonitrene is indicated by reactions with CO and PMe3 to form isocyanate and phosphoraneiminato platinum(ii) complexes, respectively. Transient metallonitrenes (M–N) have been proposed as key intermediates in nitrogen atom transfer reactions, but well-defined examples have remained elusive. Now, a platinum complex with an atomic nitrogen ligand, best described as a subvalent nitrogen diradical singly bonded to a platinum(ii) ion (Pt–N), has been isolated and shows ambiphilic reactivity.},

  abstract     = {Cyclic peptide natural products have served as important drug molecules, with several examples used clinically. Enzymatic or chemical macrocyclization is the key transformation for constructing these chemotypes. Methods to generate new and diverse cyclic peptide scaffolds enabling the modular and predictable synthesis of peptide libraries are desirable in drug discovery platforms. Here we identify a suite of post-translational modifying enzymes from bacteria that install single or multiple strained cyclophane macrocycles. The crosslinking occurs on three-residue motifs that include tryptophan or phenylalanine to form indole- or phenyl-bridged cyclophanes. The macrocycles display restricted rotation of the aromatic ring and induce planar chirality in the asymmetric indole bridge. The biosynthetic gene clusters originate from a broad range of bacteria derived from marine, terrestrial and human microbiomes. Three-residue cyclophane-forming enzymes define a new and significant natural product family and occupy a distinct region in sequence–function space. A series of enzymes that catalyse the formation of strained peptide cyclophanes through a stereospecific C(sp2)–C(sp3) bond have been identified. Crosslinking occurs on three-residue motifs that include tryptophan or phenylalanine to form indole- or phenyl-bridged cyclophanes.

  abstract     = {Chemical reactions that convert sp2 to sp3 hybridization have been demonstrated to be a fascinating yet challenging route to functionalize graphene. So far it has not been possible to precisely control the reaction sites nor their lateral order at the atomic/molecular scale. The application prospects have been limited for reactions that require long soaking, heating, electric pulses or probe-tip press. Here we demonstrate a spatially selective photocycloaddition reaction of a two-dimensional molecular network with defect-free basal plane of single-layer graphene. Directly visualized at the submolecular level, the cycloaddition is triggered by ultraviolet irradiation in ultrahigh vacuum, requiring no aid of the graphene Moiré pattern. The reaction involves both [2+2] and [2+4] cycloadditions, with the reaction sites aligned into a two-dimensional extended and well-ordered array, inducing a bandgap for the reacted graphene layer. This work provides a solid base for designing and engineering graphene-based optoelectronic and microelectronic devices. The controllable functionalization of graphene at the molecular level may prove useful for graphene-based electronics, but is difficult to do in a precise fashion. Now it has been shown that a photocycloaddition reaction between a hydrogen-bonded network of maleimide-derived molecules and single-layer graphene can produce a functionalized array with long-range order.},

  abstract     = {All living organisms synthesize phospholipids as the primary constituent of their cell membranes. Enzymatic synthesis of diacylphospholipids requires preexisting membrane-embedded enzymes. This limitation has led to models of early life in which the first cells used simpler types of membrane building blocks and has hampered integration of phospholipid synthesis into artificial cells. Here we demonstrate an enzyme-free synthesis of natural diacylphospholipids by transacylation in water, which is enabled by a combination of ion pairing and self-assembly between lysophospholipids and acyl donors. A variety of membrane-forming cellular phospholipids have been obtained in high yields. Membrane formation takes place in water from natural alkaline sources such as soda lakes and hydrothermal oceanic vents. When formed vesicles are transferred to more acidic solutions, electrochemical proton gradients are spontaneously established and maintained. This high-yielding non-enzymatic synthesis of natural phospholipids in water opens up new routes for lipid synthesis in artificial cells and sheds light on the origin and evolution of cellular membranes. It is unclear how phospholipid membranes formed on the early Earth, as modern cells synthesize the phospholipid constituents of their membranes enzymatically. Now, a combination of ion pairing and self-assembly has enabled transacylation of lysophospholipids with acyl donors in water, affording a variety of membrane-forming natural diacylphospholipids in high yields.},

  abstract     = {Life is an out-of-equilibrium system sustained by a continuous supply of energy. In extant biology, the generation of the primary energy currency, adenosine 5′-triphosphate and its use in the synthesis of biomolecules require enzymes. Before their emergence, alternative energy sources, perhaps assisted by simple catalysts, must have mediated the activation of carboxylates and phosphates for condensation reactions. Here, we show that the chemical energy inherent to isonitriles can be harnessed to activate nucleoside phosphates and carboxylic acids through catalysis by acid and 4,5-dicyanoimidazole under mild aqueous conditions. Simultaneous activation of carboxylates and phosphates provides multiple pathways for the generation of reactive intermediates, including mixed carboxylic acid–phosphoric acid anhydrides, for the synthesis of peptidyl–RNAs, peptides, RNA oligomers and primordial phospholipids. Our results indicate that unified prebiotic activation chemistry could have enabled the joining of building blocks in aqueous solution from a common pool and enabled the progression of a system towards higher complexity, foreshadowing today’s encapsulated peptide–nucleic acid system. Life requires a constant supply of energy, but the energy sources that drove the transition from prebiotic chemistry to biochemistry on the early Earth are unknown. Now, a potentially prebiotic chemical activating reagent has been shown to enable the synthesis, in aqueous conditions and catalysed by small molecules, of peptides, peptidyl–RNAs, RNA oligomers and primordial phospholipids.},

  abstract     = {Efforts to decipher the prebiotic roots of metabolic pathways have focused on recapitulating modern biological transformations, with metals typically serving in place of cofactors and enzymes. Here we show that the reaction of glyoxylate with pyruvate under mild aqueous conditions produces a series of α-ketoacid analogues of the reductive citric acid cycle without the need for metals or enzyme catalysts. The transformations proceed in the same sequence as the reverse Krebs cycle, resembling a protometabolic pathway, with glyoxylate acting as both the carbon source and reducing agent. Furthermore, the α-ketoacid analogues provide a natural route for the synthesis of amino acids by transamination with glycine, paralleling the extant metabolic mechanisms and obviating the need for metal-catalysed abiotic reductive aminations. This emerging sequence of prebiotic reactions could have set the stage for the advent of increasingly sophisticated pathways operating under catalytic control. Metal-catalysed prebiotic reactions have been proposed as forerunners of modern metabolism. Now, an abiotic pathway resembling the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle has been shown to proceed without metal catalysis. The reaction of glyoxylate and pyruvate produces a series of α-ketoacid tricarboxylic acid analogues, and provides a route to generate α-amino acids by transamination.},

  abstract     = {Enzymes are powerful tools for protein labelling due to their specificity and mild reaction conditions. Many protocols, however, are restricted to modifications at protein termini, rely on non-peptidic metabolites or require large recognition domains. Here we report a chemoenzymatic method, which we call lysine acylation using conjugating enzymes (LACE), to site-specifically modify folded proteins at internal lysine residues. LACE relies on a minimal genetically encoded tag (four residues) recognized by the E2 small ubiquitin-like modifier-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and peptide or protein thioesters. Together, this approach obviates the need for E1 and E3 enzymes, enabling isopeptide formation with just Ubc9 in a programmable manner. We demonstrate the utility of LACE by the site-specific attachment of biochemical probes, one-pot dual-labelling in combination with sortase, and the conjugation of wild-type ubiquitin and ISG15 to recombinant proteins. A chemoenzymatic method to site-specifically conjugate peptide and protein thioesters to folded proteins at lysine residues has been developed. The method uses a genetically encoded four-residue tag that is recognized by the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. This approach enables isopeptide formation with just Ubc9 in a programmable manner and obviates the need for E1 and E3 enzymes.},

  abstract     = {The past decade has seen unprecedented growth in the development of new chemical methods that proceed by mechanisms involving radical intermediates. This new attention has served to highlight a long-standing challenge in the field of radical chemistry — that of controlling absolute stereochemistry. This Review will examine developments using a strategy that offers enormous potential, in which attractive non-covalent interactions between a chiral catalyst and the substrate are leveraged to exert enantiocontrol. In a simplistic sense, such an approach mimics the modes of activation and control in enzyme catalysis and the realization that this can be achieved in the context of small-molecule catalysts has had sizable impact on the field of asymmetric catalysis in recent years. This strategy is now starting to quickly gather pace as a powerful approach for control of enantioselectivity in radical reactions and we hope that this focused survey of progress so far will inspire future developments in the area. The past decade has seen unprecedented growth in the development of chemical methods that proceed by mechanisms involving radical intermediates, but controlling absolute stereochemistry has been a longstanding challenge in this area.

With a minimalistic β-domain architecture, this cyanobacterial enzyme is able to construct four rings in cytotoxic meroterpenoids with a sterol-like topology. The structures with bound substrate, product, and inhibitor provide detailed snapshots of a cyclization mechanism largely governed by residues located in a noncanonical enzyme region. Our results complement the few known class II cyclase crystal structures, while also indicating that archaic monodomain cyclases might have already catalyzed complex reaction cascades. Class II terpene cyclases convert simple linear substrates into complex polycyclic compounds, which typically requires multiple protein domains. Now, a single-domain class II cyclase, a cyanobacterial merosterolic acid synthase, has been identified and characterized. High-resolution X-ray crystal structures provide detailed insights into how a minimalistic enzyme accomplishes this complex cyclization process.},

  abstract     = {The aqueous chemistry of uranium is dominated by the linear uranyl cation [UO2]2+, yet the isoelectronic nitrogen-based analogue of this ubiquitous cation, molecular [UN2], has so far only been observed in an argon matrix. Here, we present three different complexes of [UN2] obtained by the reaction of the uranium pentahalides UCl5 or UBr5 with anhydrous liquid ammonia. The [UN2] moieties are linear, with the U atoms coordinated by five additional ligands (ammonia, chloride or bromide), resulting in a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination sphere that is also commonly adopted by the uranyl cation [UO2(L)5]2+ (L, ligand). In all three cases, the nitrido ligands are further coordinated through their lone pairs by the Lewis-acidic ligands [U(NH3)8]4+ to form almost linear, trinuclear complex cations. Those were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopy, 14N/15N isotope studies and quantum chemical calculations, which support the presence of two U≡N triple bonds within the [UN2] moieties. Three crystalline complexes comprising a linear [UN2] moiety that is isoelectronic to the ubiquitous uranyl cation [UO2]2+ have been prepared by reaction of UCl5 or UBr5 with liquid ammonia. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the bonding in the [UN2] moieties is best described with two U≡N triple bonds.},

  abstract     = {Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) stimulates angiogenesis in human endothelial cells, and increasing its expression is a potential treatment for heart failure. Here, we report the design of a small molecule (TGP-377) that specifically and potently enhances VEGFA expression by the targeting of a non-coding microRNA that regulates its expression. A selection-based screen, named two-dimensional combinatorial screening, revealed preferences in small-molecule chemotypes that bind RNA and preferences in the RNA motifs that bind small molecules. The screening program increased the dataset of known RNA motif–small molecule binding partners by 20-fold. Analysis of this dataset against the RNA-mediated pathways that regulate VEGFA defined that the microRNA-377 precursor, which represses Vegfa messenger RNA translation, is druggable in a selective manner. We designed TGP-377 to potently and specifically upregulate VEGFA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These studies illustrate the power of two-dimensional combinatorial screening to define molecular recognition events between ‘undruggable’ biomolecules and small molecules, and the ability of sequence-based design to deliver efficacious structure-specific compounds. A selection-based screen has now revealed preferences in small-molecule chemotypes that bind RNA as well as preferences in the RNA motifs that bind small molecules. Analysis of these data enabled the design of a small molecule that selectively binds a non-coding microRNA and upregulates expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A.},

Due to the computational cost of quantum chemistry methods and the immense number of theoretically possible stable compounds, comprehensive in silico screening remains prohibitive. To overcome this challenge, we combine atom-in-molecule-based fragments, dubbed ‘amons’ (A), with active learning in transferable quantum machine learning (ML) models. The efficiency, accuracy, scalability and transferability of the resulting AML models is demonstrated for important molecular quantum properties such as energies, forces, atomic charges, NMR shifts and polarizabilities and for systems including organic molecules, 2D materials, water clusters, Watson–Crick DNA base pairs and even ubiquitin. Conceptually, the AML approach extends Mendeleev’s table to account effectively for chemical environments, which allows the systematic reconstruction of many chemistries from local building blocks. Quantum machine learning with improved data efficiency and transferability has been achieved using on-the-fly selection of query-dependent training molecules, which are drawn from a ‘dictionary’ of atom-in-molecule-based fragments. The benefits of the resulting models have been demonstrated for important molecular properties and for systems including organic molecules, 2D materials, water clusters, DNA base pairs and ubiquitin.},

Here we demonstrate that the knotting and unknotting of a molecular strand can be used to control, and even invert, the handedness of a helical organization within a liquid crystal. An oligodentate tris(2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide) strand with six point-chiral centres folds into an overhand knot of single handedness upon coordination to lanthanide ions, both in isotropic solutions and in liquid crystals. In achiral liquid crystals, dopant knotted and unknotted strands induce supramolecular helical organizations of opposite handedness, with dynamic switching achievable through in situ knotting and unknotting events. Tying the molecular knot transmits information regarding asymmetry across length scales, from Euclidean point chirality (constitutional chirality) via molecular entanglement (conformation) to liquid-crystal (centimetre-scale) chirality. The magnitude of the effect induced by the tying of the molecular knots is similar to that famously used to rotate a glass rod on the surface of a liquid crystal by synthetic molecular motors. Reversible nanoscale knotting and unknotting of a molecular strand can be used to control the handedness of helical organizations at macroscopic length scales. Dopant knotted and unknotted strands induce supramolecular helical structures of opposite handedness in achiral liquid crystals, and the left- and right-handed forms can be switched in situ.},

  abstract     = {CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein linked to various biological processes reliant on epigenetic plasticity, which include development, inflammation, immune responses, wound healing and cancer progression. Although it is often referred to as a cell surface marker, the functional regulatory roles of CD44 remain elusive. Here we report the discovery that CD44 mediates the endocytosis of iron-bound hyaluronates in tumorigenic cell lines, primary cancer cells and tumours. This glycan-mediated iron endocytosis mechanism is enhanced during epithelial–mesenchymal transitions, in which iron operates as a metal catalyst to demethylate repressive histone marks that govern the expression of mesenchymal genes. CD44 itself is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear iron through a positive feedback loop, which is in contrast to the negative regulation of the transferrin receptor by excess iron. Finally, we show that epigenetic plasticity can be altered by interfering with iron homeostasis using small molecules. This study reveals an alternative iron-uptake mechanism that prevails in the mesenchymal state of cells, which illuminates a central role of iron as a rate-limiting regulator of epigenetic plasticity. CD44 is a cell-surface adhesion receptor associated with many biological processes that rely on cellular plasticity. Now, CD44 has been shown to mediate endocytosis of iron-bound hyaluronates. Furthermore, iron catalyses the demethylation of repressive histone marks, thereby unlocking the expression of genes regulating cellular plasticity.},

However, because of the scale and highly dynamic nature of nuclei, the formation and early growth of nuclei are very difficult to observe. Here, we have employed single-walled carbon nanotubes as test tubes, and an ‘atomic injector’ coupled with aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, to enable in situ imaging of the initial steps of nucleation at the atomic scale. With three different metals we observed three main processes prior to heterogeneous nucleation: formation of crystal nuclei directly from an atomic seed (Fe), from a pre-existing amorphous nanocluster (Au) or by coalescence of two separate amorphous sub-nanometre clusters (Re). We demonstrate the roles of the amorphous precursors and the existence of an energy barrier before nuclei formation. In all three cases, crystal nucleus formation occurred through a two-step nucleation mechanism. Crystal nucleation processes are difficult to probe experimentally because of the spatial and temporal scales involved. Now, the heterogeneous nucleation of three different metals has been observed by electron microscopy with atomic resolution—using single-walled carbon nanotube as test tubes—and, in each case, shown to adopt a two-step nucleation mechanism involving a metastable amorphous precursor.},

We combine time-resolved in situ scanning probe microscopy to monitor the crystal growth processes with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We show that crystals grow non-classically, predominantly by incorporation of centrosymmetric dimers. The growth rate of crystal layers exhibits a quadratic dependence on the solute concentration, characteristic of the second-order kinetics of the incorporation of dimers, which exist in equilibrium with a majority of monomers. We show that growth by dimers is preferred due to overwhelming accumulation of adsorbed dimers on the crystal surface, where it is complemented by dimerization and expedites dimer incorporation into growth sites. Crystal symmetry is notoriously uncorrelated to the symmetry of the constituent molecules that make up a crystal.

However, toxicity linked to off-target reactivity can be minimized by using latent electrophiles that only become activated towards covalent bond formation on binding a specific protein. Here we study sulfuramidimidoyl fluorides, a class of weak electrophiles that undergo sulfur(vi) fluoride exchange chemistry. We show that equilibrium binding of a sulfuramidimidoyl fluoride to a protein can allow nucleophilic attack by a specific amino acid side chain, which leads to conjugate formation. We incubated small molecules, each bearing a sulfuramidimidoyl fluoride electrophile, with human cell lysate, and the protein conjugates formed were identified by affinity chromatography–mass spectrometry. This inverse drug discovery approach identified a compound that covalently binds to and irreversibly inhibits the activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, an important anticancer target in living cells. Latent functional groups—typically unreactive unless activated by protein binding—can provide additional selectivity to covalent drugs. Now, compounds containing the weakly electrophilic sulfuramidimidoyl fluoride group, capable of undergoing sulfur(vi) fluoride exchange, have been used to identify reactive proteins in human cell lysate.

Although this approach is commonly employed for the synthesis of oxetanes and cyclobutanes, the synthesis of azetidines via intermolecular aza Paternò–Büchi reactions remains highly underdeveloped. Here we report a visible-light-mediated intermolecular aza Paternò–Büchi reaction that utilizes the unique triplet state reactivity of oximes, specifically 2-isoxazoline-3-carboxylates. The reactivity of this class of oximes can be harnessed via the triplet energy transfer from a commercially available iridium photocatalyst and allows for [2+2] cycloaddition with a wide range of alkenes. This approach is characterized by its operational simplicity, mild conditions and broad scope, and allows for the synthesis of highly functionalized azetidines from readily available precursors. Importantly, the accessible azetidine products can be readily converted into free, unprotected azetidines, which represents a new approach to access these highly desirable synthetic targets. Although azetidines represent highly desirable building blocks in drug discovery, methods for their efficient and straightforward synthesis remain underdeveloped. Now, it has been shown that highly functionalized azetidines can be prepared via an intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction between cyclic oximes and alkenes, in a process enabled by a visible-light-mediated triplet energy transfer.},

  abstract     = {The electronic Schrödinger equation can only be solved analytically for the hydrogen atom, and the numerically exact full configuration-interaction method is exponentially expensive in the number of electrons. Quantum Monte Carlo methods are a possible way out: they scale well for large molecules, they can be parallelized and their accuracy has, as yet, been only limited by the flexibility of the wavefunction ansatz used. Here we propose PauliNet, a deep-learning wavefunction ansatz that achieves nearly exact solutions of the electronic Schrödinger equation for molecules with up to 30 electrons. PauliNet has a multireference Hartree–Fock solution built in as a baseline, incorporates the physics of valid wavefunctions and is trained using variational quantum Monte Carlo. PauliNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art variational ansatzes for atoms, diatomic molecules and a strongly correlated linear H10, and matches the accuracy of highly specialized quantum chemistry methods on the transition-state energy of cyclobutadiene, while being computationally efficient. High-accuracy quantum chemistry methods struggle with a combinatorial explosion of Slater determinants in larger molecular systems, but now a method has been developed that learns electronic wavefunctions with deep neural networks and reaches high accuracy with only a few determinants. The method is applicable to realistic chemical processes such as the automerization of cyclobutadiene.},

  abstract     = {Fusions of fatty acids and peptides expand the structural diversity of natural products; however, polyketide/ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (PK/RiPPs) hybrid lipopeptides are relatively rare. Here we report a family of PK/RiPPs called goadvionins, which inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, and an acyltransferase, GdvG, which catalyses the condensation of the PK and RiPP moieties. Goadvionin comprises a trimethylammonio 32-carbon acyl chain and an eight-residue RiPP with an avionin structure. The positions of six hydroxyl groups and one double bond in the very-long acyl chain were determined by radical-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry, which collides radical ion species to generate C–C bond cleavage fragments. GdvG belongs to the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily. Unlike conventional acyltransferases, GdvG transfers a very long acyl chain that is tethered to an acyl carrier protein to the N-terminal amino group of the RiPP moiety. gdvG homologues flanked by PK/fatty acid and RiPP biosynthesis genes are widely distributed in microbial species, suggesting that acyltransferase-catalysed condensation of PKs and RiPPs is a general strategy in biosynthesis of similar lipopeptides. The biosynthesis of goadvionins—hybrid lipopeptide antibiotics—is not fully understood. An unusual acyltransferase, GdvG, has now been identified and shown to catalyse a condensation reaction between an acyl-carrier-protein-tethered very-long-chain fatty acid and an eight-residue ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide. The position of functional groups in the very-long acyl chain have been determined by tandem mass spectrometry.},

Among various synthetic strategies towards their synthesis, intermolecular higher-order cycloaddition provides great potential to build complex medium-sized rings from simple building blocks. Unfortunately, such transformations are often plagued with competitive reaction pathways and low levels of site- and stereoselectivity. Herein, we report catalyst-controlled divergent access to three classes of medium-sized bicyclic compounds in high efficiency and stereoselectivity, by palladium-catalysed cycloadditions of tropones with γ-methylidene-δ-valerolactones. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations disclosed that the divergent reactions stem from the different reaction profiles of the diastereomeric intermediates. While one undergoes either O- or C-allylation to provide [5.5.0] or [4.4.1] bicyclic compounds, the unique conformation of the other diastereomer allows an unconventional alkene isomerization to deliver bridgehead alkene-containing bicyclo[4.4.1] compounds. The conversion of these products to diverse complex polycyclic scaffolds has also been demonstrated. Using readily accessible tropones and γ-methylidene-δ-valerolactones, the divergent synthesis of three classes of challenging [5.5.0] or [4.4.1] bicyclic systems has been achieved—with high efficiency and stereoselectivity—through Pd-catalysed higher-order cycloaddition.

  abstract     = {Simultaneous binding of molecules by multiple binding partners is known to strongly reduce the apparent dissociation constant of the corresponding molecular complexes, and can be used to achieve strong, non-covalent molecular interactions. Based on this principle, efficient binding of proteins to DNA nanostructures has been achieved previously by placing several aptamers in close proximity to each other onto DNA scaffolds. Here, we develop an approach for exploring design parameters, such as the geometric arrangement or the nanomechanical properties of the binding sites, that use two-dimensional DNA origami-based nanocavities that bear aptamers with known mechanical properties at defined distances and orientations. The origami structures are labelled with barcodes, which enables large numbers of binding cavities to be investigated in parallel and under identical conditions, and facilitates a direct and reliable quantitative comparison of their binding yields. We demonstrate that binding geometry and mechanical properties have a dramatic effect on origami-based multivalent binding sites, and that optimization of linker spacings and flexibilities can improve the effective binding strength of the sites substantially. Multivalent binding is a common strategy to enhance the interactions between weak binding partners. Now, following this principle, DNA origami scaffolds have been used to arrange DNA aptamers into specific geometries and to optimize linker spacings and flexibilities, which results in artificial binding sites with very high affinities for their corresponding ligands.},

  abstract     = {The solid state is typically not well suited to sustaining fast molecular motion, but in recent years a variety of molecular machines, switches and rotors have been successfully engineered within porous crystals and on surfaces. Here we show a fast-rotating molecular rotor within the bicyclopentane–dicarboxylate struts of a zinc-based metal–organic framework—the carboxylate groups anchored to the metal clusters act as an axle while the bicyclic unit is free to rotate. The three-fold bipyramidal symmetry of the rotator conflicts with the four-fold symmetry of the struts within the cubic crystal cell of the zinc metal–organic framework. This frustrates the formation of stable conformations, allowing for the continuous, unidirectional, hyperfast rotation of the bicyclic units with an energy barrier of 6.2 cal mol−1 and a high frequency persistent for several turns even at very low temperatures (1010 Hz below 2 K). Using zirconium instead of zinc led to a different metal cluster–carboxylate coordination arrangement in the resulting metal–organic framework, and much slower rotation of the bicyclic units. Molecular rotors have been engineered within the bicyclopentane–dicarboxylate struts of a metal–organic framework—the bicyclic unit is the rotator and the carboxylate groups serve as the stator. In a zinc-based metal–organic framework, the crossed conformation of the strut–metal nodes enables fast rotation of the bicyclic moiety, but in the corresponding zirconium metal–organic framework a change in the conformation results in much slower rotation.},

Achieving this goal typically requires reversing the absolute configuration of the chiral component employed in the reaction system that is being used. The task becomes challenging when the natural source of the chiral component is not available in both configurations. Herein, we report a time-dependent enantiodivergent synthesis, in which an Ir-catalysed allylic substitution reaction uses one catalyst sequentially to promote two kinetic resolution reactions, enabling the synthesis of both enantiomers of the product using the same enantiomer of a chiral catalyst. The appropriate permutation of individual reaction rates is essential for the isolation of the chiral products in opposite configurations with high enantiopurity when quenched at different reaction times. This work provides an alternative solution for the preparation of both enantiomers of chiral molecules. Access to both enantiomers of a chiral target compound typically relies on reversing the absolute configuration of the chiral component in the reaction system that is used to make them. A time-dependent enantiodivergent synthesis is reported in which the same enantiomer of a chiral catalyst can give both enantiomers of the product, depending on the reaction time.},

Herein, we report a G4-specific fluorescent probe (SiR-PyPDS) that enables single-molecule and real-time detection of individual G4 structures in living cells. Live-cell single-molecule fluorescence imaging of G4s was carried out under conditions that use low concentrations of SiR-PyPDS (20 nM) to provide informative measurements representative of the population of G4s in living cells, without globally perturbing G4 formation and dynamics. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging and time-dependent chemical trapping of unfolded G4s in living cells reveal that G4s fluctuate between folded and unfolded states. We also demonstrate that G4 formation in live cells is cell-cycle-dependent and disrupted by chemical inhibition of transcription and replication. Our observations provide robust evidence in support of dynamic G4 formation in living cells. Visualization of endogenous G-quadruplexes (G4s) in living cells by fluorescence microscopy has been hampered by the high concentrations of G4-binding probes required, which can artificially induce additional G4 formation.

In polymer mechanochemistry, a mechanical force, transduced along polymer chains, is used to activate covalent bonds in mechanosensitive molecules (mechanophores). Cleavage of a C–C bond often follows a homolytic pathway, but some mechanophores have also been designed that react in a concerted or, more rarely, a heterolytic manner. Here, using 1H- and 19F-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with deuterium labelling, we show that the dissociation of a mechanophore built around an N-heterocyclic carbene precursor proceeds with the rupture of a C–C bond through concomitant heterolytic, concerted and homolytic pathways. The distribution of products probably arises from a post-transition-state bifurcation in the reaction pathway, and their relative proportion is dictated by the polarization of the scissile C–C bond. Chemical reactions usually proceed through either a radical, concerted or ionic mechanism; transformations in which all three mechanisms occur are rare.

Despite the numerous new IDPs that have been identified, progress towards rational engineering in cells has been limited. To address this limitation, we systematically scanned the sequence space of native IDPs and designed artificial IDPs (A-IDPs) with different molecular weights and aromatic content, which exhibit variable condensate saturation concentrations and temperature cloud points in vitro and in cells. We created A-IDP puncta using these simple principles, which are capable of sequestering an enzyme and whose catalytic efficiency can be manipulated by the molecular weight of the A-IDP. These results provide a robust engineered platform for creating puncta with new, phase-separation-mediated control of biological function in living cells. Artificial intrinsically disordered proteins (A-IDPs) have now been shown to form exclusionary, intracellular droplets that can be designed using simple principles that are based on the aromatic/aliphatic ratio and molecular weight. Droplets that sequester an enzyme and modulate enzyme efficiency on the basis of the molecular weight of the A-IDPs were also engineered using A-IDPs as a minimal condensate scaffold.},

Audible sound-induced liquid vibrations control the dissolution of atmospheric gases (such as O2 and CO2) in water to generate spatiotemporal chemical patterns in the bulk of the fluid, segregating the solution into spatiotemporal domains having different redox properties or pH values. It further helps us in the organization of transiently formed supramolecular aggregates in a predictable spatiotemporal manner. Patterns formed by artificial out-of-equilibrium chemical oscillating networks (such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction) are difficult to control with any precision. Now, it has been shown that low-intensity audible sound can be used to generate spatiotemporal patterns with a programmable distribution of redox- and pH-responsive chemical systems and supramolecular assemblies in solution.},

  abstract     = {In contrast to the well-established transition-metal-mediated activation of white phosphorus (P4), the metal-free direct functionalization of P4 has remained rare. The conversion of P4 into a reactive zero-valent diphosphorus compound (P2) has proven challenging to carry out without relying on metal reactivity. Herein, we describe the facile degradation of P4 mediated by two divalent silicon atoms in a bis(silylene) scaffold, resulting in a silylene-stabilized zero-valent P2 complex. The presence of two lone pairs of electrons on each P atom in the silylene-stabilized P2 complex enables a rich reactivity towards small molecules; reaction of the P2 species with CO2, water or a borane leads to the formation of P–C, P–H or P–B bonds, respectively. Notably, the P2 complex also serves as a single phosphorus anion (P−) transfer reagent towards metal carbonyls and a chlorogermylene compound, leading to the synthetically valuable phosphaketenide (PCO−) ligand and a phosphinidene germylene complex, respectively. White phosphorus (P4) is very reactive but is relatively difficult to activate without relying on transition metals. Now, it has been shown that the degradation of P4 can be mediated by two divalent silicon atoms in a bis(silylene) scaffold to give a diphosphorus complex that can be further functionalized and also act as a P− transfer agent.},

  abstract     = {Photoinduced isomerization reactions lie at the heart of many chemical processes in nature. The mechanisms of such reactions are determined by a delicate interplay of coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics occurring on the femtosecond scale, followed by the slower redistribution of energy into different vibrational degrees of freedom. Here we apply time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with a seeded extreme ultraviolet free-electron laser to trace the ultrafast ring opening of gas-phase thiophenone molecules following ultraviolet photoexcitation. When combined with ab initio electronic structure and molecular dynamics calculations of the excited- and ground-state molecules, the results provide insights into both the electronic and nuclear dynamics of this fundamental class of reactions. The initial ring opening and non-adiabatic coupling to the electronic ground state are shown to be driven by ballistic S–C bond extension and to be complete within 350 fs. Theory and experiment also enable visualization of the rich ground-state dynamics that involve the formation of, and interconversion between, ring-opened isomers and the cyclic structure, as well as fragmentation over much longer timescales. Photoinduced isomerization reactions, including ring-opening reactions, lie at the heart of many chemical processes in nature. The pathway and dynamics of the ring opening of a model heterocycle have now been investigated by femtosecond photoelectron spectroscopy combined with ab initio theory, enabling the visualization of rich dynamics in both the ground and excited electronic states.},

Herein we developed a general host–guest strategy to fabricate various metal single-atom catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon (M1/CN, M = Pt, Ir, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni, Mn). The iridium variant Ir1/CN electrocatalyses the formic acid oxidation reaction with a mass activity of 12.9 $${{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}$$ whereas an Ir/C nanoparticle catalyst is almost inert (~4.8 × 10−3 $${{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}$$). The activity of Ir1/CN is also 16 and 19 times greater than those of Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively. Furthermore, Ir1/CN displays high tolerance to CO poisoning. First-principle density functional theory reveals that the properties of Ir1/CN stem from the spatial isolation of iridium sites and from the modified electronic structure of iridium with respect to a conventional nanoparticle catalyst. Single-atom catalysts maximize metal atom efficiency and exhibit properties that can be considerably different to their nanoparticle equivalent. Now a general host–guest strategy to make various single-atom catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon has been developed; the iridium variant electrocatalyses the formic acid oxidation reaction with high mass activity and displays high tolerance to CO poisoning.},

Chemical backbones of such polyketides are produced by minimal PKS systems that consist of a malonyl transacylase, an acyl carrier protein and an α/β heterodimeric ketosynthase. Here, we present X-ray structures of all ternary complexes that constitute the minimal PKS system for anthraquinone biosynthesis in Photorhabdus luminescens. In addition, we characterize this invariable core using molecular simulations, mutagenesis experiments and functional assays. We show that malonylation of the acyl carrier protein is accompanied by major structural rearrangements in the transacylase. Principles of an ongoing chain elongation are derived from the ternary complex with a hexaketide covalently linking the heterodimeric ketosynthase with the acyl carrier protein. Our results for the minimal PKS system provide mechanistic understanding of PKSs and a fundamental basis for engineering PKS pathways for future applications. The invariable core of a type II polyketide synthase has been characterized using X-ray crystallography, simulations, mutagenesis experiments and functional assays. The characterization of the ternary acyl carrier protein complexes provides a mechanistic understanding of the reactivity and could inform future engineering of this complex biosynthetic machinery.},

  abstract     = {Chiral nitriles and their derivatives are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. Enantioselective alkene hydrocyanation represents a convenient and efficient approach for synthesizing these molecules. However, a generally applicable method featuring a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance remains elusive. Here, we address this long-standing synthetic problem using dual electrocatalysis. Using this strategy, we leverage electrochemistry to seamlessly combine two canonical radical reactions—cobalt-mediated hydrogen-atom transfer and copper-promoted radical cyanation—to accomplish highly enantioselective hydrocyanation without the need for stoichiometric oxidants. We also harness electrochemistry’s unique feature of precise potential control to optimize the chemoselectivity of challenging substrates. Computational analysis uncovers the origin of enantio-induction, for which the chiral catalyst imparts a combination of attractive and repulsive non-covalent interactions to direct the enantio-determining C–CN bond formation. This work demonstrates the power of electrochemistry in accessing new chemical space and providing solutions to pertinent challenges in synthetic chemistry. A general method for the enantioselective hydrocyanation of alkenes has been a long-standing synthetic challenge. Now, using a dual electrocatalytic approach that combines two synergistic redox catalytic cycles, a wide variety of chiral nitriles can be synthesized from conjugated alkenes in high enantioselectivity.},

  abstract     = {Living systems carry out the reduction of N2 to ammonia (NH3) through a series of protonation and electron transfer steps under ambient conditions using the enzyme nitrogenase. In the chemical industry, the Haber–Bosch process hydrogenates N2 but requires high temperatures and pressures. Both processes rely on iron-based catalysts, but molecular iron complexes that promote the formation of NH3 on addition of H2 to N2 have remained difficult to devise. Here, we isolate the tri(iron)bis(nitrido) complex [(Cp′Fe)3(μ3-N)2] (in which Cp′ = η5-1,2,4-(Me3C)3C5H2), which is prepared by reduction of [Cp′Fe(μ-I)]2 under an N2 atmosphere and comprises three iron centres bridged by two μ3-nitrido ligands. In solution, this complex reacts with H2 at ambient temperature (22 °C) and low pressure (1 or 4 bar) to form NH3. In the solid state, it is converted into the tri(iron)bis(imido) species, [(Cp′Fe)3(μ3-NH)2], by addition of H2 (10 bar) through an unusual solid–gas, single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. In solution, [(Cp′Fe)3(μ3-NH)2] further reacts with H2 or H+ to form NH3. The reduction of N2 to NH3 is mediated in living systems by the enzyme nitrogenase and in the chemical industry by the Haber–Bosch process; both systems rely on iron-based catalysis. Now, a molecular tri(iron)bis(nitrido) complex, prepared by reduction of a bis(iron)bis(iodo) precursor under an N2 atmosphere, has been isolated and shown to promote the formation of NH3 from H2.},

  abstract     = {Various pathogenic bacteria use post-translational modifications to manipulate the central components of host cell functions. Many of the enzymes released by these bacteria belong to the large Fic family, which modify targets with nucleotide monophosphates. The lack of a generic method for identifying the cellular targets of Fic family enzymes hinders investigation of their role and the effect of the post-translational modification. Here, we establish an approach that uses reactive co-substrate-linked enzymes for proteome profiling. We combine synthetic thiol-reactive nucleotide derivatives with recombinantly produced Fic enzymes containing strategically placed cysteines in their active sites to yield reactive binary probes for covalent substrate capture. The binary complexes capture their targets from cell lysates and permit subsequent identification. Furthermore, we determined the structures of low-affinity ternary enzyme–nucleotide–substrate complexes by applying a covalent-linking strategy. This approach thus allows target identification of the Fic enzymes from both bacteria and eukarya. Many bacterial pathogens release effector enzymes belonging to the large Fic family, which modify host targets with nucleotide monophosphates. Now, recombinantly produced Fic enzymes have been equipped with synthetic thiol-reactive nucleotide derivatives to make covalent binary probes. The reaction of modified Fic enzymes with their targets permits covalent substrate capture and the structural determination of low-affinity ternary enzyme–nucleotide–substrate complexes.},

A long-standing challenge in C–H activation is the inability to distinguish electronically and sterically similar C–H bonds. Although numerous synergistic combinations of transition-metal complexes and chelating directing groups have been utilized to distinguish C–H bonds, undirected regioselective C–H functionalization strategies remain elusive. Here we report a regioselective C–H activation/amination reaction of various unsymmetrical dialkyl-substituted alkenes. The regioselectivity of C–H activation is correlated to the electronic properties of allylic C–H bonds indicated by the corresponding 1JCH coupling constants. A linear relationship between the difference in the 1JCH coupling constants of the two competing allylic C–H bonds (Δ1JCH) and the C–H activation barriers (ΔΔG‡) has also been determined. Site-selective functionalization of nearly identical C–H bonds has been a long-standing challenge. Now, a regioselective C–H amination has been achieved by [CpxIr(iii)] catalysis, which senses subtle electronic differences of allylic C–H bonds induced by remote electron-withdrawing groups. A linear correlation between Δ1JCH and ΔΔG‡ is found, leading to predictable regioselectivities.},

  abstract     = {The use of nitrogen fertilizers has been estimated to have supported 27% of the world’s population over the past century. Urea (CO(NH2)2) is conventionally synthesized through two consecutive industrial processes, N2 + H2 → NH3 followed by NH3 + CO2 → urea. Both reactions operate under harsh conditions and consume more than 2% of the world’s energy. Urea synthesis consumes approximately 80% of the NH3 produced globally. Here we directly coupled N2 and CO2 in H2O to produce urea under ambient conditions. The process was carried out using an electrocatalyst consisting of PdCu alloy nanoparticles on TiO2 nanosheets. This coupling reaction occurs through the formation of C–N bonds via the thermodynamically spontaneous reaction between *N=N* and CO. Products were identified and quantified using isotope labelling and the mechanism investigated using isotope-labelled operando synchrotron-radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A high rate of urea formation of 3.36 mmol g–1 h–1 and corresponding Faradic efficiency of 8.92% were measured at –0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Conventionally, urea is synthesized via two consecutive processes, N2 + H2 → NH3 followed by NH3 + CO2.

  abstract     = {α-Synuclein (α-Syn) aggregation and amyloid formation is directly linked with Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis. However, the early events involved in this process remain unclear. Here, using the in vitro reconstitution and cellular model, we show that liquid–liquid phase separation of α-Syn precedes its aggregation. In particular, in vitro generated α-Syn liquid-like droplets eventually undergo a liquid-to-solid transition and form an amyloid hydrogel that contains oligomers and fibrillar species. Factors known to aggravate α-Syn aggregation, such as low pH, phosphomimetic substitution and familial Parkinson’s disease mutations, also promote α-Syn liquid–liquid phase separation and its subsequent maturation. We further demonstrate α-Syn liquid-droplet formation in cells. These cellular α-Syn droplets eventually transform into perinuclear aggresomes, the process regulated by microtubules. This work provides detailed insights into the phase-separation behaviour of natively unstructured α-Syn and its conversion to a disease-associated aggregated state, which is highly relevant in Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis. The mechanism of nucleation for α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregation and amyloid formation in Parkinson’s disease is unclear. Now, α-Syn has been shown to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation and a liquid-to-solid-like transition leading to amyloid fibril formation. This raises the possibility that liquid–liquid phase separation is a key pathogenic mechanism behind α-Syn aggregation in Parkinson’s disease.},

  abstract     = {Asymmetric, radical C–H functionalizations are rare but powerful tools for solving modern synthetic challenges. Specifically, the enantio- and regioselective C–H amination of alcohols to access medicinally valuable chiral β-amino alcohols remains elusive. To solve this challenge, a radical relay chaperone strategy was designed, wherein an alcohol was transiently converted to an imidate radical that underwent intramolecular H-atom transfer (HAT). This regioselective HAT was also rendered enantioselective by harnessing energy transfer catalysis to mediate selective radical generation and interception by a chiral copper catalyst. The successful development of this multi-catalytic, asymmetric, radical C–H amination enabled broad access to chiral β-amino alcohols from a variety of alcohols containing alkyl, allyl, benzyl and propargyl C–H bonds. Mechanistic experiments revealed that triplet energy sensitization of a Cu-bound radical precursor facilitates catalyst-mediated HAT stereoselectivity, enabling the synthesis of several important classes of chiral β-amines by enantioselective, radical C–H amination. The synthesis of chiral amino alcohols from simple alcohol starting materials can be achieved through a catalytic, asymmetric radical relay. Multiple catalysts work in concert to harness a H-atom transfer mechanism to enable enantio- and regioselective C–H amination by transient N-centred radicals.},

  abstract     = {The kagome lattice, composed of a planar array of corner-sharing triangles, is one of the most geometrically frustrated lattices. The realization of a spin S = 1/2 kagome lattice antiferromagnet is of particular interest because it may host an exotic form of matter, a quantum spin liquid state, which shows long-range entanglement and no magnetic ordering down to 0 K. A few S = 1/2 kagome lattice antiferromagnets exist, typically based on Cu2+, d9 compounds, though they feature structural imperfections. Herein, we present the synthesis of (CH3NH3)2NaTi3F12, which comprises an S = 1/2 kagome layer that exhibits only one crystallographically distinct Ti3+, d1 site, and one type of bridging fluoride. A static positional disorder is proposed for the interlayer CH3NH3+. No structural phase transitions were observed from 1.8 K to 523 K. Despite its spin-freezing behaviour, other features—including its negative Curie–Weiss temperature and a lack of long-range ordering—imply that this compound is a highly frustrated magnet with unusual magnetic phase behaviours. The highly frustrated spin-1/2 kagome lattice antiferromagnet, predicted to exhibit unconventional magnetic behaviours, has remained difficult to synthesize without structural imperfections. Now, a d1-titanium fluoride kagome lattice antiferromagnet has been prepared in which there is only one crystallographically distinct Ti3+ site and one type of bridging fluoride, and it is shown to be a frustrated magnet with unusual magnetic properties.},

However, RTs have proven challenging to discover and engineer, in particular for the more divergent XNA chemistries. Here we describe a general strategy for the directed evolution of RT function for any template chemistry called compartmentalized bead labelling and demonstrate it by the directed evolution of efficient RTs for 2′-O-methyl RNA and hexitol nucleic acids and the discovery of RTs for the orphan XNA chemistries d-altritol nucleic acid and 2′-methoxyethyl RNA, for which previously no RTs existed. Finally, we describe the engineering of XNA RTs with active exonucleolytic proofreading as well as the directed evolution of RNA RTs with very high complementary DNA synthesis fidelities, even in the absence of proofreading. Engineering reverse transcriptases for modified or unnatural nucleic acids is challenging, but now a versatile method has been developed that enables the discovery of efficient reverse transcriptases. The method works with a wide range of template structures, including xeno-nucleic acids and can also be used to produce high-fidelity reverse transcriptases for RNA.},

An important target is the tuning of a material’s exciton binding energy—the energy binding an electron–hole pair through the electrostatic Coulomb force—independent of its electronic band gap. Here, we report on the doping of a family of two-dimensional hybrid perovskites, in which inorganic lead halide sheets alternate with naphthalene-based organic layers, with tetrachloro-1,2-benzoquinone (TCBQ). For four out of seven n = 1 perovskites, the incorporation of the electron-accepting TCBQ dopant into the organic sublattice containing the electron-donating naphthalene species enabled the tuning of the materials’ 1s exciton binding energy. The naphthalene–TCBQ electron donor–acceptor interactions increased the electrostatic screening of the exciton, in turn lowering its binding energy relative to the undoped perovskite—by almost 50% in one system. Structural and optical characterization showed that the inorganic lattice is not significantly perturbed even though the layer-to-layer spacing increases upon molecular dopant incorporation. The strength of electrostatic interactions in semiconductors strongly affects their performance in optoelectronic devices. Now, doping two-dimensional naphthalene-based lead halide perovskites with tetrachloro-1,2-benzoquinone has been shown to introduce donor–acceptor interactions within the organic network, without disrupting the inorganic sublattice.

Here we report f-block complexes that can catalyse the reduction and functionalization of molecular dinitrogen, including the catalytic conversion of molecular dinitrogen to a secondary silylamine. Simple bridging ligands assemble two actinide metal cations into narrow dinuclear metallacycles that can trap the diatom while electrons from an externally bound group 1 metal, and protons or silanes, are added, enabling dinitrogen to be functionalized with modest but catalytic yields of six equivalents of secondary silylamine per molecule at ambient temperature and pressure. Metallacycles formed from two large, under-coordinated actinide MIV cations and two rigid arene-bridged aryloxide ligands are capable of binding dinitrogen inside their cavity. These f-block complexes can catalyse the reduction and functionalization of dinitrogen as well as the catalytic conversion of molecular dinitrogen to a secondary silylamine.},

In contrast, group 3–5 metals, with fewer valence electrons, have been shown to form highly coordinated heptacarbonyl and octacarbonyl complexes—although they were only identified by gas-phase mass spectrometry and/or matrix isolation spectroscopy work. Now we have prepared heptacarbonyl cations of niobium and tantalum as crystalline salts that are stable at room temperature. The [M(CO)7]+ (M = Nb or Ta) complexes were formed by the oxidation of [M(CO)6]– with 2Ag+[Al(ORF)4]– (RF, C(CF3)3) under a CO atmosphere; their experimental characterization was supported by density functional theory calculations. Other unusual carbonyl compounds were also synthesized: two isostructural salts that contained the 84-valence-electron cluster cation [Ag6{Nb(CO)6}4]2+, the piano-stool complexes [(1,2-F2C6H4)M(CO)4]+ and two polymorphs of neutral Ta2(CO)12 with a long, unsupported Ta–Ta bond. In contrast to the variety of stable carbonyl complexes of group 7–12 metals, few are known for group 3–5 metals; among those, cations have only been identified in the gas phase or by matrix isolation.

Here we show that the facultative electrogen Shewanella oneidensis can control metal-catalysed living radical polymerizations under apparent aerobic conditions by first consuming dissolved oxygen via aerobic respiration, and then directing extracellular electron flux to a metal catalyst. In both open and closed containers, S. oneidensis enabled living radical polymerizations without requiring the preremoval of oxygen. Polymerization activity was closely tied to S. oneidensis anaerobic metabolism through specific extracellular electron transfer proteins and was effective for a variety of monomers using low (parts per million) concentrations of metal catalysts. Finally, polymerizations survived repeated challenges of oxygen exposure and could be initiated using lyophilized or spent (recycled) cells. Overall, our results demonstrate how the unique ability of S. oneidensis to use both oxygen and metals as respiratory electron acceptors can be leveraged to address salient challenges in polymer synthesis. Oxygen is a potent inhibitor of radical polymerization reactions, but the facultative bacterium Shewanella oneidensis has now been shown to facilitate aerobic radical polymerizations by first consuming dissolved oxygen and then directing extracellular electron flux to a metal catalyst. Aerobic polymerization activity is dependent on the S. oneidensis genotype and can be initiated using lyophilized or spent cells.},

  abstract     = {Polyketide natural products are an important class of biologically active compounds. Although substantial progress has been made on the synthesis of repetitive polyketide motifs through the iterative application of a single reaction type, synthetic access to more diverse motifs that require more than one type of carbon–carbon bond connection remains a challenge. Here we describe a catalytic, multicomponent method for the synthesis of the privileged polyketide 1,3-dienyl-6-oxy motif. The method allows for the formation of two new carbon–carbon bonds and two stereodefined olefins. It generates products that contain up to three contiguous sp3 stereocentres with a high stereoselectivity in a single operation and can be used to generate chiral products. The successful development of this methodology relies on the remarkable efficiency of the ruthenium-catalysed alkene–alkyne coupling reaction between readily available vinyl boronic acids and alkynes to provide unsymmetrical 3-boryl-1,4-diene reagents. In the presence of carbonyl compounds, these reagents undergo highly diastereoselective allylations to afford the desired 1,3-dienyl-6-oxy motif and enable complex polyketide synthesis in a rapid and asymmetric fashion. A ruthenium-catalysed multicomponent reaction provides rapid and tunable access to 1,3-dienyl-6-oxy polyketide motifs. An initial alkene–alkyne coupling produces unsymmetrical 3-boryl-1,4-dienes. Allylation of aldehydes and ketones with these products is highly diastereoselective and results in the formation of two carbon–carbon bonds, two stereodefined olefins and up to three contiguous sp3 stereocentres.},

Despite the importance of Diels–Alder reactions in the biosynthesis of numerous secondary metabolites, no naturally occurring stand-alone Diels–Alderase has been demonstrated to catalyse intermolecular Diels–Alder transformations. Here we report a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent enzyme, Morus alba Diels–Alderase (MaDA), from Morus cell cultures, that catalyses an intermolecular [4+2] cycloaddition to produce the natural isoprenylated flavonoid chalcomoracin with a high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory calculations and preliminary measurements of the kinetic isotope effects establish a concerted but asynchronous pericyclic pathway. Structure-guided mutagenesis and docking studies demonstrate the interactions of MaDA with the diene and dienophile to catalyse the [4+2] cycloaddition. MaDA exhibits a substrate promiscuity towards both dienes and dienophiles, which enables the expedient syntheses of structurally diverse natural products. We also report a biosynthetic intermediate probe (BIP)-based target identification strategy used to discover MaDA. A naturally occurring stand-alone and intermolecular Diels–Alderase, MaDA, has been identified from Morus alba cell cultures. MaDA is a FAD-dependent enzyme, which catalyses the intermolecular [4+2] cycloaddition via a concerted but asynchronous pericyclic pathway between morachalcone A and a diene generated from moracin C.

However, one of the most common reactions of transition metal complexes, the direct reaction with carbon monoxide and formation of room-temperature isolable carbonyl complexes, is virtually unknown in main-group-element chemistry. Here, we show the synthesis, single-crystal X-ray structure, and density functional theory computations of a room-temperature-stable silylene carbonyl complex [L(Br)Ga]2Si:–CO (L = HC[C(Me)N(2,6-iPr2-C6H3)]2), which was obtained by direct carbonylation of the electron-rich silylene intermediate [L(Br)Ga]2Si:. Furthermore, [L(Br)Ga]2Si:–CO reacts with H2 and PBr3 with bond activation, whereas the reaction with cyclohexyl isocyanide proceeds with CO substitution. Compounds of main-group elements rarely undergo direct carbonylation reactions. Now, an electron-rich silylene intermediate has been shown to readily react with CO to form a silylene carbonyl complex that is stable at room temperature. This complex engages in CO substitution as well as oxidative addition reactions.},

  abstract     = {Establishing how life can emerge from inanimate matter is among the grand challenges of contemporary science. Chemical systems that capture life’s essential characteristics—replication, metabolism and compartmentalization—offer a route to understanding this momentous process. The synthesis of life, whether based on canonical biomolecules or fully synthetic molecules, requires the functional integration of these three characteristics. Here we show how a system of fully synthetic self-replicating molecules, on recruiting a cofactor, acquires the ability to transform thiols in its environment into disulfide precursors from which the molecules can replicate. The binding of replicator and cofactor enhances the activity of the latter in oxidizing thiols into disulfides through photoredox catalysis and thereby accelerates replication by increasing the availability of the disulfide precursors. This positive feedback marks the emergence of light-driven protometabolism in a system that bears no resemblance to canonical biochemistry and constitutes a major step towards the highly challenging aim of creating a new and completely synthetic form of life. The integration of replication with metabolism represents a key step in the transition of chemistry into biology. Now, it has been shown that a self-replicator can recruit and activate two different photocatalytic cofactors, which then catalyse the synthesis of the precursors for the replicator.},

However, the possible applications of these materials are limited due to the restrictions imposed by the solid-state environment on the incorporated photoswitches, which render the photoisomerization inefficient. Here we present responsive porous switchable framework materials based on a bistable chiroptical overcrowded alkene incorporated in the backbone of a rigid aromatic framework. As a consequence of the high intrinsic porosity, the resulting framework readily responds to a light stimulus, as demonstrated by solid-state Raman and reflectance spectroscopies. Solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy highlights an efficient and quantitative bulk photoisomerization of the incorporated light-responsive overcrowded olefins in the solid material. Taking advantage of the quantitative photoisomerization, the porosity of the framework and the consequent gas adsorption can be reversibly modulated in response to light and heat. Despite numerous potential applications, the development of light-responsive solid materials based on molecular photoswitches is impeded by the low efficiency of photoisomerization in the solid environment. Now a robust, solid porous material made from tetraphenylmethane and a photoswitchable overcrowded alkene exhibits nearly quantitative photoisomerization in the bulk and in photomodulation of gas uptake.},

Although water is predicted to de-wet purely repulsive surfaces and evacuate crevices, the extent of de-wetting is unclear when ubiquitous van der Waals interactions are in play. The structural simplicity of synthetic supramolecular hosts imbues them with considerable potential to address this issue. To this end, here we detail a combination of densimetry and molecular dynamics simulations of three cavitands, coupled with calorimetric studies of their complexes with short-chain carboxylates. Our results reveal the range of wettability possible within the ostensibly identical cavitand pockets—which differ only in the presence and/or position of the methyl groups that encircle the portal to their non-polar pockets. The results demonstrate the ability of macrocycles to template water cavitation within their binding sites and show how the orientation of methyl groups can trigger the drying of non-polar pockets in liquid water, which suggests new avenues to control guest complexation. Water plays an active role in modulating guest recognition by both artificial and biological hosts, but how this role can be controlled is unclear.

  abstract     = {When an amide group is distorted from its planar conformation, the conjugation between the nitrogen lone pair and the π* orbital of the carbonyl is disrupted and the reactivity towards nucleophiles is enhanced. Although there are several reports on the synthesis of activated twisted amides, amide activation through mechanical twisting is much less common. Here, we report twisted amides that are stabilized through their inclusion in a self-assembled coordination cage. When secondary aromatic amides are included in a Td-symmetric cage, the cis-twisted conformation is favoured over the trans-planar one—as evidenced by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis—revealing that the amide can twist by up to 34°. As a consequence of this distortion, the hydrolysis of amides is significantly accelerated upon inclusion. The distortion of an amide group away from a planar conformation typically enhances its reactivity and such activation is usually achieved through the chemical synthesis of twisted amides. Now, it has been shown that a non-covalent activation strategy leading to accelerated hydrolysis can be achieved by binding a reactive twisted amide conformer inside a molecular cage.},

  abstract     = {Nature’s synthetic plans to construct molecules have been developed over millions of years of evolution and frequently prove to be among the most sophisticated. Mimicking nature’s route can be a direct and feasible way for synthetic organic chemists to construct complicated molecules. However, lacking nature’s ability to manipulate enzymes often prevents us from reproducing the same route. Modifying nature’s approaches can provide a simpler synthetic alternative to access complex structural target molecules. Here we report a strategy that simplifies the synthesis of terpenes by inverting the order of nature’s two-phase biosynthesis route. We first unite simple molecules into a polyfunctionalized linear polyenyne, with all the desired carbons and oxygens in the targeted places. This compound then undergoes polyenyne cycloisomerization, in the presence of all the functional groups, to give polyoxidized terpenes. The key reaction is a palladium-catalysed polyenyne cycloisomerization that not only tolerates the presence of all of the oxygen functionalities, but also is facilitated by them. Inverting the order of nature’s two-phase biosynthesis of terpenes offers a strategy by which the synthesis of these compounds can be simplified.

We show the generality of this method by producing single-site Au, Pd, Ru and Pt catalysts supported on carbon in a facile manner. Single-site Au/C catalysts have previously been validated commercially to produce vinyl chloride, and here we show that this facile synthesis method can produce effective catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination in the absence of the highly oxidizing acidic solvents previously used. Au/C single-site catalysts have been validated commercially for acetylene hydrochlorination, but they have previously been prepared using highly oxidizing acidic solvents or additional ligands. It has now been shown that they can be made by impregnation of a metal salt from an acetone solution—generating catalysts with comparable activity to those synthesized by the other methods.},

  abstract     = {The generation of molecular chirality in the absence of any molecular chiral inductor is challenging and of fundamental interest for developing a better understanding of homochirality. Here, we show the manipulation of molecular chirality through control of the handedness of helical metal nanostructures (referred to as nanohelices) that are produced by glancing angle deposition onto a substrate that rotates in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. A prochiral molecule, 2-anthracenecarboxylic acid, is stereoselectively adsorbed on the metal nanohelices as enantiomorphous anti-head-to-head dimers. The dimers show either Si–Si or Re–Re facial stacking depending on the handedness of the nanohelices, which results in a specific enantiopreference during their photoinduced cyclodimerization: a left-handed nanohelix leads to the formation of (+)-cyclodimers, whereas a right-handed one gives (–)-cyclodimers. Density functional theory calculations, in good agreement with the experimental results, point to the enantioselectivity mainly arising from the selective spatial matching of either Si–Si or Re–Re facial stacking at the helical surface; it may also be influenced by chiroplasmonic effects. The photoinduced dimerization of a prochiral anthracenecarboxylic acid occurs in an enantioselective fashion when the molecules are adsorbed on helical metal nanostructures. This enantiopreference arises mostly from the helicity of the silver and copper substrates—prepared using shear forces during the deposition process—and may also be influenced by chiroplasmonic effects.},

Although a vast number of studies have aimed to simplify access to such materials through the C–H bond functionalization of feedstock alicyclic amines, the simultaneous introduction of more than one substituent to unprotected amines has never been accomplished. Here we report an advance in C–H bond functionalization methodology that enables the introduction of up to three substituents in a single operation. Lithiated amines are first exposed to a ketone oxidant, generating transient imines that are subsequently converted to endocyclic 1-azaallyl anions, which can be processed further to furnish β-substituted, α,β-disubstituted, or α,β,α′-trisubstituted amines. This study highlights the unique utility of in situ-generated endocyclic 1-azaallyl anions, elusive intermediates in synthetic chemistry. The preparation of unprotected alicyclic amines containing variable substituents in multiple ring positions typically requires multistep synthetic sequences. Now, an advance in C–H bond functionalization methodology that enables the convenient preparation of elusive endocyclic 1-azaallyl anions allows the introduction of up to three substituents in a single operation.},

  abstract     = {Expanding and reprogramming the genetic code of cells for the incorporation of multiple distinct non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), and the encoded biosynthesis of non-canonical biopolymers, requires the discovery of multiple orthogonal aminoacyl–transfer RNA synthetase/tRNA pairs. These pairs must be orthogonal to both the host synthetases and tRNAs and to each other. Pyrrolysyl–tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/PyltRNA pairs are the most widely used system for genetic code expansion. Here, we reveal that the sequences of ΔNPylRS/ΔNPyltRNA pairs (which lack N-terminal domains) form two distinct classes. We show that the measured specificities of the ΔNPylRSs and ΔNPyltRNAs correlate with sequence-based clustering, and most ΔNPylRSs preferentially function with ΔNPyltRNAs from their class. We then identify 18 mutually orthogonal pairs from the 88 ΔNPylRS/ΔNPyltRNA combinations tested. Moreover, we generate a set of 12 triply orthogonal pairs, each composed of three new PylRS/PyltRNA pairs. Finally, we diverge the ncAA specificity and decoding properties of each pair, within a triply orthogonal set, and direct the incorporation of three distinct non-canonical amino acids into a single polypeptide. Non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) can be incorporated into proteins in cells using orthogonal aminaocyl–tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs; the most widely adopted system is based on a pyrrolysyl–tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNA pair. Now, three new PylRS/tRNA pairs have been developed that are mutually orthogonal and can be used together to site-specifically incorporate three distinct ncAAs into a single protein.},

  abstract     = {Experimental developments continue to challenge the theoretical description of molecular interactions. One key arena in which these advances have taken place is in rotationally inelastic scattering. Electric fields have been used with great success to select the initial quantum state and slow molecules for scattering studies, revealing novel stereodynamics, diffraction oscillations and scattering resonances. These have enjoyed excellent agreement with quantum scattering calculations performed on state-of-the-art coupled-cluster potential energy surfaces. To date these studies have largely employed reactants in the ground vibrational state (v = 0) and the lowest low-field-seeking quantum state. Here we describe the use of stimulated emission pumping to prepare NO molecules in arbitrary single rotational and parity states of v = 10 for inelastic scattering studies. These are employed in a near-copropagating molecular beam geometry that permits the collision energy to be tuned from above room temperature to 1 K or below, with product differential cross-sections obtained by velocity map imaging. This extremely nonequilibrium condition, not found in nature, tests current theoretical methods in a new regime. Scattering experiments in which two beams nearly co-propagate allow broadly tunable collision energies and can enable cold collisions. Now, such experiments have been combined with the preparation of NO molecules using stimulated emission to generate highly vibrationally excited states for state-to-state scattering studies, testing the theoretical gold standard in a regime not found in nature.},

  abstract     = {Elucidating the physiological binding partners of histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) is key to understanding fundamental epigenetic regulatory pathways. Determining such interactomes will enable the study of how perturbations of these interactions affect disease. Here we use a synthetic biology approach to set a series of hPTM-controlled photo-affinity traps in native chromatin. Using quantitative proteomics, the local interactomes of these chemically customized chromatin landscapes are determined. We show that the approach captures transiently interacting factors such as methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as previously reported and novel hPTM reader proteins. We also apply this in situ proteomics approach to a recently disclosed cancer-associated histone mutation, H3K4M, revealing a number of perturbed interactions with the mutated tail. Collectively our studies demonstrate that modifying and interrogating native chromatin with chemical precision is a powerful tool for exploring epigenetic regulation and dysregulation at the molecular level. Proteins that interact with histone post-translational modifications have now been identified using an approach based on split-intein mediated histone semisynthesis. Histone modifications and disease-relevant mutations were installed into native chromatin with an adjacent photocross-linker to enable in situ cross-linking. This strategy enabled the determination of chromatin-relevant interactomes and represents a powerful tool for exploring epigenetic regulation and dysregulation at the molecular level.},

  abstract     = {The magic methyl effect is well acknowledged in medicinal chemistry, but despite its significance, accessing such analogues via derivatization at a late stage remains a pivotal challenge. In an effort to mitigate this major limitation, we here present a strategy for the cobalt-catalysed late-stage C–H methylation of structurally complex drug molecules. Enabling broad applicability, the transformation relies on a boron-based methyl source and takes advantage of inherently present functional groups to guide the C–H activation. The relative reactivity observed for distinct classes of functionalities were determined and the sensitivity of the transformation towards a panel of common functional motifs was tested under various reaction conditions. Without the need for prefunctionalization or postdeprotection, a diverse array of marketed drug molecules and natural products could be methylated in a predictable manner. Subsequent physicochemical and biological testing confirmed the magnitude with which this seemingly minor structural change can affect important drug properties. Despite the importance of C–H methylation in medicinal chemistry, the application to densely functionalized complex molecules remains a challenge. Now, a novel cobalt-catalysed method takes advantage of inherently present functional groups to guide the C–H activation and a boron-based methyl source enables the late stage C–H methylation of pharmaceutically relevant substrates.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal-catalysed C–H functionalization and decarboxylative coupling are two of the most notable synthetic strategies developed in the past 30 years. Here, we connect these two reaction pathways using bases and a simple Pd-based catalyst system to promote a para-selective C–H functionalization reaction from benzylic electrophiles. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest a pathway that involves an uncommon Pd-catalysed dearomatization of the benzyl moiety followed by a base-enabled rearomatization through a formal 1,5-hydrogen migration. This reaction complements ‘C–H activation’ strategies that convert inert C–H bonds into C–metal bonds prior to C–C bond formation. Instead, this reaction exploits an inverted sequence and promotes C–C bond formation prior to deprotonation. These studies provide an opportunity to develop general para-selective C–H functionalization reactions from benzylic electrophiles and show how new reactive modalities may be accessed with careful control of the reaction conditions. A catalytic para-selective alkylation reaction connects C–H functionalization and decarboxylative coupling strategies using simple bases to trap a previously hidden intermediate. This reaction exploits an ‘inverted sequence’ that forms the C–C bond prior to C–H bond cleavage and provides a new entry into C–H functionalization reactions.},

  abstract     = {Conformational heterogeneity is emerging as a defining characteristic of enzyme function. However, understanding the role of protein conformations requires their thermodynamic and kinetic characterization at the single-molecule level, which remains extremely challenging. Here we report the ligand-induced conformational changes of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by measuring the modulation of the nanopore currents. The long observation time of the electrical recordings enabled the detection of rare conformational transitions hidden in ensemble measurements. We show that DHFR exists in at least four ground-state configurations or conformers with different affinities for its ligands. Unliganded DHFR adopted low-affinity conformers, whereas the binding of substrates promoted the switch to the high-affinity conformer. Conversion between the conformers was accelerated by molecules that stabilized the transition state of DHFR, which suggests that the reaction lowers the energy barrier for conformer exchange and thus facilitates product release. This mechanism might be a general feature in enzymatic reactions affected by product inhibition or when the release of products is the rate-limiting step. Single-molecule nanopore measurements have revealed ligand-induced conformational changes in the catalytic cycle of dihydrofolate reductase, and showed that the enzyme adopts distinctive conformers, which have different affinities for substrates and products. Crossing the transition state facilitates conformer exchange, suggesting that the chemical step catalyses the switch between conformers to obtain a more efficient product release.},

Odd–even effects in the solid state often arise from intermolecular interactions that involve fully extended molecules. These effects have also been observed in less condensed phases, such as self-assembled monolayers; however, the origins of these effects in such systems can be difficult to determine. Here we combined NMR and computational analysis to show that all-syn contiguously methyl-substituted hydrocarbons, with chain lengths from C6 to C11, exhibit a dramatic odd–even effect in helical propensity. The even- and odd-numbered hydrocarbons populate regular and less-controlled helical conformations, respectively. This knowledge will guide the design of helical hydrocarbons as rigid scaffolds or as hydrophobic components in soft materials. Even- and odd-numbered homologues of some hydrocarbons are known to exhibit different trends in solid-state properties. Now, experimental and computational investigations on a homologous series of a stereochemically well-defined hydrocarbon have revealed an odd–even effect in conformational behaviour in solution that is caused by a single gauche interaction.},

Here we report the construction of a series of giant supramolecular hexagonal grids, with diameters on the order of 20 nm and molecular weights greater than 65 kDa, through a combination of intra- and intermolecular metal-mediated self-assembly steps. The hexagonal intermediates and the resulting self-assembled grid architectures were imaged at submolecular resolution by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Characterization (including by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy) enabled the unambiguous atomic-scale determination of fourteen hexagonal grid isomers. Metal-mediated self-assembly in solution typically leads to small two- and three-dimensional architectures on scales smaller than 10 nm, but now a series of large, discrete, two-dimensional supramolecular hexagonal grids have been prepared through a combination of intra- and intermolecular coordination interactions.

  abstract     = {The introduction of a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group can dramatically improve a compound’s biological properties. Despite the well-established importance of trifluoromethylated compounds, general methods for the trifluoromethylation of alkyl C–H bonds remain elusive. Here we report the development of a dual-catalytic C(sp3)–H trifluoromethylation through the merger of light-driven, decatungstate-catalysed hydrogen atom transfer and copper catalysis. This metallaphotoredox methodology enables the direct conversion of both strong aliphatic and benzylic C–H bonds into the corresponding C(sp3)–CF3 products in a single step using a bench-stable, commercially available trifluoromethylation reagent. The reaction requires only a single equivalent of substrate and proceeds with excellent selectivity for positions distal to unprotected amines. To demonstrate the utility of this new methodology for late-stage functionalization, we have directly derivatized a broad range of approved drugs and natural products to generate valuable trifluoromethylated analogues. Preliminary mechanistic experiments reveal that a ‘Cu–CF3’ species is formed during this process and the critical C(sp3)–CF3 bond-forming step involves the copper catalyst. Despite the importance of trifluoromethylated compounds, direct catalytic methods for the conversion of C(sp3)–H bonds into the corresponding C(sp3)–CF3 analogues have remained elusive. This transformation has now been achieved by the merger of copper catalysis with decatungstate photocatalysis, enabling the C(sp3)–H trifluoromethylation of abundant feedstocks, natural products and pharmaceuticals.},

Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are metal complexes with two degenerate magnetic ground states and are promising for increasing storage density, but remain unexplored using ultrafast techniques. Here we have explored the dynamics occurring after photoexcitation of a trinuclear µ3-oxo-bridged Mn(iii)-based SMM, whose magnetic anisotropy is closely related to the Jahn–Teller distortion. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in solution reveals oscillations superimposed on the decay traces due to a vibrational wavepacket. Based on complementary measurements and calculations on the monomer Mn(acac)3, we conclude that the wavepacket motion in the trinuclear SMM is constrained along the Jahn–Teller axis due to the µ3-oxo and µ-oxime bridges. Our results provide new possibilities for optical control of the magnetization in SMMs on femtosecond timescales and open up new molecular-design challenges to control the wavepacket motion in the excited state of polynuclear transition-metal complexes. Controlling single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with ultrashort laser pulses could be key to future data storage devices, however, the photophysics of SMMs is complex. Now, using a monomer model system, it has been shown that optical excitation of Mn(iii)-SMMs leads to a modulation of the Jahn–Teller distortion, which is important for its magnetic anisotropy.},

  abstract     = {Oligomeric species populated during the aggregation of the Aβ42 peptide have been identified as potent cytotoxins linked to Alzheimer’s disease, but the fundamental molecular pathways that control their dynamics have yet to be elucidated. By developing a general approach that combines theory, experiment and simulation, we reveal, in molecular detail, the mechanisms of Aβ42 oligomer dynamics during amyloid fibril formation. Even though all mature amyloid fibrils must originate as oligomers, we found that most Aβ42 oligomers dissociate into their monomeric precursors without forming new fibrils. Only a minority of oligomers converts into fibrillar structures. Moreover, the heterogeneous ensemble of oligomeric species interconverts on timescales comparable to those of aggregation. Our results identify fundamentally new steps that could be targeted by therapeutic interventions designed to combat protein misfolding diseases. Aβ42 oligomers are key toxic species associated with protein aggregation; however, the molecular pathways determining the dynamics of oligomer populations have remained unknown. Now, direct measurements of oligomer populations, coupled to theory and computer simulations, define and quantify the dynamics of Aβ42 oligomers formed during amyloid aggregation.},

  abstract     = {Unlike their more common linear counterparts, cyclic polymers have a ring-like structure and a lack of chain ends. Because of their topology, cyclic polymers exhibit a unique set of properties when compared with linear or branched macromolecules. For example, cyclic homopolymers exhibit a reduced hydrodynamic volume and a slower degradation profile compared with their linear analogues. Cyclic block copolymers self-assemble into compact nanostructures, as illustrated by their reduced domain spacing when cast into thin films and their reduced micellar size in solution. Although methods for preparing well-defined cyclic polymers have only been available since 1980, the extensive utilization of the cyclic topology in nature highlights the vital role that a cyclic architecture can play in imparting valuable physical properties, such as increased chemical stability or propensity towards self-assembly. This Review describes the major developments in the synthesis of cyclic polymers and provides an overview of their fundamental physical properties. In this context, preliminary studies exploring potential applications will be critically assessed and the remaining challenges for the field delineated. Cyclic polymers have a ring-like architecture and one of the most important consequences of this topology is the absence of any chain ends, which typically have a substantial impact on the physical properties of macromolecules. This Review Article discusses advances in the synthesis, purification and characterization of cyclic polymers and the potential applications they may prove useful for.},

  abstract     = {The Soai reaction has profoundly impacted chemists’ perspective of autocatalysis, chiral symmetry breaking, absolute asymmetric synthesis and its role in the origin of biological homochirality. Here we describe the unprecedented observation of asymmetry-amplifying autocatalysis in the alkylation of 5-(trimethylsilylethynyl)pyridine-3-carbaldehyde using diisopropylzinc. Kinetic studies with a surrogate substrate and spectroscopic analysis of a series of zinc alkoxides that incorporate specific structural mutations reveal a ‘pyridine-assisted cube escape’. The new tetrameric cluster functions as a catalyst that activates the substrate through a two-point binding mode and poises a coordinated diisopropylzinc moiety for alkyl group transfer. Transition-state models leading to both the homochiral and heterochiral products were validated by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, experimental and computational analysis of the heterochiral complex provides a definitive explanation for the nonlinear behaviour of this system. Our deconstruction of the Soai system reveals the structural logic for autocatalyst evolution, function and substrate compatibility—a central mechanistic aspect of this iconic transformation. The discovery of amplifying autocatalysis in a pyridine-3-carbaldehyde system facilitates a mechanistic deconstruction of the Soai reaction. A tetrameric autocatalyst, assembled by a combination of steric effects and nitrogen–zinc coordination, activates the substrate by two-point binding. This is followed by intra-complex isopropyl group transfer that generates the product alkoxide with high homochiral fidelity.},

  abstract     = {Three-stranded coiled coils are peptide structures constructed from amphipathic heptad repeats. Here we show that it is possible to form pure heterotrimeric three-stranded coiled coils by combining three distinct characteristics: (1) a cysteine sulfur layer for metal coordination, (2) a thiophilic, trigonal pyramidal metalloid (Pb(ii)) that binds to these sulfurs and (3) an adjacent layer of reduced steric bulk generating a cavity where water can hydrogen bond to the cysteine sulfur atoms. Cysteine substitution in an a site yields Pb(ii)A2B heterotrimers, while d sites provide pure Pb(ii)C2D or Pb(ii)CD2 scaffolds. Altering the metal from Pb(ii) to Hg(ii) or shifting the relative position of the sterically less demanding layer removes heterotrimer specificity. Because only two of the eight or ten hydrophobic layers are perturbed, catalytic sites can be introduced at other regions of the scaffold. A Zn(ii)(histidine)3(H2O) centre can be incorporated at a remote location without perturbing the heterotrimer selectivity, suggesting a unique strategy to prepare dissymmetric catalytic sites within self-assembling de novo-designed proteins. A method to fabricate heterotrimeric three-stranded coiled-coil peptide structures has now been developed using coordination around a Pb(ii) centre. The heterotrimeric structures require only three cysteines that bind to Pb(ii) to form a trigonal pyramidal structure, and the formation of an adjacent cavity in which water can hydrogen bond to the cysteine sulfur atoms.},

Towards this goal, it is essential to develop strategies to activate C–H bonds that are distal from a functional group. In this context, distinguishing remote C–H bonds on adjacent carbon atoms is an extraordinary challenge due to the lack of electronic or steric bias between the two positions. Herein, we report the design of a catalytic system leveraging a remote directing template and a transient norbornene mediator to selectively activate a previously inaccessible remote C–H bond that is one bond further away. The generality of this approach has been demonstrated with a range of heterocycles, including a complex anti-leukaemia agent and hydrocinnamic acid substrates. Distinguishing remote C–H bonds on adjacent carbon atoms is a fundamental challenge because of a lack of electronic or steric bias. Now, differentiation of distal C–H bonds that are adjacent to each other has been achieved by combining selective remote C–H activation—based on distance and geometry—with a norbornene-assisted palladium migration.},

  abstract     = {Molecules that undergo singlet fission, converting singlet excitons into pairs of triplet excitons, have potential as photovoltaic materials. The possible advantages of endothermic singlet fission (enhanced use of photon energy and larger triplet energies for coupling with common absorbers) motivated us to assess the role of exciton delocalization in the activation of this process. Here we report the synthesis of a series of linear perylene oligomers that undergo endothermic singlet fission and have endothermicities in the range 5–10 kBT at room temperature in solution. We study these compounds using transient spectroscopy and modelling to unravel the singlet and triplet dynamics. We show that the minimal number of coupled chromophores needed to undergo endothermic singlet fission is three, which provides sufficient statistical space for triplet excitons to separate and avoid annihilation—and a subsequent fast return to the singlet state. Our data additionally suggest that torsional motion of chromophores about the molecular axis following triplet-pair separation contributes to the increase in entropy, thus lengthening the triplet lifetime in longer oligomers. Generating high-energy triplet excitons from singlet fission without excess energy loss is a critical goal for potential applications. Now it is shown that molecular chromophores that are connected covalently can harbour multiple long-lived and high-energy triplets—created from one photon—only if more than two chromophoric units are present and they have sufficient flexibility to isolate the excitations upon torsional motion.},

Designed with disease biomarkers as inputs, our logic devices showed site-specific release of multiple therapeutics (including kinase inhibitors, drugs and short interfering RNA) in vitro and in vivo. We expect that this ‘plug and play’ platform will be expanded towards smart biomaterial engineering for therapeutic delivery, precision medicine, tissue engineering and stem cell therapy. A programmable polymer library that responds to external and internal stimuli has been developed and used to fabricate a series of nanocarriers for drug release.

  abstract     = {Carbon dioxide and epoxide copolymerization is an industrially relevant means to valorize waste and improve sustainability in polymer manufacturing. Given the value of the polymer products—polycarbonates or polyether carbonates—it could provide an economic stimulus to capture and storage technologies. The process efficiency depends upon the catalyst, and previously Zn(ii)Mg(ii) heterodinuclear catalysts showed good performances at low carbon dioxide pressures, attributed to synergic interactions between the metals. Now, a Mg(ii)Co(ii) catalyst is reported that exhibits significantly better activity (turnover frequency &amp;gt; 12,000 h−1) and high selectivity (&amp;gt;99% CO2 utilization and polycarbonate selectivity) for carbon dioxide and cyclohexene oxide copolymerization. Detailed kinetic investigations show a second-order rate law, independent of CO2 pressure from 1–40 bar, to produce polyols. Kinetic data also reveal that synergy arises from differentiated roles for the metals in the mechanism: epoxide coordination occurs at Mg(ii), with reduced transition state entropy, while the Co(ii) centre accelerates carbonate attack by lowering the transition state enthalpy. This rare insight into intermetallic synergy rationalizes the outstanding catalytic performance and provides a new feature to exploit in other homogeneous catalyses. The copolymerization of CO2 with epoxides is an attractive approach for valorizing waste products and improving sustainability in polymer manufacturing. Now, a heterodinuclear Mg(ii)Co(ii) complex has been shown to act as a highly active and selective catalyst for this reaction at low CO2 pressure. The synergy between the two metals was investigated using polymerization kinetics.},

  abstract     = {Responsive hydrogels that undergo controlled shape changes in response to a range of stimuli are of interest for microscale soft robotic and biomedical devices. However, these applications require fabrication methods capable of preparing complex, heterogeneous materials. Here we report a new approach for making patterned, multi-material and multi-responsive hydrogels, on a micrometre to millimetre scale. Nanolitre aqueous pre-gel droplets were connected through lipid bilayers in predetermined architectures and photopolymerized to yield continuous hydrogel structures. By using this droplet network technology to pattern domains containing temperature-responsive or non-responsive hydrogels, structures that undergo reversible curling were produced. Through patterning of gold nanoparticle-containing domains into the hydrogels, light-activated shape change was achieved, while domains bearing magnetic particles allowed movement of the structures in a magnetic field. To highlight our technique, we generated a multi-responsive hydrogel that, at one temperature, could be moved through a constriction under a magnetic field and, at a second temperature, could grip and transport a cargo. Responsive hydrogels are of interest for a range of potential applications, including microscale soft robotic and biomedical devices. Now, a versatile fabrication approach has been developed to prepare patterned, multi-material and multi-responsive hydrogels. Pre-gel droplets are connected through lipid bilayers in predetermined architectures and photopolymerized to yield continuous hydrogel structures that respond to a variety of stimuli.},

  abstract     = {ortho-Quinone methides are useful transient synthetic intermediates in organic synthesis. These species are most often generated in situ by the acid- or base-mediated transformation of phenols that have been pre-functionalized at a benzylic position, or by biomimetic oxidation of the corresponding ortho-alkylphenols with metal oxidants or transition-metal complexes. Here we describe a method for the transition-metal-free oxidative generation of o-QMs from ortho-alkylarenols, using hypoiodite catalysis under nearly neutral conditions, which can then be applied in one-pot tandem reactions. This method for the chemoselective oxidative generation of ortho-quinone methides may prove superior to previous methods with respect to environmental issues and scope, and can be applied to various tandem reactions such as inter- or intramolecular [4 + 2] cycloaddition, oxa-6π-electrocyclization, conjugate addition and spiroepoxidation. ortho-Quinone methides are highly reactive transient intermediates found in some organic syntheses and biological processes. The generation of these species often requires pre-functionalized substrates and/or metal oxidants, but now the chemoselective oxidative generation of ortho-quinone methides from ortho-alkylarenols has been achieved using hypoiodite catalysis under nearly neutral conditions.},

  abstract     = {Advances in chemical control of the photophysical properties of transition-metal complexes are revolutionizing a wide range of technologies, particularly photocatalysis and light-emitting diodes, but they rely heavily on molecules containing precious metals such as ruthenium and iridium. Although the application of earth-abundant ‘early’ transition metals in photosensitizers is clearly advantageous, a detailed understanding of excited states with ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) character is paramount to account for their distinct electron configurations. Here we report an air- and moisture-stable, visible light-absorbing Zr(iv) photosensitizer, Zr(MesPDPPh)2, where [MesPDPPh]2− is the doubly deprotonated form of [2,6-bis(5-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-3-phenyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyridine]. This molecule has an exceptionally long-lived triplet LMCT excited state (τ = 350 μs), featuring highly efficient photoluminescence emission (Ф = 0.45) due to thermally activated delayed fluorescence emanating from the higher-lying singlet configuration with significant LMCT contributions. Zr(MesPDPPh)2 engages in numerous photoredox catalytic processes and triplet energy transfer. Our investigation provides a blueprint for future photosensitizer development featuring early transition metals and excited states with significant LMCT contributions. Understanding the photophysical properties of transition-metal complexes is paramount to advances in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion and light-emitting diodes. Now, long-lived emission via thermally activated delayed fluorescence has been demonstrated from an air- and water-stable zirconium complex featuring excited states with significant ligand-to-metal charge transfer character.},

Here we show a material that combines superionic conductivity with a polar crystal structure at room temperature. This three-dimensional anionic network is based on –Fe–N≡C–Mo– units, with Cs cations hosted in every other pore. In the resulting Cs1.1Fe0.95[Mo(CN)5(NO)]·4H2O material, the negative and positive charges of the framework and Cs+ ions, respectively, are non-symmetrically shifted in the c-axis direction of the unit cell, and spontaneous electric polarization is generated, in turn leading to second harmonic generation (SHG). Additionally, this material is a superionic conductor (with an ionic conductivity value of 4 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 318 K). Furthermore, the ionic conductivity significantly decreases under 532 nm light irradiation (from 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 to 6 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature) and, when irradiation stops, returns to its original value within ~1 h. A material based on a three-dimensional –Fe–N≡C–Mo– anionic framework that hosts a Cs+ cation in every other pore has been shown to exhibit superionic conductivity, despite its polar crystal structure. It also exhibits second harmonic generation (SHG)—usually observed in insulators—and its ionic conductivity was reversibly altered under light irradiation.},

These features have inspired chemists for decades to seek artificial mimetics of proteins with improved or novel properties. Such work has focused primarily on small protein fragments, often isolated secondary structures; however, there has lately been a growing interest in the design of artificial molecules that mimic larger, more complex tertiary folds. In this Perspective, we define these agents as ‘proteomimetics’ and discuss the recent advances in the field. Proteomimetics can be divided into three categories: protein domains with side-chain functionality that alters the native linear-chain topology; protein domains in which the chemical composition of the polypeptide backbone has been partially altered; and protein-like folded architectures that are composed entirely of non-natural monomer units. We give an overview of these proteomimetic approaches and outline remaining challenges facing the field. The complexity of proteins has inspired chemists to seek artificial mimetics of protein structure and function. Historically, most such work has focused on analogues of small, isolated segments; however, there is growing interest in mimicry of larger, intact tertiary folds. This Perspective surveys the emerging body of work on these agents, termed ‘proteomimetics’, discusses their construction and outlines some of the remaining challenges.},

Heterodimerization generates a compound collection with topological complexity and diverse principal moments of inertia. The special status of the sp3–sp3 attached-ring motif is demonstrated in a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes pathway, which recruited these butenolide heterodimers from a field of 250,000 compounds. The driving forces underlying this general attached-ring coupling identify a novel paradigm for the accession of wider natural product chemical space, accelerating the discovery of selective lead compounds. Although biaryl rings can be easily formed via cross coupling, their tetrahedral, high-fraction sp3 equivalents cannot. Now the scope, mechanism and biological profile of a general attached-ring synthesis has been probed.

  abstract     = {Force can induce remarkable non-destructive transformations along a polymer, but we have a limited understanding of the energy transduction and product distribution in tandem mechanochemical reactions. Ladderanes consist of multiple fused cyclobutane rings and have recently been used as monomeric motifs to develop polymers that drastically change their properties in response to force. Here we show that [4]-ladderane always exhibits ‘all-or-none’ cascade mechanoactivations and the same stereochemical distribution of the generated dienes under various conditions and within different polymer backbones. Transition state theory fails to capture the reaction kinetics and explain the observed stereochemical distributions. Ab initio steered molecular dynamics reveals unique non-equilibrium dynamic effects: energy transduction from the first cycloreversion substantially accelerates the second cycloreversion, and bifurcation on the force-modified potential energy surface leads to the product distributions. Our findings illustrate the rich chemistry in closely coupled multi-mechanophores and an exciting potential for effective energy transduction in tandem mechanochemical reactions. The mechanochemical activation of [4]-ladderane/ene has been studied and found to exhibit cascade unzipping and a consistent stereochemical distribution of products under various conditions and in different polymer backbones.

  abstract     = {The development of new methodologies that enable chemo- and stereoselective construction of fluorinated substituents, such as the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group, plays an essential role in the synthesis of new pharmaceutical agents. The exceptional ability of the CF3 moiety to prevent in vivo metabolism as well as improve other pharmacological properties has led to numerous innovative strategies for installing this unique functional group. One potential yet underdeveloped approach to access these trifluoromethylated products is direct substitution of α-trifluoromethyl carbanions. Although the electron-withdrawing nature of the CF3 group should facilitate deprotonation of adjacent hydrogens, the propensity of the resulting carbanions to undergo α-elimination of fluoride renders this process highly challenging. Herein, we describe a new strategy for stabilizing and utilizing transient α-trifluoromethyl carbanions that relies on a neighbouring cationic π-allyl palladium complex. These palladium-stabilized zwitterions participate in asymmetric [3 + 2] cycloadditions with a broad range of acceptors, generating valuable di- and trifluoromethylated cyclopentanes, pyrrolidines and tetrahydrofurans. Although methods exist for the construction of CF3-containing stereocentres, the utilization of α-trifluoromethyl carbanions remains challenging because of the propensity for fluoride elimination. A strategy has now been developed to stabilize these carbanions through a neighbouring cationic Pd complex and the corresponding Pd-stabilized zwitterions participate in asymmetric cycloadditions with a broad range of acceptors.},

  abstract     = {Functionalizing the surfaces of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets with noble metals is important for electrically contacting them to devices, as well as improving their catalytic and sensing capabilities. Solution-phase deposition provides a scalable approach to the creation of metal–TMD hybrid systems, but controlling such processes remains challenging. Here we elucidate the different pathways by which gold and silver deposit at room temperature onto colloidal 1T-WS2, 2H-WS2, 2H-MoSe2, 2H-WSe2, 1T′-MoTe2 and Td-WTe2 few-layer nanostructures to produce several distinct classes of 0D–2D and 2D–2D metal–TMD hybrids. Uniform gold nanoparticles form on all of the TMDs. By contrast, silver deposits as nanoparticles with a bimodal size distribution on the disulfides and diselenides, and as atomically thin layers on the ditellurides. The various sizes and morphologies of these surface-bound metal species arise from the relative strengths of the interfacial metal–chalcogen bonds during the reduction of Au3+ or Ag+ by the TMDs. The deposition of noble metals onto two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is crucial for practical applications, including in catalysis and sensing, yet this process has remained difficult to control. Now, gold and silver have been shown to grow on colloidal transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets into either atomically thin layers or nanoparticles whose sizes and morphologies depend on the relative strengths of the interfacial noble metal–chalcogen bonds.},

  abstract     = {Anti-Markovnikov additions to alkenes have been a longstanding goal of catalysis, and anti-Markovnikov addition of arenes to alkenes would produce alkylarenes that are distinct from those formed by acid-catalysed processes. Existing hydroarylations are either directed or occur with low reactivity and low regioselectivity for the n-alkylarene. Herein, we report the first undirected hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes with unactivated arenes that occurs with high regioselectivity for the anti-Markovnikov product. The reaction occurs with a nickel catalyst ligated by a highly sterically hindered N-heterocyclic carbene. Catalytically relevant arene- and alkene-bound nickel complexes have been characterized, and the rate-limiting step was shown to be reductive elimination to form the C–C bond. Density functional theory calculations, combined with second-generation absolutely localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis, suggest that the difference in activity between catalysts containing large and small carbenes results more from stabilizing intramolecular non-covalent interactions in the secondary coordination sphere than from steric hindrance. The anti-Markovnikov hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes with unactivated arenes has been achieved with high selectivity by using nickel catalysts bearing large N-heterocyclic carbene ligands. Energy decomposition analysis indicates that the high activity of the catalysts with large carbene ligands arises from stabilizing non-covalent interactions rather than steric effects.},

These materials are typically porous solids, although the liquid state can be easier to manipulate in industrial settings. The idea of combining the size and shape selectivity of porous domains with the fluidity of liquids is a promising one and porous liquids composed of functionalized organic cages have recently attracted attention. Here we describe an ionic-liquid, porous, tetrahedral coordination cage. Complementing the gas binding observed in other porous liquids, this material also encapsulates non-gaseous guests—shape and size selectivity was observed for a series of isomeric alcohols. Three gaseous chlorofluorocarbon guests, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane and chlorotrifluoromethane, were also shown to be taken up by the liquid coordination cage with an affinity that increased with their size. We hope that these findings will lead to the synthesis of other porous liquids whose guest-uptake properties may be tailored to fulfil specific functions. Porous liquids promise to combine the advantages of the porosity of solids with those of the fluidity of liquids. Now, a permanently porous ionic-liquid coordination cage has been assembled that encapsulates isomers of butanol and propanol with some size and shape selectivity, as well as three gaseous chlorofluorocarbons with a size-dependent affinity.},

  abstract     = {Given the important role played by 2-hydroxybiaryls in organic, medicinal and materials chemistry, concise methods for the synthesis of this common motif are extremely valuable. In seeking to extend the lexicon of synthetic chemists in this regard, we have developed an expedient and general strategy for the ortho-arylation of phenols and naphthols using readily available boronic acids. Our methodology relies on in situ generation of a uniquely reactive Bi(v) arylating agent from a bench-stable Bi(iii) precursor via telescoped B–to–Bi transmetallation and oxidation. By exploiting reactivity that is orthogonal to conventional metal-catalysed manifolds, diverse aryl and heteroaryl partners can be rapidly coupled to phenols and naphthols under mild conditions. Following arylation, high-yielding recovery of the Bi(iii) precursor allows for its efficient re-use in subsequent reactions. Mechanistic interrogation of each key step of the methodology informs its practical application and provides fundamental insight into the underexploited reactivity of organobismuth compounds. Step-economic access to the biologically relevant 2-hydroxybiaryl motif represents a long-standing challenge in synthetic organic chemistry. Now, a bismuth-mediated oxidative arylation of phenols and naphthols with boronic acids has been developed — supported by experimental mechanistic insight — giving a direct and practical route to this valuable molecular architecture.},

  abstract     = {In biological systems, large and complex structures are often assembled from multiple simpler identical subunits. This strategy—homooligomerization—allows efficient genetic encoding of structures and avoids the need to control the stoichiometry of multiple distinct units. It also allows the minimal number of distinct subunits when designing artificial nucleic acid structures. Here, we present a robust self-assembly system in which homooligomerizable tiles are formed from intramolecularly folded RNA single strands. Tiles are linked through an artificially designed branched kissing-loop motif, involving Watson–Crick base pairing between the single-stranded regions of a bulged helix and a hairpin loop. By adjusting the tile geometry to gain control over the curvature, torsion and the number of helices, we have constructed 16 different linear and circular structures, including a finite-sized three-dimensional cage. We further demonstrate cotranscriptional self-assembly of tiles based on branched kissing loops, and show that tiles inserted into a transfer RNA scaffold can be overexpressed in bacterial cells. Homooligomerization systems can be used to construct nanoarchitectures and to aid understanding of natural analogues. But the formation of such artificial systems with structural diversity and complexity comparable to that of biological systems is challenging. Now, an artificial branched kissing-loop motif has been designed, which links tiles folded from a single strand of RNA to give diverse homooligomeric nanostructures.},

The aromaticity in 3D π-conjugated molecules has been rarely studied. Here we report a fully conjugated diradicaloid molecular cage and its global aromaticity at different oxidation states. The neutral compound has an open-shell singlet ground state with a dominant 38π monocyclic conjugation pathway and follows the [4n + 2] Hückel aromaticity rule; the dication has a triplet ground state with a dominant 36π monocyclic conjugation pathway and satisfies [4n] Baird aromaticity; the tetracation is an open-shell singlet with 52 π-electrons that are delocalized along the 3D rigid framework, showing 3D global antiaromaticity; and the hexacation possesses D3 symmetry with 50 globally delocalized π-electrons, showing [6n + 2] 3D global aromaticity. Different types of aromaticity were therefore accessed in one molecular cage platform, depending on the symmetry, number of π-electrons and spin state. A conjugated diradicaloid cage has been synthesized and its aromaticity was investigated. The neutral compound and the dication have dominant monocyclic conjugation pathways and both are aromatic (the former following Hückel’s rule and the latter Baird’s rule). The tetracation ([6n + 4] π-electrons) exhibits global 3D antiaromaticity whereas the hexacation ([6n + 2] π-electrons) exhibits global 3D aromaticity and has high D3 symmetry.},

  abstract     = {Aromaticity can be defined by the ability of a molecule to sustain a ring current when placed in a magnetic field. Hückel’s rule states that molecular rings with [4n + 2] π-electrons are aromatic, with an induced magnetization that opposes the external field inside the ring, whereas those with 4n π-electrons are antiaromatic, with the opposite magnetization. This rule reliably predicts the behaviour of small molecules, typically with fewer than 22 π-electrons (n = 5). It is not clear whether aromaticity has a size limit, or whether Hückel’s rule extends to much larger macrocycles. Here, we present evidence for global aromaticity in porphyrin nanorings with circuits of up to 162 π-electrons (n = 40); aromaticity is controlled by changing the constitution, oxidation state and conformation. Whenever a ring current is observed, its direction is correctly predicted by Hückel’s rule. The largest ring currents occur when the porphyrin units have fractional oxidation states. Does aromaticity have a size limit? Evidence is presented for global aromaticity in porphyrin nanorings with circuits of up to 162 π-electrons. The conformation of the nanoring can be altered by changing the template, which in turn controls the aromaticity.

These novel ‘pseudo-natural product’ classes retain the biological relevance of NPs, yet exhibit structures and bioactivities not accessible to nature or through the use of existing design strategies. We also analyse selected pseudo-NP libraries using chemoinformatic tools, to assess their molecular shape diversity and properties. To facilitate the exploration of biologically relevant chemical space, we identify design principles and connectivity patterns that would provide access to unprecedented pseudo-NP classes, offering new opportunities for bioactive small-molecule discovery. The structures of biologically active natural products have long served as inspiration in drug discovery. This Perspective outlines design principles and connectivity patterns for the de novo combination of natural product-derived fragments.

  abstract     = {The distribution of electrons in the 4f orbitals of lanthanide ions is often assigned a crucial role in the design of single-molecule magnets, which maintain magnetization in zero external field. Optimal spatial complementarity between the 4f-electron density and the ligand field is key to maximizing magnetic anisotropy, which is an important factor in the ability of lanthanide complexes to display single-molecule magnet behaviour. Here we have experimentally determined the electron density distribution in two dysprosium molecular complexes by interpreting high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction with a multipole model. The ground-state 4f-electron density is found to be an oblate ellipsoid, as is often deduced from a simplified Sievers model that assumes a pure |±15/2&amp;gt; ground-state doublet for the lanthanide ion. The large equatorial asymmetry—determined by a model wavefunction—was found to contain considerable MJ mixing of |±11/2&amp;gt; and only 81% of |±15/2&amp;gt;. The experimental molecular magnetic easy axes were recovered, and found to deviate by 13.1° and 8.7° from those obtained by ab initio calculations. Gaining a better understanding of the complex electronic structure of single-molecule magnets is essential for their design and development. The 4f-electron density distribution of a dysprosium single-molecule magnet has now been experimentally determined using synchrotron diffraction data interpreted with a multipole model. The magnetic easy axes were recovered by analysis of the 4f-electron density shape, which is clearly oblate.},

  abstract     = {A reduction in CO2 emissions is required to mitigate global warming. Post-combustion carbon capture is one of the most developed technologies that has the potential to meet this goal, but its cost prevents its widespread use. A different approach would be to use CO2 directly as it is captured, before it is stored. Here we explore spontaneous CO2 fixation by industrial polyamines as a strategy to generate dynamic libraries of ligands for metal separation and recovery. We identify the CO2 loadings and solvents promoting the optimal precipitation of each metal from the dynamic libraries of complexes. We demonstrate the separation of lanthanum and nickel using the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine vehicle, and show that the three metal constituents of the La2Ni9Co alloys used to manufacture the batteries of electric vehicles can be separated and recovered by successive CO2-induced selective precipitations. Beyond the concept of CO2-sourced multi-level dynamic coordination chemistry, this study provides a potential framework for integrated CO2 capture and use through sustainable processes. Carbon capture technologies are poised to play an important role in reducing CO2 emissions to mitigate global warming, but their cost prevents their extensive use. Now, CO2 capture and utilization have been combined using a triple-level dynamic combinatorial approach. CO2 was spontaneously captured by industrial polyamines to create libraries of ligands that can be used for the separation and recovery of metals.},

Here, we combine stereospecific phosphorothioate substitution, precision nucleobase mutation and linear free-energy relationship measurements with molecular dynamics, molecular solvation theory and ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical free-energy simulations to gain insight into the catalysis. Through this confluence of theory and experiment, we unify the existing body of structural and functional data to unveil the catalytic mechanism in unprecedented detail, including the degree of proton transfer in the transition state. Further, we provide evidence for a critical Mg2+ in the active site that interacts with the scissile phosphate and anchors the general base guanine in position for nucleophile activation. This novel role for Mg2+ adds to the diversity of known catalytic RNA strategies and unifies functional features observed in the Varkud satellite, hairpin and hammerhead ribozyme classes. The Varkud satellite ribozyme, which catalyses site-specific RNA cleavage and ligation, is an important model to understand RNA catalysis. Now, a combination of theoretical and experimental work has revealed new details about its catalytic mechanism. Mg2+ is shown to play an important role in organizing the active site, and the proton transfers in the transition state have also been identified.},

  abstract     = {Competitive water adsorption can have a significant impact on metal–organic framework performance properties, ranging from occupying active sites in catalytic reactions to co-adsorbing at the most favourable adsorption sites in gas separation and storage applications. In this study, we investigate, for a metal–organic framework that is stable after moisture exposure, what are the reversible, loading-dependent structural changes that occur during water adsorption. Herein, a combination of in situ synchrotron powder and single-crystal diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and molecular modelling analysis was used to understand the important role of loading-dependent water effects in a water stable metal–organic framework. Through this analysis, insights into changes in crystallographic lattice parameters, water siting information and water-induced defect structure as a response to water loading were obtained. This work shows that, even in stable metal–organic frameworks that maintain their porosity and crystallinity after moisture exposure, important molecular-level structural changes can still occur during water adsorption due to guest–host interactions such as water-induced bond rearrangements. A stable zinc-based metal–organic framework known to retain its porosity and crystallinity after exposure to moisture has been shown to undergo structural changes at the molecular level on adsorbing water. This dynamic and reversible response to the presence of water, including the rearrangement of bonds, is suggested to be the reason for the hydrolytic stability of this particular metal–organic framework.},

Here we show a new, air-stable bimetallic scaffold that acts as a single-chromophore photocatalyst for hydrogen-gas generation and operates with irradiation wavelengths that span the ultraviolet to the red/near-infrared. Irradiation in acidic solutions that contain an electron donor results in the catalytic production of hydrogen with 170 ± 5 turnovers in 24 hours and an initial rate of 28 turnovers per hour. The catalysis proceeds through two stepwise excited-state redox events—atypical of the currently known homogeneous photocatalysis—and features the storage of multiple redox equivalents on a dirhodium catalyst enabled by low-energy light. Homogeneous photocatalysts for the conversion and storage of solar energy typically feature separate sensitizer–catalyst assemblies, whereas previous examples of single-chromophore single-molecule photocatalysts are inefficient and do not use significant portions of the visible spectrum. Now a dirhodium single-chromophore single-molecule catalyst has been developed that generates hydrogen using low-energy light through a previously unobserved mechanism.},

This strategy enables direct introduction of key hydroxyl groups and rapid construction of key bonds and stereocentres, facilitating the development of a concise route (7–12 steps from commercial materials) to eight oxidized meroterpenoids from two common molecular scaffolds. This work lays the foundation for rapid access to a wide range of oxidized meroterpenoids through the use of similar hybrid strategy that combines two synthetic approaches. Meroterpenoids are mixed terpenoid–polyketide natural products that exhibit a range of biological activities. A hybrid synthetic strategy that combines biocatalytic and radical-based methods has now been developed and it enables eight different oxidized meroterpenoids to be made in just 7–12 steps from commercially available materials.},

  abstract     = {Live-cell fluorescence nanoscopy is a powerful tool to study cellular biology on a molecular scale, yet its use is held back by the paucity of suitable fluorescent probes. Fluorescent probes based on regular fluorophores usually suffer from a low cell permeability and an unspecific background signal. Here we report a general strategy to transform regular fluorophores into fluorogenic probes with an excellent cell permeability and a low unspecific background signal. Conversion of a carboxyl group found in rhodamines and related fluorophores into an electron-deficient amide does not affect the spectroscopic properties of the fluorophore, but allows us to rationally tune the dynamic equilibrium between two different forms: a fluorescent zwitterion and a non-fluorescent, cell-permeable spirolactam. Furthermore, the equilibrium generally shifts towards the fluorescent form when the probe binds to its cellular targets. The resulting increase in fluorescence can be up to 1,000-fold. Using this simple design principle, we created fluorogenic probes in various colours for different cellular targets for wash-free, multicolour, live-cell nanoscopy. It is difficult to develop suitable fluorescent probes for live-cell nanoscopy, but a general strategy is now reported that can transform regular fluorophores into fluorogenic probes with excellent cell permeability and low unspecific background signals. Using this approach, probes in a variety of colours were developed for different cellular targets and used for wash-free, multicolour, live-cell confocal and STED microscopy.},

  abstract     = {The extremely broad infrared spectrum of water in the OH stretching region is a manifestation of how profoundly a water molecule is distorted when embedded in its extended hydrogen-bonding network. Many effects contribute to this breadth in solution at room temperature, which raises the question as to what the spectrum of a single OH oscillator would be in the absence of thermal fluctuations and coupling to nearby OH groups. We report the intrinsic spectral responses of isolated OH oscillators embedded in two cold (~20 K), hydrogen-bonded water cages adopted by the Cs+·(HDO)(D2O)19 and D3O+·(HDO)(D2O)19 clusters. Most OH oscillators yield single, isolated features that occur with linewidths that increase approximately linearly with their redshifts. Oscillators near 3,400 cm−1, however, occur with a second feature, which indicates that OH stretch excitation of these molecules drives low-frequency, phonon-type motions of the cage. The excited state lifetimes inferred from the broadening are considered in the context of fluctuations in the local electric fields that are available even at low temperature. The broad infrared spectrum of water in the OH stretching region shows how significantly a water molecule is distorted when within a hydrogen-bonding network; it also raises the question of what the spectrum of a single OH oscillator would be. Now, the spectral signatures of isolated OH oscillators embedded in cold water cages have been measured using vibrational spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {New drugs are desperately needed to combat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Here, we report screening commercial kinase inhibitors for antibacterial activity and found the anticancer drug sorafenib as major hit that effectively kills MRSA strains. Varying the key structural features led to the identification of a potent analogue, PK150, that showed antibacterial activity against several pathogenic strains at submicromolar concentrations. Furthermore, this antibiotic eliminated challenging persisters as well as established biofilms. PK150 holds promising therapeutic potential as it did not induce in vitro resistance, and shows oral bioavailability and in vivo efficacy. Analysis of the mode of action using chemical proteomics revealed several targets, which included interference with menaquinone biosynthesis by inhibiting demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase and the stimulation of protein secretion by altering the activity of signal peptidase IB. Reduced endogenous menaquinone levels along with enhanced levels of extracellular proteins of PK150-treated bacteria support this target hypothesis. The associated antibiotic effects, especially the lack of resistance development, probably stem from the compound’s polypharmacology. Screening commercial kinase inhibitors for antibacterial activity identified the anticancer drug sorafenib as a major hit. Subsequent structure–activity optimization created a new antibacterial analogue with high potency against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including challenging persisters and biofilms, as well as demonstrating efficacy in an in vivo mouse model. The mode of action involves stimulation of protein secretion and inhibition of menaquinone biosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {Inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals interfaced with spin-triplet exciton-accepting organic molecules have emerged as promising materials for converting incoherent long-wavelength light into the visible range. However, these materials to date have made exclusive use of nanocrystals containing toxic elements, precluding their use in biological or environmentally sensitive applications. Here, we address this challenge by chemically functionalizing non-toxic silicon nanocrystals with triplet-accepting anthracene ligands. Photoexciting these structures drives spin-triplet exciton transfer from silicon to anthracene through a single 15 ns Dexter energy transfer step with a nearly 50% yield. When paired with 9,10-diphenylanthracene emitters, these particles readily upconvert 488–640 nm photons to 425 nm violet light with efficiencies as high as 7 ± 0.9% and can be readily incorporated into aqueous micelles for biological use. Our demonstration of spin-triplet exciton transfer from silicon to molecular triplet acceptors can critically enable new technologies for solar energy conversion, quantum information and near-infrared driven photocatalysis. Quantum dots functionalized with energy-accepting dyes hold promise for converting low-energy photons into higher-energy visible light for bioimaging, catalysis and solar energy harvesting. Now, it has been shown that non-toxic silicon quantum dots can be used in these systems; the transfer of spin-triplet excitons to molecules at their surface has been observed.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of electrically conductive metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has led to applications in chemical sensing and electrical energy storage, among others. The most conductive MOFs are made from organic ligands and square-planar transition metal ions connected into two-dimensional (2D) sheets stacked on top of each other. Their electrical properties are thought to depend critically on the covalency of the metal–ligand bond, and less importance is given to out-of-plane charge transport. Here, we report a series of lanthanide-based MOFs that allow fine tuning of the sheet stacking. In these materials, the Ln3+ ions lie between the planes of the ligands, thus connecting organic layers into a 3D framework through lanthanide–oxygen chains. Here, efficient charge transport is found to occur primarily perpendicular to the 2D sheets. These results demonstrate that high conductivity in layered MOFs does not necessarily require a metal–ligand bond with highly covalent character, and that interactions between organic ligands alone can produce efficient charge transport pathways. High electrical conductivities in metal–organic frameworks—attractive for applications in sensing and energy storage—typically arise in layered MOFs from metal–ligand bonds with strong covalent character. Now, lanthanide-based MOFs have shown high out-of-plane conductivities originating instead from the π-stacking of organic ligands.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of scanning probe microscopy, it has become possible to study polymerization processes on suitable surfaces at the atomic level and in real space. In the two-dimensional confinement of a surface, polymerization reactions can give rise to the formation of unprecedented polymers with unique structures and properties, not accessible in solution. After a little over one decade since the discovery of covalent on-surface polymerization, we give an overview of the field, analyse the crucial aspects and critically reflect on the status quo. Specifically, we provide some general considerations about fundamental mechanisms as well as kinetics and thermodynamics of on-surface polymerization processes. The important role of the surface is detailed in view of its ability to control polymer formation with regard to structure, dimensionality and composition. Furthermore, examples that allow for locally induced polymerization are highlighted. Finally, we provide an analysis of scientific challenges in the field and outline future prospects. Growing polymers directly on surfaces has emerged as a powerful tool because it can provide a route to otherwise inaccessible structures such as defect-free linear chains, graphene nanoribbons and two-dimensional networks. This Review Article describes general principles and key aspects of this method from the perspectives of surface science and polymer chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Topological transitions between considerably different phases typically require harsh conditions to collectively break chemical bonds and overcome the stress caused to the original structure by altering its correlated bond environment. In this work we present a case system that can achieve rapid rearrangement of the whole lattice of a metal–organic framework through a domino alteration of the bond connectivity under mild conditions. The system transforms from a disordered metal–organic framework with low porosity to a highly porous and crystalline isomer within 40 s following activation (solvent exchange and desolvation), resulting in a substantial increase in surface area from 725 to 2,749 m2 g–1. Spectroscopic measurements show that this counter-intuitive lattice rearrangement involves a metastable intermediate that results from solvent removal on coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. This disordered–crystalline switch between two topological distinct metal–organic frameworks is shown to be reversible over four cycles through activation and reimmersion in polar solvents. A disordered metal–organic framework converts into a more porous, crystalline phase within 40 s following solvent exchange and desolvation. The rapid domino rearrangement of the whole lattice, which involves carboxylate migration on coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, is accompanied by a substantial increase in surface area.},

  abstract     = {Water oxidation is the key kinetic bottleneck of photoelectrochemical devices for fuel synthesis. Despite advances in the identification of intermediates, elucidating the catalytic mechanism of this multi-redox reaction on metal–oxide photoanodes remains a significant experimental and theoretical challenge. Here, we report an experimental analysis of water oxidation kinetics on four widely studied metal oxides, focusing particularly on haematite. We observe that haematite is able to access a reaction mechanism that is third order in surface-hole density, which is assigned to equilibration between three surface holes and M(OH)–O–M(OH) sites. This reaction exhibits low activation energy (Ea ≈ 60 meV). Density functional theory is used to determine the energetics of charge accumulation and O–O bond formation on a model haematite (110) surface. The proposed mechanism shows parallels with the function of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II, and provides new insights into the mechanism of heterogeneous water oxidation on a metal oxide surface. The oxidation of water remains the kinetic bottleneck of solar-to-fuel synthesis. Now, spectroelectrochemical evidence together with density functional theory calculations show that charge accumulation determines the reaction mechanism on metal–oxide photoanodes. These insights reveal features that are common to the mechanisms of water oxidation carried out by other inorganic and biological systems.},

  abstract     = {The development of robust catalytic methods to assemble tertiary alkylamines provides a continual challenge to chemical synthesis. In this regard, transformation of a traditionally unreactive C–H bond, proximal to the nitrogen atom, into a versatile chemical entity would be a powerful strategy for introducing functional complexity to tertiary alkylamines. A practical and selective metal-catalysed C(sp3)–H activation facilitated by the tertiary alkylamine functionality, however, remains an unsolved problem. Here, we report a Pd(ii)-catalysed protocol that appends arene feedstocks to tertiary alkylamines via C(sp3)–H functionalization. A simple ligand for Pd(ii) orchestrates the C–H activation step in favour of deleterious pathways. The reaction can use both simple and complex starting materials to produce a range of multifaceted γ-aryl tertiary alkylamines and can be rendered enantioselective. The enabling features of this transformation should be attractive to practitioners of synthetic and medicinal chemistry as well as in other areas that use biologically active alkylamines. A practical and selective palladium-catalysed process for C(sp3)–H arylation of tertiary alkylamines is enabled by the use of a simple amino acid-derived ligand. The reaction combines a range of multifaceted tertiary alkylamines with readily available aryl-boronic acids to form γ-aryl tertiary alkylamines and can also be performed enantioselectively.},

  abstract     = {Flavin-dependent ‘ene’-reductases (EREDs) are exquisite catalysts for effecting stereoselective reductions. Although these reactions typically proceed through a hydride transfer mechanism, we recently found that EREDs can also catalyse reductive dehalogenations and cyclizations via single electron transfer mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that these enzymes can catalyse redox-neutral radical cyclizations to produce enantioenriched oxindoles from α-haloamides. This transformation is a C–C bond-forming reaction currently unknown in nature and one for which there are no catalytic asymmetric examples. Mechanistic studies indicate the reaction proceeds via the flavin semiquinone/quinone redox couple, where ground-state flavin semiquinone provides the electron for substrate reduction and flavin quinone oxidizes the vinylogous α-amido radical formed after cyclization. This mechanistic manifold was previously unknown for this enzyme family, highlighting the versatility of EREDs in asymmetric synthesis. Flavin-dependent ‘ene’-reductases have now been shown to catalyse redox-neutral radical cyclizations of α-haloamides to form enantioenriched oxindoles. Mechanistic studies indicate the reaction proceeds via the flavin semiquinone/quinone redox couple, where a ground state flavin semiquinone provides the electron for substrate reduction and flavin quinone oxidizes the radical formed after cyclization.},

  abstract     = {Singlet fission promises to surpass the Shockley–Queisser limit for single-junction solar cell efficiency through the production of two electron–hole pairs per incident photon. However, this promise has not been fulfilled because singlet fission produces two low-energy triplet excitons that have been unexpectedly difficult to dissociate into free charges. To understand this phenomenon, we study charge separation from triplet excitons in polycrystalline pentacene using an electrochemical series of 12 different guest electron-acceptor molecules with varied reduction potentials. We observe separate optima in the charge yield as a function of driving force for singlet and triplet excitons, including inverted regimes for the dissociation of both states. Molecular acceptors can thus provide a strategic advantage to singlet fission solar cells by suppressing singlet dissociation at optimal driving forces for triplet dissociation. However, even at the optimal driving force, the rate constant for charge transfer from the triplet state is surprisingly small, ~107 s−1, presenting a previously unidentified obstacle to the design of efficient singlet fission solar cells. Singlet fission produces two low-energy triplet excitons that are difficult to dissociate into free charges. Now, separate optima in charge yield have been observed as a function of driving force for singlet and triplet excitons in pentacene. At optimal driving forces, the triplet-exciton dissociation rate is at least five orders of magnitude smaller than the singlet-exciton dissociation rate.},

  abstract     = {Photoredox catalysis, especially in combination with transition metal catalysis, can produce redox states of transition metal catalysts to facilitate challenging bond formations that are not readily accessible in conventional redox catalysis. For arene functionalization, metallophotoredox catalysis has successfully made use of the same leaving groups as those valuable in conventional cross-coupling catalysis, such as bromide. Yet the redox potentials of common photoredox catalysts are not sufficient to reduce most aryl bromides, so synthetically useful aryl radicals are often not directly available. Therefore, the development of a distinct leaving group more appropriately matched in redox potential could enable new reactivity manifolds for metallophotoredox catalysis, especially if arylcopper(iii) complexes are accessible, from which the most challenging bond-forming reactions can occur. Here we show the conceptual advantages of aryl thianthrenium salts for metallophotoredox catalysis, and their utility in site-selective late-stage aromatic fluorination. Despite the potential of fluorinated compounds in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, the formation of C–F bonds remains challenging. It has now been shown that aryl sulfonium salts, which can be made by site-selective C–H functionalization, have advantageous photoredox reactivity compared to conventional (pseudo)halides and can be used for late-stage C–H fluorination.},

Here we present an electrochemical interface that permits expanded multiplexed reporting for cell-free gene-circuit-based sensors. We have engineered a scalable system of reporter enzymes that cleave specific DNA sequences in solution, which results in an electrochemical signal when these newly liberated strands are captured at the surface of a nanostructured microelectrode. We describe the development of this interface and show its utility using a ligand-inducible gene circuit and toehold switch-based sensors by demonstrating the detection of multiple antibiotic resistance genes in parallel. This technology has the potential to expand the field of synthetic biology by providing an interface for materials, hardware and software. Gene-circuit-based sensors have, to date, largely relied on optical proteins (such as green fluorescent protein) to report the output, which limits the signalling bandwidth. Now, an electrochemical output has been developed and integrated with cell-free gene circuits.

In organic semiconductors exhibiting singlet fission, the geometric relationship between molecules plays an important role by setting the intermolecular couplings that determine the system energetics. Here, we spatially image TIPS-pentacene microcrystals using ultrafast two-dimensional white-light microscopy and discover a low-energy singlet state sparsely distributed throughout the microcrystals, with higher concentrations at edges and morphological defects. The spectra of these singlet states are consistent with slip-stacked molecular geometries and increased charge-transfer couplings. The picosecond-timescale kinetics of these low-energy singlet states matches that of the correlated triplet-pair state, which we attribute to singlet/triplet-pair interconversion at these sites. Our observations support the conclusion that small populations of geometries with favourable energetics can play outsized roles in singlet fission processes. Intermolecular coupling plays a critical role in singlet fission. Now, high-resolution 2D white-light spectroscopy has been used to map the presence of non-equilibrium molecular packing in single TIPS-pentacene microcrystals and characterize its effect on the dynamics of singlet fission.},

  abstract     = {Aluminium anions with an unoccupied orbital are generally considered as highly difficult synthetic targets, as aluminium is the most electropositive element in the p block. Stabilizing effects from two nitrogen substituents and/or the coordination of a Lewis base were recently used to synthesize the first examples of anionic nucleophilic aluminium species. Here we show the synthesis and properties of a potassium salt of a non-stabilized dialkylaluminium anion that exhibits very strong basicity, which reflects the electropositive character of aluminium. An X-ray diffraction analysis revealed a monomeric structure and the shortest Al–K distance hitherto reported. The ultraviolet visible spectrum in combination with density functional theory calculations suggests an electronic structure characterized by a lone pair of electrons and an unoccupied p orbital on the aluminium centre. This species readily deprotonates benzene to form the corresponding (hydrido)(phenyl)aluminate. Reactions with other electrophiles corroborate the nucleophilicity of the aluminium centre. Owing to the electropositive character of aluminium it is difficult to prepare Al anions; the few that exist are supported by nitrogen ligands. Now, a dialkyl-alumanyl anion has been synthesized that features a polar Al–K bond. This anion reacts as a very strong base that deprotonates benzene, and undergoes nucleophilic substitution reactions.},

  abstract     = {DNA, when folded into nanostructures with a specific shape, is capable of spacing and arranging binding sites into a complex geometric pattern with nanometre precision. Here we demonstrate a designer DNA nanostructure that can act as a template to display multiple binding motifs with precise spatial pattern-recognition properties, and that this approach can confer exceptional sensing and potent viral inhibitory capabilities. A star-shaped DNA architecture, carrying five molecular beacon-like motifs, was constructed to display ten dengue envelope protein domain III (ED3)-targeting aptamers into a two-dimensional pattern precisely matching the spatial arrangement of ED3 clusters on the dengue (DENV) viral surface. The resulting multivalent interactions provide high DENV-binding avidity. We show that this structure is a potent viral inhibitor and that it can act as a sensor by including a fluorescent output to report binding. Our molecular-platform design strategy could be adapted to detect and combat other disease-causing pathogens by generating the requisite ligand patterns on customized DNA nanoarchitectures. DNA is capable of self-assembling into a wide range of user-defined structures and so can be used as a scaffold to arrange binding motifs with nanometre precision. Now, DNA has been used to accurately display aptamers that fit the repeated epitope pattern of a dengue viral antigen to produce a nanostructure that can be a potent viral inhibitor or a fluorescent sensor.},

  abstract     = {Over the past ten years, there have been several high-profile accidents in academic laboratories around the world, resulting in significant injuries and fatalities. The aftermath of these incidents is often characterized by calls for reflection and re-examination of the academic discipline’s approach to safety research and policy. However, the study of academic lab safety is still underdeveloped and necessary data about changes in safety attitudes and behaviours has not been gathered. This Review article critically examines the state of academic chemical safety research from a multifactorial stance, including research on the occurrence of lab accidents, contributors to lab accidents, the state of safety training research and the cultural barriers to conducting safety research and implementing safer lab practices. The Review concludes by delineating research questions that must be addressed to minimize future serious academic laboratory incidents as well as stressing the need for committed leadership from our research institutions. Despite the regular occurrence of high-profile accidents leading to serious injuries or deaths among lab personnel, the state of academic lab safety research has languished. Existing studies in this area are summarized and critiqued in this Review and suggestions are made for future research directions.},
