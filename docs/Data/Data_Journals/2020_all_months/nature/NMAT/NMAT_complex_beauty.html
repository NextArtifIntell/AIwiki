  abstract     = {Nanoparticle delivery to solid tumours over the past ten years has stagnated at a median of 0.7% of the injected dose. Varying nanoparticle designs and strategies have yielded only minor improvements. Here we discovered a dose threshold for improving nanoparticle tumour delivery: 1 trillion nanoparticles in mice. Doses above this threshold overwhelmed Kupffer cell uptake rates, nonlinearly decreased liver clearance, prolonged circulation and increased nanoparticle tumour delivery. This enabled up to 12% tumour delivery efficiency and delivery to 93% of cells in tumours, and also improved the therapeutic efficacy of Caelyx/Doxil. This threshold was robust across different nanoparticle types, tumour models and studies across ten years of the literature. Our results have implications for human translation and highlight a simple, but powerful, principle for designing nanoparticle cancer treatments. Efficient nanoparticle delivery into tumours has been a challenge in the field. It is now shown that the efficiency can be improved substantially when the dose breaches a specific threshold.},

Herein, we exploit regioselective depletion interactions to engineer the directional bonding and assembly of non-spherical colloidal hybrid microparticles. We report that the crystallization of a binary colloidal mixture can be regulated by tuning the depletion conditions. Subsequently, we fabricate triblock biphasic colloids with controlled aspect ratios to achieve regioselective bonding. Without any surface treatment, these biphasic colloids assemble into various colloidal superstructures and superlattices featuring optimized pole-to-pole or centre-to-centre interactions. Additionally, we observe polymorphic crystallization, quantify the abundancy of each form using algorithms we developed and investigate the crystallization process in real time. We demonstrate selective control of attractive interactions between specific regions on an anisotropic colloid with no need of site-specific surface functionalization, leading to a general method for achieving colloidal structures with yet unforeseen arrangements and properties. Hybrid colloidal suprastructures and superlattices are assembled by exploring depletion forces to selectively control the interactions between colloidal particles.},

  abstract     = {The combination of well-defined molecular cavities and chemical functionality makes crystalline porous solids attractive for a great number of technological applications, from catalysis to gas separation. However, in contrast to other widely applied synthetic solids such as polymers, the lack of processability of crystalline extended solids hampers their application. In this work, we demonstrate that metal–organic frameworks, a type of highly crystalline porous solid, can be made solution processable via outer surface functionalization using N-heterocyclic carbene ligands. Selective outer surface functionalization of relatively large nanoparticles (250 nm) of the well-known zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-67 allows for the stabilization of processable dispersions exhibiting permanent porosity. The resulting type III porous liquids can either be directly deployed as liquid adsorbents or be co-processed with state-of-the-art polymers to yield highly loaded mixed matrix membranes with excellent mechanical properties and an outstanding performance in the challenging separation of propylene from propane. We anticipate that this approach can be extended to other metal–organic frameworks and other applications. Solution processability is required for many industrial processes, but metal–organic frameworks are in general not dispersible, hindering their application. Here, a surface modification is reported that allows porous liquid formation and so synthesis of highly loaded and mechanically robust mixed matrix membranes.},

Here, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy was used to reveal the evolving nanostructure of Li metal deposits at various transient states in the nucleation and growth process, in which a disorder–order phase transition was observed as a function of current density and deposition time. The atomic interaction over wide spatial and temporal scales was depicted by reactive molecular dynamics simulations to assist in understanding the kinetics. Compared to crystalline Li, glassy Li outperforms in electrochemical reversibility, and it has a desired structure for high-energy rechargeable Li batteries. Our findings correlate the crystallinity of the nuclei with the subsequent growth of the nanostructure and morphology, and provide strategies to control and shape the mesostructure of Li metal to achieve high performance in rechargeable Li batteries. Lithium metal is considered an ideal anode for high-energy rechargeable lithium batteries, but understanding its nucleation and growth at the nanoscale remains challenging.

  abstract     = {Charge-transfer (CT) complexes, formed by electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor, play a crucial role in organic semiconductors. Excited-state CT complexes, termed exciplexes, harness both singlet and triplet excitons for light emission, and are thus useful for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, present exciplex emitters often suffer from low photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs), due to limited control over the relative orientation, electronic coupling and non-radiative recombination channels of the donor and acceptor subunits. Here, we use a rigid linker to control the spacing and relative orientation of the donor and acceptor subunits, as demonstrated with a series of intramolecular exciplex emitters based on 10-phenyl-9,10-dihydroacridine and 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine. Sky-blue OLEDs employing one of these emitters achieve an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.4% at 67 cd m−2 with only minor efficiency roll-off (EQE = 24.4%) at a higher luminous intensity of 1,000 cd m−2. As a control experiment, devices using chemically and structurally related but less rigid emitters reach substantially lower EQEs. These design rules are transferrable to other donor/acceptor combinations, which will allow further tuning of emission colour and other key optoelectronic properties. The use of rigid linkers to control the relative position and interaction of donor and acceptor units in exciplex emitters leads to the realization of organic light-emitting devices with enhanced external quantum efficiency.},

Here, we use high-efficiency perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells and redox flow batteries based on robust BTMAP-Vi/NMe-TEMPO redox couples to realize a high-performance and stable solar flow battery device. Numerical analysis methods enable the rational design of both components, achieving an optimal voltage match. These efforts led to a solar-to-output electricity efficiency of 20.1% for solar flow batteries, as well as improved device lifetime, solar power conversion utilization ratio and capacity utilization rate. The conceptual design strategy presented here also suggests general future optimization approaches for integrated solar energy conversion and storage systems.

In this work, we demonstrate control of isolated 29Si nuclear spins in silicon carbide (SiC) to create an entangled state between an optically active divacancy spin and a strongly coupled nuclear register. We then show how isotopic engineering of SiC unlocks control of single weakly coupled nuclear spins and present an ab initio method to predict the optimal isotopic fraction that maximizes the number of usable nuclear memories. We bolster these results by reporting high-fidelity electron spin control (F = 99.984(1)%), alongside extended coherence times (Hahn-echo T2 = 2.3 ms, dynamical decoupling T2DD &amp;gt; 14.5 ms), and a &amp;gt;40-fold increase in Ramsey spin dephasing time (T2*) from isotopic purification. Overall, this work underlines the importance of controlling the nuclear environment in solid-state systems and links single photon emitters with nuclear registers in an industrially scalable material.

  abstract     = {A fundamental understanding of hot-carrier dynamics in photo-excited metal nanostructures is needed to unlock their potential for photodetection and photocatalysis. Despite numerous studies on the ultrafast dynamics of hot electrons, so far, the temporal evolution of hot holes in metal–semiconductor heterostructures remains unknown. Here, we report ultrafast (t &amp;lt; 200 fs) hot-hole injection from Au nanoparticles into the valence band of p-type GaN. The removal of hot holes from below the Au Fermi level is observed to substantially alter the thermalization dynamics of hot electrons, reducing the peak electronic temperature and the electron–phonon coupling time of the Au nanoparticles. First-principles calculations reveal that hot-hole injection modifies the relaxation dynamics of hot electrons in Au nanoparticles by modulating the electronic structure of the metal on timescales commensurate with electron–electron scattering. These results advance our understanding of hot-hole dynamics in metal–semiconductor heterostructures and offer additional strategies for manipulating the dynamics of hot carriers on ultrafast timescales. Photo-excited gold nanoparticles are shown to provide ultrafast and efficient hot-hole injection to the valence band of p-type GaN, substantially altering hot-electron dynamics in the nanoparticles and forming a basis to design hot-hole-based optoelectronics.},

Advances in moiré engineering stem from the formation of peculiar moiré superlattices at small, specific twist angles. Here we report configurable nanoscale light–matter waves—phonon polaritons—by twisting stacked α-phase molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO3) slabs over a broad range of twist angles from 0° to 90°. Our combined experimental and theoretical results reveal a variety of polariton wavefront geometries and topological transitions as a function of the twist angle. In contrast to the origin of the modified electronic band structure in moiré superlattices, the polariton twisting configuration is attributed to the electromagnetic interaction of highly anisotropic hyperbolic polaritons in stacked α-MoO3 slabs. These results indicate twisted α-MoO3 to be a promising platform for nanophotonic devices with tunable functionalities. Infrared nanoimaging of phonon polaritons in twisted α-phase molybdenum trioxide bilayers reveals tunable wavefront geometries and topological transitions over a broad range of twist angles, offering a configurable platform for nanophotonic applications.},

Here, we demonstrate a ledge-directed epitaxy (LDE) of dense arrays of continuous, self-aligned, monolayer and single-crystalline MoS2 nanoribbons on β-gallium (iii) oxide (β-Ga2O3) (100) substrates. LDE MoS2 nanoribbons have spatial uniformity over a long range and transport characteristics on par with those seen in exfoliated benchmarks. Prototype MoS2-nanoribbon-based field-effect transistors exhibit high on/off ratios of 108 and an averaged room temperature electron mobility of 65 cm2 V−1 s−1. The MoS2 nanoribbons can be readily transferred to arbitrary substrates while the underlying β-Ga2O3 can be reused after mechanical exfoliation. We further demonstrate LDE as a versatile epitaxy platform for the growth of p-type WSe2 nanoribbons and lateral heterostructures made of p-WSe2 and n-MoS2 nanoribbons for futuristic electronics applications. Aligned arrays of single-crystalline monolayer TMD nanoribbons with high aspect ratios, as well as their lateral heterostructures, are realized, with the growth directed by the ledges on the β-Ga2O3 substrate.

The discovery of two-dimensional layered magnetic materials3–8 presents a new platform to explore the magnetostriction effects in ultrathin solids. Here we demonstrate an exchange-driven magnetostriction effect in mechanical resonators made of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic CrI3. The mechanical resonance frequency is found to depend on the magnetic state of the material. We quantify the relative importance of the exchange and anisotropy magnetostriction by measuring the resonance frequency under a magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the easy axis, respectively. Furthermore, we show efficient strain-tuning of the internal magnetic interactions in two-dimensional CrI3 as a result of inverse magnetostriction. Our results establish the basis for mechanical detection and control of magnetic states and magnetic phase transitions in two-dimensional layered materials. A coupling of mechanical vibrations and magnetism and strain-tuning of the exchange interactions, is demonstrated for few-layer CrI3.},

  abstract     = {Strong magnetization fluctuations are expected near the thermodynamic critical point of a continuous magnetic phase transition. Such critical fluctuations are highly correlated and in principle can occur at any time and length scales1; they govern critical phenomena and potentially can drive new phases2,3. Although critical phenomena in magnetic materials have been studied using neutron scattering, magnetic a.c. susceptibility and other techniques4–6, direct real-time imaging of critical magnetization fluctuations remains elusive. Here we develop a fast and sensitive magneto-optical imaging microscope to achieve wide-field, real-time monitoring of critical magnetization fluctuations in single-layer ferromagnetic insulator CrBr3. We track the critical phenomena directly from the fluctuation correlations and observe both slowing-down dynamics and enhanced correlation length. Through real-time feedback control of the critical fluctuations, we further achieve switching of magnetic states solely by electrostatic gating. The ability to directly image and control critical fluctuations in 2D magnets opens up exciting opportunities to explore critical phenomena and develop applications in nanoscale engines and information science. The development of a magneto-optical imaging technique enables the real-time imaging and control of critical magnetic fluctuations in the single-layer ferromagnetic insulator CrBr3.},

Azido-labelled DCs were detected in lymph nodes for weeks, and could covalently capture dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-bearing antigens and adjuvants via efficient Click chemistry for improved antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and antitumour efficacy. We also show that azido labelling of DCs allowed for in vitro and in vivo conjugation of DBCO-modified cytokines, including DBCO–IL-15/IL-15Rα, to improve priming of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. This DC labelling and targeted modulation technology provides an unprecedented strategy for manipulating DCs and regulating DC–T-cell interactions in vivo. Dendritic cells concentrated in vivo within a hydrogel have been metabolically tagged with azido groups to enable tracking as well as delivery of antigens, adjuvants and cytokines, thereby facilitating targeted immunomodulation.},

The impact surface of the fast-striking dactyl club from the mantis shrimp is an example of one such composite material; the shrimp has evolved the capability to localize damage and avoid catastrophic failure from high-speed collisions during its feeding activities. Here we report that the dactyl club of mantis shrimps contains an impact-resistant coating composed of densely packed (about 88 per cent by volume) ~65-nm bicontinuous nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite integrated within an organic matrix. These mesocrystalline hydroxyapatite nanoparticles are assembled from small, highly aligned nanocrystals. Under impacts of high strain rates (around 104 s−1), particles rotate and translate, whereas the nanocrystalline networks fracture at low-angle grain boundaries, form dislocations and undergo amorphization. The interpenetrating organic network provides additional toughening, as well as substantial damping, with a loss coefficient of around 0.02. An unusual combination of stiffness and damping is therefore achieved, outperforming many engineered materials. A coating made from densely packed hydroxyapatite particles in an organic matrix endows the dactyl club of mantis shrimps with high stiffness and energy damping.},

Here, we introduce high-strength synthetic proteins that self-heal micro- and macro-scale mechanical damage within a second by local heating. These materials are optimized systematically to improve their hydrogen-bonded nanostructure and network morphology, with programmable healing properties (2–23 MPa strength after 1 s of healing) that surpass by several orders of magnitude those of other natural and synthetic soft materials. Such healing performance creates new opportunities for bioinspired materials design, and addresses current limitations in self-healing materials for soft robotics and personal protective equipment. Protein-based materials for soft robotics that self-heal within a second while maintaining the high strength of the damaged area are reported.},

  abstract     = {The doublet-spin nature of radical emitters is advantageous for applications in organic light-emitting diodes, as it avoids the formation of triplet excitons that limit the electroluminescence efficiency of non-radical emitters. However, radicals generally show low optical absorption and photoluminescence yields. Here we explain the poor optical properties of radicals based on alternant hydrocarbons, and establish design rules to increase the absorption and luminescence yields for donor–acceptor-type radicals. We show that non-alternant systems are necessary to lift the degeneracy of the lowest energy orbital excitations; moreover, intensity borrowing from an intense high-lying transition by the low-energy charge-transfer excitation enhances the oscillator strength of the emitter. We apply these rules to design tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl–pyridoindolyl derivatives with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&amp;gt;90%). Organic light-emitting diodes based on these molecules showed a pure-red emission with an over 12% external quantum efficiency.

  abstract     = {This contribution reports the discovery and analysis of a p-block Sn-based catalyst for the electroreduction of molecular oxygen in acidic conditions at fuel cell cathodes; the catalyst is free of platinum-group metals and contains single-metal-atom actives sites coordinated by nitrogen. The prepared SnNC catalysts meet and exceed state-of-the-art FeNC catalysts in terms of intrinsic catalytic turn-over frequency and hydrogen–air fuel cell power density. The SnNC-NH3 catalysts displayed a 40–50% higher current density than FeNC-NH3 at cell voltages below 0.7 V. Additional benefits include a highly favourable selectivity for the four-electron reduction pathway and a Fenton-inactive character of Sn. A range of analytical techniques combined with density functional theory calculations indicate that stannic Sn(iv)Nx single-metal sites with moderate oxygen chemisorption properties and low pyridinic N coordination numbers act as catalytically active moieties. The superior proton-exchange membrane fuel cell performance of SnNC cathode catalysts under realistic, hydrogen–air fuel cell conditions, particularly after NH3 activation treatment, makes them a promising alternative to today’s state-of-the-art Fe-based catalysts. For oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation reactions, proton-exchange membrane fuel cells typically rely on precious-metal-based catalysts. A p-block single-metal-site tin/nitrogen-doped carbon is shown to exhibit promising electrocatalytic and fuel cell performance.},

  abstract     = {A remaining challenge for the deployment of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells is the limited durability of platinum (Pt) nanoscale materials that operate at high voltages during the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction. In this work, atomic-scale insight into well-defined single-crystalline, thin-film and nanoscale surfaces exposed Pt dissolution trends that governed the design and synthesis of durable materials. A newly defined metric, intrinsic dissolution, is essential to understanding the correlation between the measured Pt loss, surface structure, size and ratio of Pt nanoparticles in a carbon (C) support. It was found that the utilization of a gold (Au) underlayer promotes ordering of Pt surface atoms towards a (111) structure, whereas Au on the surface selectively protects low-coordinated Pt sites. This mitigation strategy was applied towards 3 nm Pt3Au/C nanoparticles and resulted in the elimination of Pt dissolution in the liquid electrolyte, which included a 30-fold durability improvement versus 3 nm Pt/C over an extended potential range up to 1.2 V. Deployment of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells is limited by the durability of Pt-nanoscale catalysts during cathodic oxygen reduction reactions. Dissolution processes on single crystalline and thin film surfaces are now correlated leading to the design of PtAu catalysts with suppressed dissolution.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the electronic energy landscape in metal halide perovskites is essential for further improvements in their promising performance in thin-film photovoltaics. Here, we uncover the presence of above-bandgap oscillatory features in the absorption spectra of formamidinium lead triiodide thin films. We attribute these discrete features to intrinsically occurring quantum confinement effects, for which the related energies change with temperature according to the inverse square of the intrinsic lattice parameter, and with peak index in a quadratic manner. By determining the threshold film thickness at which the amplitude of the peaks is appreciably decreased, and through ab initio simulations of the absorption features, we estimate the length scale of confinement to be 10–20 nm. Such absorption peaks present a new and intriguing quantum electronic phenomenon in a nominally bulk semiconductor, offering intrinsic nanoscale optoelectronic properties without necessitating cumbersome additional processing steps. Oscillatory features in the absorption spectra of formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite thin films reveal the occurrence of intrinsic quantum confinement effects with confinement on the scale of tens of nanometres.},

  abstract     = {Utilizing quantum effects in complex oxides, such as magnetism, multiferroicity and superconductivity, requires atomic-level control of the material’s structure and composition. In contrast, the continuous conductivity changes that enable artificial oxide-based synapses and multiconfigurational devices are driven by redox reactions and domain reconfigurations, which entail long-range ionic migration and changes in stoichiometry or structure. Although both concepts hold great technological potential, combined applications seem difficult due to the mutually exclusive requirements. Here we demonstrate a route to overcome this limitation by controlling the conductivity in the functional oxide hexagonal Er(Mn,Ti)O3 by using conductive atomic force microscopy to generate electric-field induced anti-Frenkel defects, that is, charge-neutral interstitial–vacancy pairs. These defects are generated with nanoscale spatial precision to locally enhance the electronic hopping conductivity by orders of magnitude without disturbing the ferroelectric order. We explain the non-volatile effects using density functional theory and discuss its universality, suggesting an alternative dimension to functional oxides and the development of multifunctional devices for next-generation nanotechnology. Combining quantum effects with conductivity modulation in complex oxides requires mutually exclusive criteria, making applications difficult. Using tip-induced electrical generation of anti-Frenkel defects, conducting features in Er(Mn,Ti)O3 are written with nanoscale precision while keeping structural integrity.},

Here, we show that dead layers with low Li concentration located at the surface of LiNbO3 ferroelectric materials can function as unipolar selectors. LiNbO3 mesa cells were etched from a single-crystal LiNbO3 substrate, and Pt metal contacts were deposited on their sides. Poling induced non-volatile switching of ferroelectric domains in the cell, and volatile switching in the domains in the interfacial (dead) layers, with the domain walls created within the substrate being electrically conductive. These features were also confirmed using single-crystal LiNbO3 thin films bonded to SiO2/Si wafers. The fabricated nanoscale mesa-structured memory cell with an embedded interfacial-layer selector shows a high on-to-off ratio (&amp;gt;106) and high switching endurance (~1010 cycles), showing potential for the fabrication of crossbar arrays of ferroelectric domain wall memories. An integrated one selector–one resistor device is realized using the volatile and non-volatile switching properties of ferroelectric domains created, respectively, at the interface and in the bulk of mesa-like LiNbO3 domain wall memory cells.},

A well-known example is the metal–insulator transition, which has been shown to be highly controllable. However, the length scale over which these phases can be established is not yet well understood. To gain insight into this issue, we atomically engineered an artificially phase-separated system through fabricating epitaxial superlattices that consist of SmNiO3 and NdNiO3, two materials that undergo a metal-to-insulator transition at different temperatures. We demonstrate that the length scale of the interfacial coupling between metal and insulator phases is determined by balancing the energy cost of the boundary between a metal and an insulator and the bulk phase energies. Notably, we show that the length scale of this effect exceeds that of the physical coupling of structural motifs, which introduces a new framework for interface-engineering properties at temperatures against the bulk energetics. The characteristic length scale and mechanism of the metal–insulator transition in nickelate superlattices is addressed, with implications for the design of oxide electronics.},

Refractory high-entropy alloys have drawn particular attention due to their high melting points and excellent softening resistance, which are the two key requirements for high-temperature applications. Their compositional space is immense even after considering cost and recyclability restrictions, providing abundant design opportunities. However, refractory high-entropy alloys often exhibit apparent brittleness and oxidation susceptibility, which remain important challenges for their processing and application. Here, utilizing natural-mixing characteristics among refractory elements, we designed a Ti38V15Nb23Hf24 refractory high-entropy alloy that exhibits &amp;gt;20% tensile ductility in the as-cast state, and physicochemical stability at high temperatures. Exploring the underlying deformation mechanisms across multiple length scales, we observe that a rare β′-phase plays an intriguing role in the mechanical response of this alloy. These results reveal the effectiveness of natural-mixing tendencies in expediting high-entropy alloy discovery. A refractory high-entropy alloy was designed with the composition chosen based on the natural-mixing characteristics among refractory elements; this alloy demonstrates good tensile ductility in the as-cast state and physicochemical stability at high temperatures.},

Despite more than five decades of intensive study, relaxor ferroelectrics remain one of the least understood material families in ferroelectric materials and condensed matter physics5–14. Here, by combining X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscope infrared spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we reveal that the relaxor behaviour of ferroelectric polymers originates from conformational disorder, completely different from classic perovskite relaxors, which are typically characterized by chemical disorder. We show that chain chirality is essential to the formation of the disordered helix conformation arising from local distortions of gauche torsional angles, which consequently give rise to relaxor properties in polymers. This study not only sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms of relaxor ferroelectrics, but also offers guidance for the discovery of new ferroelectric relaxor organic materials for flexible, scalable and biocompatible sensor and energy applications. Relaxor ferroelectric polymers are a material of choice for applications such as electrostrictive actuators or electrocaloric cooling. Here, the origin of relaxor behaviour at the molecular level is investigated and found to arise from conformational disorder.},

Here we demonstrate electro-optic switching and modulation from room temperature down to 4 K by using the Pockels effect in integrated barium titanate (BaTiO3) devices3. We investigate the temperature dependence of the nonlinear optical properties of BaTiO3, showing an effective Pockels coefficient of 200 pm V−1 at 4 K. The fabricated devices show an electro-optic bandwidth of 30 GHz, ultralow-power tuning that is 109 times more efficient than thermal tuning, and high-speed data modulation at 20 Gbps. Our results demonstrate a missing component for cryogenic PICs, removing major roadblocks for the realization of cryogenic-compatible systems in the field of quantum computing, supercomputing and sensing, and for interfacing those systems with instrumentation at room temperature.

  abstract     = {Cells comprise mechanically active matter that governs their functionality, but intracellular mechanics are difficult to study directly and are poorly understood. However, injected nanodevices open up opportunities to analyse intracellular mechanobiology. Here, we identify a programme of forces and changes to the cytoplasmic mechanical properties required for mouse embryo development from fertilization to the first cell division. Injected, fully internalized nanodevices responded to sperm decondensation and recondensation, and subsequent device behaviour suggested a model for pronuclear convergence based on a gradient of effective cytoplasmic stiffness. The nanodevices reported reduced cytoplasmic mechanical activity during chromosome alignment and indicated that cytoplasmic stiffening occurred during embryo elongation, followed by rapid cytoplasmic softening during cytokinesis (cell division). Forces greater than those inside muscle cells were detected within embryos. These results suggest that intracellular forces are part of a concerted programme that is necessary for development at the origin of a new embryonic life. Mechanical properties and forces sculpt the behaviour of cells in living organisms. Silicon-based nanochips implanted into mouse one-cell embryos have been used to reveal mechanical changes during the early onset of embryonic development.},

The ability to prepare such materials allows the study of near-ideal glassy systems. We report the preparation and characterization of stable glasses of polymers prepared by physical vapour deposition. By controlling the substrate temperature, deposition rate and polydispersity, we prepared and characterized a variety of stable polymer glasses. These materials display the kinetic stability, low fictive temperatures and high-density characteristic of stable glasses. Extrapolation of the measured transformation times between the stable and normal glass provides estimates of the relaxation times of the equilibrium supercooled liquid at temperatures as much as 30 K below the glass transition temperature. These results demonstrate that polymer stable glasses are an exciting and powerful tool in the study of ultrastable glass and disordered materials in general. The physical vapour deposition of ultrastable monodispersed polymer glasses is reported. This technique allows for the high tunability of glass transition temperatures of the deposited polymers, which could be useful for technological applications.},

We have developed a versatile gelatin-based biogel, which is highly resilient with outstanding elastic characteristics, yet degrades fully when disposed. It self-adheres, is rapidly healable and derived entirely from natural and food-safe constituents. We merge all the favourable attributes in one material that is easy to reproduce and scalable, and has a low-cost production under ambient conditions. This biogel is a step towards durable, life-like soft robotic and electronic systems that are sustainable and closely mimic their natural antetypes. Stretchable and biodegradable elastic biogels based on gelatin, glucose, glycerol and citric acid are realized, whose mechanical properties can be adapted to a broad range of applications in soft robotics and wearable electronics.},

Superconcentrated ionic-liquid electrolytes (for example 1:1 ionic liquid:alkali ion) coupled with anode preconditioning at more negative potentials can completely mitigate these issues, and therefore revolutionize high-density energy storage devices. However, the mechanisms by which very high salt concentration and preconditioning potential enable uniform metal deposition and prevent dendrite formation at the metal anode during cycling are poorly understood, and therefore not optimized. Here, we use atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to unravel the influence of these factors on the interface chemistry in a sodium electrolyte, demonstrating how a molten-salt-like structure at the electrode surface results in dendrite-free metal cycling at higher rates. Such a structure will support the formation of a more favourable solid electrolyte interphase, accepted as being a critical factor in stable battery cycling. This new understanding will enable engineering of efficient anode electrodes by tuning the interfacial nanostructure via salt concentration and high-voltage preconditioning. Non-uniform metal deposition and dendrite formation reduce the efficiency, safety and life of batteries with metal anodes. The influence of these factors in a sodium electrolyte now shows how a molten-salt-like structure at the electrode surface results in dendrite-free metal cycling at higher rates.},

  abstract     = {In the synthesis of inorganic materials, reactions often yield non-equilibrium kinetic byproducts instead of the thermodynamic equilibrium phase. Understanding the competition between thermodynamics and kinetics is a fundamental step towards the rational synthesis of target materials. Here, we use in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction to investigate the multistage crystallization pathways of the important two-layer (P2) sodium oxides Na0.67MO2 (M = Co, Mn). We observe a series of fast non-equilibrium phase transformations through metastable three-layer O3, O3′ and P3 phases before formation of the equilibrium two-layer P2 polymorph. We present a theoretical framework to rationalize the observed phase progression, demonstrating that even though P2 is the equilibrium phase, compositionally unconstrained reactions between powder precursors favour the formation of non-equilibrium three-layered intermediates. These insights can guide the choice of precursors and parameters employed in the solid-state synthesis of ceramic materials, and constitutes a step forward in unravelling the complex interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics during materials synthesis. Understanding the competition between thermodynamics and kinetics is crucial for the rational synthesis of inorganic materials. The synthesis of two-layer sodium metal oxides is investigated by in situ synchrotron XRD and a model is developed to rationalize why the observed phase progression proceeds through non-equilibrium three-layered intermediates.},

  abstract     = {The methanol-to-hydrocarbons reaction refers collectively to a series of important industrial catalytic processes to produce either olefins or gasoline. Mechanistically, methanol conversion proceeds through a ‘pool’ of hydrocarbon species. For the methanol-to-olefins process, these species can be delineated broadly into ‘desired’ lighter olefins and ‘undesired’ heavier fractions that cause deactivation in a matter of hours. The crux in further catalyst optimization is the ability to follow the formation of carbonaceous species during operation. Here, we report the combined results of an operando Kerr-gated Raman spectroscopic study with state-of-the-art operando molecular simulations, which allowed us to follow the formation of hydrocarbon species at various stages of methanol conversion. Polyenes are identified as crucial intermediates towards formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with their fate determined largely by the zeolite topology. Notably, we provide the missing link between active and deactivating species, which allows us to propose potential design rules for future-generation catalysts. The methanol-to-hydrocarbons reaction on zeolites produces olefins from many sources, but catalyst stability is a major challenge. Here, by combining operando measurements and simulations, the formation and identification of deactivating carbonaceous species throughout the reaction are achieved.},

Here we present an alternative, facile approach to enhance the mass-transport properties of zeolites by the epitaxial growth of fin-like protrusions on seed crystals. We validate this generalizable methodology on two common zeolites and confirm that fins are in crystallographic registry with the underlying seeds, and that secondary growth does not impede access to the micropores. Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin. This approach could be extended to the rational synthesis of other zeolite and aluminosilicate materials. Nanosized zeolites enable better catalytic performance; however, their synthesis is non-trivial. Here, a simple treatment is presented that enables the growth of nanosized fins on zeolites that act as pseudo-nanoparticles, reducing deactivation rates for methanol-to-hydrocarbon catalysis.},

  abstract     = {The possibility of confining interlayer excitons in interfacial moiré patterns has recently gained attention as a strategy to form ordered arrays of zero-dimensional quantum emitters and topological superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. Strain is expected to play an important role in the modulation of the moiré potential landscape, tuning the array of quantum dot-like zero-dimensional traps into parallel stripes of one-dimensional quantum wires. Here, we present real-space imaging of unstrained zero-dimensional and strain-induced one-dimensional moiré patterns along with photoluminescence measurements of the corresponding excitonic emission from WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers. Whereas excitons in zero-dimensional moiré traps display quantum emitter-like sharp photoluminescence peaks with circular polarization, the photoluminescence emission from excitons in one-dimensional moiré potentials shows linear polarization and two orders of magnitude higher intensity. These results establish strain engineering as an effective method to tailor moiré potentials and their optoelectronic response on demand. The combination of piezoresponse force microscopy and optical measurements reveals the influence of strain in the formation of one-dimensional moiré patterns and the resulting behaviour of interlayer excitons in van der Waals heterostructures.},

  abstract     = {Nematic order is the breaking of rotational symmetry in the presence of translational invariance. While originally defined in the context of liquid crystals, the concept of nematic order has arisen in crystalline matter with discrete rotational symmetry, most prominently in the tetragonal Fe-based superconductors where the parent state is four-fold symmetric. In this case the nematic director takes on only two directions, and the order parameter in such ‘Ising-nematic’ systems is a simple scalar. Here, using a spatially resolved optical polarimetry technique, we show that a qualitatively distinct nematic state arises in the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Fe1/3NbS2. The crucial difference is that the nematic order on the triangular lattice is a $$Z_3$$ or three-state Potts-nematic order parameter. As a consequence, the anisotropy axes of response functions such as the resistivity tensor can be continuously reoriented by external perturbations. This discovery lays the groundwork for devices that exploit analogies with nematic liquid crystals. A spatially resolved optical polarimetry technique is used to identify a three-state Potts-nematic order parameter in a triangular lattice antiferromagnetic material.},

However, artificial nanofluidic devices15–18 are still far from demonstrating the advanced functionalities existing in biological systems, such as electrically and mechanically activated transport19,20. Here, we focus on ionic transport through 2-nm-radius individual multiwalled carbon nanotubes under the combination of mechanical and electrical forcings. Our findings evidence mechanically activated ionic transport in the form of an ionic conductance that depends quadratically on the applied pressure. Our theoretical study relates this behaviour to the complex interplay between electrical and mechanical drivings, and shows that the superlubricity of the carbon nanotubes4–8,21 is a prerequisite to attaining mechanically activated transport. The pressure sensitivity shares similarities with the response of biological mechanosensitive ion channels19,20, but observed here in an artificial system. This paves the way to build new active nanofluidic functionalities inspired by complex biological machinery. Carbon nanotubes with 2 nm channel radius are shown to display pressure-driven ionic currents, which share some similarities to the response of biological mechanosensitive ion channels to tension.},

  abstract     = {Zeolites are a class of materials that are of great relevance for industrial catalysis. Several fundamental questions relating to the structure and role of the Lewis acid sites in these materials remain unanswered. Proposals for the origin of such species can broadly be classified into three categories, which have distinct structures: extra-framework, framework-associated and framework aluminium. In this Perspective, we review each of these proposals and proceed to analyse their suitability to understand experimental results. Contrary to traditional belief, the number of Lewis acid sites does not always correlate to extra-framework aluminium content. As a result, we highlight that the terms ‘extra-framework’ and ‘framework-associated’ aluminium should be used with caution. We propose how the usage of different characterization techniques can enable the closure of knowledge gaps concerning the strength, multiplicity, localization and structure of catalytically active Lewis acid sites in zeolites. Lewis acid aluminium sites in zeolites enable some industrially relevant catalytic reactions, such as biomass valorization. This Perspective explores the origin and interpretation of these species, and discusses characterization techniques that can close knowledge gaps.},

  abstract     = {The symmetry breaking of protein distribution and cytoskeleton organization is an essential aspect for the development of apicobasal polarity. In embryonic cells this process is largely cell autonomous, while differentiated epithelial cells collectively polarize during epithelium formation. Here, we demonstrate that the de novo polarization of mature hepatocytes does not require the synchronized development of apical poles on neighbouring cells. De novo polarization at the single-cell level by mere contact with the extracellular matrix and immobilized cadherin defining a polarizing axis. The creation of these single-cell liver hemi-canaliculi allows unprecedented imaging resolution and control and over the lumenogenesis process. We show that the density and localization of cadherins along the initial cell–cell contact act as key triggers of the reorganization from lateral to apical actin cortex. The minimal cues necessary to trigger the polarization of hepatocytes enable them to develop asymmetric lumens with ectopic epithelial cells originating from the kidney, breast or colon. The polarity of primary hepatocytes has now been shown to be inducible at the single-cell level by passive artificial micro-niches, indicating that the early development of polarity occurs largely independently of the types and response of the neighbouring cells.},

  abstract     = {Cortical stiffness is an important cellular property that changes during migration, adhesion and growth. Previous atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation measurements of cells cultured on deformable substrates have suggested that cells adapt their stiffness to that of their surroundings. Here we show that the force applied by AFM to a cell results in a significant deformation of the underlying substrate if this substrate is softer than the cell. This ‘soft substrate effect’ leads to an underestimation of a cell’s elastic modulus when analysing data using a standard Hertz model, as confirmed by finite element modelling and AFM measurements of calibrated polyacrylamide beads, microglial cells and fibroblasts. To account for this substrate deformation, we developed a ‘composite cell–substrate model’. Correcting for the substrate indentation revealed that cortical cell stiffness is largely independent of substrate mechanics, which has major implications for our interpretation of many physiological and pathological processes. Atomic force microscopy indentation measurements of cells cultured on soft substrates may result in an underestimation of cell stiffness. A model has now been developed that takes this soft substrate effect into account, revealing that cortical cell stiffness is largely independent of substrate mechanics.},

  abstract     = {The diversity of DNA duplex structures is limited by a binary pair of hydrogen-bonded motifs. Here we show that poly(thymine) self-associates into antiparallel, right-handed duplexes in the presence of melamine, a small molecule that presents a triplicate set of the hydrogen-bonding face of adenine. X-ray crystallography shows that in the complex two poly(thymine) strands wrap around a helical column of melamine, which hydrogen bonds to thymine residues on two of its three faces. The mechanical strength of the thymine–melamine–thymine triplet surpasses that of adenine–thymine base pairs, which enables a sensitive detection of melamine at 3 pM. The poly(thymine)–melamine duplex is orthogonal to native DNA base pairing and can undergo strand displacement without the need for overhangs. Its incorporation into two-dimensional grids and hybrid DNA–small-molecule polymers highlights the poly(thymine)–melamine duplex as an additional tool for DNA nanotechnology. Melamine is shown to associate with two poly(thymine) strands, forming antiparallel duplexes that can be used for the dynamic assembly of DNA-based nanostructures.},

Emerging approaches using highly concentrated salts (21–55 m (mol kg–1)) create artificial solid–electrode interfaces and improve water stability; however, these approaches raise concerns about cost and toxicity. Molecular crowding is a common phenomenon in living cells where water activity is substantially suppressed by molecular crowding agents through altering the hydrogen-bonding structure. Here we demonstrate a ‘molecular crowding’ electrolyte using the water-miscible polymer poly(ethylene glycol) as the crowding agent to decrease water activity, thereby achieving a wide electrolyte operation window (3.2 V) with low salt concentration (2 m). Aqueous Li4Ti5O12/LiMn2O4 full cells with stable specific energies between 75 and 110 W h kg−1 were demonstrated over 300 cycles. Online electrochemical mass spectroscopy revealed that common side reactions in aqueous Li-ion batteries (hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions) are virtually eliminated. This work provides a path for designing high-voltage aqueous electrolytes for low-cost and sustainable energy storage. Developing cheap and sustainable aqueous electrolytes with a wide voltage window is key to achieving safe and high-energy Li-ion batteries. An electrolyte using the polymer poly(ethylene glycol) as a crowding agent to decrease water activity achieves a wide operation window at low salt concentration.},

  abstract     = {Dielectric ceramics are highly desired for electronic systems owing to their fast discharge speed and excellent fatigue resistance. However, the low energy density resulting from the low breakdown electric field leads to inferior volumetric efficiency, which is the main challenge for practical applications of dielectric ceramics. Here, we propose a strategy to increase the breakdown electric field and thus enhance the energy storage density of polycrystalline ceramics by controlling grain orientation. We fabricated high-quality &amp;lt;111&amp;gt;-textured Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3–Sr0.7Bi0.2TiO3 (NBT-SBT) ceramics, in which the strain induced by the electric field is substantially lowered, leading to a reduced failure probability and improved Weibull breakdown strength, on the order of 103 MV m−1, an ~65% enhancement compared to their randomly oriented counterparts. The recoverable energy density of &amp;lt;111&amp;gt;-textured NBT-SBT multilayer ceramics is up to 21.5 J cm−3, outperforming state-of-the-art dielectric ceramics. The present research offers a route for designing dielectric ceramics with enhanced breakdown strength, which is expected to benefit a wide range of applications of dielectric ceramics for which high breakdown strength is required, such as high-voltage capacitors and electrocaloric solid-state cooling devices. The energy density of dielectric ceramic capacitors is limited by low breakdown fields. Here, by considering the anisotropy of electrostriction in perovskites, it is shown that &amp;lt;111&amp;gt;-textured Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3–Sr0.7Bi0.2TiO3 ceramics can sustain higher electrical fields and achieve an energy density of 21.5 J cm−3.},

  abstract     = {Radiation-induced segregation is well known in metals, but has been rarely studied in ceramics. We discover that radiation can induce notable segregation of one of the constituent elements to grain boundaries in a ceramic, despite the fact that the ceramic forms a line compound and therefore has a strong thermodynamic driving force to resist off-stoichiometry. Specifically, irradiation of silicon carbide at 300 °C leads to carbon enrichment near grain boundaries, whereas the enrichment diminishes for irradiation at 600 °C. The temperature dependence of this radiation-induced segregation is different from that shown in metallic systems. Using an ab initio informed rate theory model, we demonstrate that this difference is introduced by the unique defect energy landscapes present in the covalent system. Additionally, we discover that grain boundaries in unirradiated silicon carbide grown by chemical vapour deposition are intrinsically carbon-depleted. The inherent grain boundary chemistry and its evolution under radiation are both critical for understanding the many properties of ceramics associated with grain boundaries. Radiation-induced segregation is widely observed in metals. Here it is discovered that radiation-induced segregation also occurs in a ceramic, with carbon atoms in silicon carbide segregating to the grain boundaries under irradiation.},

  abstract     = {Interacting electrons confined in one dimension are generally described by the Luttinger liquid formalism, where the low-energy electronic dispersion is assumed to be linear and the resulting plasmonic excitations are non-interacting. Instead, a Luttinger liquid in one-dimensional materials with nonlinear electronic bands is expected to show strong plasmon–plasmon interactions, but an experimental demonstration of this behaviour has been lacking. Here, we combine infrared nano-imaging and electronic transport to investigate the behaviour of plasmonic excitations in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes with carrier density controlled by electrostatic gating. We show that both the propagation velocity and the dynamic damping of plasmons can be tuned continuously, which is well captured by the nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory. These results contrast with the gate-independent plasmons observed in metallic nanotubes, as expected for a linear Luttinger liquid. Our findings provide an experimental demonstration of one-dimensional electron dynamics beyond the conventional linear Luttinger liquid paradigm and are important for understanding excited-state properties in one dimension. Electric-field tunable plasmonic excitations in semiconducting carbon nanotubes are shown to behave consistently with the nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory, providing a platform to study non-conventional one-dimensional electron dynamics and realize integrated nanophotonic devices.},

However, experimental investigations have been hampered by the field-immunity of antiferromagnets. Ferrimagnets have been shown to be an alternative platform to study antiferromagnetic spin dynamics. Here we investigate thermally excited spin waves in ferrimagnets across the magnetization compensation and angular momentum compensation temperatures using Brillouin light scattering. Our results show that right-handed and left-handed modes intersect at the angular momentum compensation temperature where pure antiferromagnetic spin waves are expected. A field-induced shift of the mode-crossing point from the angular momentum compensation temperature and the gyromagnetic reversal reveal hitherto unrecognized properties of ferrimagnetic dynamics. We also provide a theoretical understanding of our experimental results. Our work demonstrates important aspects of the physics of ferrimagnetic spin waves and opens up the attractive possibility of ferrimagnet-based magnonic devices. Right- and left-handed spin-wave modes are identified in ferrimagnets, and their dynamics are revealed.},

However, the detection of these hinge states is difficult due to the semimetallic behaviour of the bulk. In this study, we have spatially resolved the hinge states by analysing the magnetic field interference of the supercurrent in Nb–WTe2–Nb proximity Josephson junctions. The Josephson current along the a axis of the WTe2 crystal, but not along the b axis, showed a sharp enhancement at the edges of the junction, and the amount of enhanced Josephson current was comparable to the upper limits of a single one-dimensional helical channel. Our experimental observations suggest a higher-order topological phase in WTe2 and its corresponding anisotropic topological hinge states, in agreement with theoretical calculations. Our work paves the way for the study of hinge states in topological transition-metal dichalcogenides and analogous phases. Transport measurements and calculations show that WTe2 may be a higher-order topological insulator with topological hinge states.},

While promising, these implementations rely on software to run ANN algorithms. Ultimately, it is desirable to build hardware ANNs4,5 that can both directly interface with living tissue and adapt based on biofeedback6,7. The first essential step towards biologically integrated neuromorphic systems is to achieve synaptic conditioning based on biochemical signalling activity. Here, we directly couple an organic neuromorphic device with dopaminergic cells to constitute a biohybrid synapse with neurotransmitter-mediated synaptic plasticity. By mimicking the dopamine recycling machinery of the synaptic cleft, we demonstrate both long-term conditioning and recovery of the synaptic weight, paving the way towards combining artificial neuromorphic systems with biological neural networks.

However, the lack of tunability of their narrow and material-specific spectral range—the Reststrahlen band—severely limits their technological implementation. Here, we demonstrate that intercalation of Na atoms in the van der Waals semiconductor α-V2O5 enables a broad spectral shift of Reststrahlen bands, and that the phonon polaritons excited show ultra-low losses (lifetime of 4 ± 1 ps), similar to phonon polaritons in a non-intercalated crystal (lifetime of 6 ± 1 ps). We expect our intercalation method to be applicable to other van der Waals crystals, opening the door for the use of phonon polaritons in broad spectral bands in the mid-infrared domain. The spectral range of long-lived and confined phonon polaritons in a polar van der Waals crystal is shown to be tunable by intercalation of Na atoms, expanding their potential for nanophotonic applications in the mid-infrared domain.},

  abstract     = {Over the past two decades, there has been a growing interest in the use of plasmonic nanoparticles as sources of heat remotely controlled by light, giving rise to the field of thermoplasmonics. The ability to release heat on the nanoscale has already impacted a broad range of research activities, from biomedicine to imaging and catalysis. Thermoplasmonics is now entering an important phase: some applications have engaged in an industrial stage, while others, originally full of promise, experience some difficulty in reaching their potential. Meanwhile, innovative fundamental areas of research are being developed. In this Review, we scrutinize the current research landscape in thermoplasmonics, with a specific focus on its applications and main challenges in many different fields of science, including nanomedicine, cell biology, photothermal and hot-electron chemistry, solar light harvesting, soft matter and nanofluidics. Thermoplasmonics is based on the use of plasmonic nanoparticles as sources of heat remotely controlled by light. This Review discusses its current applications and challenges in a broad range of scientific fields, from nanomedicine to hot-electron chemistry and nanofluidics.},

While the majority of chiral surfaces in practical use are based on achiral materials whose surfaces have been modified with enantiomerically pure chiral adsorbates, there are many inorganic materials with valuable surface properties that could be rendered enantiospecific, if their surfaces were intrinsically chiral. This Perspective discusses recent developments in the fabrication of intrinsically chiral surfaces exhibiting enantiospecific adsorption, surface chemistry and electron emission. We propose possible paths to the scalable fabrication of high-surface-area, enantiomerically pure surfaces and discuss opportunities for future progress.

However, dosing volumes, injection site reactions and health-care oversight are obstacles towards a broad usage. The creation of poloxamer-coated hydrophobic and lipophilic CAB prodrugs with controlled hydrolysis and tissue penetrance can overcome these obstacles. To such ends, fatty acid ester CAB nanocrystal prodrugs with 14, 18 and 22 added carbon chains were encased in biocompatible surfactants named NMCAB, NM2CAB and NM3CAB and tested for drug release, activation, cytotoxicity, antiretroviral activities, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Pharmacokinetics studies, performed in mice and rhesus macaques, with the lead 18-carbon ester chain NM2CAB, showed plasma CAB levels above the protein-adjusted 90% inhibitory concentration for up to a year. NM2CAB, compared with NMCAB and NM3CAB, demonstrated a prolonged drug release, plasma circulation time and tissue drug concentrations after a single 45 mg per kg body weight intramuscular injection. These prodrug modifications could substantially improve CAB’s effectiveness. Nanoformulated long-acting cabotegravir prodrugs are shown to be capable of extending the native drug’s antiretroviral activity, biodistribution and pharmacokinetics for up to 12 months in mice and rhesus macaques.},

In living systems the integration of supramolecular structures and covalent polymers contributes to the responsive behaviour of membranes, muscles and tendons, among others. Here we describe hybrid light-responsive soft materials composed of peptide amphiphile supramolecular polymers chemically bonded to spiropyran-based networks that expel water in response to visible light. The supramolecular polymers form a reversibly deformable and water-draining skeleton that mechanically reinforces the hybrid and can also be aligned by printing methods. The noncovalent skeleton embedded in the network thus enables faster bending and flattening actuation of objects, as well as longer steps during the light-driven crawling motion of macroscopic films. Our work suggests that hybrid bonding polymers, which integrate supramolecular assemblies and covalent networks, offer strategies for the bottom-up design of soft matter that mimics living organisms. Peptide amphiphile supramolecular polymers with a crosslinked spiropyran network respond to light by expelling water, enabling the fabrication of soft actuators or light-driven crawlers.},

MXenes are mainly prepared from Al-containing MAX phases (where A = Al) by Al dissolution in F-containing solution; most other MAX phases have not been explored. Here a redox-controlled A-site etching of MAX phases in Lewis acidic melts is proposed and validated by the synthesis of various MXenes from unconventional MAX-phase precursors with A elements Si, Zn and Ga. A negative electrode of Ti3C2 MXene material obtained through this molten salt synthesis method delivers a Li+ storage capacity of up to 738 C g−1 (205 mAh g−1) with high charge–discharge rate and a pseudocapacitive-like electrochemical signature in 1 M LiPF6 carbonate-based electrolyte. MXenes prepared via this molten salt synthesis route may prove suitable for use as high-rate negative-electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage applications. Two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, are currently considered as energy storage materials.

  abstract     = {A number of grain boundary phenomena in ionic materials, in particular, anomalous (either depressed or enhanced) charge transport, have been attributed to space charge effects. Developing effective strategies to manipulate transport behaviour requires deep knowledge of the origins of the interfacial charge, as well as its variability within a polycrystalline sample with millions of unique grain boundaries. Electron holography is a powerful technique uniquely suited for studying the electric potential profile at individual grain boundaries, whereas atom-probe tomography provides access to the chemical identify of essentially every atom at individual grain boundaries. Using these two techniques, we show here that the space charge potential at grain boundaries in lightly doped, high-purity ceria can vary by almost an order of magnitude. We further find that trace impurities (&amp;lt;25 ppm), rather than inherent thermodynamic factors, may be the ultimate source of grain boundary charge. These insights suggest chemical tunability of grain boundary transport properties. A number of grain boundary phenomena in ionic materials, such as anomalous charge transport, have been attributed to space charge effects. Space charge potential at grain boundaries in lightly doped, high-purity ceria is now shown to vary by almost an order of magnitude.},

A meron is half of a skyrmion, and both have potential applications for information carrying and storage. Although merons and skyrmions in ferromagnetic materials can be readily obtained via inter-spin interactions, their behaviour and even existence in ferroelectric materials are still elusive. Here we observe using electron microscopy not only the atomic morphology of merons with a topological charge of 1/2, but also a periodic meron lattice in ultrathin PbTiO3 films under tensile epitaxial strain on a SmScO3 substrate. Phase-field simulations rationalize the formation of merons for which an epitaxial strain, as a single alterable parameter, plays a critical role in the coupling of lattice and charge. This study suggests that by engineering strain at the nanoscale it should be possible to fabricate topological polar textures, which in turn could facilitate the development of nanoscale ferroelectric devices. Merons are topological structures, but these have yet to be directly observed in ferroelectrics. Here, by epitaxially straining PbTiO3 on a SmScO3 substrate, electron microscopy and phase-field modelling allow the morphology and distribution of merons to be observed.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional materials with high charge carrier mobility and tunable band gaps have attracted intense research effort for their potential use in nanoelectronics. Two-dimensional π-conjugated polymers constitute a promising subclass because the band structure can be manipulated by varying the molecular building blocks while preserving key features such as Dirac cones and high charge mobility. The major barriers to the application of two-dimensional π-conjugated polymers have been the small domain size and high defect density attained in the syntheses explored so far. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of mesoscale ordered two-dimensional π-conjugated polymer kagome lattices with semiconducting properties, Dirac cone structures and flat bands on Au(111). This material has been obtained by combining a rigid azatriangulene precursor and a hot dosing approach, which favours molecular diffusion and eliminates voids in the network. These results open opportunities for the synthesis of two-dimensional π-conjugated polymer Dirac cone materials and their integration into devices. Optimized Ullmann coupling reaction of heterotriangulene precursors allows the synthesis of two-dimensional π-conjugated polymers with ordered domains larger than 100 × 100 nm2 showing both Dirac cones and flat bands in their electronic structure.},

  abstract     = {The electronic, optical and chemical properties of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides strongly depend on their three-dimensional atomic structure and crystal defects. Using Re-doped MoS2 as a model system, here we present scanning atomic electron tomography as a method to determine three-dimensional atomic positions as well as positions of crystal defects such as dopants, vacancies and ripples with a precision down to 4 pm. We measure the three-dimensional bond distortion and local strain tensor induced by single dopants. By directly providing these experimental three-dimensional atomic coordinates to density functional theory, we obtain more accurate electronic band structures than derived from conventional density functional theory calculations that relies on relaxed three-dimensional atomic coordinates. We anticipate that scanning atomic electron tomography not only will be generally applicable to determine the three-dimensional atomic coordinates of two-dimensional materials, but also will enable ab initio calculations to better predict the physical, chemical and electronic properties of these materials. Scanning atomic electron tomography is demonstrated to determine the 3D atomic positions and defects of Re-doped MoS2 monolayers and other 2D materials, providing picometre precision atomic coordinates that can be used as direct input to DFT to reveal more accurate electronic band structures of these systems.},

  abstract     = {In narrow electron bands in which the Coulomb interaction energy becomes comparable to the bandwidth, interactions can drive new quantum phases. Such flat bands in twisted graphene-based systems result in correlated insulator, superconducting and topological states. Here we report evidence of low-energy flat bands in twisted bilayer WSe2, with signatures of collective phases observed over twist angles that range from 4 to 5.1°. At half-band filling, a correlated insulator appeared that is tunable with both twist angle and displacement field. At a 5.1° twist, zero-resistance pockets were observed on doping away from half filling at temperatures below 3 K, which indicates a possible transition to a superconducting state. The observation of tunable collective phases in a simple band, which hosts only two holes per unit cell at full filling, establishes twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides as an ideal platform to study correlated physics in two dimensions on a triangular lattice. Tunable correlated states are observed in twist bilayer WSe2 over a range of twist angles, with signatures of superconductivity for a twist of 5.1°.},

  abstract     = {Much of the recent attention directed towards topological insulators is motivated by their hallmark feature of protected chiral edge states. In electronic (or fermionic) topological insulators, these states originate from time-reversal symmetry and allow carriers with opposite spin-polarization to propagate in opposite directions at the edge of an insulating bulk. By contrast, photonic (or bosonic) systems are generally assumed to be precluded from supporting edge states that are intrinsically protected by time-reversal symmetry. Here, we experimentally demonstrate counter-propagating chiral states at the edge of a time-reversal-symmetric photonic waveguide structure. The pivotal step in our approach is the design of a Floquet driving protocol that incorporates effective fermionic time-reversal symmetry, enabling the realization of the photonic version of an electronic topological insulator. Our findings allow for fermionic properties to be harnessed in bosonic systems, thereby offering alternative opportunities for photonics as well as acoustics, mechanical waves and cold atoms. Counter-propagating chiral edge states are demonstrated in a photonic structure able to effectively incorporate fermionic time-reversal symmetry, thus providing the photonic implementation of an electronic topological insulator.},

  abstract     = {Collective interstitial ordering is at the core of martensite formation in Fe–C-based alloys, laying the foundation for high-strength steels. Even though this ordering has been studied extensively for more than a century, some fundamental mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show the unexpected effects of two correlated phenomena on the ordering mechanism: anharmonicity and segregation. The local anharmonicity in the strain fields induced by interstitials substantially reduces the critical concentration for interstitial ordering, up to a factor of three. Further, the competition between interstitial ordering and segregation results in an effective decrease of interstitial segregation into extended defects for high interstitial concentrations. The mechanism and corresponding impact on interstitial ordering identified here enrich the theory of phase transitions in materials and constitute a crucial step in the design of ultra-high-performance alloys. The interstitial ordering in Fe–C alloys is shown to be stabilized by local anharmonicity in strain fields, which substantially reduces the critical C concentration for ordering. C segregation into extended defects predominates over ordering at low C concentrations but sharply decreases at high concentrations.},

  abstract     = {To avoid crosstalk and suppress leakage currents in resistive random access memories (RRAMs), a resistive switch and a current rectifier (diode) are usually combined in series in a one diode–one resistor (1D–1R) RRAM. However, this complicates the design of next-generation RRAM, increases the footprint of devices and increases the operating voltage as the potential drops over two consecutive junctions1. Here, we report a molecular tunnel junction based on molecules that provide an unprecedented dual functionality of diode and variable resistor, resulting in a molecular-scale 1D–1R RRAM with a current rectification ratio of 2.5 × 104 and resistive on/off ratio of 6.7 × 103, and a low drive voltage of 0.89 V. The switching relies on dimerization of redox units, resulting in hybridization of molecular orbitals accompanied by directional ion migration. This electric-field-driven molecular switch operating in the tunnelling regime enables a class of molecular devices where multiple electronic functions are preprogrammed inside a single molecular layer with a thickness of only 2 nm. A multifunctional molecule acting both as diode and variable resistor is used to fabricate compact molecular switches with a thickness of 2 nm, good current rectification and resistive on/off ratio, and requiring a drive voltage as low as 0.89 V.},

Whereas these studies focused on static properties, dynamic magnetic properties, such as excitation and control of spin waves, remain elusive. Here we investigate spin-wave dynamics in antiferromagnetic CrI3 bilayers using an ultrafast optical pump/magneto-optical Kerr probe technique. Monolayer WSe2 with a strong excitonic resonance was introduced on CrI3 to enhance the optical excitation of spin waves. We identified subterahertz magnetic resonances under an in-plane magnetic field, from which the anisotropy and interlayer exchange fields were determined. We further showed tuning of the antiferromagnetic resonances by tens of gigahertz through electrostatic gating. Our results shed light on magnetic excitations and spin dynamics in 2D magnetic materials, and demonstrate their potential for applications in ultrafast data storage and processing. Gating dependent laser induced spin dynamics in an antiferromagnetic bilayer are observed and explained, with implications for future spintronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Defining the interplay between the genetic events and microenvironmental contexts necessary to initiate tumorigenesis in normal cells is a central endeavour in cancer biology. We found that receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)–Ras oncogenes reprogram normal, freshly explanted primary mouse and human cells into tumour precursors, in a process requiring increased force transmission between oncogene-expressing cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix. Microenvironments approximating the normal softness of healthy tissues, or blunting cellular mechanotransduction, prevent oncogene-mediated cell reprogramming and tumour emergence. However, RTK–Ras oncogenes empower a disproportional cellular response to the mechanical properties of the cell’s environment, such that when cells experience even subtle supra-physiological extracellular-matrix rigidity they are converted into tumour-initiating cells. These regulations rely on YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction, and YAP/TAZ target genes account for a large fraction of the transcriptional responses downstream of oncogenic signalling. This work lays the groundwork for exploiting oncogenic mechanosignalling as a vulnerability at the onset of tumorigenesis, including tumour prevention strategies. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)–Ras oncogenes have now been shown to reprogram normal primary human and mouse cells into tumour precursors by empowering cellular mechanotransduction, in a process requiring permissive extracellular-matrix rigidity and intracellular YAP/TAZ/Rac mechanical signalling sustained by activated oncogenes.},

Despite successes in nanoparticle assembly, most extant methods are system specific and not fully compatible with biomolecules. Here, we report a platform for creating distinct 3D ordered arrays from different nanomaterials using DNA-prescribed and valence-controlled material voxels. These material voxels consist of 3D DNA frames that integrate nano-objects within their scaffold, thus enabling the object’s valence and coordination to be determined by the frame’s vertices, which can bind to each other through hybridization. Such DNA material voxels define the lattice symmetry through the spatially prescribed valence decoupling the 3D assembly process from the nature of the nanocomponents, such as their intrinsic properties and shapes. We show this by assembling metallic and semiconductor nanoparticles and also protein superlattices. We support the technological potential of such an assembly approach by fabricating light-emitting 3D arrays with diffraction-limited spectral purity and 3D enzymatic arrays with increased activity. Three-dimensional DNA frames can be created with controlled valence and coordination for the assembly of ordered arrays of biological and inorganic nanomaterials.},

Nevertheless, synthetic approaches for programming molecular reactions or assembly generally rely on the use of multiple polymer chains (for example, patchy particles). Here we demonstrate a method for patterning colloidal gold nanoparticles with valence bond analogues using single-stranded DNA encoders containing polyadenine (polyA). By programming the order, length and sequence of each encoder with alternating polyA/non-polyA domains, we synthesize programmable atom-like nanoparticles (PANs) with n-valence that can be used to assemble a spectrum of low-coordination colloidal molecules with different composition, size, chirality and linearity. Moreover, by exploiting the reconfigurability of PANs, we demonstrate dynamic colloidal bond-breaking and bond-formation reactions, structural rearrangement and even the implementation of Boolean logic operations. This approach may be useful for generating responsive functional materials for distinct technological applications. Single-stranded DNA encoders containing polyadenine domains endow colloidal gold nanoparticles with programmable bond valence, orthogonality and reconfigurability, thus achieving post-synthetic control over colloidal structures.},

  abstract     = {The ageing behaviour of dense suspensions or pastes at rest is almost exclusively attributed to structural dynamics. Here, we identify another ageing process, contact-controlled ageing, consisting of the progressive stiffening of solid–solid contacts of an arrested colloidal suspension. By combining rheometry, confocal microscopy and particle-scale mechanical tests using laser tweezers, we demonstrate that this process governs the shear-modulus ageing of dense aqueous silica and polymer latex suspensions at moderate ionic strengths. We further show that contact-controlled ageing becomes relevant as soon as Coulombic interactions are sufficiently screened out that the formation of solid–solid contacts is not limited by activation barriers. Given that this condition only requires moderate ion concentrations, contact-controlled ageing should be generic in a wide class of materials, such as cements, soils or three-dimensional inks, thus questioning our understanding of ageing dynamics in these systems. The progressive stiffening of the solid–solid contacts that freeze dense colloidal suspensions are shown to cause the macroscopic ageing of such materials.},

  abstract     = {Biological ion channels have remarkable ion selectivity, permeability and rectification properties, but it is challenging to develop artificial analogues. Here, we report a metal–organic framework-based subnanochannel (MOFSNC) with heterogeneous structure and surface chemistry to achieve these properties. The asymmetrically structured MOFSNC can rapidly conduct K+, Na+ and Li+ in the subnanometre-to-nanometre channel direction, with conductivities up to three orders of magnitude higher than those of Ca2+ and Mg2+, equivalent to a mono/divalent ion selectivity of 103. Moreover, by varying the pH from 3 to 8 the ion selectivity can be tuned further by a factor of 102 to 104. Theoretical simulations indicate that ion–carboxyl interactions substantially reduce the energy barrier for monovalent cations to pass through the MOFSNC, and thus lead to ultrahigh ion selectivity. These findings suggest ways to develop ion selective devices for efficient ion separation, energy reservation and power generation. Here, using an interfacial growth strategy, UiO-66 MOF nanocrystals are asymmetrically embedded into conical pores in a polymer membrane. These pores have a mono/divalent cation selectivity of 103, which can be tuned by pH, and act as ionic rectifiers.},

  abstract     = {Dendrite formation during electrodeposition while charging lithium metal batteries compromises their safety. Although high-shear-modulus (Gs) solid-ion conductors (SICs) have been prioritized to resolve the pressure-driven instabilities that lead to dendrite propagation and cell shorting, it is unclear whether these or alternatives are needed to guide uniform lithium electrodeposition, which is intrinsically density-driven. Here, we show that SICs can be designed within a universal chemomechanical paradigm to access either pressure-driven dendrite-blocking or density-driven dendrite-suppressing properties, but not both. This dichotomy reflects the competing influence of the SIC’s mechanical properties and the partial molar volume of Li+ ($$V_{\mathrm{Li}^+}$$) relative to those of the lithium anode (GLi and VLi) on plating outcomes. Within this paradigm, we explore SICs in a previously unrecognized dendrite-suppressing regime that are concomitantly ‘soft’, as is typical of polymer electrolytes, but feature an atypically low $$V_{\mathrm{Li}^+}$$ that is more reminiscent of ‘hard’ ceramics. Li plating (1 mA cm−2; T = 20 °C) mediated by these SICs is uniform, as revealed using synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography. As a result, cell cycle life is extended, even when assembled with thin Li anodes (~30 µm) and either high-voltage NMC-622 cathodes (1.44 mAh cm−2) or high-capacity sulfur cathodes (3.02 mAh cm−2). Dendrite formation during electrodeposition while charging lithium metal batteries compromises their safety. Solid-ion conductors are now designed with a universal chemomechanical approach, resulting in either pressure- or density-driven dendrite-suppressing properties.},

Here we apply the concept of complex networks to modelling carrier conduction in such systems. The approach permits assignment of arbitrary connectivity and connection strength between assembly constituents and is thus ideal for nanostructured films, composites and other geometries. Modelling of simplified rod-like nanostructures is consistent with analytical solutions, whereas results for more realistic nanostructure assemblies agree with experimental data and reveal conduction behaviour not captured by previous models. Fitting of ensemble measurements also allows the conduction properties of individual constituents to be extracted, which are subsequently used to guide the realization of transparent electrodes with improved performance. A global optimization process was employed to identify geometries and properties with high potential for transparent conductors. Our intuitive discretization approach, combined with a simple solver tool, allows researchers with little computational experience to carry out realistic simulations. A modelling approach based on complex networks is used to simulate carrier transport in assemblies of nanostructures with a broad range of shapes and electrical properties, relevant to the realization of efficient transparent conductors.},

  abstract     = {Doping of organic semiconductors is crucial for the operation of organic (opto)electronic and electrochemical devices. Typically, this is achieved by adding heterogeneous dopant molecules to the polymer bulk, often resulting in poor stability and performance due to dopant sublimation or aggregation. In small-molecule donor–acceptor systems, charge transfer can yield high and stable electrical conductivities, an approach not yet explored in all-conjugated polymer systems. Here, we report ground-state electron transfer in all-polymer donor–acceptor heterojunctions. Combining low-ionization-energy polymers with high-electron-affinity counterparts yields conducting interfaces with resistivity values five to six orders of magnitude lower than the separate single-layer polymers. The large decrease in resistivity originates from two parallel quasi-two-dimensional electron and hole distributions reaching a concentration of ∼1013 cm–2. Furthermore, we transfer the concept to three-dimensional bulk heterojunctions, displaying exceptional thermal stability due to the absence of molecular dopants. Our findings hold promise for electro-active composites of potential use in, for example, thermoelectrics and wearable electronics. Doping through spontaneous electron transfer between donor and acceptor polymers is obtained by selecting organic semiconductors with suitable electron affinity and ionization energy, achieving high conductivity in blends and bilayer configuration.},

  abstract     = {The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a consequence of non-zero Berry curvature in momentum space. The QAH insulator harbours dissipation-free chiral edge states in the absence of an external magnetic field. However, the topological Hall (TH) effect, a hallmark of chiral spin textures, is a consequence of real-space Berry curvature. Here, by inserting a topological insulator (TI) layer between two magnetic TI layers, we realized the concurrence of the TH effect and the QAH effect through electric-field gating. The TH effect is probed by bulk carriers, whereas the QAH effect is characterized by chiral edge states. The appearance of the TH effect in the QAH insulating regime is a consequence of chiral magnetic domain walls that result from the gate-induced Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction and occurs during the magnetization reversal process in the magnetic TI sandwich samples. The coexistence of chiral edge states and chiral spin textures provides a platform for proof-of-concept dissipationless spin-textured spintronic applications.

  abstract     = {Spin models arise in the microscopic description of magnetic materials and have been recently used to map certain classes of optimization problems involving large degrees of freedom. In this regard, various optical implementations of such Hamiltonians have been demonstrated to quickly converge to the global minimum in the energy landscape. Yet, so far, an integrated nanophotonic platform capable of emulating complex magnetic materials is still missing. Here, we show that the cooperative interplay among vectorial electromagnetic modes in coupled metallic nanolasers can be utilized to implement certain types of spin Hamiltonians. Depending on the topology/geometry of the arrays, these structures can be governed by a classical XY Hamiltonian that exhibits ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, as well as geometrical frustration. Our results pave the way towards a scalable nanophotonic platform to study spin exchange interactions and could address a variety of optimization problems. Vectorial electromagnetic modes in coupled metallic nanolasers are used to emulate the behaviour of complex magnetic materials, providing an integrated nanophotonic platform to study spin exchange interactions and map large-scale optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal nanoparticle assembly methods can serve as ideal models to explore the fundamentals of homogeneous crystallization phenomena, as interparticle interactions can be readily tuned to modify crystal nucleation and growth. However, heterogeneous crystallization at interfaces is often more challenging to control, as it requires that both interparticle and particle–surface interactions be manipulated simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate how programmable DNA hybridization enables the formation of single-crystal Winterbottom constructions of substrate-bound nanoparticle superlattices with defined sizes, shapes, orientations and degrees of anisotropy. Additionally, we show that some crystals exhibit deviations from their predicted Winterbottom structures due to an additional growth pathway that is not typically observed in atomic crystals, providing insight into the differences between this model system and other atomic or molecular crystals. By precisely tailoring both interparticle and particle–surface potentials, we therefore can use this model to both understand and rationally control the complex process of interfacial crystallization.

  abstract     = {Superelasticity associated with the martensitic transformation has found a broad range of engineering applications1,2. However, the intrinsic hysteresis3 and temperature sensitivity4 of the first-order phase transformation significantly hinder the usage of smart metallic components in many critical areas. Here, we report a large superelasticity up to 15.2% strain in [001]-oriented NiCoFeGa single crystals, exhibiting non-hysteretic mechanical responses, a small temperature dependence and high-energy-storage capability and cyclic stability over a wide temperature and composition range. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements show that the superelasticity is correlated with a stress-induced continuous variation of lattice parameter accompanied by structural fluctuation. Neutron diffraction and electron microscopy observations reveal an unprecedented microstructure consisting of atomic-level entanglement of ordered and disordered crystal structures, which can be manipulated to tune the superelasticity. The discovery of the large elasticity related to the entangled structure paves the way for exploiting elastic strain engineering and development of related functional materials. NiCoFeGa single crystals exhibit large non-hysteretic superelasticity over broad temperature and composition ranges. It is attributed to the continuous phase transition with applied stress, which is related to the fluctuation of entangled ordered and disordered crystal structures.},

Here, we develop an enhancement-mode, internal ion-gated organic electrochemical transistor (e-IGT) based on a reversible redox reaction and hydrated ion reservoirs within the conducting polymer channel, which enable long-term stable operation and shortened ion transit time. E-IGT transient responses depend on hole rather than ion mobility, and combine with high transconductance to result in a gain–bandwidth product that is several orders of magnitude above that of other ion-based transistors. We used these transistors to acquire a wide range of electrophysiological signals, including in vivo recording of neural action potentials, and to create soft, biocompatible, long-term implantable neural processing units for the real-time detection of epileptic discharges. E-IGTs offer a safe, reliable and high-performance building block for chronically implanted bioelectronics, with a spatiotemporal resolution at the scale of individual neurons. Internal ion-gated organic electrochemical transistors operating in enhancement mode are shown to record electrophysiological signals in vivo, with a speed and sensitivity that enable the detection of action potentials from individual neurons.},

  abstract     = {Extensive research over the past decades has identified integrins to be the primary transmembrane receptors that enable cells to respond to external mechanical cues. We reveal here a mechanism whereby syndecan-4 tunes cell mechanics in response to localized tension via a coordinated mechanochemical signalling response that involves activation of two other receptors: epidermal growth factor receptor and β1 integrin. Tension on syndecan-4 induces cell-wide activation of the kindlin-2/β1 integrin/RhoA axis in a PI3K-dependent manner. Furthermore, syndecan-4-mediated tension at the cell–extracellular matrix interface is required for yes-associated protein activation. Extracellular tension on syndecan-4 triggers a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain, the variable region of which is indispensable for the mechanical adaptation to force, facilitating the assembly of a syndecan-4/α-actinin/F-actin molecular scaffold at the bead adhesion. This mechanotransduction pathway for syndecan-4 should have immediate implications for the broader field of mechanobiology. A mechanism of cell response to localized tension shows that syndecan-4 synergizes with EGFR to elicit a mechanosignalling cascade that leads to adaptive cell stiffening through PI3K/kindlin-2 mediated integrin activation.},

  abstract     = {Amongst the more than 18 different forms of water ice, only the common hexagonal phase and the cubic phase are present in nature on Earth. Nonetheless, it is now widely recognized that all samples of ‘cubic ice’ discovered so far do not have a fully cubic crystal structure but instead are stacking-disordered forms of ice I (namely, ice Isd), which contain both hexagonal and cubic stacking sequences of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Here, we describe a method to obtain large quantities of cubic ice Ic with high structural purity. Cubic ice Ic is formed by heating a powder of D2O ice XVII obtained from annealing of pristine C0 hydrate samples under dynamic vacuum. Neutron diffraction experiments performed on two different instruments and Raman spectroscopy measurements confirm the structural purity of the cubic ice, Ic. These findings contribute to a better understanding of ice I polymorphism and the existence of the two natural ice forms. Structurally pure cubic ice Ic is obtained from the controlled heating of D2O ice XVII.},

  abstract     = {Unlike the wide-ranging dynamic control of electrical conductivity, there does not exist an analogous ability to tune thermal conductivity by means of electric potential. The traditional picture assumes that atoms inserted into a material’s lattice act purely as a source of scattering for thermal carriers, which can only reduce thermal conductivity. In contrast, here we show that the electrochemical control of oxygen and proton concentration in an oxide provides a new ability to bi-directionally control thermal conductivity. On electrochemically oxygenating the brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 to the perovskite SrCoO3–δ, the thermal conductivity increases by a factor of 2.5, whereas protonating it to form hydrogenated SrCoO2.5 effectively reduces the thermal conductivity by a factor of four. This bi-directional tuning of thermal conductivity across a nearly 10 ± 4-fold range at room temperature is achieved by using ionic liquid gating to trigger the ‘tri-state’ phase transitions in a single device. We elucidated the effects of these anionic and cationic species, and the resultant changes in lattice constants and lattice symmetry on thermal conductivity by combining chemical and structural information from X-ray absorption spectroscopy with thermoreflectance thermal conductivity measurements and ab initio calculations. This ability to control multiple ion types, multiple phase transitions and electronic conductivity that spans metallic through to insulating behaviour in oxides by electrical means provides a new framework for tuning thermal transport over a wide range. Unlike dynamic control of electrical conductivity, tuning thermal conductivity by means of electric potential is challenging. Electrochemically induced phase transition control of oxygen and proton concentration in a SrCoOx oxide provides a way to tune bi-directionally thermal conductivity.},

  abstract     = {The application of transition metal fluorides as energy-dense cathode materials for lithium ion batteries has been hindered by inadequate understanding of their electrochemical capabilities and limitations. Here, we present an ideal system for mechanistic study through the colloidal synthesis of single-crystalline, monodisperse iron(ii) fluoride nanorods. Near theoretical capacity (570 mA h g−1) and extraordinary cycling stability (&amp;gt;90% capacity retention after 50 cycles at C/20) is achieved solely through the use of an ionic liquid electrolyte (1 m LiFSI/Pyr1,3FSI), which forms a stable solid electrolyte interphase and prevents the fusing of particles. This stability extends over 200 cycles at much higher rates (C/2) and temperatures (50 °C). High-resolution analytical transmission electron microscopy reveals intricate morphological features, lattice orientation relationships and oxidation state changes that comprehensively describe the conversion mechanism. Phase evolution, diffusion kinetics and cell failure are critically influenced by surface-specific reactions. The reversibility of the conversion reaction is governed by topotactic cation diffusion through an invariant lattice of fluoride anions and the nucleation of metallic particles on semicoherent interfaces. This new understanding is used to showcase the inherently high discharge rate capability of FeF2. The application of metal fluorides as cathodes for lithium ion batteries has been hindered by inadequate understanding of their electrochemical capabilities. Reversible conversion reaction in iron fluoride nanocrystals is shown to be due to topotactic cation diffusion and nucleation of metallic particles.},

  abstract     = {Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) metals may be key ingredients in next-generation quantum and optoelectronic devices. However, 2D metals must be stabilized against environmental degradation and integrated into heterostructure devices at the wafer scale. The high-energy interface between silicon carbide and epitaxial graphene provides an intriguing framework for stabilizing a diverse range of 2D metals. Here we demonstrate large-area, environmentally stable, single-crystal 2D gallium, indium and tin that are stabilized at the interface of epitaxial graphene and silicon carbide. The 2D metals are covalently bonded to SiC below but present a non-bonded interface to the graphene overlayer; that is, they are ‘half van der Waals’ metals with strong internal gradients in bonding character. These non-centrosymmetric 2D metals offer compelling opportunities for superconducting devices, topological phenomena and advanced optoelectronic properties. For example, the reported 2D Ga is a superconductor that combines six strongly coupled Ga-derived electron pockets with a large nearly free-electron Fermi surface that closely approaches the Dirac points of the graphene overlayer. Single-crystal 2D metals are stabilized at the interface between epitaxial graphene and silicon carbide, with strong internal gradients in bonding character. The confined 2D metals demonstrate compelling superconducting properties.},

  abstract     = {Van der Waals heterostructures offer attractive opportunities to design quantum materials. For instance, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess three quantum degrees of freedom: spin, valley index and layer index. Furthermore, twisted TMD heterobilayers can form moiré patterns that modulate the electronic band structure according to the atomic registry, leading to spatial confinement of interlayer excitons (IXs). Here we report the observation of spin–layer locking of IXs trapped in moiré potentials formed in a heterostructure of bilayer 2H-MoSe2 and monolayer WSe2. The phenomenon of locked electron spin and layer index leads to two quantum-confined IX species with distinct spin–layer–valley configurations. Furthermore, we observe that the atomic registries of the moiré trapping sites in the three layers are intrinsically locked together due to the 2H-type stacking characteristic of bilayer TMDs. These results identify the layer index as a useful degree of freedom to engineer tunable few-level quantum systems in two-dimensional heterostructures. The optical properties of two species of localized interlayer excitons in a van der Waals heterostructure are shown to depend on their spin–valley–layer configuration, enabling the identification of the moiré atomic registry and offering insights for engineering quantum states in two-dimensional materials.},

  abstract     = {Although photons in free space barely interact, matter can mediate interactions between them resulting in optical nonlinearities. Such interactions at the single-quantum level result in an on-site photon repulsion, crucial for photon-based quantum information processing and for realizing strongly interacting many-body states of light. Here, we report repulsive dipole–dipole interactions between electric field-tuneable, localized interlayer excitons in the MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer. The presence of a single, localized exciton with an out-of-plane, non-oscillating dipole moment increases the energy of the second excitation by ~2 meV—an order of magnitude larger than the emission linewidth and corresponding to an inter-dipole distance of ~7 nm. At higher excitation power, multi-exciton complexes appear at systematically higher energies. The magnetic field dependence of the emission polarization is consistent with the spin-valley singlet nature of the dipolar molecular state. Our finding represents a step towards the creation of excitonic few- and many-body states such as dipolar crystals with spin-valley spinor in van der Waals heterostructures. Repulsive dipole–dipole interactions between localized interlayer excitons are shown to modify the optical response of van der Waals heterobilayers, forming the basis to obtain strong optical nonlinearity and excitonic many-body states in two-dimensional materials.},

  abstract     = {The nanoscale periodic potentials introduced by moiré patterns in semiconducting van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as a platform for designing exciton superlattices. However, our understanding of the motion of excitons in moiré potentials is still limited. Here we investigated interlayer exciton dynamics and transport in WS2–WSe2 heterobilayers in time, space and momentum domains using transient absorption microscopy combined with first-principles calculations. We found that the exciton motion is modulated by twist-angle-dependent moiré potentials around 100 meV and deviates from normal diffusion due to the interplay between the moiré potentials and strong exciton–exciton interactions. Our experimental results verified the theoretical prediction of energetically favourable K–Q interlayer excitons and showed exciton-population dynamics that are controlled by the twist-angle-dependent energy difference between the K–Q and K–K excitons. These results form a basis to investigate exciton and spin transport in van der Waals heterostructures, with implications for the design of quantum communication devices. Interlayer exciton dynamics in a van der Waals heterostructure is found to be modulated by the twist angle between the atomically thin layers, elucidating the effect of moiré potentials on exciton motion and providing guidelines to design quantum photonics devices based on 2D materials.},

Here, we show that Bi2TeI is a dual topological insulator. It exhibits band inversions at two time reversal symmetry points of the bulk band, which classify it as a weak topological insulator with metallic states on its ‘side’ surfaces. The mirror symmetry of the crystal structure concurrently classifies it as a topological crystalline insulator. We investigated Bi2TeI spectroscopically to show the existence of both two-dimensional Dirac surface states, which are susceptible to mirror symmetry breaking, and one-dimensional channels that reside along the step edges. Their mutual coexistence on the step edge, where both facets join, is facilitated by momentum and energy segregation. Our observation of a dual topological insulator should stimulate investigations of other dual topology classes with distinct surface manifestations coexisting at their boundaries. Bi2TeI is identified as a dual topological insulator. It is a weak topological insulator with metallic states at the (010) surfaces and a topological crystalline insulator at the (001) surfaces.},

Photovoltaic conversion and electromechanical transduction are two common energy-harvesting mechanisms based on, respectively, semiconducting junctions and piezoelectric insulators. However, the different material families on which these transduction phenomena are based complicate their integration into single devices. Here we demonstrate that halide perovskites, a family of highly efficient photovoltaic materials1–3, display a photoflexoelectric effect whereby, under a combination of illumination and oscillation driven by a piezoelectric actuator, they generate orders of magnitude higher flexoelectricity than in the dark. We also show that photoflexoelectricity is not exclusive to halides but a general property of semiconductors that potentially enables simultaneous electromechanical and photovoltaic transduction and harvesting in unison from multiple energy inputs. Flexoelectricity is the ability of materials to generate electricity upon bending. Here it is demonstrated that adding light to mechanical oscillation enhances effective flexoelectric coefficients by orders of magnitude, with the halide perovskites showing the largest coefficients.},

This Review summarizes recent advances in this field, with emphasis on active and passive constituent materials, design architectures and integration methods that support necessary levels of biocompatibility, electronic functionality, long-term stable operation in biofluids and reliability for use in vivo. Bioelectronic systems that enable multiplexed electrophysiological mapping across large areas at high spatiotemporal resolution are surveyed, with a particular focus on those with proven chronic stability in live animal models and scalability to thousands of channels over human-brain-scale dimensions. Research in materials science will continue to underpin progress in this field of study.

The size of these gaps was found to be up to 2,000 nm. This justified the development of nanoparticles to treat solid tumours as their size is small enough to extravasate and access the tumour microenvironment. Here we show that these inter-endothelial gaps are not responsible for the transport of nanoparticles into solid tumours. Instead, we found that up to 97% of nanoparticles enter tumours using an active process through endothelial cells. This result is derived from analysis of four different mouse models, three different types of human tumours, mathematical simulation and modelling, and two different types of imaging techniques. These results challenge our current rationale for developing cancer nanomedicine and suggest that understanding these active pathways will unlock strategies to enhance tumour accumulation. The dominant mechanism of nanoparticle entry into solid tumours has now been shown to be an active trans-endothelial pathway rather than the currently established passive transport via inter-endothelial gaps.},

We demonstrate that incorporating a heterojunction between a donor polymer (PTB7-Th) and non-fullerene acceptor (EH-IDTBR) in organic nanoparticles (NPs) can result in hydrogen evolution photocatalysts with greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity. Control of the nanomorphology of these NPs was achieved by varying the stabilizing surfactant employed during NP fabrication, converting it from a core–shell structure to an intermixed donor/acceptor blend and increasing H2 evolution by an order of magnitude. The resulting photocatalysts display an unprecedentedly high H2 evolution rate of over 60,000 µmol h−1 g−1 under 350 to 800 nm illumination, and external quantum efficiencies over 6% in the region of maximum solar photon flux.

The molecular modelling clarifies how ions transport and reside inside polarized porous MOFs, and then predicts the corresponding potential-dependent capacitance in characteristic shapes. The transmission line model was adopted to characterize the charging dynamics, which further allowed evaluation of the capacitive performance of this class of supercapacitors at the macroscale from the simulation-obtained data at the nanoscale. These ‘computational microscopy’ results were supported by macroscopic electrochemical measurements. Such a combined nanoscale-to-macroscale investigation demonstrates the potential of MOF supercapacitors for achieving unprecedentedly high volumetric energy and power densities. It gives molecular insights into preferred structures of MOFs for accomplishing consistent performance with optimal energy–power balance, providing a blueprint for future characterization and design of these new supercapacitor systems. The electrochemical performance of supercapacitors can be enhanced with porous electrodes. Molecular dynamics simulations can now help to clarify the double-layer structure and capacitive performance of supercapacitors composed of MOF electrodes and ionic liquid electrolytes.},

The use of molecules as magnetic components has already shown great promise, but the diversity of properties offered by the molecular realm remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate a submonolayer of tetrairon(iii) propeller-shaped single molecule magnets deposited on a superconducting lead surface. This material combination reveals a strong influence of the superconductor on the spin dynamics of the single molecule magnet. It is shown that the superconducting transition to the condensate state switches the single molecule magnet from a blocked magnetization state to a resonant quantum tunnelling regime. Our results open perspectives to control single molecule magnetism via superconductors and to use single molecule magnets as local probes of the superconducting state.

While colour centres in three-dimensional crystals such as diamond and silicon carbide were studied in detail, they were not observed experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we report spin-dependent processes in the 2D material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We identify fluorescence lines associated with a particular defect, the negatively charged boron vacancy ($${\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{B}}^ -$$), showing a triplet (S = 1) ground state and zero-field splitting of ~3.5 GHz. We establish that this centre exhibits optically detected magnetic resonance at room temperature and demonstrate its spin polarization under optical pumping, which leads to optically induced population inversion of the spin ground state—a prerequisite for coherent spin-manipulation schemes. Our results constitute a step forward in establishing 2D hBN as a prime platform for scalable quantum technologies, with potential for spin-based quantum information and sensing applications. An ensemble of spins associated with an intrinsic defect of two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride is shown to be optically addressable, allowing spin polarization of its triplet ground state and providing evidence of spin coherence.},

  abstract     = {Defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) exhibit high-brightness, room-temperature quantum emission, but their large spectral variability and unknown local structure challenge their technological utility. Here, we directly correlate hBN quantum emission with local strain using a combination of photoluminescence (PL), cathodoluminescence (CL) and nanobeam electron diffraction. Across 40 emitters, we observe zero phonon lines (ZPLs) in PL and CL ranging from 540 to 720 nm. CL mapping reveals that multiple defects and distinct defect species located within an optically diffraction-limited region can each contribute to the observed PL spectra. Local strain maps indicate that strain is not required to activate the emitters and is not solely responsible for the observed ZPL spectral range. Instead, at least four distinct defect classes are responsible for the observed emission range, and all four classes are stable upon both optical and electron illumination. Our results provide a foundation for future atomic-scale optical characterization of colour centres. Defects in hexagonal boron nitride exhibit room-temperature quantum emission, but their unknown structural origin challenges their technological utility. A combination of optical and electron microscopy helps to distinguish at least four classes of defects and correlate them with local strain.},

  abstract     = {Developing a precise and reproducible bandgap tuning method that enables tailored design of materials is of crucial importance for optoelectronic devices. Towards this end, we report a sphere diameter engineering (SDE) technique to manipulate the bandgap of two-dimensional (2D) materials. A one-to-one correspondence with an ideal linear working curve is established between the bandgap of MoS2 and the sphere diameter in a continuous range as large as 360 meV. Fully uniform bandgap tuning of all the as-grown MoS2 crystals is realized due to the isotropic characteristic of the sphere. More intriguingly, both a decrease and an increase of the bandgap can be achieved by constructing a positive or negative curvature. By fusing individual spheres in the melted state, post-synthesis bandgap adjustment of the supported 2D materials can be realized. This SDE technique, showing good precision, uniformity and reproducibility with high efficiency, may further accelerate the potential applications of 2D materials. The bandgap of 2D molybdenum disulfide can be tuned uniformly, reproducibly and precisely over a large range by using a glass sphere support and changing the diameter of the spheres.},

The robust axion insulator state occurs in zero magnetic field, over a wide magnetic-field range and at relatively high temperatures. Moreover, a moderate magnetic field drives a quantum phase transition from the axion insulator phase to a Chern insulator phase with zero longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance h/e2, where h is Planck’s constant and e is electron charge. Our results pave the way for using even-number septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 to realize the quantized topological magnetoelectric effect and axion electrodynamics in condensed matter systems. A large longitudinal resistance and zero Hall plateau—hallmarks of an axion insulator—are found in MnBi2Te4. Moreover, a moderate magnetic field drives a quantum phase transition to a Chern insulator phase with zero longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance h/e2.},

  abstract     = {Industrial processes prominently feature π-acidic gases, and an adsorbent capable of selectively interacting with these molecules could enable important chemical separations1–4. Biological systems use accessible, reducing metal centres to bind and activate weakly π-acidic species, such as N2, through backbonding interactions5–7, and incorporating analogous moieties into a porous material should give rise to a similar adsorption mechanism for these gaseous substrates8. Here, we report a metal–organic framework featuring exposed vanadium(ii) centres capable of back-donating electron density to weak π acids to successfully target π acidity for separation applications. This adsorption mechanism, together with a high concentration of available adsorption sites, results in record N2 capacities and selectivities for the removal of N2 from mixtures with CH4, while further enabling olefin/paraffin separations at elevated temperatures. Ultimately, incorporating such π-basic metal centres into porous materials offers a handle for capturing and activating key molecular species within next-generation adsorbents. Nitrogenases use transition metals to selectively capture weak π acids such as N2 by employing backbonding interactions. Here, a metal–organic framework with exposed vanadium sites is presented that uses this approach for selective capture of N2 from CH4, with impressive selectivity and capacity.},

Crystallization rates are also considered to be useful probes of glass-forming ability1–3. At the microscopic level, crystallization is described by the classical crystal nucleation and growth theories4,5, yet in general solid formation is a far more complex process. In particular, the observation of apparently different crystal growth regimes in many binary liquid mixtures greatly challenges our understanding of crystallization1,6–12. Here, we study by experiments, theory and computer simulations the crystallization of supercooled mixtures of argon and krypton, showing that crystal growth rates in these systems can be reconciled with existing crystal growth models only by explicitly accounting for the non-ideality of the mixtures. Our results highlight the importance of thermodynamic aspects in describing the crystal growth kinetics, providing a substantial step towards a more sophisticated theory of crystal growth. The contribution of non-ideal mixing for the crystallization of supercooled mixtures of argon and krypton is reported, showing that this process is well described by classical crystal growth theories when such thermodynamics is considered.},

  abstract     = {The diffusion of defects in crystalline materials1 controls macroscopic behaviour of a wide range of processes, including alloying, precipitation, phase transformation and creep2. In real materials, intrinsic defects are unavoidably bound to static trapping centres such as impurity atoms, meaning that their diffusion is dominated by de-trapping processes. It is generally believed that de-trapping occurs only by thermal activation. Here, we report the direct observation of the quantum de-trapping of defects below around one-third of the Debye temperature. We successfully monitored the de-trapping and migration of self-interstitial atom clusters, strongly trapped by impurity atoms in tungsten, by triggering de-trapping out of equilibrium at cryogenic temperatures, using high-energy electron irradiation and in situ transmission electron microscopy. The quantum-assisted de-trapping leads to low-temperature diffusion rates orders of magnitude higher than a naive classical estimate suggests. Our analysis shows that this phenomenon is generic to any crystalline material.

  abstract     = {The integration of diverse electronic phenomena, such as magnetism and nontrivial topology, into a single system is normally studied either by seeking materials that contain both ingredients, or by layered growth of contrasting materials1–9. The ability to simply stack very different two-dimensional van der Waals materials in intimate contact permits a different approach10,11. Here we use this approach to couple the helical edges states in a two-dimensional topological insulator, monolayer WTe2 (refs. 12–16), to a two-dimensional layered antiferromagnet, CrI3 (ref. 17). We find that the edge conductance is sensitive to the magnetization state of the CrI3, and the coupling can be understood in terms of an exchange field from the nearest and next-nearest CrI3 layers that produces a gap in the helical edge. We also find that the nonlinear edge conductance depends on the magnetization of the nearest CrI3 layer relative to the current direction. At low temperatures this produces an extraordinarily large nonreciprocal current that is switched by changing the antiferromagnetic state of the CrI3. The coupling between magnetism and topology is studied in a van der Waals heterostructure.},

A key enabling factor has been significant scientific progress in improving their charge transport properties and carrier mobilities, which has been made possible by a better understanding of the molecular structure–property relationships and the underpinning charge transport physics. Here we aim to present a coherent review of how we understand charge transport in these high-mobility van der Waals bonded semiconductors. Specific questions of interest include estimates for intrinsic limits to the carrier mobilities that might ultimately be achievable; a discussion of the coupling between charge and structural dynamics; the importance of molecular conformations and mesoscale structural features; how the transport physics of conjugated polymers and small molecule semiconductors are related; and how the incorporation of counterions in doped films—as used, for example, in bioelectronics and thermoelectric devices—affects the electronic structure and charge transport properties. Organic semiconductors are making their way into applications ranging from display technology to flexible electronics and biomedical applications.

  abstract     = {Mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear envelope (NE) proteins lamins A/C, cause Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy and other diseases collectively known as laminopathies. The mechanisms responsible for these diseases remain incompletely understood. Using three mouse models of muscle laminopathies and muscle biopsies from individuals with LMNA-related muscular dystrophy, we found that Lmna mutations reduced nuclear stability and caused transient rupture of the NE in skeletal muscle cells, resulting in DNA damage, DNA damage response activation and reduced cell viability. NE and DNA damage resulted from nuclear migration during skeletal muscle maturation and correlated with disease severity in the mouse models. Reduction of cytoskeletal forces on the myonuclei prevented NE damage and rescued myofibre function and viability in Lmna mutant myofibres, indicating that myofibre dysfunction is the result of mechanically induced NE damage. Taken together, these findings implicate mechanically induced DNA damage as a pathogenic contributor to LMNA skeletal muscle diseases. Lamin mutations responsible for muscular dystrophy are shown to reduce nuclear envelope stability, resulting in mechanically induced nuclear envelope rupture, DNA damage and activation of DNA damage response pathways that lead to muscle cell death. Preventing nuclear envelope damage by reducing cytoskeletal forces on the nucleus improves muscle fibre health and function.},

This n-type polymer is also used as an anode and paired with a polymeric cathode in an enzymatic fuel cell to convert the chemical energy of glucose and oxygen into electrical power. The all-polymer biofuel cell shows a performance that scales with the glucose content in the solution and a stability that exceeds 30 days. Moreover, at physiologically relevant glucose concentrations and from fluids such as human saliva, it generates enough power to operate an organic electrochemical transistor, thus contributes to the technological advancement of self-powered micrometre-scale sensors and actuators that run on metabolites produced in the body.

However, at the nanoscale, the pathways towards crystallization have been largely unexplored owing to the challenge of resolving the motion of individual building blocks in a liquid medium. Here we address this gap by directly imaging the full transition of dispersed gold nanoprisms to a superlattice at the single-particle level. We utilize liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy at low dose rates to control nanoparticle interactions without affecting their motions. Combining particle tracking with Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal that positional ordering of the superlattice emerges from orientational disorder. This method allows us to measure parameters such as line tension and phase coordinates, charting the nonclassical nucleation pathway involving a dense, amorphous intermediate. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach via crystallization of different nanoparticles, pointing the way to more general applications. Low-dose liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy, particle tracking and numerical simulations are used to characterize the crystallization kinetics and pathways of gold nanoprisms at the single-particle level.},

  abstract     = {Zeolite MFI is a widely used catalyst and adsorbent that also holds promise as a thin-film membrane. The discovery of nanometre-thick two-dimensional (2D) MFI nanosheets has facilitated methods for thin-film zeolite fabrication that open new horizons for membrane science and engineering. However, the crystal structure of 2D-MFI nanosheets and their relationship to separation performance remain elusive. Using transmission electron microscopy, we find that one- to few-unit-cell-wide intergrowths of zeolite MEL exist within 2D-MFI. We identify the planar distribution of these 1D or near-1D-MEL domains, and show that a fraction of nanosheets have high (~25% by volume) MEL content while the majority of nanosheets are MEL-free. Atomistic simulations show that commensurate knitting of 1D-MEL within 2D-MFI creates more rigid and highly selective pores compared to pristine MFI nanosheets, and permeation experiments show a separation factor of 60 using an industrially relevant (undiluted 1 bar xylene mixture) feed. Confined growth in graphite is shown to increase the MEL content in MFI nanosheets. Our observation of these intergrowths suggests strategies for the development of ultra-selective zeolite membranes. Two-dimensional zeolite MFI nanosheets show ultra-selective separation of xylene isomers, but it was not known why this occurs. Here, using electron microscopy and atomistic simulation, it is shown that one-dimensional intergrowths of zeolite MEL enable selectivity by formation of more rigid pores.},

Alternatively, H2O2 can be produced electrochemically via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction, although the performance of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts is insufficient to meet the demands for industrialization. Interestingly, guided by first-principles calculations, we found that the catalytic properties of the Co–N4 moiety can be tailored by fine-tuning its surrounding atomic configuration to resemble the structure-dependent catalytic properties of metalloenzymes. Using this principle, we designed and synthesized a single-atom electrocatalyst that comprises an optimized Co–N4 moiety incorporated in nitrogen-doped graphene for H2O2 production and exhibits a kinetic current density of 2.8 mA cm−2 (at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) and a mass activity of 155 A g−1 (at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) with negligible activity loss over 110 hours. Producing H2O2 electrochemically currently use electrocatalysts that are insufficient to meet the demands for industrialization.

  abstract     = {All-solid-state Li-ion batteries promise safer electrochemical energy storage with larger volumetric and gravimetric energy densities. A major concern is the limited electrochemical stability of solid electrolytes and related detrimental electrochemical reactions, especially because of our restricted understanding. Here we demonstrate for the argyrodite-, garnet- and NASICON-type solid electrolytes that the favourable decomposition pathway is indirect rather than direct, via (de)lithiated states of the solid electrolyte, into the thermodynamically stable decomposition products. The consequence is that the electrochemical stability window of the solid electrolyte is notably larger than predicted for direct decomposition, rationalizing the observed stability window. The observed argyrodite metastable (de)lithiated solid electrolyte phases contribute to the (ir)reversible cycling capacity of all-solid-state batteries, in addition to the contribution of the decomposition products, comprehensively explaining solid electrolyte redox activity. The fundamental nature of the proposed mechanism suggests this is a key aspect for solid electrolytes in general, guiding interface and material design for all-solid-state batteries. Although all-solid-state Li-ion batteries exhibit enhanced energy densities, electrochemical stability of solid electrolytes remains a challenge. A mechanism explaining the relationship between redox activity and electrochemical stability for typical solid electrolytes is now proposed.},

  abstract     = {Despite the high energy density of lithium-rich layered-oxide electrodes, their real-world implementation in batteries is hindered by the substantial voltage decay on cycling. This voltage decay is widely accepted to mainly originate from progressive structural rearrangements involving irreversible transition-metal migration. As prevention of this spontaneous cation migration has proven difficult, a paradigm shift toward management of its reversibility is needed. Herein, we demonstrate that the reversibility of the cation migration of lithium-rich nickel manganese oxides can be remarkably improved by altering the oxygen stacking sequences in the layered structure and thereby dramatically reducing the voltage decay. The preeminent intra-cycle reversibility of the cation migration is experimentally visualized, and first-principles calculations reveal that an O2-type structure restricts the movements of transition metals within the Li layer, which effectively streamlines the returning migration path of the transition metals. Furthermore, we propose that the enhanced reversibility mitigates the asymmetry of the anionic redox in conventional lithium-rich electrodes, promoting the high-potential anionic reduction, thereby reducing the subsequent voltage hysteresis. Our findings demonstrate that regulating the reversibility of the cation migration is a practical strategy to reduce voltage decay and hysteresis in lithium-rich layered materials. The use of high-energy-density lithium-rich layered-oxide electrodes in batteries is hindered by voltage decay on cycling. Improving the reversible cation migration by altering oxygen stacking is shown to suppress voltage decay and redox asymmetry in lithium-rich nickel manganese oxides.},

  abstract     = {The composition of perovskite has been optimized combinatorially such that it often contains six components (AxByC1−x−yPbXzY3−z) in state-of-art perovskite solar cells. Questions remain regarding the precise role of each component, and the lack of a mechanistic explanation limits the practical exploration of the large and growing chemical space. Here, aided by transient photoluminescence microscopy, we find that, in perovskite single crystals, carrier diffusivity is in fact independent of composition. In polycrystalline thin films, the different compositions play a crucial role in carrier diffusion. We report that methylammonium (MA)-based films show a high carrier diffusivity of 0.047 cm2 s−1, while MA-free mixed caesium-formamidinium (CsFA) films exhibit an order of magnitude lower diffusivity. Elemental composition studies show that CsFA grains display a graded composition. This curtails electron diffusion in these films, as seen in both vertical carrier transport and surface potential studies. Incorporation of MA leads to a uniform grain core-to-edge composition, giving rise to a diffusivity of 0.034 cm2 s−1 in CsMAFA films. A model that invokes competing crystallization processes allows us to account for this finding, and suggests further strategies to achieve homogeneous crystallization for the benefit of perovskite optoelectronics. Methylammonium is shown to influence the crystallization process in hybrid lead halide perovskites, leading to a more homogeneous chemical distribution of caesium and formamidinium and improved charge transport between grains in multi-cation systems.},

  abstract     = {Materials can suffer mechanical fatigue when subjected to cyclic loading at stress levels much lower than the ultimate tensile strength, and understanding this behaviour is critical to evaluating long-term dynamic reliability. The fatigue life and damage mechanisms of two-dimensional (2D) materials, of interest for mechanical and electronic applications, are currently unknown. Here, we present a fatigue study of freestanding 2D materials, specifically graphene and graphene oxide (GO). Using atomic force microscopy, monolayer and few-layer graphene were found to exhibit a fatigue life of more than 109 cycles at a mean stress of 71 GPa and a stress range of 5.6 GPa, higher than any material reported so far. Fatigue failure in monolayer graphene is global and catastrophic without progressive damage, while molecular dynamics simulations reveal this is preceded by stress-mediated bond reconfigurations near defective sites. Conversely, functional groups in GO impart a local and progressive fatigue damage mechanism. This study not only provides fundamental insights into the fatigue enhancement behaviour of graphene-embedded nanocomposites, but also serves as a starting point for the dynamic reliability evaluation of other 2D materials. Mechanical fatigue occurs under cyclic stress much lower than the tensile strength, but this has not been investigated for 2D materials. Here, graphene is found to have a fatigue life of 109 cycles.},

  abstract     = {The ground-state properties of correlated electron systems can be extraordinarily sensitive to external stimuli, offering abundant platforms for functional materials. Using the multi-messenger combination of atomic force microscopy, cryogenic scanning near-field optical microscopy, magnetic force microscopy and ultrafast laser excitation, we demonstrate both ‘writing’ and ‘erasing’ of a metastable ferromagnetic metal phase in strained films of La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) with nanometre-resolved finesse. By tracking both optical conductivity and magnetism at the nanoscale, we reveal how strain-coupling underlies the dynamic growth, spontaneous nanotexture and first-order melting transition of this hidden photoinduced metal. Our first-principles calculations reveal that epitaxially engineered Jahn–Teller distortion can stabilize nearly degenerate antiferromagnetic insulator and ferromagnetic metal phases. We propose a Ginzburg–Landau description to rationalize the co-active interplay of strain, lattice distortions and magnetism nano-resolved here in strained LCMO, thus guiding future functional engineering of epitaxial oxides into the regime of phase-programmable materials. A multi-messenger combination of atomic force microscopy, scanning near-field optical microscopy and magnetic force microscopy demonstrates a strain-modulated photoinduced ferromagnetic metallic state in La2/3Ca1/3MnO3.},

  abstract     = {The nucleation of crystals has long been thought to occur through the stochastic association of ions, atoms or molecules to form critical nuclei, which will later grow out to crystals1. Only in the past decade has the awareness grown that crystallization can also proceed through the assembly of different types of building blocks2,3, including amorphous precursors4, primary particles5, prenucleation species6,7, dense liquid droplets8,9 or nanocrystals10. However, the forces that control these alternative pathways are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate the crystallization of magnetite (Fe3O4) through the formation and aggregation of primary particles and show that both the thermodynamics and the kinetics of the process can be described in terms of colloidal assembly. This model allows predicting the average crystal size at a given initial Fe concentration, thereby opening the way to the design of crystals with predefined sizes and properties. The kinetics and thermodynamics of the nucleation of magnetite crystals from primary particles are shown to be described by colloidal assembly theory, allowing for predictions of crystal sizes to be made.},

However, chiral textures should also exist in other types of ferroic materials, such as antiferromagnets, for which theory predicts that they should move faster for lower power3, and ferroelectrics, where they should be extremely small and possess unusual topologies4,5. Here, we report the concomitant observation of antiferromagnetic and electric chiral textures at domain walls in the room-temperature ferroelectric antiferromagnet BiFeO3. Combining reciprocal and real-space characterization techniques, we reveal the presence of periodic chiral antiferromagnetic objects along the domain walls as well as a priori energetically unfavourable chiral ferroelectric domain walls. We discuss the mechanisms underlying their formation and their relevance for electrically controlled topological oxide electronics and spintronics. Chiral electric and magnetic structures are observed at domain walls in thin films of the room-temperature multiferroic BiFeO3.},

  abstract     = {The search continues for nickel oxide-based materials with electronic properties similar to cuprate high-temperature superconductors1–10. The recent discovery of superconductivity in the doped infinite-layer nickelate NdNiO2 (refs. 11,12) has strengthened these efforts. Here, we use X-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory to show that the electronic structure of LaNiO2 and NdNiO2, while similar to the cuprates, includes significant distinctions. Unlike cuprates, the rare-earth spacer layer in the infinite-layer nickelate supports a weakly interacting three-dimensional 5d metallic state, which hybridizes with a quasi-two-dimensional, strongly correlated state with $$3d_{x^2-y^2}$$ symmetry in the NiO2 layers. Thus, the infinite-layer nickelate can be regarded as a sibling of the rare-earth intermetallics13–15, which are well known for heavy fermion behaviour, where the NiO2 correlated layers play an analogous role to the 4f states in rare-earth heavy fermion compounds. This Kondo- or Anderson-lattice-like ‘oxide-intermetallic’ replaces the Mott insulator as the reference state from which superconductivity emerges upon doping. X-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory are used to show that the electronic structure of the parent compound of superconducting infinite-layer nickelates, while similar to the copper-based high-temperature superconductors, has significant differences.},

The exact nature of these transitions and their modulation by anticancer drugs such as Taxol and epothilone, which can stabilize microtubules but also perturb their growth, are poorly understood. Here, we directly visualize the action of fluorescent Taxol and epothilone derivatives and show that microtubules can transition to a state that triggers cooperative drug binding to form regions with altered lattice conformation. Such regions emerge at growing microtubule ends that are in a pre-catastrophe state, and inhibit microtubule growth and shortening. Electron microscopy and in vitro dynamics data indicate that taxane accumulation zones represent incomplete tubes that can persist, incorporate tubulin dimers and repeatedly induce microtubule rescues. Thus, taxanes modulate the material properties of microtubules by converting destabilized growing microtubule ends into regions resistant to depolymerization. Anticancer drugs such as Taxol can affect microtubule dynamics and organization in cells. Direct visualization of the action of such drugs has shown that they can trigger local and cooperative changes in microtubule lattice and induce formation of stable microtubule regions that promote rescues.},

  abstract     = {Biological membranes are ideal for separations as they provide high permeability while maintaining high solute selectivity due to the presence of specialized membrane protein (MP) channels. However, successful integration of MPs into manufactured membranes has remained a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate a two-hour organic solvent method to develop 2D crystals and nanosheets of highly packed pore-forming MPs in block copolymers (BCPs). We then integrate these hybrid materials into scalable MP-BCP biomimetic membranes. These MP-BCP nanosheet membranes maintain the molecular selectivity of the three types of β-barrel MP channels used, with pore sizes of 0.8 nm, 1.3 nm, and 1.5 nm. These biomimetic membranes demonstrate water permeability that is 20–1,000 times greater than that of commercial membranes and 1.5–45 times greater than that of the latest research membranes with comparable molecular exclusion ratings. This approach could provide high performance alternatives in the challenging sub-nanometre to few-nanometre size range. Protein channels are highly selective, but application in membranes is limited due to low protein content.

  abstract     = {Acceptor-doped barium zirconate is a promising proton-conducting oxide for various applications, for example, electrolysers, fuel cells or methane-conversion cells. Despite many experimental and theoretical investigations there is, however, only a limited understanding as to how to connect the complex microscopic proton motion and the macroscopic proton conductivity for the full range of acceptor levels, from diluted acceptors to concentrated solid solutions. Here we show that a combination of density functional theory calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations enables this connection. At low concentrations, acceptors trap protons, which results in a decrease of the average proton mobility. With increasing concentration, however, acceptors form nanoscale percolation pathways with low proton migration energies, which leads to a strong increase of the proton mobility and conductivity. Comparing our simulated proton conductivities with experimental values for yttrium-doped barium zirconate yields excellent agreement. We then predict that ordered dopant structures would not only strongly enhance the proton conductivities, but would also enable one- or two-dimensional proton conduction in barium zirconate. Finally, we show how the properties of other dopants influence the proton conductivity. Although acceptor-doped barium zirconate is a promising conductor for electrolysers or fuel cells, our understanding of the relationship between proton motion and conductivity is limited. Our simulations now suggest a generic nanoscale percolation mechanism for high mobility in other oxides.},

  abstract     = {Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are widely used to engineer the surface properties of metals. The relatively simple and versatile chemistry of metal–thiolate bonds makes thiolate SAMs the preferred option in a range of applications, yet fragility and a tendency to oxidize in air limit their long-term use. Here, we report the formation of thiol-free self-assembled mono- and bilayers of glycol ethers, which bind to the surface of coinage metals through the spontaneous chemisorption of glycol ether-functionalized fullerenes. As-prepared assemblies are bilayers presenting fullerene cages at both the substrate and ambient interface. Subsequent exposure to functionalized glycol ethers displaces the topmost layer of glycol ether-functionalized fullerenes, and the resulting assemblies expose functional groups to the ambient interface. These layers exhibit the key properties of thiolate SAMs, yet they are stable to ambient conditions for several weeks, as shown by the performance of tunnelling junctions formed from SAMs of alkyl-functionalized glycol ethers. Glycol ether-functionalized spiropyrans incorporated into mixed monolayers lead to reversible, light-driven conductance switching. Self-assemblies of glycol ethers are drop-in replacements for thiolate SAMs that retain all of their useful properties while avoiding the drawbacks of metal–thiolate bonds. Chemisorbed molecules combining glycol-ether moieties and fullerenes are shown to form uniform and air-stable self-assembled bilayers on coinage metals, and are amenable to versatile functionalization by in-place exchange of the top layer.},

  abstract     = {Improving charge mobility in quantum dot (QD) films is important for the performance of photodetectors, solar cells and light-emitting diodes. However, these applications also require preservation of well defined QD electronic states and optical transitions. Here, we present HgTe QD films that show high mobility for charges transported through discrete QD states. A hybrid surface passivation process efficiently eliminates surface states, provides tunable air-stable n and p doping and enables hysteresis-free filling of QD states evidenced by strong conductance modulation. QD films dried at room temperature without any post-treatments exhibit mobility up to μ ~ 8 cm2 V−1 s−1 at a low carrier density of less than one electron per QD, band-like behaviour down to 77 K, and similar drift and Hall mobilities at all temperatures. This unprecedented set of electronic properties raises important questions about the delocalization and hopping mechanisms for transport in QD solids, and introduces opportunities for improving QD technologies. High charge mobility while retaining signatures of quantum-confined states is obtained in films of surface-passivated HgTe quantum dots.},

This has resulted in structural designs that feature a near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion. However, the dimensional instabilities that result from moisture ingression and release remain the fundamental vulnerability of the matrix, which restricts many applications. Here, we address this challenge by developing a space-qualifiable physical surface barrier that blends within the mechanical properties of the composite, thus becoming part of the composite itself. The resulting enhanced composite features mechanical integrity and a strength that is superior to the underlying composite, while remaining impervious to moisture and outgassing. We demonstrate production capability for a model-sized component for the Sentinel-5 mission and demonstrate such capability for future European Space Agency (ESA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) programmes such as Copernicus Extension, Earth Explorer and Science Cosmic Visions. Multiple layers of diamond-like carbon films are shown to act as moisture barriers when conformally deposited on carbon fibre reinforced polymers used in space applications.},

Here we report that, under simulated repository conditions, corrosion could be significantly accelerated at the interfaces of different barrier materials, which has not been considered in the current safety and performance assessment models. Severe localized corrosion was found at the interfaces between stainless steel and a model nuclear waste glass and between stainless steel and a ceramic waste form. The accelerated corrosion can be attributed to changes of solution chemistry and local acidity/alkalinity within a confined space, which significantly alter the corrosion of both the waste-form materials and the metallic canisters. The corrosion that is accelerated by the interface interaction between dissimilar materials could profoundly impact the service life of the nuclear waste packages, which, therefore, should be carefully considered when evaluating the performance of waste forms and their packages. Moreover, compatible barriers should be selected to further optimize the performance of the geological repository system. Immobilization of radionuclides in glass or ceramic forms in stainless steel in deep geological repositories is planned in the US for disposal of nuclear waste.

These continuum limits are evident in two-dimensional materials, where there is no consensus on their bending stiffnesses or how they scale with thickness. Through combined computational and electron microscopy experiments, we measure the bending stiffness of graphene, obtaining 1.2–1.7 eV for a monolayer. Moreover, we find that the bending stiffness of few-layer graphene decreases sharply as a function of bending angle, tuning by almost 400% for trilayer graphene. This softening results from shear, slip and the onset of superlubricity between the atomic layers and corresponds with a gradual change in scaling power from cubic to linear. Our results provide a unified model for bending in two-dimensional materials and show that their multilayers can be orders of magnitude softer than previously thought, among the most flexible electronic materials currently known. The bending stiffness of few-layer graphene is shown to decrease significantly with the bending angle due to shear and slip between the atomic layers, which culminate in superlubric behaviour as the bending angle further increases.},

However, issues such as lattice mismatch or a small misalignment of the constituent layers can drastically suppress electron–photon coupling for these interlayer transitions. Here, we engineered type-II interfaces by assembling atomically thin crystals that have the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band at the Γ point, and thus avoid any momentum mismatch. We found that these van der Waals interfaces exhibit radiative optical transitions irrespective of the lattice constant, the rotational and/or translational alignment of the two layers or whether the constituent materials are direct or indirect gap semiconductors. Being robust and of general validity, our results broaden the scope of future optoelectronics device applications based on two-dimensional materials.

Here, we report a large θSH of 0.32 accompanied by a long Lsf of 2.2 μm at room temperature in a low-symmetry few-layered semimetal MoTe2, thus identifying it as an excellent candidate for simultaneous spin generation, transport and detection. In addition, we report that longitudinal spin current with out-of-plane polarization can be generated by both transverse and vertical charge current, due to the conventional and a newly observed planar SHE, respectively. Our study suggests that manipulation of crystalline symmetries and strong SOC opens access to new charge-spin interconversion configurations and spin–orbit torques for spintronic applications.

Particles with complete Pt coverage precisely maintained their core–shell structure and atomic composition during accelerated electrochemical ageing studies consisting of over 10,000 potential cycles. The exceptional durability of fully coated materials highlights the potential of core–shell architectures using earth-abundant transition metal carbide (TMC) and nitride (TMN) cores for future catalytic applications.

Pt is currently the most common catalyst used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in devices such as fuel cells and metal–air batteries2,3, although a scalable use is restricted by the scarcity, cost and vulnerability to poisoning of Pt (refs 4–6). Here we show that nanoparticulate zirconium nitride (ZrN) can replace and even surpass Pt as a catalyst for ORR in alkaline environments. As-synthesized ZrN nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit a high oxygen reduction performance with the same activity as that of a widely used Pt-on-carbon (Pt/C) commercial catalyst. Both materials show the same half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.80 V) and ZrN has a higher stability (ΔE1/2 = −3 mV) than the Pt/C catalyst (ΔE1/2 = −39 mV) after 1,000 ORR cycles in 0.1 M KOH. ZrN is also shown to deliver a greater power density and cyclability than Pt/C in a zinc–air battery. Replacement of Pt by ZrN is likely to reduce costs and promote the usage of electrochemical energy devices, and ZrN may also be useful in other catalytic systems. Platinum catalysts are widely used for oxygen reduction reactions in electrochemical devices but scalability is restricted by scarcity, cost and vulnerability to poisoning.

A potential way to exploit the pseudospin of electrons in pseudospintronics3–5 is to find quantum matter with tunable and sizeable pseudospin polarization. Here, we propose a bipolar pseudospin semiconductor, where the electron and hole states have opposite net pseudospin polarization. We experimentally identify such states in anisotropic honeycomb crystal—black phosphorus. By sublattice interference of photoelectrons, we find bipolar pseudospin polarization greater than 95% that is stable at room temperature. This pseudospin polarization is identified as a consequence of Dirac cones merged in the highly anisotropic honeycomb system6,7. The bipolar pseudospin semiconductor, which is a pseudospin analogue of magnetic semiconductors, is not only interesting in itself, but also might be useful for pseudospintronics. Anisotropic honeycomb crystal of black phosphorous is found to have pseudospin polarization greater than 95% at room temperature, attributed to the merging of Dirac cones. This bipolar pseudospin semiconductor may be useful for pseudospintronics.},

  abstract     = {The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) addresses the need for storage of renewable energy in valuable carbon-based fuels and feedstocks, yet challenges remain in the improvement of electrosynthesis pathways for highly selective hydrocarbon production. To improve catalysis further, it is of increasing interest to lever synergies between heterogeneous and homogeneous approaches. Organic molecules or metal complexes adjacent to heterogeneous active sites provide additional binding interactions that may tune the stability of intermediates, improving catalytic performance by increasing Faradaic efficiency (product selectivity), as well as decreasing overpotential. We offer a forward-looking perspective on molecularly enhanced heterogeneous catalysis for CO2RR. We discuss four categories of molecularly enhanced strategies: molecular-additive-modified heterogeneous catalysts, immobilized organometallic complex catalysts, reticular catalysts and metal-free polymer catalysts. We introduce present-day challenges in molecular strategies and describe a vision for CO2RR electrocatalysis towards multi-carbon products. These strategies provide potential avenues to address the challenges of catalyst activity, selectivity and stability in the further development of CO2RR. The carbon dioxide reduction reaction can enable renewable energy storage by producing valuable products such as ethylene. This Perspective provides an overview of strategies that use molecular enhancement of heterogeneous catalysts to improve activity, efficiency and selectivity.},

  abstract     = {A common feature of cancer cells is the alteration of kinases and biochemical signalling pathways enabling transformed growth on soft matrices, whereas cytoskeletal protein alterations are thought to be a secondary issue. However, we report here that cancer cells from different tissues can be toggled between transformed and rigidity-dependent growth states by the absence or presence of mechanosensory modules, respectively. In various cancer lines from different tissues, cells had over tenfold fewer rigidity-sensing contractions compared with normal cells from the same tissues. Restoring normal levels of cytoskeletal proteins, including tropomyosins, restored rigidity sensing and rigidity-dependent growth. Further depletion of other rigidity sensor proteins, including myosin IIA, restored transformed growth and blocked sensing. In addition, restoration of rigidity sensing to cancer cells inhibited tumour formation and changed expression patterns. Thus, the depletion of rigidity-sensing modules through alterations in cytoskeletal protein levels enables cancer cell growth on soft surfaces, which is an enabling factor for cancer progression. A range of cancer cell types are shown to lack rigidity-sensing due to alteration in specific cytoskeletal sensor proteins and this sensing ability can be reversed from a transformed to a rigidity-dependent growth state by the sensor proteins, resulting in restoration of contractility and adhesion.},

  abstract     = {The isotropic or anisotropic organization of biological extracellular matrices has important consequences for tissue function. We study emergent anisotropy using fibroblasts that generate varying degrees of matrix alignment from uniform starting conditions. This reveals that the early migratory paths of fibroblasts are correlated with subsequent matrix organization. Combined experimentation and adaptation of Vicsek modelling demonstrates that the reorientation of cells relative to each other following collision plays a role in generating matrix anisotropy. We term this behaviour ‘cell collision guidance’. The transcription factor TFAP2C regulates cell collision guidance in part by controlling the expression of RND3. RND3 localizes to cell–cell collision zones where it downregulates actomyosin activity. Cell collision guidance fails without this mechanism in place, leading to isotropic matrix generation. The cross-referencing of alignment and TFAP2C gene expression signatures against existing datasets enables the identification and validation of several classes of pharmacological agents that disrupt matrix anisotropy. The generation of aligned extracellular matrices by fibroblasts is shown to depend on cell reorientation following collision, leading to closer alignment of the cells’ long axes. This cell collision guidance depends on the transcription factor TFAP2C and localized regulation of actomyosin contractility.},

  abstract     = {Haematopoietic cells and platelets employ G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to sense extracellular information and respond by initiating integrin-mediated adhesion. So far, such processes have not been demonstrated in non-haematopoietic cells. Here, we report that the activation of protease-activated receptors PAR1 and PAR2 induce multiple signalling pathways to establish α5β1-integrin-mediated adhesion. First, PARs signal via Gβγ and PI3K to α5β1-integrins to adopt a talin- and kindlin-dependent high-affinity conformation, which triggers fibronectin binding and initiates cell adhesion. Then, within 60 s, PARs signal via Gα13, Gαi, ROCK and Src to strengthen the α5β1-integrin-mediated adhesion. Furthermore, PAR signalling changes the abundance of numerous proteins in the adhesome assembled by α5β1-integrins, including Gα13, vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 36, and band 4.1-like protein 4B or 5, and accelerates cell adhesion maturation, spreading and migration. The mechanistic insights describe how agonist binding to PAR employs GPCR and integrin-signalling pathways to initiate and regulate adhesion and to guide physiological responses of non-haematopoietic cells. As in haematopoietic cells and platelets, agonist binding to protease-activated receptors PAR1 and PAR2 in non-haematopoietic cells also triggers signalling pathways that lead to α5β1-integrin-mediated cell adhesion.},

The few enticing examples of 3D printed glasses are limited in their chemical compositions and suffer from the low resolution achievable with particle-based or molten glass technologies. Here, we report a digital light-processing 3D printing platform that exploits the photopolymerization-induced phase separation of hybrid resins to create glass parts with complex shapes, high spatial resolutions and multi-oxide chemical compositions. Analogously to conventional porous glass fabrication methods, we exploit phase separation phenomena to fabricate complex glass parts displaying light-controlled multiscale porosity and dense multicomponent transparent glasses with arbitrary geometry using a desktop printer. Because most functional properties of glasses emerge from their transparency and multicomponent nature, this 3D printing platform may be useful for distinct technologies, sciences and arts. Photopolymerization-induced phase separation of resins enables the high-resolution 3D printing of glass oxides with intricate shapes and distinct chemical composition.},

Here we report a general synthetic orthogonal assembly approach to controllably construct 3D multilayer-crossed metal oxide nanowire arrays. Taking tungsten oxide semiconducting nanowires as an example, we show the spontaneous orthogonal packing of composite nanorods of poly(ethylene oxide)-block-polystyrene and silicotungstic acid; the following calcination gives rise to 3D cross-stacked nanowire arrays of Si-doped metastable ε-phase WO3. This nanowire stack framework was also tested as a gas detector for the selective sensing of acetone. By using other polyoxometallates, this fabrication method for woodpile-like 3D nanostructures can also be generalized to different doped metal oxide nanowires, which provides a way to manipulate their physical properties for various applications. Orthogonal self-assembly of amphiphilic diblock copolymers and polyoxometallates followed by calcination allows the formation of cross-stacked multilayer 3D arrays of tungsten oxide nanowires.},

However, it remains challenging to design cost-effective, easily processed ion-conductive membranes with well-defined pore architectures. Here, we report a new approach to designing membranes with narrow molecular-sized channels and hydrophilic functionality that enable fast transport of salt ions and high size-exclusion selectivity towards small organic molecules. These membranes, based on polymers of intrinsic microporosity containing Tröger’s base or amidoxime groups, demonstrate that exquisite control over subnanometre pore structure, the introduction of hydrophilic functional groups and thickness control all play important roles in achieving fast ion transport combined with high molecular selectivity. These membranes enable aqueous organic flow batteries with high energy efficiency and high capacity retention, suggesting their utility for a variety of energy-related devices and water purification processes. Ion-selective membranes are widely used for water purification and electrochemical energy devices but designing their pore architectures is challenging.

  abstract     = {The photoelectrochemical (PEC) production of syngas from water and CO2 represents an attractive technology towards a circular carbon economy. However, the high overpotential, low selectivity and cost of commonly employed catalysts pose challenges for this sustainable energy-conversion process. Here we demonstrate highly tunable PEC syngas production by integrating a cobalt porphyrin catalyst immobilized on carbon nanotubes with triple-cation mixed halide perovskite and BiVO4 photoabsorbers. Empirical data analysis is used to clarify the optimal electrode selectivity at low catalyst loadings. The perovskite photocathodes maintain selective aqueous CO2 reduction for one day at light intensities as low as 0.1 sun, which provides pathways to maximize daylight utilization by operating even under low solar irradiance. Under 1 sun irradiation, the perovskite–BiVO4 PEC tandems sustain bias-free syngas production coupled to water oxidation for three days. The devices present solar-to-H2 and solar-to-CO conversion efficiencies of 0.06 and 0.02%, respectively, and are able to operate as standalone artificial leaves in neutral pH solution. Photoelectrochemical production of syngas from water and CO2 is technologically attractive but overpotentials, low selectivity and catalyst cost remain challenging. Tunable syngas production integrating cobalt porphyrin catalysts with perovskite and BiVO4 photoabsorbers is now shown.},

However, intrinsically stretchable optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting capacitors usually require high driving alternating voltages and excitation frequencies to achieve sufficient luminance in ambient lighting conditions. Here, we present a healable, low-field illuminating optoelectronic stretchable (HELIOS) device by introducing a transparent, high permittivity polymeric dielectric material. The HELIOS device turns on at an alternating voltage of 23 V and a frequency below 1 kHz, safe operating conditions for human–machine interactions. We achieved a brightness of 1,460 cd m−2 at 2.5 V µm−1 with stable illumination demonstrated up to a maximum of 800% strain. The materials also self-healed mechanically and electronically from punctures or when severed. We further demonstrate various HELIOS light-emitting capacitor devices in environment sensing using optical feedback. Moreover, our devices can be powered wirelessly, potentially enabling applications for untethered damage-resilient soft robots. Stretchable and self-healing light-emitting capacitors operating at low frequency and low voltage have been realized using a transparent elastomeric dielectric with high permittivity.},

  abstract     = {Epitaxial strain can unlock enhanced properties in oxide materials, but restricts substrate choice and maximum film thickness, above which lattice relaxation and property degradation occur. Here we employ a chemical alternative to epitaxial strain by providing targeted chemical pressure, distinct from random doping, to induce a ferroelectric instability with the strategic introduction of barium into today’s best millimetre-wave tuneable dielectric, the epitaxially strained 50-nm-thick n = 6 (SrTiO3)nSrO Ruddlesden–Popper dielectric grown on (110) DyScO3. The defect mitigating nature of (SrTiO3)nSrO results in unprecedented low loss at frequencies up to 125 GHz. No barium-containing Ruddlesden–Popper titanates are known, but the resulting atomically engineered superlattice material, (SrTiO3)n−m(BaTiO3)mSrO, enables low-loss, tuneable dielectric properties to be achieved with lower epitaxial strain and a 200% improvement in the figure of merit at commercially relevant millimetre-wave frequencies. As tuneable dielectrics are key constituents of emerging millimetre-wave high-frequency devices in telecommunications, our findings could lead to higher performance adaptive and reconfigurable electronics at these frequencies. Strain can modify properties, but to prevent cracking is limited to films below a critical thickness. Here, by inserting atomic layers into a ferroelectric superlattice, chemical pressure is generated in thicker films, with enhanced figure of merit for tuneable millimetre-wave dielectrics.},

However, despite the diversity of existing bulk materials and the recent advent of interfacial and low-dimensional effects, control of this interconversion at room temperature remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate strongly enhanced room-temperature spin-to-charge interconversion in graphene driven by the proximity of WS2. By performing spin precession experiments in appropriately designed Hall bars, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall and the spin galvanic effects. Remarkably, their corresponding conversion efficiencies can be tailored by electrostatic gating in magnitude and sign, peaking near the charge neutrality point with an equivalent magnitude that is comparable to the largest efficiencies reported to date. Such electric-field tunability provides a building block for spin generation free from magnetic materials and for ultra-compact magnetic memory technologies. Enhanced spin-charge conversion in graphene is realized by proximity coupling to WS2 and electric-field tunability is demonstrated.},

However, the paradigmatic states of the idealized two-dimensional kagome lattice—Dirac fermions and flat bands—have not been simultaneously observed. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and de Haas–van Alphen quantum oscillations to reveal coexisting surface and bulk Dirac fermions as well as flat bands in the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeSn, which has spatially decoupled kagome planes. Our band structure calculations and matrix element simulations demonstrate that the bulk Dirac bands arise from in-plane localized Fe-3d orbitals, and evidence that the coexisting Dirac surface state realizes a rare example of fully spin-polarized two-dimensional Dirac fermions due to spin-layer locking in FeSn. The prospect to harness these prototypical excitations in a kagome lattice is a frontier of great promise at the confluence of topology, magnetism and strongly correlated physics. A prototypical kagome metal with magnetic and topological properties is identified.},

  abstract     = {Thermal detectors, such as bolometric, pyroelectric and thermoelectric devices, are uniquely capable of sensing incident radiation for any electromagnetic frequency; however, the response times of practical devices are typically on the millisecond scale1–7. By integrating a plasmonic metasurface with an aluminium nitride pyroelectric thin film, we demonstrate spectrally selective, room-temperature pyroelectric detectors from 660–2,000 nm with an instrument-limited 1.7 ns full width at half maximum and 700 ps rise time. Heat generated from light absorption diffuses through the subwavelength absorber into the pyroelectric film producing responsivities up to 0.18 V W−1 due to the temperature-dependent spontaneous polarization of the pyroelectric films. Moreover, finite-element simulations reveal the possibility of reaching a 25 ps full width at half maximum and 6 ps rise time rivalling that of semiconductor photodiodes8. This design approach has the potential to realize large-area, inexpensive gigahertz pyroelectric detectors for wavelength-specific detection from the ultraviolet to short-wave infrared or beyond for, for example, high-speed hyperspectral imaging. The ultrafast response of a pyroelectric sensor with near-infrared responsivity is demonstrated by combining a pyroelectric thermal detector with wavelength-selective nanoparticle absorbers.},

A field where these materials have yet to make a deep impact is antiferromagnetic spintronics—a relatively new research direction promising technologies with fast switching times, insensitivity to magnetic perturbations and reduced cross-talk1–3. Here, we present measurements on the intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Fe1/3NbS2 that exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below 42 K (refs. 4,5). We find that remarkably low current densities of the order of 104 A cm−2 can reorient the magnetic order, which can be detected through changes in the sample resistance, demonstrating its use as an electronically accessible antiferromagnetic switch. Fe1/3NbS2 is part of a larger family of magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides, some of which may exhibit switching at room temperature, forming a platform from which to build tuneable antiferromagnetic spintronic devices6,7. A remarkably low critical current is found to reorient the magnetic order in a magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide, suggesting this class of materials could form a basis for antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

  abstract     = {While conventional approaches for inflammatory bowel diseases mainly focus on suppressing hyperactive immune responses, it remains unclear how to address disrupted intestinal barriers, dysbiosis of the gut commensal microbiota and dysregulated mucosal immune responses in inflammatory bowel diseases. Moreover, immunosuppressive agents can cause off-target systemic side effects and complications. Here, we report the development of hyaluronic acid–bilirubin nanomedicine (HABN) that accumulates in inflamed colonic epithelium and restores the epithelium barriers in a murine model of acute colitis. Surprisingly, HABN also modulates the gut microbiota, increasing the overall richness and diversity and markedly augmenting the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Clostridium XIVα, which are microorganisms with crucial roles in gut homeostasis. Importantly, HABN associated with pro-inflammatory macrophages, regulated innate immune responses and exerted potent therapeutic efficacy against colitis. Our work sheds light on the impact of nanotherapeutics on gut homeostasis, microbiome and innate immune responses for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Imbalance of the gut microbiome has been implicated in numerous human diseases. Nanoparticles have now been designed to target colitis by modulating the gut microbiome, local innate immune response and restoration of the intestinal barrier function.},

  abstract     = {Throughout embryonic development and adult life, epithelia are subjected to compressive deformations. While these have been shown to trigger mechanosensitive responses such as cell extrusion and differentiation, which span tens of minutes, little is known about how epithelia adapt to compression over shorter timescales. Here, using suspended epithelia, we uncover the immediate response of epithelial tissues to the application of in-plane compressive strains (5–80%). We show that fast compression induces tissue buckling followed by actomyosin-dependent tissue flattening that erases the buckle within tens of seconds, in both mono- and multi-layered epithelia. Strikingly, we identify a well-defined limit to this response, so that stable folds form in the tissue when compressive strains exceed a ‘buckling threshold’ of ~35%. A combination of experiment and modelling shows that this behaviour is orchestrated by adaptation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton as it re-establishes tissue tension following compression. Thus, tissue pre-tension allows epithelia to both buffer against deformation and sets their ability to form and retain folds during morphogenesis. Epithelial tissues behave as pre-tensed viscoelastic sheets that can buffer against compression and rapidly recover from buckling. Epithelial mechanical properties define a tissue-intrinsic buckling threshold that dictates the compressive strain above which tissue folds become permanent.},

Since then, canonical approaches for fabricating silk-based materials typically involve solution-derived processing methods, which have inherent limitations with respect to silk protein solubility and stability in solution, and time and cost efficiency. Here we report a thermal processing method for the direct solid-state moulding of regenerated silk into bulk ‘parts’ or devices with tunable mechanical properties. At elevated temperature and pressure, regenerated amorphous silk nanomaterials with ultralow β-sheet content undergo thermal fusion via molecular rearrangement and self-assembly assisted by bound water to form a robust bulk material that retains biocompatibility, degradability and machinability. This technique reverses presumptions about the limitations of direct thermal processing of silk into a wide range of new material formats and composite materials with tailored properties and functionalities. Biocompatible and degradable silk materials with programmable mechanical properties can be directly obtained from regenerated amorphous silk using thermal moulding.},

Nonetheless, blue-phase liquid crystals with distinct crystal symmetries and thus band structures will be advantageous for optical applications. Here we use repetitive electrical pulses to reconfigure blue-phase liquid crystals into stable orthorhombic and tetragonal lattices. This approach, termed repetitively applied field, allows the system to relax between each pulse, gradually transforming the initial cubic lattice into various intermediate metastable states until a stable non-cubic crystal is achieved. We show that this technique is suitable for engineering non-cubic lattices with tailored photonic bandgaps, associated dispersion and band structure across the entire visible spectrum in blue-phase liquid crystals with distinct composition and initial crystal orientation. These field-free blue-phase liquid crystals exhibit large electro-optic responses and can be polymer-stabilized to have a wide operating temperature range and submillisecond response speed, which are promising properties for information display, electro-optics, nonlinear optics, microlasers and biosensing applications. Repetitive electrical pulse stimulation of blue-phase liquid crystals promotes their reconfiguration into stable non-cubic structures with promising electro-optical responses for display technologies.},

Here we report a hetero-atomic MFI-type zeolite (NbAlS-1), over which aqueous solutions of γ-valerolactone (GVL), obtained from biomass-derived carbohydrates, can be quantitatively converted into butenes with a yield of &amp;gt;99% at ambient pressure under continuous flow conditions. NbAlS-1 incorporates simultaneously niobium(v) and aluminium(iii) centres into the framework and thus has a desirable distribution of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites with optimal strength. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy show that there is cooperativity between Nb(v) and the Brønsted acid sites on the confined adsorption of GVL, whereas the catalytic mechanism for the conversion of the confined GVL into butenes is revealed by in situ inelastic neutron scattering, coupled with modelling. This study offers a prospect for the sustainable production of butene as a platform chemical for the manufacture of renewable materials. Production of olefins from biomass-derived γ-valerolactone could lead to sustainable chemical processes, but catalysts suffer from deactivation due to water. Here, a MFI-type zeolite doped with Nb(v) and Al(iii) shows &amp;gt;99% yield at 320 °C and catalyst stability over 180 hours.},

  abstract     = {The reduction of Pt content in the cathode for proton exchange membrane fuel cells is highly desirable to lower their costs. However, lowering the Pt loading of the cathodic electrode leads to high voltage losses. These voltage losses are known to originate from the mass transport resistance of O2 through the platinum–ionomer interface, the location of the Pt particle with respect to the carbon support and the supports’ structures. In this study, we present a new Pt catalyst/support design that substantially reduces local oxygen-related mass transport resistance. The use of chemically modified carbon supports with tailored porosity enabled controlled deposition of Pt nanoparticles on the outer and inner surface of the support particles. This resulted in an unprecedented uniform coverage of the ionomer over the high surface-area carbon supports, especially under dry operating conditions. Consequently, the present catalyst design exhibits previously unachieved fuel cell power densities in addition to high stability under voltage cycling. Thanks to the Coulombic interaction between the ionomer and N groups on the carbon support, homogeneous ionomer distribution and reproducibility during ink manufacturing process is ensured. Reducing Pt content in cathodes for proton exchange membrane fuel cells is crucial to lower costs but results in high voltage losses. A Pt catalyst/support design that substantially reduces local oxygen-related mass transport resistance is reported.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor structures (for example, films, wires, particles) used in photoelectrochemical devices are often decorated with nanoparticles that catalyse fuel-forming reactions, including water oxidation, hydrogen evolution or carbon-dioxide reduction. For high performance, the catalyst nanoparticles must form charge-carrier-selective contacts with the underlying light-absorbing semiconductor, facilitating either hole or electron transfer while inhibiting collection of the opposite carrier. Despite the key role played by such selective contacts in photoelectrochemical energy conversion and storage, the underlying nanoscale interfaces are poorly understood because direct measurement of their properties is challenging, especially under operating conditions. Using an n-Si/Ni photoanode model system and potential-sensing atomic force microscopy, we measure interfacial electron-transfer processes and map the photovoltage generated during photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution at nanoscopic semiconductor/catalyst interfaces. We discover interfaces where the selectivity of low-Schottky-barrier n-Si/Ni contacts for holes is enhanced via a nanoscale size-dependent pinch-off effect produced when surrounding high-barrier regions develop during device operation. These results thus demonstrate (1) the ability to make nanoscale operando measurements of contact properties under practical photoelectrochemical conditions and (2) a design principle to control the flow of electrons and holes across semiconductor/catalyst junctions that is broadly relevant to different photoelectrochemical devices. Although nanocatalysts forming selective contacts are crucial in photoelectrochemistry, the underlying nanoscale interfaces are poorly understood. Using a n-Si/Ni photoanode and potential-sensing AFM, interfacial electron-transfer processes and photovoltage are measured.},

Coulomb repulsion between the intercalants leads to ordering of the intercalant sublattice, which hinders ionic diffusion and impacts battery performance. While conventional diffraction can identify the long-range order that can occur at discrete intercalant concentrations during the charging cycle, it cannot determine short-range order at other concentrations that also disrupt ionic mobility. In this Article, we show that the use of real-space transforms of single-crystal diffuse scattering, measured with high-energy synchrotron X-rays, allows a model-independent measurement of the temperature dependence of the length scale of ionic correlations along each of the crystallographic axes in sodium-intercalated V2O5. The techniques described here provide a new way of probing the evolution of structural ordering in crystalline materials. Conventional diffraction cannot determine short-range order at concentrations that disrupt ionic mobility. Real-space transforms of single-crystal diffuse scattering now allow us to measure ionic correlation length scales in sodium-intercalated V2O5.},

Understanding and controlling energy flow, however, requires observing it on ultrasmall and ultrafast spatio-temporal scales, where energetic and structural roadblocks dictate the fate of energy carriers. Here, we developed a non-invasive optical scheme that leverages non-resonant interferometric scattering to track tiny changes in material polarizability created by energy carriers. We thus map evolving energy carrier distributions in four dimensions of spacetime with few-nanometre lateral precision and directly correlate them with material morphology. We visualize exciton, charge and heat transport in polyacene, silicon and perovskite semiconductors and elucidate how disorder affects energy flow in three dimensions. For example, we show that morphological boundaries in polycrystalline metal halide perovskites possess lateral- and depth-dependent resistivities, blocking lateral transport for surface but not bulk carriers. We also reveal strategies for interpreting energy transport in disordered environments that will direct the design of defect-tolerant materials for the semiconductor industry of tomorrow. A stroboscopic scattering microscopy approach is developed to image the evolution of carrier distributions in three dimensions and with sub-nanosecond resolution while the carriers propagate in organic and inorganic films.},

Here we use X-ray scattering and correlative electron imaging and diffraction of individual SL grains to determine the formation mechanism of three-dimensional PbSe QD epi-SL films. We show that the epi-SL forms from a rhombohedrally distorted body centred cubic parent SL via a phase transition in which the QDs translate with minimal rotation (~10°) and epitaxially fuse across their {100} facets in three dimensions. This collective epitaxial transformation is atomically topotactic across the 103–105 QDs in each SL grain. Infilling the epi-SLs with alumina by atomic layer deposition greatly changes their electrical properties without affecting the superlattice structure. Our work establishes the formation mechanism of three-dimensional QD epi-SLs and illustrates the critical importance of surface chemistry to charge transport in these materials. A structural investigation on the formation of 3D superlattices of colloidal PbSe quantum dots reveals a topotactic transition from the self-assembled phase of ligand-capped quantum dots to the epitaxially fused phase typical of conductive solids.},

  abstract     = {The family of layered thio- and seleno-phosphates has gained attention as potential control dielectrics for the rapidly growing family of two-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional electronic materials. Here we report a combination of density functional theory calculations, quantum molecular dynamics simulations and variable-temperature, -pressure and -bias piezoresponse force microscopy data to predict and verify the existence of an unusual ferroelectric property—a uniaxial quadruple potential well for Cu displacements—enabled by the van der Waals gap in copper indium thiophosphate (CuInP2S6). The calculated potential energy landscape for Cu displacements is strongly influenced by strain, accounting for the origin of the negative piezoelectric coefficient and rendering CuInP2S6 a rare example of a uniaxial multi-well ferroelectric. Experimental data verify the coexistence of four polarization states and explore the temperature-, pressure- and bias-dependent piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, which are supported by bias-dependent molecular dynamics simulations. These phenomena offer new opportunities for both fundamental studies and applications in data storage and electronics. The atomic displacements that generate ferroelectricity in materials commonly fit a double-well potential energy surface. Here, ferroelectricity in two-dimensional CuInP2S6 is shown to fit a quadruple well due to the van der Waals gap between layers of this material.},

  abstract     = {Room-temperature skyrmions in ferromagnetic films and multilayers show promise for encoding information bits in new computing technologies. Despite recent progress, ferromagnetic order generates dipolar fields that prevent ultrasmall skyrmion sizes, and allows a transverse deflection of moving skyrmions that hinders their efficient manipulation. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions shall lift these limitations. Here we demonstrate that room-temperature antiferromagnetic skyrmions can be stabilized in synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), in which perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, antiferromagnetic coupling and chiral order can be adjusted concurrently. Utilizing interlayer electronic coupling to an adjacent bias layer, we demonstrate that spin-spiral states obtained in a SAF with vanishing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be turned into isolated antiferromagnetic skyrmions. We also provide model-based estimates of skyrmion size and stability, showing that room-temperature antiferromagnetic skyrmions below 10 nm in radius can be anticipated in further optimized SAFs. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions in SAFs may thus solve major issues associated with ferromagnetic skyrmions for low-power spintronic devices. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions—which have distinct advantages over skyrmions found in other magnetic systems—are observed at room temperature in synthetic antiferromagnets. These results hold promise for low-power spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {One or a few layers of van der Waals (vdW) materials are promising for applications in nanoscale electronics. Established properties include high mobility in graphene, a large direct gap in monolayer MoS2, the quantum spin Hall effect in monolayer WTe2 and so on. These exciting properties arise from electron quantum confinement in the two-dimensional limit. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal directional massless Dirac fermions due to one-dimensional confinement of carriers in the layered vdW material NbSi0.45Te2. The one-dimensional directional massless Dirac fermions are protected by non-symmorphic symmetry, and emerge from a stripe-like structural modulation with long-range translational symmetry only along the stripe direction as we show using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Our work not only provides a playground for investigating further the properties of directional massless Dirac fermions, but also introduces a unique component with one-dimensional long-range order for engineering nano-electronic devices based on heterostructures of vdW materials. A one-dimensional Dirac-like band is observed in a layer van der Waals material, expanding the arsenal of 2D systems.},

  abstract     = {Materials that efficiently transport and couple ionic and electronic charge are key to advancing a host of technological developments for next-generation bioelectronic, optoelectronic and energy storage devices. Here we highlight key progress in the design and study of organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs), a diverse family of soft synthetically tunable mixed conductors. Across applications, the same interrelated fundamental physical processes dictate OMIEC properties and determine device performance. Owing to ionic and electronic interactions and coupled transport properties, OMIECs demand special understanding beyond knowledge derived from the study of organic thin films and membranes meant to support either electronic or ionic processes only. We address seemingly conflicting views and terminology regarding charging processes in these materials, and highlight recent approaches that extend fundamental understanding and contribute to the advancement of materials. Further progress is predicated on multimodal and multi-scale approaches to overcome lingering barriers to OMIEC design and implementation. From optoelectronic to biomedical and energy storage applications, the interest in organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors is expanding. This Review describes current understanding of the processes occurring in these materials and their structure–property relations.},
