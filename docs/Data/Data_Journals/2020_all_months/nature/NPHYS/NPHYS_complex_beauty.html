  abstract     = {Most physical and other natural systems are complex entities that are composed of a large number of interacting individual elements. It is a surprising fact that they often obey the so-called scaling laws that relate an observable quantity to a measure of the size of the system. Here, we describe the discovery of universal superlinear metabolic scaling laws in human cancers. This dependence underpins increasing tumour aggressiveness, owing to evolutionary dynamics, that leads to an explosive growth as the disease progresses. We validated this dynamic using longitudinal volumetric data of different histologies from large cohorts of patients with cancer. To explain our observations we tested complex, biologically inspired mathematical models that describe the key processes that govern tumour growth. Our models predict that the emergence of superlinear allometric scaling laws is an inherently three-dimensional phenomenon. Moreover, the scaling laws that we identified allowed us to define a set of metabolic metrics with prognostic value, which adds clinical utility to our findings. The authors investigate the relationship between the volume of malignant tumours and their metabolic processes using a large dataset of patients with cancer. They find that cancers follow a superlinear metabolic scaling law, which implies that the proliferation of cancer cells accelerates with increasing volume.},

Here, we place a magnetic impurity on the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope (YSR-STM) and use it to demonstrate sequential tunnelling of electrons between parity-protected YSR states on the tip and in the sample. Using this Shiba–Shiba tunnelling technique we probe the YSR lifetime, which we can enhance by reducing the relaxation of the excited YSR state to the intrinsic channel. Our work offers a way to characterize and manipulate coupled superconducting bound states, such as Andreev levels, YSR states or Majorana bound states at the atomic limit. A magnetic impurity is placed on the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope, allowing direct tunnelling between two Yu–Shiba–Rusinov bound states.

Photon-assisted tunnelling combined with the venerable Tien–Gordon model has long been a powerful tool to identify tunnelling processes between superconductors. Here, we probe superconducting tunnel junctions including an impurity-induced Yu–Shiba–Rusinov (YSR) state by exposing a scanning tunnelling microscope with a superconducting tip to microwave radiation. We find that a simple Tien–Gordon description describes tunnelling of single electrons and Cooper pairs into the bare substrate, but breaks down for tunnelling via YSR states by resonant Andreev reflections. We develop an improved theoretical description that is in excellent agreement with the data. Our results establish photon-assisted tunnelling as a powerful tool to analyse tunnelling processes at the atomic scale, which should be particularly informative for unconventional and topological superconductors. Scanning tunnelling microscopy is enhanced by microwave radiation that allows photon-assisted tunnelling processes. This technique is demonstrated on impurity states in a superconductor.},

In real materials SU(N) symmetry is an idealization, but this symmetry is pristinely realized in fully controllable ultracold alkaline-earth atomic gases. Here, we study an SU(N)-symmetric Fermi liquid of 87Sr atoms, where N can be tuned to be as large as 10. In the deeply degenerate regime, we show through precise measurements of density fluctuations and expansion dynamics that the large N of spin states under SU(N) symmetry leads to pronounced interaction effects in a system with a nominally negligible interaction parameter. Accounting for these effects, we demonstrate thermometry accurate to 1\% of the Fermi energy. We also demonstrate record speed for preparing degenerate Fermi seas enabled by the SU(N)-symmetric interactions, reaching T/TF = 0.22 with 10 nuclear spin states in 0.6 s working with a laser-cooled sample. This, along with the introduction of a new spin polarizing method, enables the operation of a three-dimensional optical lattice clock in the band insulating regime. Ultracold alkaline-earth fermionic atoms with large number of nuclear spin states possess SU(N) symmetry. That deeply affects their interaction properties, and allows a Fermi gas of these atoms to be cooled quickly to the quantum degenerate regime.},

  abstract     = {Physical systems powering motion and creating structure in a fixed amount of time dissipate energy and produce entropy. Whether living, synthetic or engineered, systems performing these dynamic functions must balance dissipation and speed. Here, we show that rates of energy and entropy exchange are subject to a speed limit—a time–information uncertainty relation—imposed by the rates of change in the information content of the system. This uncertainty relation bounds the time that elapses before the change in a thermodynamic quantity has the same magnitude as its s.d. From this general bound, we establish a family of speed limits for heat, dissipated/chemical work and entropy depending on the experimental constraints on the system and its environment. In all of these inequalities, the timescale of transient dynamical fluctuations is universally bounded by the Fisher information. Moreover, they all have a mathematical form that mirrors the Mandelstam–Tamm version of the time–energy uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics. These bounds on the speed of arbitrary observables apply to transient systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium, independent of the physical constraints on the stochastic dynamics or their function. A time–information uncertainty relation in thermodynamics has been derived, analogous to the time–energy uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics, imposing limits on the speed of energy and entropy exchange between a system and external reservoirs.},

  abstract     = {Quantum measurement remains a puzzle through its stormy history from the birth of quantum mechanics to state-of-the-art quantum technologies. Two complementary measurement schemes have been widely investigated in a variety of quantum systems: von Neumann’s projective ‘strong’ measurement and Aharonov’s weak measurement. Here, we report the observation of a weak-to-strong measurement transition in a single trapped 40Ca+ ion system. The transition is realized by tuning the interaction strength between the ion’s internal electronic state and its vibrational motion, which play the roles of the measured system and the measuring pointer, respectively. By pre- and post-selecting the internal state, a pointer state composed of two of the ion’s motional wavepackets is obtained, and its central-position shift, which corresponds to the measurement outcome, demonstrates the transition from the weak-value asymptotes to the expectation-value asymptotes. Quantitatively, the weak-to-strong measurement transition is characterized by a universal transition factor $${e}^{-{\varGamma }^{2}/2}$$ , where Γ is a dimensionless parameter related to the system–apparatus coupling. This transition, which continuously connects weak measurements and strong measurements, may open new experimental possibilities to test quantum foundations and prompt us to re-examine and improve the measurement schemes of related quantum technologies. A weak-to-strong quantum measurement transition has been observed in a single-trapped-ion system, where the ion’s internal electronic state and its vibrational motion play the roles of the measured system and the measuring pointer.},

  abstract     = {Does quantum theory apply at all scales, including that of observers? New light on this fundamental question has recently been shed through a resurgence of interest in the long-standing Wigner’s friend paradox. This is a thought experiment addressing the quantum measurement problem—the difficulty of reconciling the (unitary, deterministic) evolution of isolated systems and the (non-unitary, probabilistic) state update after a measurement. Here, by building on a scenario with two separated but entangled friends introduced by Brukner, we prove that if quantum evolution is controllable on the scale of an observer, then one of ‘No-Superdeterminism’, ‘Locality’ or ‘Absoluteness of Observed Events’—that every observed event exists absolutely, not relatively—must be false. We show that although the violation of Bell-type inequalities in such scenarios is not in general sufficient to demonstrate the contradiction between those three assumptions, new inequalities can be derived, in a theory-independent manner, that are violated by quantum correlations. This is demonstrated in a proof-of-principle experiment where a photon’s path is deemed an observer. We discuss how this new theorem places strictly stronger constraints on physical reality than Bell’s theorem. For a scenario of two separated but entangled observers, inequalities are derived from three fundamental assumptions. An experiment shows that these inequalities can be violated if quantum evolution is controllable on the scale of an observer.},

  abstract     = {Nd2Ir2O7 is a correlated semimetal with the pyrochlore structure, in which competing spin–orbit coupling and electron–electron interactions are believed to induce a time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal phase characterized by pairs of topologically protected Dirac points at the Fermi energy1–4. However, the emergent properties in these materials are far from clear, and exotic new states of matter have been conjectured5–7. Here, we demonstrate optically that, at low temperatures, the free carrier spectral weight is proportional to T2, where T is the temperature, as expected for massless Dirac electrons. However, we do not observe the corresponding T3 term in the specific heat. That the system is not in a Fermi liquid state is further corroborated by the charge carrier scattering rate approaching critical damping and the progressive opening of a correlation-induced gap at low temperatures. These observations cannot be reconciled within the framework of band theory of electron-like quasiparticles and point towards the effective decoupling of the charge transport from the single particle sector. Transport and optical conductivity measurements reveal the non-Fermi liquid behaviour in correlated semimetal Nd2Ir2O7. The result implies the emergent collective charge transport in this compound, not reconcilable with conventional band theory.},

  abstract     = {In most unconventional and high-temperature superconductors, superconductivity emerges as a nearby symmetry-breaking phase is suppressed by chemical doping or pressure1–7. This has led to the belief that the fluctuations associated with the symmetry-breaking phase are beneficial, if not responsible, for the superconducting pairing8,9. A direct test to verify this hypothesis is to observe a decrease of the superconducting critical temperature (Tc) by applying the symmetry-breaking conjugate field that suppresses the dynamic fluctuations of the competing order. However, most of the competing phases in unconventional superconductors break translational symmetry, requiring a spatially modulated conjugate field that is difficult to realize experimentally. Here, we show that anisotropic strain, the conjugate field of nematicity, reduces the Tc of an iron pnictide. For optimally doped samples we show a fivefold reduction of Tc with less than one per cent of strain. For underdoped samples, Tc becomes zero yielding a fully metallic ground state. In addition to providing direct evidence of the role played by the nematic fluctuations in the formation of the superconducting state, these results demonstrate tunable mechanical control of a high-temperature superconductor, an important step forward for technological applications of superconductivity. Using doped BaFe2As2, the authors test whether nematicity is linked to superconductivity in the iron pnictides by applying the conjugate field to nematicity—a specific form of strain—and observe that the critical temperature decreases.},

  abstract     = {Noise is the central obstacle to building large-scale quantum computers. Quantum systems with sufficiently uncorrelated and weak noise could be used to solve computational problems that are intractable with current digital computers. There has been substantial progress towards engineering such systems1–8. However, continued progress depends on the ability to characterize quantum noise reliably and efficiently with high precision9. Here, we describe such a protocol and report its experimental implementation on a 14-qubit superconducting quantum architecture. The method returns an estimate of the effective noise and can detect correlations within arbitrary sets of qubits. We show how to construct a quantum noise correlation matrix allowing the easy visualization of correlations between all pairs of qubits, enabling the discovery of long-range two-qubit correlations in the 14-qubit device that had not previously been detected. Our results are the first implementation of a provably rigorous and comprehensive diagnostic protocol capable of being run on state-of-the-art devices and beyond. These results pave the way for noise metrology in next-generation quantum devices, calibration in the presence of crosstalk, bespoke quantum error-correcting codes10 and customized fault-tolerance protocols11 that can greatly reduce the overhead in a quantum computation. A protocol for the reliable, efficient and precise characterization of quantum noise is reported and implemented in an architecture consisting of 14 superconducting qubits. Correlated noise within arbitrary sets of qubits can be easily detected.},

  abstract     = {The second law of thermodynamics points to the existence of an ‘arrow of time’, along which entropy only increases. This arises despite the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) of the microscopic laws of nature. Within quantum theory, TRS underpins many interesting phenomena, most notably topological insulators1–4 and the Haldane phase of quantum magnets5,6. Here, we demonstrate that such TRS-protected effects are fundamentally unstable against coupling to an environment. Irrespective of the microscopic symmetries, interactions between a quantum system and its surroundings facilitate processes that would be forbidden by TRS in an isolated system. This leads not only to entanglement entropy production and the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility7–9, but also to the demise of TRS-protected phenomena, including those associated with certain symmetry-protected topological phases. Our results highlight the enigmatic nature of TRS in quantum mechanics and elucidate potential challenges in utilizing topological systems for quantum technologies. When a quantum system couples with its surroundings, macroscopic irreversibility emerges even though the microscopic Hamiltonian is itself time-reversal symmetric, causing the phenomena associated with certain symmetry-protected topological phases to be unstable.},

  abstract     = {Because the cuprate superconductors are doped Mott insulators, it would be advantageous to solve even a toy model that exhibits both Mottness and superconductivity. We consider the Hatsugai–Kohmoto model1,2, an exactly solvable system that is a prototypical Mott insulator. Upon either doping or reducing the interaction strength, our exact calculations show that the system becomes a non-Fermi liquid metal with a superconducting instability. In the presence of a weak pairing interaction, the instability produces a thermal transition to a superconducting phase, which is distinct from the traditional state described by Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory, as evidenced by a gap-to-transition temperature ratio exceeding the universal BCS limit. The elementary excitations of this superconductor are not Bogoliubov quasiparticles but rather superpositions of doublons and holons, composite excitations that show that the superconducting ground state of the doped Mott insulator inherits the non-Fermi liquid character of the normal state. An unexpected feature of this model is that it exhibits a superconductivity-induced transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies, as seen in the cuprates3, as well as a suppression of the superfluid density relative to that in BCS theory. The Mott insulator ground state is a crucial feature of high-temperature superconductors such as the cuprates. Here, the authors find an exactly solvable model that contains both superconductivity and Mottness.},

  abstract     = {The respiratory tract is protected by mucus, a complex fluid transported along the epithelial surface by the coordinated beating of millions of microscopic cilia, hence the name of mucociliary clearance. Its impairment is associated with all severe chronic respiratory diseases. Yet, the relationship between ciliary density and the spatial scale of mucus transport, as well as the mechanisms that drive ciliary-beat orientations are much debated. Here, we show on polarized human bronchial epithelia that mucus swirls and circular orientational order of the underlying ciliary beats emerge and grow during ciliogenesis, until a macroscopic mucus transport is achieved for physiological ciliary densities. By establishing that the macroscopic ciliary-beat order is lost and recovered by removing and adding mucus, respectively, we demonstrate that cilia–mucus hydrodynamic interactions govern the collective dynamics of ciliary-beat directions. We propose a two-dimensional model that predicts a phase diagram of mucus transport in accordance with the experiments. This paves the way to a predictive in silico modelling of bronchial mucus transport in health and disease. The flow of fluid, such as mucus in the human respiratory tract, can affect biological function. Here the authors show that the hydrodynamic interactions mediated by mucus are essential for the directional coordination of ciliary beating in the lungs.},

Here, we reveal a simple mechanism by which different populations of motile cells can self-organize through a reciprocal control of their motilities. We first show how the reciprocal activation of motility between two populations of engineered Escherichia coli makes an initially mixed population of cells segregate, leading to out-of-phase population oscillations without the need of any preexisting positional or orientational cues. By redesigning the interaction, the original segregation between the two populations can be turned into co-localization. We account for this self-organization using a theoretical model that shows the reciprocal control of motility to be a robust and versatile self-organization pathway in multi-component systems. We finally show how our theoretical and experimental results can be generalized to three interacting bacterial populations. The authors engineer Escherichia coli into two distinct strains with tunable motility. The induced control of motility leads to the formation of patterns through a self-organizing mechanism that is specific to multi-component active systems.},

  abstract     = {Eukaryotic cell processes depend on molecular motors to transport cargo along cytoskeletal filaments, and the response of these mechanoenzymes to external forces shapes their cellular function. These responses have been largely mapped out in dilute, in vitro media. The cytosol, however, is host to a high concentration of macromolecules, and this crowding can alter protein conformation, binding rates, reaction kinetics and therefore motor function. Here, we use live-cell and single-molecule imaging and optical tweezer force measurements to uncover the consequences of macromolecular crowding on cargo transport by kinesin-1 motors. Surprisingly, we find that crowding significantly slows transport by teams of motors, while having no effect on single-motor velocity. We find that this emergent property of kinesin teams results from the increased sensitivity of the individual motors to hindering load when in a crowded medium. We explain this increased sensitivity using a model where entropic forces due to crowding push the two kinesin heads together into a more compact configuration when the motor is poised to take a step. Our results highlight the importance of motor–motor interactions in cargo transport, explain the long-observed variability of cargo velocity and suggest the use of crowding as a control parameter to study kinesin’s mechanochemical cycle. The native environment of the cell is crowded by DNA, proteins and other biomolecules. Here, the authors show that crowding slows down groups of kinesin motors but has no effect on single motors.},

  abstract     = {Weyl semimetals in three-dimensional crystals provide the paradigm example of topologically protected band nodes. It is usually taken for granted that a pair of colliding Weyl points annihilate whenever they carry opposite chiral charge. In stark contrast, here we report that Weyl points in systems that are symmetric under the composition of time reversal with a π rotation are characterized by a non-Abelian topological invariant. The topological charges of the Weyl points are transformed via braid phase factors, which arise upon exchange inside symmetric planes of the reciprocal momentum space. We elucidate this process with an elementary two-dimensional tight-binding model that is implementable in cold-atom set-ups and in photonic systems. In three dimensions, interplay of the non-Abelian topology with point-group symmetry is shown to enable topological phase transitions in which pairs of Weyl points may scatter or convert into nodal-line rings. By combining our theoretical arguments with first-principles calculations, we predict that Weyl points occurring near the Fermi level of zirconium telluride carry non-trivial values of the non-Abelian charge, and that uniaxial compression strain drives a non-trivial conversion of the Weyl points into nodal lines. Weyl points in three-dimensional systems with certain symmetry carry non-Abelian topological charges, which can be transformed via non-trivial phase factors that arise upon braiding these points inside the reciprocal space.},

  abstract     = {In many chemical reactions, the transformation from reactants to products is mediated by transient intermediate complexes. For gas-phase reactions involving molecules with a few atoms, these complexes typically live on the order of 10 ps or less before dissociating, and are therefore rarely influenced by external processes. Here, we demonstrate that the transient intermediate complex K2Rb2*, formed from collisions between ultracold KRb molecules, undergoes rapid photo-excitation in the presence of a continuous-wave laser source at 1,064 nm, a wavelength commonly used to confine ultracold molecules. These excitations are facilitated by the exceptionally long lifetime of the complex under ultracold conditions. Indeed, by monitoring the change in the complex population after the sudden removal of the excitation light, we directly measure the lifetime of the complex to be 360 ± 30 ns, in agreement with our calculations based on the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) statistical theory. Our results shed light on the origin of the two-body loss widely observed in ultracold molecule experiments. Additionally, the long complex lifetime, coupled with the observed photo-excitation pathway, opens up the possibility to spectroscopically probe the structure of the complex with high resolution, thus elucidating the reaction dynamics. A transient intermediate complex in a chemical reaction—formed from collisions between molecules with a few atoms—is observed under ultracold conditions. Its lifetime can be directly measured after suppression of the photo-excitation process.},

  abstract     = {Quantum light–matter interactions of bound electron systems have been studied extensively. By contrast, quantum interactions of free electrons with light have only become accessible in recent years, following the discovery of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). So far, the fundamental free electron–light interaction in all PINEM experiments has remained weak due to its localized near-field nature, which imposes an energy–momentum mismatch between electrons and light. Here, we demonstrate a strong interaction between free-electron waves and light waves, resulting from precise energy–momentum phase-matching with the extended propagating light field. By exchanging hundreds of photons with the field, each electron simultaneously accelerates and decelerates in a coherent manner. Consequently, each electron’s quantum wavefunction evolves into a quantized energy comb, spanning a bandwidth of over 1,700 eV, requiring us to extend the PINEM theory. Our observation of coherent electron phase-matching with a propagating wave is a type of inverse-Cherenkov interaction that occurs with a quantum electron wavefunction, demonstrating how the extended nature of the electron wavefunction can alter stimulated electron–light interactions. Energy–momentum phase-matching enables strong interactions between free electrons and light waves. As a result, the wavefunction of the electron exhibits a comb structure, which was observed using photon-induced near-field electron microscopy.},

  abstract     = {The Casimir force was predicted in 1948 as a force arising between macroscopic bodies from the zero-point energy. At finite temperatures, it has been shown that a thermal Casimir force exists due to thermal rather than zero-point energy and there are a growing number of experiments that characterize the effect at a range of temperatures and distances. In addition, in the rapidly evolving field of cavity optomechanics, there is an endeavour to manipulate phonons and enhance coherence. We demonstrate a way to realize a Casimir spring and engineer dilution in macroscopic optomechanics, by coupling a metallic SiN membrane to a photonic re-entrant cavity. The attraction of the spatially localized Casimir spring mimics a non-contacting boundary condition, giving rise to increased strain and acoustic coherence through dissipation dilution. This provides a way to manipulate phonons via thermal photons leading to ‘in situ’ reconfigurable mechanical states, to reduce loss mechanisms and to create additional types of acoustic nonlinearity—all at room temperature. An optomechanical cavity comprising a re-entrant cavity and membrane resonators can be tuned in and out of the Casimir regime. At the transition between the two regimes, the mechanical resonators exhibit a change in stiffness—the Casimir spring.},

  abstract     = {The transfer of quantum information through a noisy environment is a central challenge in the fields of quantum communication, imaging and nanophotonics. In particular, high-dimensional quantum states of light enable quantum networks with significantly higher information capacities and noise robustness as compared with qubits. However, although qubit entanglement has been distributed over large distances through free space and fibre, the transport of high-dimensional entanglement is hindered by the complexity of the channel, which encompasses effects such as free-space turbulence or mode mixing in multimode waveguides. Here, we demonstrate the transport of six-dimensional spatial-mode entanglement through a 2-m-long, commercial multimode fibre with 84.4\% fidelity. We show how the entanglement can itself be used to measure the transmission matrix of the complex medium, allowing the recovery of quantum correlations that were initially lost. Using a unique property of entangled states, the medium is rendered transparent to entanglement by carefully ‘scrambling’ the photon that did not enter it, rather than unscrambling the photon that did. Our work overcomes a primary challenge in the fields of quantum communication and imaging, and opens a new pathway towards the control of complex scattering processes in the quantum regime. Higher-dimensional entanglement between two photons can be preserved for a photon passing through a complex medium by applying an appropriate scrambling operation on the entangled partner that does not enter the complex medium.},

  abstract     = {The nature of the pseudogap phase of cuprates remains a major puzzle1,2. One of its signatures is a large negative thermal Hall conductivity3, whose origin is as yet unknown. This is observed even in the undoped Mott insulator La2CuO4, in which the charge carriers are localized and therefore cannot be responsible. Here, we show that the thermal Hall conductivity of La2CuO4 is roughly isotropic; that is, for heat transport parallel and normal to the CuO2 planes, it is nearly the same. This shows that the Hall response must come from phonons, as they are the only heat carriers that are able to move with the same ease both normal and parallel to the planes4. For doping levels higher than the critical doping level at which the pseudogap phase ends, both La1.6−xNd0.4SrxCuO4 and La1.8−xEu0.2SrxCuO4 show no thermal Hall signal for a heat current normal to the planes, which establishes that phonons have zero Hall response outside the pseudogap phase. Inside the pseudogap phase, the phonons must become chiral to generate the Hall response, but the mechanism by which this happens remains to be identified. It must be intrinsic (from a coupling of phonons to their electronic environment) rather than extrinsic (from structural defects or impurities), as these are the same on both sides of critical doping. Thermal transport measurements show that there is a thermal Hall effect in the out-of-plane direction in two cuprates in the pseudogap regime. This indicates that phonons are carrying the heat and that they have a handedness of unknown origin.},

  abstract     = {Readout and control of electrostatically confined electrons in semiconductors are key primitives of quantum information processing with solid-state spin qubits1,2. In superconductor–semiconductor heterostructures, localized electronic modes known as Andreev levels result from confinement that is provided by the pair potential3,4. Unlike electronic modes confined exclusively via electrostatic effects, Andreev levels carry supercurrent. Therefore, they naturally integrate with the techniques of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) that have been developed in the field of superconducting qubits and used to detect pairs of quasiparticles that are trapped in Andreev levels5–8. Here, we demonstrate single-shot cQED readout of the spin of an individual quasiparticle trapped in the Andreev levels of a semiconductor nanowire Josephson element. Owing to a spin-orbit interaction in the nanowire, this ‘superconducting spin’ directly determines the flow of supercurrent through the element. We harnessed this spin-dependent supercurrent to achieve both a zero-field spin splitting and a long-range interaction between the quasiparticle and a superconducting microwave resonator9–13. Measurement of the resultant spin-dependent resonator frequency yielded quantum non-demolition spin readout with 92\% fidelity in 1.9 μs, which enabled us to monitor the quasiparticle spin in real time. These results pave the way for superconducting spin qubits that operate at zero magnetic field and for time-domain measurements of Majorana zero modes9,10,12,14,15. A quasiparticle in Andreev levels was coupled to a superconducting microwave resonator and its spin was monitored in real time. This has potential applications in the readout of superconducting spin qubits and measurements of Majorana fermions.},

  abstract     = {Twisting or sliding two-dimensional crystals with respect to each other gives rise to moiré patterns determined by the difference in their periodicities. Such lattice mismatches can exist for several reasons: differences between the intrinsic lattice constants of the two layers, as is the case for graphene on BN1; rotations between the two lattices, as is the case for twisted bilayer graphene2; and strains between two identical layers in a bilayer3. Moiré patterns are responsible for a number of new electronic phenomena observed in recent years in van der Waals heterostructures, including the observation of superlattice Dirac points for graphene on BN1, collective electronic phases in twisted bilayers and twisted double bilayers4–8, and trapping of excitons in the moiré potential9–12. An open question is whether we can use moiré potentials to achieve strong trapping potentials for electrons. Here, we report a technique to achieve deep, deterministic trapping potentials via strain-based moiré engineering in van der Waals materials. We use strain engineering to create on-demand soliton networks in transition metal dichalcogenides. Intersecting solitons form a honeycomb-like network resulting from the three-fold symmetry of the adhesion potential between layers. The vertices of this network occur in bound pairs with different interlayer stacking arrangements. One vertex of the pair is found to be an efficient trap for electrons, displaying two states that are deeply confined within the semiconductor gap and have a spatial extent of 2 nm. Soliton networks thus provide a path to engineer deeply confined states with a strain-dependent tunable spatial separation, without the necessity of introducing chemical defects into the host materials. By sliding one layer with respect to the other in a van der Waals heterostructure, Edelberg et al. create a honeycomb network of solitons. Vertices of the network trap electrons, allowing strain-tunable control of confined states.},

When two-dimensional materials are stacked, the resulting moiré pattern introduces an additional periodicity so that the twist angle between the layers becomes an extra degree of freedom for the resulting heterostructure. As this angle changes, the electronic band structure is modified leading to the possibility of flat bands with localized states and enhanced electronic correlations1–6. In transition metal dichalcogenides, flat bands have been theoretically predicted to occur for long moiré wavelengths over a range of twist angles around 0° and 60° (ref. 4) giving much wider versatility than magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we show the existence of a flat band in the electronic structure of 3° and 57.5° twisted bilayer WSe2 samples using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Our direct spatial mapping of wavefunctions at the flat-band energy show that the localization of the flat bands is different for 3° and 57.5°, in agreement with first-principles density functional theory calculations4. Using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, the flat bands in twisted bilayer WSe2 are shown near both 0° and 60° twist angles.},

Despite the extreme variation in size, their structures are strikingly similar. However, the mechanism responsible for this remarkable morphological convergence remains unknown. Using basic physical arguments and biomimetic experiments, we reveal an optimal design strategy that links their length, base diameter d0, Young’s modulus E and friction force per unit area μp0. This principle can be framed simply as $${d}_{0} \approx {(\mu {p}_{0}/E)}^{1/3}L$$ . Existing data from measurements on viruses, algae, marine invertebrates, terrestrial invertebrates, plants, terrestrial vertebrates, marine vertebrates—as well as man-made objects such as nails, needles and weapons—are consistent with our predictions. Our results highlight the evolutionary adaptation of mechanical traits to the constraints imposed by friction, elastic stability and cost. The structures of stingers of living organisms are surprisingly similar despite their vastly different lengths. Now, stingers are found to obey a unifying mechanistic principle that characterizes the stingers resistance to buckling.},

This concept, which is a key step towards the understanding that black holes may amplify quantum fluctuations, has not been verified experimentally owing to the challenging experimental requirement that the cylinder rotation rate must be larger than the incoming wave frequency. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that these conditions can be satisfied with acoustic waves. We show that low-frequency acoustic modes with orbital angular momentum are transmitted through an absorbing rotating disk and amplified by up to 30\% or more when the disk rotation rate satisfies the Zel’dovich condition. These experiments address an outstanding problem in fundamental physics and have implications for future research into the extraction of energy from rotating systems. Acoustic waves that carry orbital angular momentum are amplified as they pass through an absorbing disk when the rotation rate exceeds the frequency of the incident wave, thus providing an experimental demonstration of Zel’dovich amplification.},

Several experiments have suggested that this phase ends at a critical hole doping level p*, but the nature of the ground state for lower doping is still debated. Here, we use local nuclear magnetic resonance and bulk ultrasound measurements to show that, once competing effects from superconductivity are removed by high magnetic fields, the spin-glass phase of La2−xSrxCuO4 survives up to a doping level consistent with p*. In this material, the antiferromagnetic-glass phase extends from the doped Mott insulator at p = 0.02 up to p* ≈ 0.19, which provides a connection between the pseudogap and the physics of the Mott insulator. Furthermore, the coincidence of the pseudogap boundary with a magnetic quantum phase transition in the non-superconducting ground state has implications for the interpretation of other experiments, particularly for transport and specific-heat measurements in high magnetic fields. NMR and ultrasound measurements show that the spin-glass phase exists in a cuprate all the way up to the doping that marks the end of the pseudogap phase. This highlights the possible connection between the pseudogap and Mott physics.},

  abstract     = {Coherent control via periodic modulation, also known as Floquet engineering, has emerged as a powerful experimental method for the realization of novel quantum systems with exotic properties. In particular, it has been employed to study topological phenomena in a variety of different platforms. In driven systems, the topological properties of the quasienergy bands can often be determined by standard topological invariants, such as Chern numbers, which are commonly used in static systems. However, due to the periodic nature of the quasienergy spectrum, this topological description is incomplete and new invariants are required to fully capture the topological properties of these driven settings. Most prominently, there are two-dimensional anomalous Floquet systems that exhibit robust chiral edge modes, despite all Chern numbers being equal to zero. Here we realize such a system with bosonic atoms in a periodically driven honeycomb lattice and infer the complete set of topological invariants from energy gap measurements and local Hall deflections. Standard topological invariants commonly used in static systems are not enough to fully capture the topological properties of Floquet systems. In a periodically driven quantum gas, chiral edge modes emerge despite all Chern numbers being equal to zero.},

We present an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements of the state. This description, called a ‘classical shadow’, can be used to predict many different properties; order $${\mathrm{log}}\,(M)$$ measurements suffice to accurately predict M different functions of the state with high success probability. The number of measurements is independent of the system size and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians. The numerical results highlight the advantages of classical shadows relative to previously known methods. An efficient method has been proposed through which the properties of a complex, large-scale quantum system can be predicted without fully characterizing the quantum state.},

In this work, we implement a single-shot canonical phase measurement on a one-photon wave packet, which surpasses the current standard of heterodyne detection and is optimal for single-shot phase estimation. By applying quantum feedback to a Josephson parametric amplifier, our system adaptively changes its measurement basis during photon arrival and allows us to validate the detector’s performance by tracking the quantum state of the photon source. These results demonstrate that quantum feedback can both enhance the precision of a detector and enable it to measure new classes of physical observables. An adaptive heterodyne technique with a Josephson parametric amplifier detector allows a high-precision single-shot canonical phase measurement on a one-photon wave packet, complementing near-ideal measurements of photon number or field amplitude.},

Previous work in this direction has introduced computational problems that can be solved with certainty by quantum circuits of depth independent of the input size (so-called ‘shallow’ circuits) but cannot be solved with high probability by any shallow classical circuit. Here we show that such a separation in computational power persists even when the shallow quantum circuits are restricted to geometrically local gates in three dimensions and corrupted by noise. We also present a streamlined quantum algorithm that is shown to achieve a quantum advantage in a one-dimensional geometry. The latter may be amenable to experimental implementation with the current generation of quantum computers. Uncorrected noise prevents quantum computers from running deep algorithms and outperforming classical machines. A method is now reported that allows noisy shallow quantum algorithms to be used to solve classically hard problems.},

In strong fields, they are complemented by higher-order nonlinearities that enable high-harmonic generation, which is currently understood as the interplay of light-driven intraband charge dynamics and interband recombination4–6. Remarkably, the nonlinear response emerging from the subcycle injection dynamics of electrons into the conduction band, that is from ionization, has been almost completely overlooked in solids and only partially considered in the gas phase7–10. Here, we reveal this strong-field-induced nonlinearity in a-SiO2 as a typical wide-bandgap dielectric by means of time-resolved, low-order wave-mixing experiments, and show that, close to the material damage threshold, the so far unexplored injection current provides the leading contribution. The sensitivity of the harmonic emission to the subcycle ionization dynamics offers an original approach to characterize the evolution of laser-induced plasma formation in optical microprocessing. Strong-field-induced nonlinearities from the injection of electrons into the conduction band contribute to harmonic generation in amorphous quartz. Close to the damage threshold, they dominate over intraband and interband contributions.},

  abstract     = {In two-dimensional layered quantum materials, the stacking order of the layers determines both the crystalline symmetry and electronic properties such as the Berry curvature, topology and electron correlation1–4. Electrical stimuli can influence quasiparticle interactions and the free-energy landscape5,6, making it possible to dynamically modify the stacking order and reveal hidden structures that host different quantum properties. Here, we demonstrate electrically driven stacking transitions that can be applied to design non-volatile memory based on Berry curvature in few-layer WTe2. The interplay of out-of-plane electric fields and electrostatic doping controls in-plane interlayer sliding and creates multiple polar and centrosymmetric stacking orders. In situ nonlinear Hall transport reveals that such stacking rearrangements result in a layer-parity-selective Berry curvature memory in momentum space, where the sign reversal of the Berry curvature and its dipole only occurs in odd-layer crystals. Our findings open an avenue towards exploring coupling between topology, electron correlations and ferroelectricity in hidden stacking orders and demonstrate a new low-energy-cost, electrically controlled topological memory in the atomically thin limit. A memory device is proposed that uses a dynamical modification of the stacking order of few-layer WTe2 to encode information. The change in stacking modifies both the Berry curvature and the Hall transport, allowing two states to be distinguished.},

  abstract     = {Measurement of the ground-state spin polarization of quantum systems offers great potential for the discovery and characterization of correlated electronic states. However, spin polarization measurements have mainly involved optical1–3 and NMR4,5 techniques that perturb the delicate ground states and, for quantum Hall systems, have provided conflicting results1,4,6. Here we present spin-resolved pulsed tunnelling (SRPT) that precisely determines the phase diagram of the ground-state spin polarization as a function of magnetic field and Landau level (LL) filling factor (ν) with negligible perturbation to the system. Our phase diagram shows a variety of polarized, unpolarized and topological spin states in the lowest (N = 0) LL, which can largely be described by a weakly interacting composite fermion (CF) model7. However, the phase diagram shows unexpected behaviour in the N = 1 LL. We observe fully polarized ν = 5/2 and 8/3 states but a partially depolarized ν = 7/3 state. This behaviour deviates from the conventional theoretical picture7,8 of weakly interacting fractional quasiparticles, but instead suggests unusual electronic correlations and the possibility of new non-Abelian phases9–11. The results establish SRPT as a powerful technique for investigating correlated electron phenomena. The spin polarization of a quantum Hall system is determined by a spin-resolved tunnelling method. This technique shows a substantial regime where the weakly interacting composite fermion picture is not valid.},

  abstract     = {Quantum Hall systems are characterized by quantization of the Hall conductance—a bulk property rooted in the topological structure of the underlying quantum states1. In condensed matter devices, material imperfections hinder a direct connection to simple topological models2,3. Artificial systems, such as photonic platforms4 or cold atomic gases5, open novel possibilities by enabling specific probes of topology6–13 or flexible manipulation, for example using synthetic dimensions14–21. However, the relevance of topological properties requires the notion of a bulk, which was missing in previous works using synthetic dimensions of limited sizes. Here, we realize a quantum Hall system using ultracold dysprosium atoms in a two-dimensional geometry formed by one spatial dimension and one synthetic dimension encoded in the atomic spin J = 8. We demonstrate that the large number of magnetic sublevels leads to distinct bulk and edge behaviours. Furthermore, we measure the Hall drift and reconstruct the local Chern marker, an observable that has remained, so far, experimentally inaccessible22. In the centre of the synthetic dimension—a bulk of 11 states out of 17—the Chern marker reaches 98(5)\% of the quantized value expected for a topological system. Our findings pave the way towards the realization of topological many-body phases. The quantum Hall effect is realized in a two-dimensional quantum gas system consisting of one spatial dimension and one synthetic dimension encoded in the atomic spin. Measurements show distinct bulk properties rooted in the topological structure.},

  abstract     = {On the fundamental level, quantum fluctuations or entanglement lead to complex dynamical behaviour in many-body systems1 for which a description as emergent phenomena can be found within the framework of quantum field theory. A central quantity in these efforts, containing all information about the measurable physical properties, is the quantum effective action2. Though non-equilibrium quantum dynamics can be exactly formulated in terms of the quantum effective action, finding solutions is in general beyond the capabilities of classical computers3. Here, we present a strategy to determine the non-equilibrium quantum effective action4 using analogue quantum simulators, and demonstrate our method experimentally with a quasi-one-dimensional spinor Bose gas out of equilibrium5,6. Spatially resolved snapshots of the complex-valued transversal spin field7 allow us to infer the quantum effective action up to fourth order in an expansion in one-particle irreducible correlation functions at equal times. We uncover a strong suppression of the irreducible four vertex emerging at low momenta in the highly occupied regime far from equilibrium where perturbative descriptions fail8. Our work constitutes a new realm of large-scale analogue quantum computing9, where highly controlled synthetic quantum systems10 provide the means for solving theoretical problems in high-energy and condensed-matter physics with an experimental approach11–14. The quantum effective action describing non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system can be inferred from experiment using analogue quantum simulators. Here is an example of how it works for a quasi-one-dimensional spinor Bose gas out of equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {A remarkable property of quantum mechanics in two-dimensional space is its ability to support ‘anyons’, particles that are neither fermions nor bosons. Theory predicts that these exotic excitations can exist as bound states confined near topological defects, such as Majorana zero modes trapped in vortices in topological superconductors. Intriguingly, in the simplest cases the non-trivial phase that arises when such defects are ‘braided’ around one another is not intrinsically quantum mechanical; instead, it can be viewed as a manifestation of the geometric (Pancharatnam–Berry) phase in wave mechanics, which makes possible the simulation of such phenomena in classical systems. Here, we report the experimental measurement of the geometric phase owing to such a braiding process. These measurements are obtained with an interferometer constructed from highly tunable two-dimensional arrays of photonic waveguides. Our results introduce photonic lattices as a versatile platform for the experimental study of topological defects and their braiding, and complement ongoing efforts in the study of solid-state systems and cold atomic gases. The non-zero geometric phase acquired by the braiding of vortex modes in photonic waveguide lattices demonstrates their potential to serve as a platform for the study of both Abelian and non-Abelian braiding in bosonic systems.},

  abstract     = {Collective processes in plasmas often induce microinstabilities that play an important role in many space or laboratory plasma environments. Particularly notable is the Weibel-type current filamentation instability, which is believed to drive the creation of collisionless shocks in weakly magnetized astrophysical plasmas. Here, this instability class is studied through interactions of ultraintense and short laser pulses with solid foils, leading to localized generation of megaelectronvolt electrons. Proton radiographic measurements of both low- and high-resistivity targets show two distinct, superimposed electromagnetic field patterns arising from the interpenetration of the megaelectronvolt electrons and the background plasma. Particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical estimates suggest that the collisionless Weibel instability building up in the dilute expanding plasmas formed at the target surfaces causes the observed azimuthally symmetric electromagnetic filaments. For a sufficiently high resistivity of the target foil, an additional resistive instability is triggered in the bulk target, giving rise to radially elongated filaments.

In the interaction of ultraintense, short laser pulses with solid targets, the collisionless Weibel instability is observed. For a sufficiently high resistivity of the target, an additional resistive instability appears.},

  abstract     = {When flying snakes glide, they use aerial undulation. To determine if aerial undulation is a flight control strategy or a non-functional behavioural vestige of lateral undulation, we measured snake glides using high-speed motion capture and developed a new dynamical model of gliding. Reconstructions of the snake’s wing-body reveal that aerial undulation is composed of horizontal and vertical waves, whose phases differ by 90° and whose frequencies differ by a factor of two. Using these results, we developed a three-dimensional mathematical model of snake flight that incorporates aerodynamic and inertial effects. Although simulated glides without undulation attained some horizontal distance, they are biologically unrealistic because they failed due to roll and pitch instabilities. In contrast, the inclusion of undulation stabilized the rotational motion and markedly increased glide performance. This work demonstrates that aerial undulation in snakes serves a different function than known uses of undulation in other animals, and suggests a new template of control for dynamic flying robots. Observations of flying snakes inform the development of a dynamical model of gliding taking undulation into account. This work suggests that aerial undulation has a different function in snakes than in other animals.},

Although information theory provides tools to quantify the information produced by a system, traditional metrics do not account for the inefficient ways that humans process this information. Here, we develop an analytical framework to study the information generated by a system as perceived by a human observer. We demonstrate experimentally that this perceived information depends critically on a system’s network topology. Applying our framework to several real networks, we find that they communicate a large amount of information (having high entropy) and do so efficiently (maintaining low divergence from human expectations). Moreover, we show that such efficient communication arises in networks that are simultaneously heterogeneous, with high-degree hubs, and clustered, with tightly connected modules—the two defining features of hierarchical organization. Together, these results suggest that many communication networks are constrained by the pressures of information transmission, and that these pressures select for specific structural features. The arrangement of a sequence of stimuli affects how humans perceive information. Here, the authors show experimentally that humans perceive information in a way that depends on the network structure of stimuli.},

  abstract     = {Mucus clearance constitutes the primary defence of the respiratory system against viruses, bacteria and environmental insults. This transport across the entire airway emerges from the integrated activity of thousands of multiciliated cells, each containing hundreds of cilia, which together must coordinate their spatial arrangement, alignment and motility. The mechanisms of fluid transport have been studied extensively at the level of an individual cilium, collectively moving metachronal waves and, more generally, the hydrodynamics of active matter. However, the connection between local cilia architecture and the topology of the flows they generate remains largely unexplored. Here, we image the mouse airway from subcellular (nm) to organ (mm) scales, characterizing quantitatively its ciliary arrangement and the generated flows. Locally, we measure heterogeneity in both cilia organization and flow structure, but, across the trachea, fluid transport is coherent. To examine this result, a hydrodynamic model was developed for a systematic exploration of different tissue architectures. Surprisingly, we find that disorder enhances particle clearance, whether it originates from fluctuations, heterogeneity in multiciliated cell arrangement or ciliary misalignment. This resembles elements of ‘stochastic resonance’, in the sense that noise can improve the function of the system. Taken together, our results shed light on how the microstructure of an active carpet determines its emergent dynamics. Furthermore, this work is also directly applicable to human airway pathologies, which are the third leading cause of deaths worldwide. Fluid flow through airways—necessary to keep lungs healthy and free from particles—occurs thanks to moving cilia. Here the authors show that defects in the arrangement of these cilia can facilitate particle clearance through the lungs.},

Combining theory, genetic perturbations and in vivo imaging, we study the development and regeneration of the fluid-motion sensors in the zebrafish’s lateral line. We find that two interacting symmetry-breaking events—one mediated by biochemical signalling and the other by cellular mechanics—give rise to precise rotations of cell pairs, which produce a mirror-symmetric polarity pattern in the receptor organ. Symmetry breaking is essential for polarization of cells and generation of left–right body asymmetry.

  abstract     = {The mystery of the hidden-order phase in the correlated electron paramagnet URu2Si2 is still unsolved. To address this problem, one strategy is to search for clues in the subtle competition between this state and neighbouring magnetically ordered states. It is now well established that long-range antiferromagnetic order can be stabilized in this metal when it is under pressure and that a spin-density wave manifests when a magnetic field is applied along the easy magnetic axis c. However, the full boundaries of the hidden-order phase in the pressure–magnetic-field plane have not been determined so far. Here we present a systematic investigation of URu2Si2 under combined high pressures and intense magnetic fields. The boundaries of the hidden-order, antiferromagnetic and spin-density-wave phases are mapped out, indicating an intricate three-dimensional phase diagram. We show that the field-induced spin-density-wave and hidden-order phases disappear in favour of antiferromagnetism at high pressure. Interestingly, a large number of phase boundaries are controlled by the field and pressure dependences of a single parameter. This gives new constraints for theories that model the electronic correlations and ordered phases in URu2Si2. The nature of the hidden order in URu2Si2 is still unknown. Here detailed measurements of the phase diagram of this material produce constraints for theories that aim to describe that phase.},

  abstract     = {Strain engineering is widely used to manipulate the electronic and magnetic properties of complex materials. For example, the piezomagnetic effect provides an attractive route to control magnetism with strain. In this effect, the staggered spin structure of an antiferromagnet is decompensated by breaking the crystal field symmetry, which induces a ferrimagnetic polarization. Piezomagnetism is especially appealing because, unlike magnetostriction, it couples strain and magnetization at linear order, and allows for bi-directional control suitable for memory and spintronics applications. However, its use in functional devices has so far been hindered by the slow speed and large uniaxial strains required. Here we show that the essential features of piezomagnetism can be reproduced with optical phonons alone, which can be driven by light to large amplitudes without changing the volume and hence beyond the elastic limits of the material. We exploit nonlinear, three-phonon mixing to induce the desired crystal field distortions in the antiferromagnet CoF2. Through this effect, we generate a ferrimagnetic moment of 0.2 μB per unit cell, nearly three orders of magnitude larger than achieved with mechanical strain. This paper shows how lattice distortions induced by a laser pulse can create a ferrimagnetic moment in an antiferromagnet. This mechanism gives a magnetic response that is orders of magnitude larger than using mechanical strain.},

Strong Aharonov–Bohm interference of the edge mode is punctuated by discrete phase slips that indicate an anyonic phase θanyon = 2π/3. Our results are consistent with a recent theory that describes an interferometer operated in a regime in which device charging energy is small compared to the energy of formation of charged quasiparticles, which indicates that we have observed anyonic braiding. An interferometer device is used to detect the quantum-mechanical phase that is gained when two anyons are braided around each other.

The proximity of superconductivity to correlated insulators suggested a close relationship between these states, reminiscent of the cuprates where superconductivity arises by doping a Mott insulator. Here, we show that superconductivity can appear far away from the correlated insulating states. Although both superconductivity and correlated insulating behaviour are strongest near the flat-band condition, superconductivity survives to larger detuning of the angle. Our observations are consistent with a ‘competing phases’ picture in which insulators and superconductivity arise from different mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Astrophysical collisionless shocks are among the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. Generated by violent interactions of supersonic plasma flows with the interstellar medium, supernova remnant shocks are observed to amplify magnetic fields1 and accelerate electrons and protons to highly relativistic speeds2–4. In the well-established model of diffusive shock acceleration5, relativistic particles are accelerated by repeated shock crossings. However, this requires a separate mechanism that pre-accelerates particles to enable shock crossing. This is known as the ‘injection problem’, which is particularly relevant for electrons, and remains one of the most important puzzles in shock acceleration6. In most astrophysical shocks, the details of the shock structure cannot be directly resolved, making it challenging to identify the injection mechanism. Here we report results from laser-driven plasma flow experiments, and related simulations, that probe the formation of turbulent collisionless shocks in conditions relevant to young supernova remnants. We show that electrons can be effectively accelerated in a first-order Fermi process by small-scale turbulence produced within the shock transition to relativistic non-thermal energies, helping overcome the injection problem. Our observations provide new insight into electron injection at shocks and open the way for controlled laboratory studies of the physics underlying cosmic accelerators. In laser–plasma experiments complemented by simulations, electron acceleration is observed in turbulent collisionless shocks. This work clarifies the pre-acceleration to relativistic energies required for the onset of diffusive shock acceleration.},

The sensitivity of this technique scales favourably, achieving even 55 nV cm−1 Hz−1/2 with a modest set-up. The minimum detectable field of 780 pV cm−1 is three orders of magnitude smaller than what can be reached by existing atomic electrometers. The Rydberg-atom superhet allows SI-traceable measurements, reaching uncertainty levels of 10−8 V cm−1 when measuring a sub-μV cm−1 field, which has been inaccessible so far with atomic sensors. Our method also enables phase and frequency detection. In sensing Doppler frequencies, sub-μHz precision is reached for fields of a few hundred nV cm−1. This work is a first step towards realizing electromagnetic-wave quantum sensors with quantum projection noise-limited sensitivity. Such a device will impact diverse areas like radio astronomy, radar technology and metrology.

  abstract     = {The theory governing the strong nuclear force—quantum chromodynamics—predicts that at sufficiently high energy densities, hadronic nuclear matter undergoes a deconfinement transition to a new phase of quarks and gluons1. Although this has been observed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions2,3, it is currently an open question whether quark matter exists inside neutron stars4. By combining astrophysical observations and theoretical ab initio calculations in a model-independent way, we find that the inferred properties of matter in the cores of neutron stars with mass corresponding to 1.4 solar masses (M⊙) are compatible with nuclear model calculations. However, the matter in the interior of maximally massive stable neutron stars exhibits characteristics of the deconfined phase, which we interpret as evidence for the presence of quark-matter cores. For the heaviest reliably observed neutron stars5,6 with mass M ≈ 2M⊙, the presence of quark matter is found to be linked to the behaviour of the speed of sound cs in strongly interacting matter. If the conformal bound $${c}_{\rm{s}}^{2}\le 1/3$$ (ref. 7) is not strongly violated, massive neutron stars are predicted to have sizable quark-matter cores. This finding has important implications for the phenomenology of neutron stars and affects the dynamics of neutron star mergers with at least one sufficiently massive participant. The cores of neutron stars could be made of hadronic matter or quark matter. By combining first-principles calculations with observational data, evidence for the presence of quark matter in neutron star cores is found.},

  abstract     = {In the last two decades the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence has emerged as a focal point of many research interests. In particular, it functions as a stepping stone to a still-missing full quantum theory of gravity. In this context, a pivotal question is if and how cosmological physics can be studied using AdS/CFT. Motivated by string theory, braneworld cosmologies propose that our universe is a four-dimensional membrane embedded in a bulk five-dimensional AdS spacetime. We show how such a scenario can be microscopically realized in AdS/CFT using special field theory states dual to an ‘end-of-the-world brane’ moving in a charged black hole spacetime. Observers on the brane experience cosmological physics and approximately four-dimensional gravity, at least locally in spacetime. This result opens a path towards a description of quantum cosmology and the simulation of cosmology on quantum machines. Braneworld cosmologies describe our universe as a four-dimensional membrane embedded in a bulk five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In a possible holographic realization, observers on the brane experience cosmology, and gravity is localized.},

  abstract     = {The realization of quantum error correction is an essential ingredient for reaching the full potential of fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. Using a range of different schemes, logical qubits that are resistant to errors can be redundantly encoded in a set of error-prone physical qubits. One such scalable approach is based on the surface code. Here we experimentally implement its smallest viable instance, capable of repeatedly detecting any single error using seven superconducting qubits—four data qubits and three ancilla qubits. Using high-fidelity ancilla-based stabilizer measurements, we initialize the cardinal states of the encoded logical qubit with an average logical fidelity of 96.1\%. We then repeatedly check for errors using the stabilizer readout and observe that the logical quantum state is preserved with a lifetime and a coherence time longer than those of any of the constituent qubits when no errors are detected. Our demonstration of error detection with its resulting enhancement of the conditioned logical qubit coherence times is an important step, indicating a promising route towards the realization of quantum error correction in the surface code. In a surface code consisting of four data and three ancilla qubits, repeated error detection is demonstrated. The lifetime and coherence time of the logical qubit are enhanced over those of any of the constituent qubits when no errors are detected.},

  abstract     = {In quantum optics, great effort is being invested in enhancing the interaction of quantum emitters with light. The different approaches include increasing the number of emitters, the laser intensity or the local photonic density of states at the location of an atom-like localized emitter. In contrast, solid-state extended emitters hold an unappreciated promise of vastly greater enhancements through their large number of vacant electronic valence states. However, the majority of valence states are considered optically inaccessible by a conduction electron. We show that, by interfacing three-dimensional (3D) solids with 2D materials, we can unlock the unoccupied valence states by nonlocal optical interactions that lead to ultra-strong coupling for each conduction electron. Consequently, nonlocal optical interactions fundamentally alter the role of the quantum vacuum in solids and create a new type of tunable mass renormalization and bandgap renormalization, which reach tens of millielectronvolts in the example we show. To present quantitative predictions, we develop a non-perturbative macroscopic quantum electrodynamic formalism that we demonstrate on a graphene–semiconductor–metal nanostructure. We find new effects, such as nonlocal Rabi oscillations and femtosecond-scale optical relaxation, overcoming all other solid relaxation mechanisms and fundamentally altering the role of optical interactions in solids. When interfacing a graphene layer with a thin solid emitter, the quantum plasmonic vacuum allows each solid electron to access all unoccupied valence states through the nonlocality of their light-matter interaction, creating ultra-strong coupling alongside mass and bandgap renormalization.},

  abstract     = {The search for topological excitations such as Majorana fermions has spurred interest in the boundaries between distinct quantum states. Here, we explore an interface between two prototypical phases of electrons with conceptually different ground states: the integer quantum Hall insulator and the s-wave superconductor. We find clear signatures of hybridized electron and hole states similar to chiral Majorana fermions, which we refer to as chiral Andreev edge states (CAESs). These propagate along the interface in the direction determined by the magnetic field and their interference can turn an incoming electron into an outgoing electron or hole, depending on the phase accumulated by the CAESs along their path. Our results demonstrate that these excitations can propagate and interfere over a significant length, opening future possibilities for their coherent manipulation. The interface between a quantum Hall state and a superconductor hosts topological modes. Here, interference between two such modes turns an electron into either a hole or an electron depending on the phase difference along the interference path.},

However, controlled two-qubit entanglement generation has so far been limited to alkali species, leaving the exploitation of more complex electronic structures as an open frontier that could lead to improved fidelities and fundamentally different applications such as quantum-enhanced optical clocks. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach utilizing the two-valence electron structure of individual alkaline-earth Rydberg atoms. We find fidelities for Rydberg state detection, single-atom Rabi operations and two-atom entanglement that surpass previously published values. Our results pave the way for novel applications, including programmable quantum metrology and hybrid atom–ion systems, and set the stage for alkaline-earth based quantum computing architectures. High entanglement fidelity between neutral atoms is achieved using highly excited Rydberg states. The unique electron structure provided by alkaline-earth atoms makes it a promising platform for various quantum-technology-based applications.},

  abstract     = {Atomic nuclei with certain combinations of proton and neutron numbers can adopt reflection-asymmetric or octupole-deformed shapes at low excitation energy. These nuclei present a promising avenue in the search for a permanent atomic electric dipole moment—the existence of which has implications for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Theoretical studies have suggested that certain thorium isotopes may have large octupole deformation. However, due to experimental challenges, the extent of the octupole collectivity in the low-energy states in these thorium nuclei has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we report measurements of the lifetimes of low-energy states in 228Th (Z = 90) with a direct electronic fast-timing technique, the mirror symmetric centroid difference method. From lifetime measurements of the low-lying Jπ = 1− and Jπ = 3− states, the E1 transition probability rates and the intrinsic dipole moment are determined. The results are in agreement with those of previous theoretical calculations, allowing us to estimate the extent of the octupole deformation of 228Th. This study indicates that the nuclei 229Th and 229Pa (Z = 91) may be good candidates for the search for a permanent atomic electric dipole moment. The intrinsic dipole moment of 228Th is reported, from which the degree of the nucleus’s octupole deformation is estimated, suggesting that 229Th and 229Pa may be suitable candidates for the search for a permanent atomic electric dipole moment.},

However, current time synchronization techniques6,7 have been shown to be vulnerable to sophisticated adversaries8. There is a compelling need for fundamentally new methods to distribute high-precision time information securely. Here, we propose a satellite-based quantum-secure time transfer (QSTT) scheme based on two-way quantum key distribution in free space and experimentally verify the key technologies of the scheme via the Micius quantum satellite. In QSTT, a quantum signal (for example, a single photon) is used as the carrier for both the time transfer and the secret-key generation, offering quantum-enhanced security for transferring the time signal and time information. We perform a satellite-to-ground time synchronization using single-photon-level signals and achieve a quantum bit error rate of less than 1\%, a time data rate of 9 kHz and a time-transfer precision of 30 ps. These results offer possibilities towards an enhanced infrastructure for a time-transfer network, whose security stems from quantum physics. Transmitting the time signal and generating the secure key with the same carrier photon improves the security of a satellite-based quantum-secure time transfer protocol, which uses two-way quantum key distribution.},

  abstract     = {An understanding of the missing antinodal electronic excitations in the pseudogap state is essential for uncovering the physics of the underdoped cuprate high-temperature superconductors1–6. The majority of high-temperature experiments performed thus far, however, have been unable to discern whether the antinodal states are rendered unobservable due to their damping or whether they vanish due to their gapping7–18. Here, we distinguish between these two scenarios by using quantum oscillations to examine whether the small Fermi surface pocket, found to occupy only 2\% of the Brillouin zone in the underdoped cuprates19–24, exists in isolation against a majority of completely gapped density of states spanning the antinodes, or whether it is thermodynamically coupled to a background of ungapped antinodal states. We find that quantum oscillations associated with the small Fermi surface pocket exhibit a signature sawtooth waveform characteristic of an isolated two-dimensional Fermi surface pocket25–32. This finding reveals that the antinodal states are destroyed by a hard gap that extends over the majority of the Brillouin zone, placing strong constraints on a drastic underlying origin of quasiparticle disappearance over almost the entire Brillouin zone in the pseudogap regime7–18. A careful study of quantum oscillations of single crystals of the cuprate superconductor YBCO placed under a magnetic field reveals a sawtooth behaviour that is reminiscent of two-dimensional electronic systems—in turn suggesting the existence of a so-called ‘hard antinodal gap’ in this system.},

  abstract     = {α-RuCl3 is drawing much attention as a promising candidate for the Kitaev quantum spin liquid1–8. However, despite intensive research efforts, controversy remains about the form of the basic interactions governing the physics of this material. Even the sign of the Kitaev interaction (the bond-dependent anisotropic interaction responsible for Kitaev physics) is still under debate, with conflicting results from theoretical and experimental studies5,6,9–15. The significance of the symmetric off-diagonal exchange interaction (referred to as the Γ term) is another contentious question16–18. Here, we present resonant elastic X-ray scattering data that provide unambiguous experimental constraints to the two leading terms in the magnetic interaction Hamiltonian. We show that the Kitaev interaction (K) is ferromagnetic, and that the Γ term is antiferromagnetic and comparable in size to the Kitaev interaction. Our findings also provide a natural explanation for the large anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility in α-RuCl3 as arising from the large Γ term. We therefore provide a crucial foundation for understanding the interactions underpinning the exotic magnetic behaviours observed in α-RuCl3. α-RuCl3 is a promising candidate for realizing the Kitaev quantum spin liquid, but the physics governing its magnetic behaviour remain elusive. Resonant elastic X-ray scattering data now set unambiguous constraints on the leading terms in the Hamiltonian.},

  abstract     = {Conduction through materials crucially depends on how ordered the materials are. Periodically ordered systems exhibit extended Bloch waves that generate metallic bands, whereas disorder is known to limit conduction and localize the motion of particles in a medium1,2. In this context, quasiperiodic systems, which are neither periodic nor disordered, demonstrate exotic conduction properties, self-similar wavefunctions and critical phenomena3. Here, we explore the localization properties of waves in a novel family of quasiperiodic chains obtained when continuously interpolating between two paradigmatic limits4: the Aubry–André model5,6, famous for its metal-to-insulator transition, and the Fibonacci chain7,8, known for its critical nature. We discover that the Aubry–André model evolves into criticality through a cascade of band-selective localization/delocalization transitions that iteratively shape the self-similar critical wavefunctions of the Fibonacci chain. Using experiments on cavity-polariton devices, we observe the first transition and reveal the microscopic origin of the cascade. Our findings offer (1) a unique new insight into understanding the criticality of quasiperiodic chains, (2) a controllable knob by which to engineer band-selective pass filters and (3) a versatile experimental platform with which to further study the interplay of many-body interactions and dissipation in a wide range of quasiperiodic models. The localization properties of waves in the quasiperiodic chains described by the Aubry–André model and Fibonacci model are investigated. Passing from one model to the other, the system develops a cascade of delocalization transitions.},

Although quantum error correction (QEC) techniques2–8 have been developed to protect stored quantum information from leading orders of error, the noise-resilient processing of the QEC-protected quantum information is highly demanded but remains elusive9. Here, we demonstrate phase gate operations on a logical qubit encoded in a bosonic oscillator in an error-transparent (ET) manner. Inspired by refs. 10,11, the ET gates are extended to the bosonic code and are able to tolerate errors on the logical qubit during gate operations, regardless of the random occurrence time of the error. With precisely designed gate Hamiltonians through photon-number-resolved a.c. Stark shifts, the ET condition is fulfilled experimentally. We verify that the ET gates outperform the non-ET gates with a substantial improvement of gate fidelity after an occurrence of the single-photon-loss error. Our ET gates in superconducting quantum circuits can be readily extended to multiple encoded qubits and a universal gate set is within reach, holding the potential for reliable quantum information processing. Error-transparent quantum gates that can tolerate certain error during the execution of quantum operations have been demonstrated. Substantial improvement of the gate fidelity sheds lights on large-scale universal quantum computation.},

  abstract     = {To reach their full potential, quantum computers need to be resilient to noise and decoherence. In such a fault-tolerant quantum computer, errors must be corrected in real time to prevent them from propagating between components1,2. This requirement is especially pertinent while applying quantum gates, where the interaction between components can cause errors to spread quickly throughout the system. However, the large overhead involved in most fault-tolerant architectures2,3 makes implementing these systems a daunting task, motivating the search for hardware-efficient alternatives4,5. Here, we present a gate enacted by an ancilla transmon on a cavity-encoded logical qubit that is fault-tolerant to ancilla decoherence and compatible with logical error correction. We maintain the purity of the encoded qubit by correcting ancilla-induced errors in real time, yielding a reduction of the logical gate error by a factor of two in the presence of naturally occurring decoherence. We also demonstrate a sixfold suppression of the gate error with increased ancilla relaxation errors and a fourfold suppression with increased ancilla dephasing errors. The results demonstrate that bosonic logical qubits can be controlled by error-prone ancilla qubits without inheriting the ancilla’s inferior performance. As such, error-corrected ancilla-enabled gates are an important step towards fault-tolerant processing of bosonic qubits. Error-corrected quantum gates that can tolerate dominant errors during the execution of quantum operations have been demonstrated. Substantial improvement of the gate fidelity sheds light on fault-tolerant universal quantum computation.},

  abstract     = {One of the most promising approaches to reach a high gain in inertial confinement fusion is the fast ignition scheme. In this scheme, a relativistic electron beam is generated; this passes through the imploded plasma and deposits parts of its energy in the core. However, the large angular spread of the relativistic electron beam and the poorly controlled compression of the target affect realization of the fast ignition technique. Here, we demonstrate that indirectly driven (that is, driven by X-rays generated inside a gold hohlraum) implosions with a ‘high-foot’ and a short-coast time of less than 200 ps allow us to tightly compress the shell. Furthermore, we show the ability to optimize the symmetry of the imploding shell by changing the hohlraum length, successfully tuning a suitable tube-shaped shell to compensate for the large angular spread of the relativistic electron beam and to enhance the electron-to-core coupling efficiency via resistive magnetic fields. Benefiting from those experimental techniques, a significant enhancement in neutron yield was achieved in our indirectly driven fast ignition experiments. These results pave the way towards high-coupling fast ignition experiments with indirectly driven targets similar to those at the National Ignition Facility. Experiments realizing the indirect-drive fast ignition scheme for inertial confinement fusion are reported. Enabled by a tightly compressed target, an increase of neutron yield is observed.},

  abstract     = {The directed migration of cell collectives is essential in various physiological processes, such as epiboly, intestinal epithelial turnover, and convergent extension during morphogenesis, as well as during pathological events such as wound healing and cancer metastasis. Collective cell migration leads to the emergence of coordinated movements over multiple cells. Our current understanding emphasizes that these movements are mainly driven by large-scale transmission of signals through adherens junctions. In this study, we show that collective movements of epithelial cells can be triggered by polarity signals at the single-cell level through the establishment of coordinated lamellipodial protrusions. We designed a minimalistic model system to generate one-dimensional epithelial trains confined in ring-shaped patterns that recapitulate rotational movements observed in vitro in cellular monolayers and in vivo in genital or follicular cell rotation. Using our system, we demonstrated that cells follow coordinated rotational movements after establishing directed Rac1-dependent polarity over the entire monolayer. Our experimental and numerical approaches show that the maintenance of coordinated migration requires the acquisition of a front–rear polarity within each single cell but does not require the maintenance of cell–cell junctions. Taken together, these unexpected findings demonstrate that collective cell dynamics in closed environments as observed in multiple in vitro and in vivo situations can arise from single-cell behaviour through a sustained memory of cell polarity. Collective cell migration is usually attributed to large-scale transmission of signals through cell junctions. Here, the authors confine cells into a ring-shaped pattern and show that collective cell migration can arise at the single-cell level.},

Here, we introduce a dissipative self-assembly methodology demonstrated on a diverse spectrum of materials, from simple, passive, identical quantum dots (a few hundred atoms) that experience extreme Brownian motion, to complex, active, non-identical human cells (~1017 atoms) with sophisticated internal dynamics. Autocatalytic growth curves of the self-assembled aggregates are shown to scale identically, and interface fluctuations of growing aggregates obey the universal Tracy–Widom law. Example applications for nanoscience and biotechnology are further provided. Biological systems are able to self-assemble in non-equilibrium conditions thanks to a continuous injection of energy. Here the authors present a tool to achieve non-equilibrium self-assembly of synthetic and biological constituents with sizes spanning three orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {In general, magnetism and superconductivity are antagonistic to each other. However, there are several families of superconductors in which superconductivity coexists with magnetism, and a few examples are known where the superconductivity itself induces spontaneous magnetism. The best known of these compounds are Sr2RuO4 and some non-centrosymmetric superconductors. Here, we report the finding of a narrow dome of an $$s+is^{\prime}$$ superconducting phase with apparent broken time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) inside the broad s-wave superconducting region of the centrosymmetric multiband superconductor Ba1 − xKxFe2As2 (0.7 ≲ x ≲ 0.85). We observe spontaneous magnetic fields inside this dome using the muon spin relaxation (μSR) technique. Furthermore, our detailed specific heat study reveals that the BTRS dome appears very close to a change in the topology of the Fermi surface. With this, we experimentally demonstrate the likely emergence of a novel quantum state due to topological changes of the electronic system. An exotic s + is multiband superconducting state manifests in a doped pnictide superconductor when a second band moves below the Fermi surface. This creates an internal magnetic field, breaking time-reversal symmetry.},

  abstract     = {Squeezed light—light with quantum noise lower than shot noise in some quadratures and higher in others—can be used to improve the sensitivity of precision measurements. In particular, squeezed light sources based on nonlinear optical crystals are being used to improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors. In optomechanical squeezers, the radiation-pressure-driven interaction of a coherent light field with a mechanical oscillator induces correlations between the amplitude and phase quadratures of the light, which induce the squeezing. However, thermally driven fluctuations of the mechanical oscillator’s position make it difficult to observe the quantum correlations at room temperature and at low frequencies. Here, we present a measurement of optomechanically squeezed light, performed at room temperature in a broad band near the audio-frequency regions relevant to gravitational wave detectors. We observe sub-Poissonian quantum noise in a frequency band of 30–70 kHz with a maximum reduction of 0.7 ± 0.1 dB below shot noise at 45 kHz. We present two independent methods of measuring this squeezing, one of which does not rely on the calibration of shot noise. The ability to create optomechanically squeezed light at room temperature across a frequency range in the audio band could improve the measurement precision of future interferometric detectors for gravitational waves.},

  abstract     = {Attosecond chronoscopy has revealed small but measurable delays in photoionization, characterized by the ejection of an electron on absorption of a single photon. Ionization-delay measurements in atomic targets provide a wealth of information about the timing of the photoelectric effect, resonances, electron correlations and transport. However, extending this approach to molecules presents challenges, such as identifying the correct ionization channels and the effect of the anisotropic molecular landscape on the measured delays. Here, we measure ionization delays from ethyl iodide around a giant dipole resonance. By using the theoretical value for the iodine atom as a reference, we disentangle the contribution from the functional ethyl group, which is responsible for the characteristic chemical reactivity of a molecule. We find a substantial additional delay caused by the presence of a functional group, which encodes the effect of the molecular potential on the departing electron. Such information is inaccessible to the conventional approach of measuring photoionization cross-sections. The results establish ionization-delay measurements as a valuable tool in investigating the electronic properties of molecules. Ionization delays from ethyl iodide around a giant dipole resonance are measured by attosecond streaking spectroscopy. Using theoretical knowledge of the iodine atom as a reference, the contribution of the functional ethyl group can be obtained.},

  abstract     = {Nanofabricated mechanical resonators are gaining significant momentum among potential quantum technologies due to their unique design freedom and independence from naturally occurring resonances. As their functionality is widely detached from material choice, they constitute ideal tools for transducers—intermediaries between different quantum systems—and as memory elements in conjunction with quantum communication and computing devices. Their capability to host ultra-long-lived phonon modes is particularity attractive for non-classical information storage, both for future quantum technologies and for fundamental tests of physics. Here, we demonstrate a Duan–Lukin–Cirac–Zoller-type mechanical quantum memory with an energy decay time of T1 ≈ 2 ms, which is controlled through an optical interface engineered to natively operate at telecom wavelengths. We further investigate the coherence of the memory, equivalent to the dephasing $${T}_{2}^{* }$$ for qubits, which has a power-dependent value between 15 and 112 μs. This demonstration is enabled by an optical scheme to create a superposition state of $$\left|0\right\rangle +\left|1\right\rangle$$ mechanical excitations, with an arbitrary ratio between the vacuum and single-phonon components. By exploiting the long-lived phonon modes in nanoscale mechanical resonators, a quantum memory that operates around the standard telecom wavelength of 1,550 nm is realized on a silicon platform.},

Here, we develop a non-Hermitian linear response theory that considers the dynamical response of a Hermitian system to a non-Hermitian probe, and we can also relate such a dynamical response to the properties of an unprobed Hermitian system at equilibrium. As an application of our theory, we consider the real-time dynamics of momentum distribution induced by one-body and two-body dissipations. Remarkably, for a critical state with no well-defined quasi-particles, we find that the dynamics are slower than the normal state with well-defined quasi-particles, and our theory provides a model-independent way to extract the critical exponent in the real-time correlation function. We find surprisingly good agreement between our theory and a recent cold atom experiment on the dissipative Bose–Hubbard model. We also propose to further quantitatively verify our theory by performing experiments on dissipative one-dimensional Luttinger liquid. Generalization of linear response theory to the non-Hermitian case turns dissipation into a new tool for detecting equilibrium phases. The prediction from this theory remarkably agrees with a recent cold atom experiment.},

  abstract     = {Bulk–boundary correspondence, a guiding principle in topological matter, relates robust edge states to bulk topological invariants. Its validity, however, has so far been established only in closed systems. Recent theoretical studies indicate that this principle requires fundamental revisions for a wide range of open systems with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Therein, the intriguing localization of nominal bulk states at boundaries, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, suggests a non-Bloch band theory in which non-Bloch topological invariants are defined in generalized Brillouin zones, leading to a general bulk–boundary correspondence beyond the conventional framework. Here, we experimentally observe this fundamental non-Hermitian bulk–boundary correspondence in discrete-time non-unitary quantum-walk dynamics of single photons. We demonstrate pronounced photon localizations near boundaries even in the absence of topological edge states, thus confirming the non-Hermitian skin effect. Facilitated by our experimental scheme of edge-state reconstruction, we directly measure topological edge states, which are in excellent agreement with the non-Bloch topological invariants. Our work unequivocally establishes the non-Hermitian bulk–boundary correspondence as a general principle underlying non-Hermitian topological systems and paves the way for a complete understanding of topological matter in open systems. Measurements of non-Hermitian photon dynamics show boundary-localized bulk eigenstates given by the non-Hermitian skin effect. A fundamental revision of the bulk–boundary correspondence in open systems is required to understand the underlying physics.},

  abstract     = {Compton scattering is one of the fundamental interaction processes of light with matter. When discovered1, it was described as a billiard-type collision of a photon ‘kicking’ a quasi-free electron. With decreasing photon energy, the maximum possible momentum transfer becomes so small that the corresponding energy falls below the binding energy of the electron. In this regime, ionization by Compton scattering becomes an intriguing quantum phenomenon. Here, we report on a kinematically complete experiment studying Compton scattering off helium atoms in that regime. We determine the momentum correlations of the electron, the recoiling ion and the scattered photon in a coincidence experiment based on cold target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy, finding that electrons are not only emitted in the direction of the momentum transfer, but that there is a second peak of ejection to the backward direction. This finding links Compton scattering to processes such as ionization by ultrashort optical pulses2, electron impact ionization3,4, ion impact ionization5,6 and neutron scattering7, where similar momentum patterns occur. Compton scattering experiments off helium atoms for photon energies close to the ionization threshold reveal that electrons are not only emitted in the direction of the momentum transfer but also backwards.},

  abstract     = {Physical systems reach thermal equilibrium through energy exchange with their environment, and for spins in solids the relevant environment is almost always their host lattice. However, recent studies1 motivated by observations by Purcell2 have shown how radiative emission into a microwave cavity can become the dominant relaxation path for spins if the spin–cavity coupling is sufficiently large (such as for small-mode-volume cavities). In this regime, the cavity electromagnetic field overrides the lattice as the dominant environment, inviting the prospect of controlling the spin temperature independently from that of the lattice, by engineering a suitable cavity field. Here, we report on precisely such control over spin temperature, illustrating a novel and universal method to increase the electron spin polarization above its thermal equilibrium value (termed hyperpolarization). By switching the cavity input between resistive loads at different temperatures we can control the electron spin polarization, cooling it below the lattice temperature. Our demonstration uses donor spins in silicon coupled to a superconducting microresonator and we observe more than a twofold increase in spin polarization. This approach provides a general route to signal enhancement in electron spin resonance, or nuclear magnetic resonance through dynamical nuclear spin polarization3,4. Electron spins in solid usually relax their energy through the coupling with phonons in the host lattice. By using the coupling to microwave photons in a cavity as an alternative relaxation path, it is demonstrated that spins can be cooled below the lattice temperature.},

  abstract     = {The study of the laws of nature has traditionally been pursued in the limit of isolated systems, where energy is conserved. This is not always a valid approximation, however, as the inclusion of features such as gain and loss, or periodic driving, qualitatively amends these laws. A contemporary frontier of metamaterial research is the challenge open systems pose to the characterization of topological matter1,2. Here, one of the most relied upon principles is the bulk–boundary correspondence (BBC), which intimately relates the surface states to the topological classification of the bulk3,4. The presence of gain and loss, in combination with the violation of reciprocity, has been predicted to affect this principle dramatically5,6. Here, we report the experimental observation of BBC violation in a non-reciprocal topolectric circuit7, which is also referred to as the non-Hermitian skin effect. The circuit admittance spectrum exhibits an unprecedented sensitivity to the presence of a boundary, displaying an extensive admittance mode localization despite a translationally invariant bulk. Intriguingly, we measure a non-local voltage response due to broken BBC. Depending on the a.c. current feed frequency, the voltage signal accumulates at the left or right boundary, and increases as a function of nodal distance to the current feed. Boundary-localized bulk eigenstates given by the non-Hermitian skin effect are observed in a non-reciprocal topological circuit.

  abstract     = {In order to understand the emergence of superconductivity it is useful to study the reverse process and identify the various pathways that lead to its destruction. One way is to increase the amount of disorder, as this leads to an increase in Coulomb repulsion that overpowers the attractive interaction responsible for Cooper pair formation. A second pathway—applicable to uniformly disordered materials—is to utilize the competition between superconductivity and Anderson localization, as this leads to electronic granularity in which phase and amplitude fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter play a role. Finally, a third pathway is to construct an array of superconducting islands coupled by some form of proximity effect that leads from a superconducting state to a state with finite resistivity, which appears like a metallic groundstate. This Review Article summarizes recent progress in understanding of these different pathways, including experiments in low dimensional materials and application in superconducting quantum devices. The breakdown of superconductivity is described as a reduction in the amplitude of the order parameter or a breakdown in phase coherence of Cooper pairs. This Review Article highlights recent results that show both mechanisms may be at play simultaneously.},

Low-density flat-band systems play a vital role because the energy range of the band is so narrow that the Coulomb interactions dominate over kinetic energy, putting these materials in the strongly-correlated regime. Experimentally, when a band is narrow in both energy and momentum, its filling may be tuned in situ across the whole range, from empty to full. Recently, one particular flat-band system—that of van der Waals heterostructures, such as twisted bilayer graphene—has exhibited strongly correlated states and superconductivity, but it is still not clear to what extent the two are linked. Here, we review the status and prospects for flat-band engineering in van der Waals heterostructures and explore how both phenomena emerge from the moiré flat bands. The identification of superconductivity and strong interactions in twisted bilayer 2D materials prompted many questions about the interplay of these phenomena.

In this Perspective, we review the evidence for the existence of Majorana zero modes that has accumulated in numerous experiments and the remaining uncertainties, and discuss what additional evidence is desirable. One very important factor for future development is the quality of the interface between the superconductor and semiconductor; we sketch out where further progress in the materials science of these interfaces can take us. We then discuss the path towards applying these modes in topologically protected quantum computing and observing more exotic kinds of superconductivity based on the same materials platform, and how to make connections to high-energy physics. Hybrid devices of superconductors and semiconductor nanowires may be topological and host majorana.

However, some exotic superconductors do not conform to this physical picture but instead feature an unusual ‘normal’ state that is not a Fermi liquid. One explanation of this unusual behaviour is that pre-formed pairs of electrons are established above the superconducting temperature Tc. Here, we highlight recent experiments that show the likely existence of these pre-formed pairs in two rather different materials—a high-temperature cuprate superconductor and strontium titanate. Moreover, in both materials the normal state from which superconductivity emerges has other shared properties, including a pseudogap and electronic nematicity—rotational symmetry breaking in the electron fluid that is not expected in Fermi liquid theory nor more generally from the crystal lattice symmetry. These experimental findings should provoke more interaction between the communities working on these materials and new insights into the underlying mechanism of the creation of pre-formed pairs. Pairs of electrons can form above the superconducting critical temperature.

  abstract     = {Jupiter’s dynamics shapes its cloud patterns but remains largely unknown below this natural observational barrier. Unravelling the underlying three-dimensional flows is thus a primary goal for NASA’s ongoing Juno mission, which was launched in 2011. Here, we address the dynamics of large Jovian vortices using laboratory experiments complemented by theoretical and numerical analyses. We determine the generic force balance responsible for their three-dimensional pancake-like shape. From this, we define scaling laws for their horizontal and vertical aspect ratios as a function of the ambient rotation, stratification and zonal wind velocity. For the Great Red Spot in particular, our predicted horizontal dimensions agree well with measurements at the cloud level since the Voyager mission in 1979. We also predict the Great Red Spot’s thickness, which is inaccessible to direct observation. It has remained surprisingly constant despite the observed horizontal shrinking. Our results now await comparison with upcoming Juno observations. Laboratory experiments reproduce the three-dimensional pancake-like shape of Jupiter’s vortices. The thickness of the Great Red Spot is predicted, awaiting comparison with NASA’s Juno mission.},

  abstract     = {The occurrence of coiled or helical morphologies is common in nature, from plant roots to DNA packaging into viral capsids, as well as in applications such as oil drilling processes. In many examples, chiral structures result from the buckling of a straight fibre either with intrinsic twist or to which end moments have been applied in addition to compression forces. Here, we elucidate a generic way to form regular helicoidal shapes from achiral straight filaments transported in viscous flows with free ends. Through a combination of experiments using fluorescently labelled actin filaments in microfluidic divergent flows and two distinct sets of numerical simulations, we demonstrate the robustness of helix formation. A nonlinear stability analysis is performed, and explains the emergence of such chiral structures from the nonlinear interaction of perpendicular planar buckling modes, an effect that solely requires a strong compressional flow, independent of the exact nature of the fibre or type of flow field. The fundamental mechanism for the uncovered morphological transition and characterization of the emerging conformations advance our understanding of several biological and industrial processes and can also be exploited for the controlled microfabrication of chiral objects. A general mechanism through which elastic filaments suspended in a strong compressional flow buckle and spontaneously acquire a chiral helicoidal shape is uncovered and elucidated theoretically.},

  abstract     = {A landmark of turbulence is the emergence of universal scaling laws, such as Kolmogorov’s E(q) ~ q−5∕3 scaling of the kinetic energy spectrum of inertial turbulence with the wavevector q. In recent years, active fluids have been shown to exhibit turbulent-like flows at low Reynolds number. However, the existence of universal scaling properties in these flows has remained unclear. To address this issue, here we propose a minimal defect-free hydrodynamic theory for two-dimensional active nematic fluids at vanishing Reynolds number. By means of large-scale simulations and analytical arguments, we show that the kinetic energy spectrum exhibits a universal scaling E(q) ~ q−1 at long wavelengths. We find that the energy injection due to activity has a peak at a characteristic length scale, which is selected by a nonlinear mechanism. In contrast to inertial turbulence, energy is entirely dissipated at the scale where it is injected, thus precluding energy cascades. Nevertheless, the non-local character of the Stokes flow establishes long-range velocity correlations, which lead to the scaling behaviour. We conclude that active nematic fluids define a distinct universality class of turbulence at low Reynolds number. Determining the properties that emerge from the equations that govern turbulent flow is a fundamental challenge in non-equilibrium physics. A hydrodynamic theory for two-dimensional active nematic fluids at vanishing Reynolds number is now put forward, revealing a universal scaling behaviour for this class of systems.},

  abstract     = {Hexagonal iron sulfide exhibits a fascinating coexistence of metal–insulator, structural and magnetic transitions, reflecting an intimate interplay of its spin, phonon and charge degrees of freedom. Here, we show how a subtle competition of energetic and entropic free-energy components governs its thermodynamics and the sequence of phase transitions it undergoes upon cooling. By means of comprehensive neutron and X-ray scattering measurements, and supported by first-principles electronic structure simulations, we identify the critical role of the coupling between antiferromagnetic ordering and instabilities of anharmonic phonons in the metallic phase in driving the metal–insulator transition. The antiferromagnetic ordering enables the emergence of two zone-boundary soft phonons, whose coupling to a zone-centre mode drives the lattice distortion opening the electronic bandgap. Simultaneously, spin–lattice coupling opens a gap in the magnon spectrum that controls the entropy component of the metal–insulator transition free energy. These results reveal the importance of spin–phonon coupling to tune anharmonic effects, thus opening new avenues to design novel technologically important materials harbouring the metal–insulator transition and magnetoelectric behaviours. A detailed and systematic X-ray and neutron scattering study of hexagonal iron sulfide uncovers the critical role of spin–phonon coupling in promoting the metal–insulator transition in this system.},

Networks of such structures can produce topologically protected qubits where the fundamental energy scale is given by the inter-pair coupling EM between the zero modes belonging to different wire segments. Here we report on the spectroscopic measurement of EM in an InAs/Al double-island device by tracking the position of the microwave-induced quasiparticle excitations using a radiofrequency charge sensor. At zero magnetic field, photon-assisted tunnelling of Cooper pairs allows us to estimate the Josephson coupling between the islands. In the presence of a magnetic field aligned along the nanowire, we observe the 1e periodic excitation spectrum resulting from a zero-energy subgap state that emerges in a magnetic field. The discrete 1e periodic excitation spectrum is consistent with the coherent hybridization of single-electron states belonging to two opposite-parity branches. The dependence of excitation frequency on detuning indicates a sizable (GHz-scale) and controllable hybridization of zero modes across the junction separating islands, a requirement for applications related to Majorana-based qubits. Majorana bound states at the end of nanowires may be used for quantum computation if they can be coupled sufficiently strongly. Here, the Copenhagen lab show strong and tunable coupling, a step along the road towards devices.},

  abstract     = {Topological defects determine the structure and function of physical and biological matter over a wide range of scales, from the turbulent vortices in planetary atmospheres, oceans or quantum fluids to bioelectrical signalling in the heart1–3 and brain4, and cell death5. Many advances have been made in understanding and controlling the defect dynamics in active6–9 and passive9,10 non-equilibrium fluids. Yet, it remains unknown whether the statistical laws that govern the dynamics of defects in classical11 or quantum fluids12–14 extend to the active matter7,15,16 and information flows17,18 in living systems. Here, we show that a defect-mediated turbulence underlies the complex wave propagation patterns of Rho-GTP signalling protein on the membrane of starfish egg cells, a process relevant to cytoskeletal remodelling and cell proliferation19,20. Our experiments reveal that the phase velocity field extracted from Rho-GTP concentration waves exhibits vortical defect motions and annihilation dynamics reminiscent of those seen in quantum systems12,13, bacterial turbulence15 and active nematics7. Several key statistics and scaling laws of the defect dynamics can be captured by a minimal Helmholtz–Onsager point vortex model21 as well as a generic complex Ginzburg–Landau22 continuum theory, suggesting a close correspondence between the biochemical signal propagation on the surface of a living cell and a widely studied class of two-dimensional turbulence23 and wave22 phenomena. Activity in certain living systems can lead to swirling flows akin to turbulence.

How patterns emerge in a homogeneous system is a fundamental question across interdisciplinary research including hydrodynamics1, condensed matter physics2, nonlinear optics3, cosmology4 and bio-chemistry5,6. Paradigmatic examples, such as Rayleigh–Bénard convection rolls and Faraday waves7,8, have been studied extensively and found numerous applications9–11. How such knowledge applies to quantum systems and whether the patterns in a quantum system can be controlled remain intriguing questions. Here we show that the density patterns with two- (D2), four- (D4) and six-fold (D6) symmetries can emerge in Bose–Einstein condensates on demand when the atomic interactions are modulated at multiple frequencies. The D6 pattern, in particular, arises from a resonant wave-mixing process that establishes phase coherence of the excitations that respect the symmetry. Our experiments explore a novel class of non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum gases, as well as a new route to prepare quantum states with desired correlations. Two-dimensional density patterns with two-, four- and six-fold symmetries emerge in homogeneous Bose–Einstein condensates when the atomic interactions are modulated at multiple frequencies causing the coherent mixing of excitations.},

  abstract     = {The fundamental concept of light–matter interaction is routinely realized by coupling the quantized electric field in a cavity to the dipole moment of a real or an artificial atom. A recent proposal1,2, motivated by the prospect of overcoming the decohering effects of distant charge fluctuations, suggests that introduction of and coupling to an electric quadrupole moment of a single electron can be achieved by confining it in a triple quantum dot. Here, we show an experimental realization of this concept by connecting a superconducting microwave resonator to the middle of the three dots, such that the dipole coupling becomes negligible. We demonstrate strong coupling to the electron quadrupole moment and determine that the coherence of our system is limited by short-range charge noise. Our experiment enables the construction and detection of a complex electronic state of a single electron in a solid-state environment that does not exist as such for a free electron. Coupling of the quadrupole moment of an electron in a triple quantum dot to photons has been predicted to be a good platform for reducing the effect of charge noise on the decoherence time of a qubit. Here, the authors create such a coupling.},

  abstract     = {Dirac fermions with highly dispersive linear bands1–3 are usually considered weakly correlated due to the relatively large bandwidths (W) compared to Coulomb interactions (U). With the discovery of nodal-line semimetals, the notion of the Dirac point has been extended to lines and loops in momentum space. The anisotropy associated with nodal-line structure gives rise to greatly reduced kinetic energy along the line. However, experimental evidence for the anticipated enhanced correlations in nodal-line semimetals is sparse. Here, we report on prominent correlation effects in a nodal-line semimetal compound, ZrSiSe, through a combination of optical spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. We observed two fundamental spectroscopic hallmarks of electronic correlations: strong reduction (1/3) of the free-carrier Drude weight and also the Fermi velocity compared to predictions of density functional band theory. The renormalization of Fermi velocity can be further controlled with an external magnetic field. ZrSiSe therefore offers the rare opportunity to investigate correlation-driven physics in a Dirac system. What happens to topological materials when their electrons are strongly interacting is an open question. Shao and others demonstrate that ZrSiSe is a material that can address this as it has a topological band structure and non-trivial correlations.},

  abstract     = {Moiré engineering has recently emerged as an effective approach to control quantum phenomena in condensed matter systems1–6. In van der Waals heterostructures, moiré patterns can be formed by lattice misorientation between adjacent atomic layers, creating long-range electronic order. Moiré engineering has so far been executed solely in stacked van der Waals multilayers. Here we describe electronic moiré patterns in films of a prototypical magnetoresistive oxide, La0.67Sr0.33MnO3, epitaxially grown on LaAlO3 substrates. Using scanning probe nanoimaging, we observe microscopic moiré profiles attributed to the coexistence and interaction of two distinct incommensurate patterns of strain modulation within these films. The net effect is that both the electronic conductivity and ferromagnetism of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 are modulated by periodic moiré textures extending over mesoscopic scales. Our work provides a potential route to achieving spatially patterned electronic textures on demand in strained epitaxial materials. Moiré engineering has rapidly gained currency as a means to manipulate electronic states of matter in van der Waals heterostructures. Now, the feat is achieved in epitaxially grown oxide heterostructures, thus opening up fresh opportunities for strongly correlated electronic systems.},

Here, by performing neutron scattering experiments on the one-dimensional Heisenberg–Ising antiferromagnet SrCo2V2O8 in high longitudinal magnetic fields, we reveal in detail the dispersion relations of the string states over the full Brillouin zone, as well as their magnetic field dependencies. Furthermore, the characteristic energy, the scattering intensity and linewidth of the observed string states exhibit excellent agreement with our precise Bethe–ansatz calculations. Our results establish the important role of string states in the quantum spin dynamics of one-dimensional systems, and will invoke studies of their dynamical properties in more general many-body systems. In one-dimensional quantum magnets, complex bound states of magnetic excitations known as Bethe strings have long been predicted. Now, a detailed neutron scattering study of SrCo2V2O8 reveals their magnetic-field-dependent dispersion relation.},

This odd–even staggering, ubiquitous throughout the nuclear landscape1, varies with the number of protons and neutrons, and poses a substantial challenge for nuclear theory2–4. Here, we report measurements of the charge radii of short-lived copper isotopes up to the very exotic 78Cu (with proton number Z = 29 and neutron number N = 49), produced at only 20 ions s–1, using the collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy method at the Isotope Mass Separator On-Line Device facility (ISOLDE) at CERN. We observe an unexpected reduction in the odd–even staggering for isotopes approaching the N = 50 shell gap. To describe the data, we applied models based on nuclear density functional theory5,6 and A-body valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group theory7,8. Through these comparisons, we demonstrate a relation between the global behaviour of charge radii and the saturation density of nuclear matter, and show that the local charge radii variations, which reflect the many-body polarization effects, naturally emerge from A-body calculations fitted to properties of A ≤ 4 nuclei. Isotopes with an odd number of neutrons are usually slightly smaller in size than their even-neutron neighbours. In charge radii of short-lived copper isotopes, a reduction of this effect is observed when the neutron number approaches fifty.},

  abstract     = {Collisions between heavy atomic nuclei at ultrarelativistic energies are carried out at particle colliders to produce the quark–gluon plasma, a state of matter where quarks and gluons are not confined into hadrons, and colour degrees of freedom are liberated. This state is thought to be produced as a transient phenomenon before it fragments into thousands of particles that reach the particle detectors. Despite two decades of investigations, one of the big open challenges1 is to obtain an experimental determination of the temperature reached in a heavy-ion collision, and a simultaneous determination of another thermodynamic quantity, such as the entropy density, that would give access to the number of degrees of freedom. Here, we obtain such a determination, utilizing state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations2. We define an effective temperature, averaged over the spacetime evolution of the medium. Then, using experimental data, we determine this temperature and the corresponding entropy density and speed of sound in the matter created in lead–lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Our results agree with first-principles calculations from lattice quantum chromodynamics3 and confirm that a deconfined phase of matter is indeed produced. The quark–gluon plasma, in which quarks and gluons are deconfined, is a transient state created in collisions of heavy nuclei. By defining an effective temperature, this temperature and the system’s entropy density and speed of sound are determined.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has been a sobering reminder of the extensive damage brought about by epidemics, phenomena that play a vivid role in our collective memory, and that have long been identified as significant sources of risk for humanity. The use of increasingly sophisticated mathematical and computational models for the spreading and the implications of epidemics should, in principle, provide policy- and decision-makers with a greater situational awareness regarding their potential risk. Yet most of those models ignore the tail risk of contagious diseases, use point forecasts, and the reliability of their parameters is rarely questioned and incorporated in the projections. We argue that a natural and empirically correct framework for assessing (and managing) the real risk of pandemics is provided by extreme value theory (EVT), an approach that has historically been developed to treat phenomena in which extremes (maxima or minima) and not averages play the role of the protagonist, being the fundamental source of risk. By analysing data for pandemic outbreaks spanning over the past 2500 years, we show that the related distribution of fatalities is strongly fat-tailed, suggesting a tail risk that is unfortunately largely ignored in common epidemiological models. We use a dual distribution method, combined with EVT, to extract information from the data that is not immediately available to inspection. To check the robustness of our conclusions, we stress our data to account for the imprecision in historical reporting. We argue that our findings have significant implications, including on the extent to which compartmental epidemiological models and similar approaches can be relied upon for making policy decisions. This Perspective argues that an approach called extreme value theory is appropriate for understanding the so-called tail risk of epidemic outbreaks, in particular by demonstrating that the distribution of fatalities due to epidemic outbreaks over the past 2500 years is fat-tailed and dominated by extreme events.},

Here, we define a framework to characterize the dynamics of the Maki–Thompson rumour spreading model in structured populations, and analytically find a previously uncharacterized dynamical phase transition that separates the local and global contagion regimes. We validate our threshold prediction through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we apply this framework in two real-world systems, the European commuting and transportation network and the Digital Bibliography and Library Project collaboration network. Our findings highlight the importance of the underlying population structure in understanding social contagion phenomena and have the potential to define new intervention strategies aimed at hindering or facilitating the diffusion of information in socio-technical systems. The mathematical modelling of how information spreads in social networks has latterly gained fresh urgency. A study of realistic structured populations now identifies the threshold at which the propagation of rumours becomes contagious, thereby inducing a phase transition.},

  abstract     = {From water balloons to cells and various organs, thin elastic shells enclosing liquid cores or capsules are ubiquitous. Although such capsules are rampant in nature and in engineering, the physics of their deformation upon rapid impact is virtually unexplored. Here we perform experiments and develop formal models to rationalize the deformation and possible bursting of elastic capsules impacting rigid walls. We discover an analogy to the impact of liquid drops, where the shell surface modulus plays the role of the drop surface tension. On the basis of this analogy, we propose an energy balance that quantitatively predicts the maximal deformation of the capsule in the inviscid limit, and for liquids with viscosities up to 1,000 cP (Reynolds numbers ≳10). Unlike drops, however, capsules can be pre-stretched and burst. Experiments show a substantial influence of the pre-stretch on the critical burst velocity, a feature also captured by our model. While we focus on macroscopic objects, our model could potentially be extended to account for the deformations of microcapsules in microfluidic channels. In addition, this work could have practical implications from the optimized detonation of fire-extinguishing balls to fight domestic fires and wildfires to the prevention of organ bursting in car crashes. Experiments on the deformation and bursting of elastic capsules impacting rigid walls are reported, revealing an analogy to the impact of liquid drops. The developed model for macroscopic objects could potentially be expanded to microscopic scales.},

  abstract     = {In an insulator, thermal transport at high temperature is expected to be dominated by entirely classical phonon dynamics. In apparent tension with this expectation, recent experimental observations have led to the conjecture that the transport lifetime, τ, is subject to a Planckian bound from below, namely, τ ≳ τPl ≡ ℏ ∕ (kBT). Here, we argue that this Planckian bound is due to a quantum-mechanical bound on the sound velocity: vs &amp;lt; vM. The ‘melting velocity’ vM is defined in terms of the melting temperature of the crystal, the interatomic spacing and Planck’s constant. We show that for several classes of insulating crystals, both simple and complex, τ ∕ τPl ≈ vM ∕ vs at high temperatures. The velocity bound therefore implies the Planckian bound. At high temperature, the heat diffusion in an insulator is expected to be dominated by entirely classical phonon dynamics. But theoretical study shows that the transport lifetime is subject to a quantum-mechanical bound related to the sound velocity.},

  abstract     = {The radiation of electromagnetic and mechanical waves depends not only on the intrinsic properties of the emitter but also on the surrounding environment. This principle has laid the foundation for the development of lasers, quantum optics, sonar, musical instruments and other fields related to wave–matter interaction. In the conventional wisdom, the environment is defined exclusively by its eigenstates, and an emitter radiates into and interacts with these eigenstates. Here we show experimentally that this scenario breaks down at a non-Hermitian degeneracy known as an exceptional point. We find a chirality-reversal phenomenon in a ring cavity where the radiation field reveals the missing dimension of the Hilbert space, known as the Jordan vector. This phenomenon demonstrates that the radiation field of an emitter can become fully decoupled from the eigenstates of its environment. The generality of this striking phenomenon in wave–matter interaction is experimentally confirmed in both electromagnetic and acoustic systems. Our finding transforms the fundamental understanding of light–matter interaction and wave–matter interaction in general, and enriches the intriguing physics of exceptional points. The modes of the radiation field generated from an emitter are usually determined by the eigenstates of the surrounding environment. However, this scenario breaks down in a non-Hermitian system, at the spectral degeneracy known as an exceptional point.},

  abstract     = {Mode-locking is a process in which different modes of an optical resonator establish stable synchronization through non-linear interactions. This self-organization underlies light sources that enable many modern scientific applications, such as ultrafast and high-field optics and frequency combs. Despite this, mode-locking has almost exclusively referred to the self-organization of light in a single dimension—time. Here we present a theoretical approach—attractor dissection—to understand three-dimensional spatiotemporal mode-locking. The key idea is to find a specific, minimal reduced model for each distinct type of three-dimensional pulse, and thus identify the important intracavity effects responsible for its formation and stability. An intuition for the results follows from the minimum loss principle, the idea that a laser strives to find the configuration of intracavity light that minimizes loss (maximizes gain extraction). Through this approach, we identify and explain several distinct forms of spatiotemporal mode-locking. These phases of coherent laser light have no analogues in one dimension and are supported by measurements of the three-dimensional field, which reveals spatiotemporal mode-locked states that comprise more than 107 cavity modes. Our results should facilitate the discovery and understanding of new higher-dimensional forms of coherent light which, in turn, may enable new applications. Mode-locking of lasers can be understood as self-organization, and the three-dimensional case of spatiotemporal mode-locking can described using attractor dissection theory, which helps develop an intuition for this complex case.},

  abstract     = {Neutrinos were assumed to be massless particles until the discovery of the neutrino oscillation process. This phenomenon indicates that the neutrinos have non-zero masses and the mass eigenstates (ν1, ν2, ν3) are mixtures of their flavour eigenstates (νe, νμ, ντ). The oscillations between different flavour eigenstates are described by three mixing angles (θ12, θ23, θ13), two differences of the squared neutrino masses of the ν2/ν1 and ν3/ν1 pairs and a charge conjugation parity symmetry violating phase δCP. The Double Chooz experiment, located near the Chooz Electricité de France reactors, measures the oscillation parameter θ13 using reactor neutrinos. Here, the Double Chooz collaboration reports the measurement of the mixing angle θ13 with the new total neutron capture detection technique from the full data set, yielding sin2(2θ13) = 0.105 ± 0.014. This measurement exploits the multidetector configuration, the isoflux baseline and data recorded when the reactors were switched off. In addition to the neutrino mixing angle measurement, Double Chooz provides a precise measurement of the reactor neutrino flux, given by the mean cross-section per fission 〈σf〉 = (5.71 ± 0.06) × 10−43 cm2 per fission, and reports an empirical model of the distortion in the reactor neutrino spectrum.

Most tissues, animal brains in particular, comprise a mix of many cell types, with mounting evidence suggesting that neurons can recognize their respective types as they organize in space8–11. How cell diversity revises the current jamming paradigm is unknown. Here, in the brain of the flatworm planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, which exhibits remarkable tissue plasticity within a simple, quantifiable nervous system12–16, we identify a distinct packing state, ‘chromatic’ jamming. Combining experiments with computational modelling, we show that neurons of distinct types form independent percolating networks barring any physical contact. This jammed state emerges as cell packing configurations become constrained by cell type-specific interactions and therefore may extend to describe cell packing in similarly complex tissues composed of multiple cell types. An imaging study of planarian flatworm brains demonstrates that densely packed neural tissues seem to have packing configurations commensurate with a jammed state.},

  abstract     = {Spin liquids are highly correlated yet disordered states formed by the entanglement of magnetic dipoles1. Theories define such states using gauge fields and deconfined quasiparticle excitations that emerge from a local constraint governing the ground state of a frustrated magnet. For example, the ‘2-in–2-out’ ice rule for dipole moments on a tetrahedron can lead to a quantum spin ice2–4 in rare-earth pyrochlores. However, f-electron ions often carry multipole degrees of freedom of higher rank than dipoles, leading to intriguing behaviours and ‘hidden’ orders5,6. Here we show that the correlated ground state of a Ce3+-based pyrochlore, Ce2Sn2O7, is a quantum liquid of magnetic octupoles. Our neutron scattering results are consistent with a fluid-like state where degrees of freedom have a more complex magnetization density than that of magnetic dipoles. The nature and strength of the octupole–octupole couplings, together with the existence of a continuum of excitations attributed to spinons, provides further evidence for a quantum ice of octupoles governed by a ‘2-plus–2-minus’ rule7,8. Our work identifies Ce2Sn2O7 as a unique example of frustrated multipoles forming a ‘hidden’ topological order, thus generalizing observations on quantum spin liquids to multipolar phases that can support novel types of emergent fields and excitations. A detailed neutron-scattering study reveals a quantum spin liquid behaviour in Ce2Sn2O7 originating from its higher-order magnetic multipolar moments acting on the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore lattice.},

  abstract     = {The Verwey transition in magnetite (Fe3O4) is the first metal–insulator transition ever observed1 and involves a concomitant structural rearrangement and charge–orbital ordering. Owing to the complex interplay of these intertwined degrees of freedom, a complete characterization of the low-temperature phase of magnetite and the mechanism driving the transition have long remained elusive. It was demonstrated in recent years that the fundamental building blocks of the charge-ordered structure are three-site small polarons called trimerons2. However, electronic collective modes of this trimeron order have not been detected to date, and thus an understanding of the dynamics of the Verwey transition from an electronic point of view is still lacking. Here, we discover spectroscopic signatures of the low-energy electronic excitations of the trimeron network using terahertz light. By driving these modes coherently with an ultrashort laser pulse, we reveal their critical softening and hence demonstrate their direct involvement in the Verwey transition. These findings shed new light on the cooperative mechanism at the origin of magnetite’s exotic ground state. Spectroscopic study of the low-energy excitations in magnetite Fe3O4 shows the signatures of its charge-ordered structure involved in the metal–insulator transition, whose building blocks are the three-site small polarons, termed trimerons.},

Here we report the discovery of zero-energy bound states simultaneously appearing at both ends of a one-dimensional atomic line defect in monolayer iron-based high-temperature superconductor FeTe0.5Se0.5 films. The spectroscopic properties of the zero-energy bound states, including the temperature and tunnelling barrier dependences, as well as their fusion induced by coupling on line defects of different lengths are found to be robust and consistent with those of the Majorana zero modes. These observations suggest a realization of topological Shockley defects at the ends of an atomic line defect in a two-dimensional s-wave superconductor that can host a Kramers pair of Majorana zero modes protected by time-reversal symmetry along the chain. Our findings reveal a class of topological line defect excitations in two-dimensional superconductor FeTe0.5Se0.5 monolayer films and offer an advantageous platform for generating topological zero-energy excitations at higher operating temperatures, in a single material, and under zero external magnetic field. Bound states at zero energy are observed at the ends of a line defect formed of atomic vacancies on the surface of a high-temperature superconductor.

However, in striking contrast to the unconventional A phase of superfluid 3He where chiral symmetry was directly observed5, identification of broken time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, a key component of chiral symmetry, has presented a challenge in bulk materials. The two leading candidates for bulk chiral superconductors are UPt3 (refs. 6–8) and Sr2RuO4 (ref. 9), although evidence for broken time-reversal symmetry comes largely from surface-sensitive measurements. A long-sought demonstration of broken time-reversal symmetry in bulk Sr2RuO4 is the observation of edge currents, which has so far not been successful10. The situation for UPt3 is not much better. Here, we use vortices to probe the superconducting state in ultraclean crystals of UPt3. Using small-angle neutron scattering, a strictly bulk probe, we demonstrate that the vortices possess an internal degree of freedom in one of its three superconducting phases, providing direct evidence for bulk broken time-reversal symmetry in this material. Small-angle neutron scattering measurements show that the vortices of the heavy-fermion compound UPt3 possess an internal degree of freedom in one of its three superconducting phases, implying the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in the bulk.},

In the present study, we report the coexistence of superconductivity and the quantum spin Hall edge state in a van der Waals heterostructure, by placing a monolayer of 1T′-WTe2, a quantum spin Hall insulator1–3, on a van der Waals superconductor, NbSe2. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we demonstrate that the WTe2 monolayer exhibits a proximity-induced superconducting gap due to the underlying superconductor and that the spectroscopic features of the quantum spin Hall edge state remain intact. Taken together, these observations provide conclusive evidence for proximity-induced superconductivity in the quantum spin Hall edge state in WTe2, a crucial step towards realizing 1D topological superconductivity and Majorana bound states in this van der Waals material platform. One way of producing Majorana fermions for topological quantum computing is to induce superconductivity in other topological states.

  abstract     = {Electron–electron interactions play an important role in graphene and related systems and can induce exotic quantum states, especially in a stacked bilayer with a small twist angle1–7. For bilayer graphene where the two layers are twisted by the ‘magic angle’, flat band and strong many-body effects lead to correlated insulating states and superconductivity4–7. In contrast to monolayer graphene, the band structure of untwisted bilayer graphene can be further tuned by a displacement field8–10, providing an extra degree of freedom to control the flat band that should appear when two bilayers are stacked on top of each other. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of displacement field-tunable electronic phases in twisted double bilayer graphene. We observe insulating states at a half-filled conduction band in an intermediate range of displacement fields. Furthermore, the resistance gap in the correlated insulator increases with respect to the in-plane magnetic fields and we find that the g factor, according to the spin Zeeman effect, is ~2, indicating spin polarization at half-filling. These results establish twisted double bilayer graphene as an easily tunable platform for exploring quantum many-body states. Placing two Bernal-stacked graphene bilayers on top of each other with a small twist angle gives correlated states. As the band structure can be tuned by an electric field, this platform is a more varied setting to study correlated electrons.},

  abstract     = {The Scanning Quantum Cryogenic Atom Microscope (SQCRAMscope) uses an atomic Bose–Einstein condensate to measure magnetic fields emanating from solid-state samples. The quantum sensor does so with unprecedented d.c. sensitivity at micrometre resolution, from room to cryogenic temperatures1. An additional advantage of the SQCRAMscope is the preservation of optical access to the sample so that magnetometry imaging of, for example, electron transport may be performed in concert with other imaging techniques. Here, we apply this multimodal imaging capability to the study of nematicity in iron pnictide high-temperature superconductors, where the relationship between electronic and structural symmetry breaking resulting in a nematic phase is under debate2. We combine the SQCRAMscope with an in situ microscope that measures optical birefringence near the surface. This enables simultaneous and spatially resolved detection of both bulk and near-surface manifestations of nematicity via transport and structural deformation channels, respectively. By performing local measurements of emergent resistivity anisotropy in iron pnictides, we observe sharp, nearly concurrent transport and structural transitions. More broadly, these measurements demonstrate the SQCRAMscope’s ability to reveal important insights into the physics of complex quantum materials. A trapped quantum gas and optical microscopy are simultaneously employed to measure the nematicity of an iron-based superconductor. This demonstrates the potential of quantum gases to be used for scanning microscopy of quantum materials.},

  abstract     = {A quantum system interacts with its environment—if ever so slightly—no matter how much care is put into isolating it1. Therefore, quantum bits undergo errors, putting dauntingly difficult constraints on the hardware suitable for quantum computation2. New strategies are emerging to circumvent this problem by encoding a quantum bit non-locally across the phase space of a physical system. Because most sources of decoherence result from local fluctuations, the foundational promise is to exponentially suppress errors by increasing a measure of this non-locality3,4. Prominent examples are topological quantum bits, which delocalize information over real space and where spatial extent measures non-locality. Here, we encode a quantum bit in the field quadrature space of a superconducting resonator endowed with a special mechanism that dissipates photons in pairs5,6. This process pins down two computational states to separate locations in phase space. By increasing this separation, we measure an exponential decrease of the bit-flip rate while only linearly increasing the phase-flip rate7. Because bit-flips are autonomously corrected, only phase-flips remain to be corrected via a one-dimensional quantum error correction code. This exponential scaling demonstrates that resonators with nonlinear dissipation are promising building blocks for quantum computation with drastically reduced hardware overhead8. The choice of the physical system that represents a qubit can help reduce errors. Encoding them in the quadrature space of a superconducting resonator leads to exponentially reduced bit-flip rates, while phase-flip errors increase only linearly.},

  abstract     = {We report on the dynamics of collective alignment in groups of the cichlid fish Etroplus suratensis. Focusing on small- to intermediate-sized groups (10 ≲ N ≲ 100), we demonstrate that schooling (highly polarized and coherent motion) is noise induced, arising from the intrinsic stochasticity associated with finite numbers of interacting fish. The fewer the fish, the greater the (multiplicative) noise and therefore the greater the likelihood of alignment. Such rare empirical evidence tightly constrains the possible underlying interactions that govern fish alignment, suggesting that E. suratensis either spontaneously change their direction or copy the direction of another fish, without any local averaging (the otherwise canonical mechanism of collective alignment). Our study therefore highlights the importance of stochasticity in behavioural inference. Furthermore, rather than simply obscuring otherwise deterministic dynamics, noise can be fundamental to the characterization of emergent collective behaviours. Groups of fish tend to move in an organized fashion. Here the authors investigate the behaviour of schools of freshwater fish and find that schooling is induced by noise; the smaller the group size, the greater the noise and hence the greater the alignment.},

  abstract     = {Active matter exhibits remarkable collective behaviour in which flows, continuously generated by active particles, are intertwined with the orientational order of these particles. The relationship remains poorly understood as the activity and order are difficult to control independently. Here we demonstrate important facets of this interplay by exploring the dynamics of swimming bacteria in a liquid crystalline environment with predesigned periodic splay and bend in molecular orientation. The bacteria are expelled from the bend regions and condense into polar jets that propagate and transport cargo unidirectionally along the splay regions. The bacterial jets remain stable even when the local concentration exceeds the threshold of bending instability in a non-patterned system. Collective polar propulsion and the different roles of bend and splay are explained by an advection–diffusion model and by numerical simulations that treat the system as a two-phase active nematic. The ability of prepatterned liquid crystalline medium to streamline the chaotic movements of swimming bacteria into polar jets that can carry cargo along a predesigned trajectory opens the door for potential applications in microscale delivery and soft microrobotics. The relationship between the dynamics and spatial order of active matter gives rise to a rich phenomenology that is not fully understood. A study of bacteria swimming in a patterned liquid crystalline environment is a case in point, and provides a way to streamline the chaotic movements of swimming bacteria into polar jets.},

  abstract     = {A passive solid cannot do work on its surroundings through any quasistatic cycle of deformations. This property places strong constraints on the allowed elastic moduli. In this Article, we show that static elastic moduli altogether absent in passive elasticity can arise from active, non-conservative microscopic interactions. These active moduli enter the antisymmetric (or odd) part of the static elastic modulus tensor and quantify the amount of work extracted along quasistatic strain cycles. In two-dimensional isotropic media, two chiral odd-elastic moduli emerge in addition to the bulk and shear moduli. We discuss microscopic realizations that include networks of Hookean springs augmented with active transverse forces and non-reciprocal active hinges. Using coarse-grained microscopic models, numerical simulations and continuum equations, we uncover phenomena ranging from auxetic behaviour induced by odd moduli to elastic wave propagation in overdamped media enabled by self-sustained active strain cycles. Our work sheds light on the non-Hermitian mechanics of two- and three-dimensional active solids that conserve linear momentum but exhibit a non-reciprocal linear response. Active, non-conservative interactions can give rise to elastic moduli that are forbidden in equilibrium and enter the antisymmetric part of the stiffness tensor. The resulting solids function as distributed elastic engines that can perform work on their surroundings through quasistatic strain cycles.},

  abstract     = {Spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter that challenge Landau’s paradigm of symmetry-breaking phase transitions. Despite strong exchange interactions, spins do not order or freeze down to zero temperature. Although well established for one-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets, in higher dimensions where quantum fluctuations are less acute, realizing and understanding such states is a major issue, both theoretically and experimentally. In this regard, the simplest nearest-neighbour Heisenberg antiferromagnet Hamiltonian on the highly frustrated kagome lattice has proven to be a fascinating and inspiring model. The exact nature of its ground state remains elusive and the existence of a spin-gap is the first key issue to be addressed to discriminate between the various classes of proposed spin liquids. Here, through low-temperature NMR contrast experiments on high-quality single crystals, we single out the kagome susceptibility and the corresponding dynamics in the kagome archetype, the mineral herbertsmithite, ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2. We firmly conclude that this material does not harbour any spin-gap, which restores a convergence with recent numerical results promoting a gapless Dirac spin liquid as the ground state of the Heisenberg kagome antiferromagnet. Herbertsmithite is an experimental realization of the so-called quantum kagome antiferromagnet, a system that is predicted to host a spin liquid state down to zero temperature. Detailed NMR measurements now confirm that this is the case, and that its ground state is indeed gapless.},

  abstract     = {Singularities of open systems, known as exceptional points (EPs), have been shown to exhibit increased sensitivities, but the observation of EPs has so far been limited to wavelength-scaled systems subject to the diffraction limit. Plasmons, the collective oscillations of free electrons coupled to photons, shrink the wavelength of light to electronic and molecular length scales. We propose a novel approach to EPs based on spatial symmetry breaking and report their observation in plasmonics at room temperature. The plasmonic EPs are based on the hybridization of detuned resonances in multilayered plasmonic structures to reach a critical complex coupling rate between nanoantenna arrays, resulting in the simultaneous coalescence of the resonances and loss rates. Their utility as sensors of anti-immunoglobulin G, the most abundant immunoglobulin isotype in human serum, is evaluated. Our work opens the way to a new class of nanoscale devices, sensors and imagers based on topological polaritonic effects. The hybridized modes of an asymmetric plasmonic dimer show avoided crossing of both the real and imaginary parts. This can lead to plasmonic exceptional points, which are used for biosensing with very high sensitivity.},

  abstract     = {Universality is a principle that fundamentally underlies many critical phenomena, ranging from epidemic spreading to the emergence or breakdown of global connectivity in networks. Percolation, the transition to global connectedness on gradual addition of links, may exhibit substantial gaps in the size of the largest connected network component. We uncover that the largest gap statistics is governed by extreme-value theory. This allows us to unify continuous and discontinuous percolation by virtue of universal critical scaling functions, obtained from normal and extreme-value statistics. Specifically, we show that the universal scaling function of the size of the largest gap is given by the extreme-value Gumbel distribution. This links extreme-value statistics to universality and criticality in percolation. Percolation transitions underpin a generic class of phenomena associated with the degree of connectedness in networks. A detailed numerical study now uncovers a universal scaling in the size of the largest cluster identified in such percolation models.},

  abstract     = {Despite decades of theoretical studies, the nature of the glass transition remains elusive and debated, while the existence of structural predictors of its dynamics is a major open question. Recent approaches propose inferring predictors from a variety of human-defined features using machine learning. Here we determine the long-time evolution of a glassy system solely from the initial particle positions and without any handcrafted features, using graph neural networks as a powerful model. We show that this method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, generalizing over a wide range of temperatures, pressures and densities. In shear experiments, it predicts the locations of rearranging particles. The structural predictors learned by our network exhibit a correlation length that increases with larger timescales to reach the size of our system. Beyond glasses, our method could apply to many other physical systems that map to a graph of local interaction. The physics that underlies the glass transition is both subtle and non-trivial. A machine learning approach based on graph networks is now shown to accurately predict the dynamics of glasses over a wide range of temperatures, pressures and densities.},

  abstract     = {The spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry in periodically driven quantum systems leads to a new phase of matter: the discrete time crystal (DTC). This phase exhibits collective subharmonic oscillations that depend upon an interplay of non-equilibrium driving, many-body interactions and the breakdown of ergodicity. However, subharmonic responses are also a well-known feature of classical dynamical systems ranging from predator–prey models to Faraday waves and a.c.-driven charge density waves. This raises the question of whether these classical phenomena display the same rigidity characteristic of a quantum DTC. In this work, we explore this question in the context of periodically driven Hamiltonian dynamics coupled to a finite-temperature bath, which provides both friction and, crucially, noise. Focusing on one-dimensional chains, where in equilibrium any transition would be forbidden at finite temperature, we provide evidence that the combination of noise and interactions drives a sharp, first-order dynamical phase transition between a discrete time-translation invariant phase and an activated classical discrete time crystal (CDTC) in which time-translation symmetry is broken out to exponentially long timescales. Power-law correlations are present along a first-order line, which terminates at a critical point. We analyse the transition by mapping it to the locked-to-sliding transition of a d.c.-driven charge density wave. Finally, building upon results from the field of probabilistic cellular automata, we conjecture the existence of classical time crystals with true long-range order, where time-translation symmetry is broken out to infinite times. The phenomenon of many-body localization gives rise to entirely new phases of quantum matter when it is driven away from equilibrium. A numerical study now shows that one of these phases—the discrete time crystal—can also occur in a classical spin chain.},

  abstract     = {Physically realized electron gas systems usually reside in either the quantum non-degenerate or fully degenerate limit, where the average de Broglie wavelength of the thermal electrons becomes comparable with the interparticle distance between electrons. A few systems, such as young brown dwarfs and the cold dense fuels created in imploded cryogenic capsules at the National Ignition Facility, lie between these two limits and are partially degenerate. The National Ignition Facility has the unique capability of varying the electron quantum degeneracy by adjusting the laser drive used to implode the capsules. This allows experimental studies of the effects of the degeneracy level on plasma transport properties. By measuring rare nuclear reactions in these cold dense fuels, we show that the electron stopping power, which is the rate of energy loss per unit distance travelled by a charged particle, changes with increasing electron density. We observe a quantum-induced shift in the peak of the stopping power using diagnostics that measure above and below this peak. The observed changes in the stopping power are shown to be unique to the transition region between non-degenerate and degenerate plasmas. Our results support the screening models applied to partially degenerate astrophysical systems such as young brown dwarfs. Transitions between non-degenerate and degenerate plasma are observed in laser-driven implosions of cryogenic capsules at the National Ignition Facility. The observed partially degenerate regime is relevant to the physics of young brown dwarfs.},

Contrarily, biological agents such as Ebola or measles are typically thought to spread as simple contagions2. Here, we demonstrate that these different spreading mechanisms can have indistinguishable population-level dynamics once multiple contagions interact. In the social context, our results highlight the challenge of identifying and quantifying spreading mechanisms, such as social reinforcement3, in a world where an innumerable number of ideas, memes and behaviours interact. In the biological context, this parallel allows the use of complex contagions to effectively quantify the non-trivial interactions of infectious diseases. Knowledge of the spreading mechanisms of contagions is important for understanding a range of epidemiological and social problems. A study now shows that so-called simple and complex contagions cannot be told apart if there is more than one simple contagion traversing the population at the same time.},

Biological phase separation features activity7, complex compositions8 and elasticity9, which reveal important gaps in our understanding of this universal physical phenomenon. Here, we explore the impact of elasticity on phase separation in synthetic polymer networks. We show that compressive stresses in a polymer network can suppress phase separation of the solvent that swells it, stabilizing mixtures well beyond the liquid–liquid phase-separation boundary. Network stresses also drive a new form of ripening, driven by transport of solute down stiffness gradients. This elastic ripening can be much faster than conventional Ostwald ripening driven by surface tension. In a process dubbed elastic ripening, compressive stresses in a polymer network are shown to suppress phase separation of the solvent that swells it, stabilizing mixtures well beyond the liquid–liquid phase separation boundary.},

This allows the demonstration of ultralow-threshold Brillouin lasing and strong phonon-mediated optical coupling. This form of strong coupling is a key capability for Brillouin-reconfigurable optical switches and circuits9,10, for photonic quantum interfaces11 and to generate synthetic electromagnetic fields12,13. While applicable to liquids quite generally, our demonstration uses superfluid helium. Configured as a Brillouin gyroscope14 this provides the prospect of measuring superfluid circulation with unprecedented precision, and exploring the rich physics of quantum fluid dynamics, from quantized vorticity to quantum turbulence15,16. Light-induced deformations in a film of superfluid helium covering an optical microresonator can greatly enhance Brillouin interactions, enabling strong coupling between counter-propagating modes as well as Brillouin lasing.},

Our results open up numerous opportunities, such as the exploration of atom–ion Feshbach resonances15,16, in analogy to neutral systems17. Cooling an atom–ion hybrid system and bringing it into the quantum regime is challenging owing to the unavoidable heating caused by atom–ion collisions.

However, the Standard Model leaves important questions unanswered, such as the nature of dark matter, the origin of the matter–antimatter asymmetry in the Universe, and the existence and hierarchy of neutrino masses. To address these questions and the origin of the newly discovered Higgs boson, high-energy colliders are required. Future generations of such machines must be versatile, as broad and powerful as possible with a capacity of unprecedented precision, sensitivity and energy reach. Here, we argue that the Future Circular Colliders offer unique opportunities, and discuss their physics motivation, key measurements, accelerator strategy, research and development status, and technical challenges. The Future Circular Collider integrated programme foresees operation in two stages: initially an electron–positron collider serving as a Higgs and electroweak factory running at different centre-of-mass energies, followed by a proton–proton collider at a collision energy of 100 TeV. The interplay between measurements at the two collider stages underscores the synergy of their physics potentials. The Future Circular Colliders are proposed as a future step after the Large Hadron Collider has stopped running. The first stage foresees collision of electron–positron pairs before a machine upgrade to allow proton–proton operation.},

This development is driven by the so-far negative results of searches for new particles with high masses at the Large Hadron Collider, and by theoretical attempts to account for neutrino masses and to solve cosmological puzzles such as dark matter, dark energy and the matter–antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Traditionally, CERN has hosted a wealth of accelerator and non-accelerator projects below the high-energy frontier, in which more than a thousand physicists are currently involved. The Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) study was launched three years ago to explore the future of this field. Here we give an overview of the various PBC proposals, ranging from explorations of the dark sector to precision measurements of strongly interacting processes. The methodology employed to compare the reach of those projects — based on a set of common benchmark models — has raised interest in the collider, neutrino and non-accelerator communities and may provide a comprehensive overview of how the parameter range for physics beyond the Standard Model should be explored in the worldwide context. Within the Physics Beyond Collider programme, complementary methods to high-energy frontier particle colliders to investigate the physics of elementary particles and their interactions are studied.},

  abstract     = {The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a proposed high-luminosity collider that would collide electrons with their antiparticles, positrons, at energies ranging from a few hundred giga-electronvolts to a few tera-electronvolts. By covering a large energy range and by ultimately reaching collision energies in the multi-tera-electronvolts range, scientists at CLIC aim to improve the understanding of nature’s fundamental building blocks and to discover new particles or other physics phenomena. CLIC is an international project hosted by CERN with 75 institutes worldwide participating in the accelerator, detector and physics studies. If commissioned, the first electron–positron collisions at CLIC are expected around 2035, following the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Here we survey the principal merits of CLIC, and examine the opportunities that arise as a result of its design. We argue that CLIC represents an attractive proposition for the next-generation particle collider by combining an innovative accelerator technology, a realistic delivery timescale, and a physics programme that is highly complementary to existing accelerators, reaching uncharted territory. The Compact Linear Collider is a proposed high-luminosity electron–positron collider that can reach TeV-scale energies. Its accelerator design and physics programme, mainly focusing on precision measurements and new physics searches, are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Particle physics experiments in the United States and Asia have greatly contributed to the understanding of elementary particles and their interactions. With the recent discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN, interest in the development of next-generation colliders has been rekindled. A linear electron–positron collider in Japan and a circular collider in China have been proposed for precision studies of the Higgs boson. In addition to the Higgs programme, new accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino mega-facilities are being built in the United States and Japan. Here, we outline the present status of key particle physics programmes at accelerators, and future plans in the United States and Asia that largely complement approaches being explored in the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update. We encourage the pursuit of this global approach, reaching beyond regional boundaries for optimized development and operations of major accelerator facilities worldwide, to ensure an active and productive future of the field. Proposals for the particle physics programmes in the United States and Asia are discussed; mainly the International Linear Collider in Japan, the Circular Electron–Positron Collider in China and accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino experiments in the United States.},

  abstract     = {Electrical signalling in biology is typically associated with action potentials—transient spikes in membrane voltage that return to baseline. Hodgkin–Huxley and related conductance-based models of electrophysiology belong to a more general class of reaction–diffusion equations that could, in principle, support the spontaneous emergence of patterns of membrane voltage that are stable in time but structured in space. Here, we show theoretically and experimentally that homogeneous or nearly homogeneous tissues can undergo spontaneous spatial symmetry breaking through a purely electrophysiological mechanism, leading to the formation of domains with different resting potentials separated by stable bioelectrical domain walls. Transitions from one resting potential to another can occur through long-range migration of these domain walls. We map bioelectrical domain wall motion using all-optical electrophysiology in an engineered cell line and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived myoblasts. Bioelectrical domain wall migration may occur during embryonic development and during physiological signalling processes in polarized tissues. These results demonstrate that nominally homogeneous tissues can undergo spontaneous bioelectrical spatial symmetry breaking. A detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of homogeneous cell tissues finds that they can undergo spontaneous spatial symmetry breaking through a purely electrophysiological mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Symmetry breaking—the phenomenon in which the symmetry of a system is not inherited by its stable states—underlies pattern formation, superconductivity and numerous other effects. Recent theoretical work has established the possibility of converse symmetry breaking, a phenomenon in which the stable states are symmetric only when the system itself is not. This includes scenarios in which interacting entities are required to be non-identical in order to exhibit identical behaviour, such as in reaching consensus. Here we present an experimental demonstration of this phenomenon. Using a network of alternating-current electromechanical oscillators, we show that their ability to achieve identical frequency synchronization is enhanced when the oscillators are tuned to be suitably non-identical and that converse symmetry breaking persists for a range of noise levels. These results have implications for the optimization and control of network dynamics in a broad class of systems whose function benefits from harnessing uniform behaviour. An experiment with three alternating-current generators demonstrates converse symmetry breaking—a phenomenon whereby the system achieves frequency synchronization when its component systems are tuned asymmetrically.},

  abstract     = {The electronic nematic phase—in which electronic degrees of freedom lower the crystal rotational symmetry—is commonly observed in high-temperature superconductors. However, understanding the role of nematicity and nematic fluctuations in Cooper pairing is often made more complicated by the coexistence of other orders, particularly long-range magnetic order. Here we report the enhancement of superconductivity in a model electronic nematic system that is not magnetic, and show that the enhancement is directly born out of strong nematic fluctuations associated with a quantum phase transition. We present measurements of the resistance as a function of strain in Ba1−xSrxNi2As2 to show that strontium substitution promotes an electronically driven nematic order in this system. In addition, the complete suppression of that order to absolute zero temperature leads to an enhancement of the pairing strength, as evidenced by a sixfold increase in the superconducting transition temperature. The direct relation between enhanced pairing and nematic fluctuations in this model system, as well as the interplay with a unidirectional charge-density-wave order comparable to that found in the cuprates, offers a means to investigate the role of nematicity in strengthening superconductivity. Transport measurements show that nematic fluctuations near a phase transition increase the temperature at which superconductivity occurs by a factor of nearly six. This happens in a non-magnetic nickel-based compound.},

In this context, by employing near-infrared single-cycle pulse pairs, we measure interferometric autocorrelations of the ultrafast currents induced by optical field emission at the nanogap of a single plasmonic nanocircuit. The dynamics of this ultrafast electron nanotransport depends on the precise temporal field profile of the optical driving pulse. Current autocorrelations are acquired with sub-femtosecond temporal resolution as a function of both pulse delay and absolute carrier-envelope phase. Quantitative modelling of the experiments enables us to monitor the spatiotemporal evolution of the electron density and currents induced in the system and to elucidate the physics underlying the electron transfer driven by strong optical fields in plasmonic gaps. Specifically, we clarify the interplay between the carrier-envelope phase of the driving pulse, plasmonic resonance and quiver motion. Single-cycle interferometric autocorrelation measurements of electrons tunnelling across the gap of a plasmonic bowtie antenna and quantitative models provide insight into the physical interactions that drive the electron transfer.},

Recently, there has been great interest in exceptional points, a type of spectral singularity that could be reached by tuning various parameters in open systems, to render unusual features to the physical systems, such as optical states with chirality. Here we theoretically and experimentally study transparency and absorption modulated by chiral optical states at exceptional points in an indirectly coupled resonator system. By tuning one resonator to an exceptional point, transparency or absorption occurs depending on the chirality of the eigenstate. Our results demonstrate a new strategy to manipulate the light flow and the spectra of a photonic resonator system by exploiting a discrete optical state associated with a specific chirality at an exceptional point as a unique control bit. Such an approach is compatible with the state control utilized in quantum gate operation and may open up new avenues for controlling slow light using optical states for optical quantum memory and computing. The optical analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency and absorption can be modulated by chiral optical states at an exceptional point, which is shown in a system of indirectly coupled microresonators.},

  abstract     = {Echoes occur in many physical systems, typically in inhomogeneously broadened ensembles of nonlinear objects. They are often used to eliminate the effects of dephasing caused by interactions with the environment as well as to enable the observation of proper, inherent object properties. Here, we report the experimental observation of quantum wave-packet echoes in a single, isolated molecule. The entire dephasing–rephasing cycle occurs without any inhomogeneous spread of molecular properties, or any interaction with the environment, and offers a way to probe the internal coherent dynamics of single molecules. In our experiments, we impulsively excite a vibrational wave packet in an anharmonic molecular potential and observe its oscillations and eventual dispersion with time. A second, delayed pulse gives rise to an echo—a partial recovery of the initial coherent oscillations. The vibrational dynamics of single molecules is visualized by a time-delayed probe pulse dissociating them, one at a time. Two mechanisms for the echo formation are discussed: a.c. Stark-induced molecular potential shaking and creation of a depletion-induced ‘hole’ in the nuclear spatial distribution. The single-molecule wave-packet echoes may lead to the development of new tools for probing ultrafast intramolecular processes in various molecules. Following an impulsive laser excitation of a single molecule, a dispersed vibrational wave-packet is partially rephased by a second pulse, and a wave-packet echo is observed. This wave-packet echo probes ultrafast intramolecular processes in the isolated molecule.},

  abstract     = {A promising route towards the demonstration of near-term quantum advantage (or supremacy) over classical systems relies on running tailored quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum machines. These algorithms typically involve sampling from probability distributions that—under plausible complexity-theoretic conjectures—cannot be efficiently generated classically. Rather than determining the computational features of output states produced by a given physical system, we investigate what features of the generating system can be efficiently learnt given direct access to an output state. To tackle this question, here we introduce the variational quantum unsampling protocol, a nonlinear quantum neural network approach for verification and inference of near-term quantum circuit outputs. In our approach, one can variationally train a quantum operation to unravel the action of an unknown unitary on a known input state, essentially learning the inverse of the black-box quantum dynamics. While the principle of our approach is platform independent, its implementation will depend on the unique architecture of a specific quantum processor. We experimentally demonstrate the variational quantum unsampling protocol on a quantum photonic processor. Alongside quantum verification, our protocol has broad applications, including optimal quantum measurement and tomography, quantum sensing and imaging, and ansatz validation. The variational quantum unsampling protocol provides a way to realize verification and inference of near-term quantum circuit outputs. This protocol is then experimentally verified on a quantum photonic processor.},

  abstract     = {Space storms1 are the dominant contributor to space weather. During storms, rearrangement of the solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field lines at the dayside enhances global plasma circulation in the magnetosphere2,3. As this circulation proceeds, energy is dissipated into heat in the ionosphere and near-Earth space. As Earth’s dayside magnetic flux is eroded during this process, magnetotail reconnection must occur to replenish it. However, whether dissipation is powered by magnetotail (nightside) reconnection, as in storms’ weaker but more commonplace relatives, substorms4,5, or by enhanced global plasma circulation driven by dayside reconnection is unknown. Here we show that magnetotail reconnection near geosynchronous orbit powered an intense storm. Near-Earth reconnection at geocentric distances of ~6.6–10 Earth radii—probably driven by the enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure and southward magnetic field—is observed from multi-satellite data. In this region, magnetic reconnection was expected to be suppressed by Earth’s strong dipole field. Revealing the physical processes that power storms and the solar wind conditions responsible for them opens a new window into our understanding of space storms. It encourages future exploration of the storm-time equatorial near-Earth magnetotail to refine storm driver models and accelerate progress towards space weather prediction. Magnetic reconnection in the near-Earth magnetotail is observed to power a space storm, although suppression of magnetic reconnection caused by the Earth’s magnetic dipole was expected close to Earth.},

Here, we tested whether dynein, a minus-end-directed microtubule (MT) motor2, can harness energy from these fluctuations using optical trapping in vitro. We show that dynein forms an asymmetric slip bond with MTs, where its detachment rate increases more slowly under hindering forces than assisting forces. This asymmetry enables dynein to generate unidirectional motility towards the minus-end from force fluctuations. Consistent with our model, oscillatory forces exerted by the trap drive dynein stepping without net force and ATP. Dynein is capable of ratcheting towards the minus-end, even when the net force is in the plus-end direction. With ATP, force oscillations increase the velocity and stall force of dynein as it transports cargos and glides MTs. Therefore, dynein is a mechanical ratchet that rectifies cytoskeletal fluctuations to move faster and resists higher forces along MTs. The motor protein dynein is associated with microtubule force generation in the cell; how it interacts with cytoskeletal fluctuations is still an open question. Here the authors show that dynein can harness these fluctuations to generate power and move faster towards the minus-end of microtubules.},

We uncover the distinct mechanical signature of topological defects using experiments and simulations, and leverage this to design complex metamaterials in which external forces steer deformations and stresses towards complementary parts of the system. Our work presents a new avenue to systematically including spatial complexity, frustration and topology in mechanical metamaterials. In natural materials, defects determine many properties.

Along with the condensation, an efficient exciton polariton quantum simulator9 would require a strong lattice with robust polariton trapping as well as strong intersite coupling to allow coherent quantum motion of polaritons within the lattice. A strong lattice can be characterized with a larger forbidden bandgap opening and a larger lattice bandwidth compared with the linewidth. However, exciton polaritons in such strong lattices have only been shown to condense at cryogenic temperatures3–8. Here, we report the observation of non-equilibrium exciton polariton condensation in a one-dimensional strong lead halide perovskite lattice at room temperature. Modulated by deep periodic potentials, the strong lead halide perovskite lattice exhibits a large forbidden bandgap opening up to 13.3 meV and a lattice band up to 8.5 meV wide, which are at least 10 times larger than previous systems. Above a critical density, we observe polariton condensation into py orbital states with long-range spatial coherence at room temperature. Our result opens the route to the implementation of polariton condensates in quantum simulators at room temperature. Non-equilibrium Bose–Einstein condensation of exciton polaritons in chains of lead halide perovskite pillars can occur at room temperature. These condensates have long spatial coherence.},

A long-standing issue is how the superconducting pairing is formed and condensed in the strange metal phase, because this is where the superconducting transition temperature is highest. Here, we use state-of-the-art high-pressure measurements to report the experimental observation of a pressure-induced crossover from two- to three-dimensional (2D to 3D) superconducting states in optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + δ bulk superconductor. By analysing the temperature dependence of the resistance, we find that the 2D superconducting transition exhibits a Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless-like behaviour10. The emergence of this 2D superconducting transition provides direct evidence that the strange metal state is predominantly 2D-like. This is important for a thorough understanding of the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors. Applying pressure to a cuprate reveals that the strange metal phase has a two-dimensional character, as shown by emerging Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless behaviour.},

  abstract     = {In the context of correlated insulators, where electron–electron interactions (U) drive the localization of charge carriers, the metal–insulator transition is described as either bandwidth- or filling-controlled1. Motivated by the challenge of the insulating phase in Sr2IrO4, a new class of correlated insulators has been proposed, in which spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is believed to renormalize the bandwidth of the half-filled jeff = 1/2 doublet, allowing a modest U to induce a charge-localized phase2,3. Although this framework has been tacitly assumed, a thorough characterization of the ground state has been elusive4,5. Furthermore, direct evidence for the role of SOC in stabilizing the insulating state has not been established, because previous attempts at revealing the role of SOC6,7 have been hindered by concurrently occurring changes to the filling8–10. We overcome this challenge by employing multiple substituents that introduce well-defined changes to the signatures of SOC and carrier concentration in the electronic structure, as well as a new methodology that allows us to monitor SOC directly. Specifically, we study Sr2Ir1−xTxO4 (T = Ru, Rh) by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, combined with ab initio and supercell tight-binding calculations. This allows us to distinguish relativistic and filling effects, thereby establishing conclusively the central role of SOC in stabilizing the insulating state of Sr2IrO4. Most importantly, we estimate the critical value for SOC in this system to be λc = 0.42 ± 0.01 eV, and provide the first demonstration of a spin–orbit-controlled metal–insulator transition. A combined ARPES and DFT study of Ru- and Rh-substituted samples of Sr2IrO4 reveals a collapse of its correlated insulating phase that is controlled by spin–orbit coupling.},

  abstract     = {Topological insulators are bulk semiconductors that manifest in-gap surface states with massless Dirac-like dispersion due to the topological bulk-boundary correspondence principle1–3. These surface states can be manipulated by the interface environment to display various emergent phenomena4–11. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy to investigate the interplay of crystallographic inhomogeneity with the topologically ordered band structure in a model topological insulator. We develop quantitative analysis methods to obtain spectroscopic information, in spite of a limited dwell time on each measured point. We find that the band energies vary on the scale of 50 meV across the sample surface, and this enables single sample measurements that are analogous to a multi-sample doping series. By focusing separately on the bulk and surface electrons we reveal a hybridization-like interplay between fluctuations in the surface and bulk state energetics. The authors develop a high-spatial-resolution photoemission technique to show variation of the energy of the Dirac point of approximately 50 meV. They also find an interplay between bulk and surface states.},

Recently, it was realized that the sensing performances of multiple spatially distributed parameters may also be enhanced through the use of an entangled quantum network3–10. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how sensing of an averaged phase shift among four distributed nodes benefits from an entangled quantum network. Using a four-mode entangled continuous-variable state, we demonstrate deterministic quantum phase sensing with a precision beyond what is attainable with separable probes. The techniques behind this result can have direct applications in a number of areas ranging from molecular tracking to quantum networks of atomic clocks. Experiments demonstrate quantum phase sensing with a four-mode entangled state, reaching a measurement precision that is beyond what can be achieved by separate individual probes.},

There are, however, fundamental obstacles to overcome — in vacuum, photons not only lack mass, but also do not naturally interact with one another. Here, we review how the superconducting quantum circuit platform has been harnessed in the last decade to make some of the first materials from light. We describe the structures that are used to imbue individual microwave photons with matter-like properties such as mass, the nonlinear elements that mediate interactions between these photons, and quantum dynamic/thermodynamic approaches that can be used to assemble and stabilize strongly correlated states of many photons. We then describe state-of-the-art techniques to generate synthetic magnetic fields, engineer topological and non-topological flat bands and explore the physics of quantum materials in non-Euclidean geometries — directions that we view as some of the most exciting for this burgeoning field. Finally, we discuss upcoming prospects, and in particular opportunities to probe novel aspects of quantum thermalization and detect quasi-particles with exotic anyonic statistics, as well as potential applications in quantum information science.

  abstract     = {The rise of quantum information science has provided new perspectives on quantum mechanics, as well as a common language for quantum engineering. The focus on platforms for the manipulation and processing of quantum information bridges between different research areas in physics as well as other disciplines. Such a crossover between borders is well embodied by the development of hybrid quantum systems, where heterogeneous physical systems are combined to leverage their individual strengths for the implementation of novel functionalities. In the microwave domain, the hybridization of various quantum degrees of freedom has been tremendously helped by superconducting quantum circuits, owing to their large zero-point field fluctuations, small dissipation, strong nonlinearity and design flexibility. These efforts take place by expanding the framework of circuit quantum electrodynamics. Here, we review recent research on the creation of hybrid quantum systems based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, encompassing mechanical oscillators, quantum acoustodynamics with surface acoustic waves, quantum magnonics and coupling between superconducting circuits and ensembles or single spins. Hybrid quantum systems combine heterogeneous physical systems for the implementation of new functionalities at the quantum level.

  abstract     = {Since the first observation of coherent quantum behaviour in a superconducting qubit, now more than 20 years ago, there have been substantial developments in the field of superconducting quantum circuits. One such advance is the introduction of the concepts of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to superconducting circuits, to yield what is now known as circuit QED. This approach realizes in a single architecture the essential requirements for quantum computation, and has already been used to run simple quantum algorithms and to operate tens of superconducting qubits simultaneously. For these reasons, circuit QED is one of the leading architectures for quantum computation. In parallel to these advances towards quantum information processing, circuit QED offers new opportunities for the exploration of the rich physics of quantum optics in novel parameter regimes in which strongly nonlinear effects are readily visible at the level of individual microwave photons. We review circuit QED in the context of quantum information processing and quantum optics, and discuss some of the challenges on the road towards scalable quantum computation. The introduction of concepts from cavity quantum electrodynamics to superconducting circuits yielded circuit quantum electrodynamics, a platform eminently suitable to quantum information processing and for the exploration of novel regimes in quantum optics.},

It is thus concerned with the investigation of phenomena that arise from the coupling between the simplest non-trivial quantum system — a spin-1/2 or qubit — and a harmonic oscillator. As such, circuit quantum electrodynamics belongs to the more general field of cavity quantum electrodynamics, which deals with natural or artificial spins in the optical, microwave or radio-frequency domains interacting with all kind of resonators. Here we survey the lineage of the concepts and experiments that led first to the development of cavity and then circuit quantum electrodynamics. We discuss similarities and differences between these two fields and compare their present achievements.

  abstract     = {In protoplanetary disks, solid objects (so-called planetesimals) are formed from dust. Micrometre-sized dust grains grow into millimetre-sized aggregates. Once those aggregates have diameters exceeding a few centimetres, they become subject to concentration mechanisms such as the streaming instability, permitting the formation of self-gravitating clusters, which might eventually collapse into kilometre-sized planetesimals. However, for the streaming instability to set in, clumps spanning sizes from centimetres to decimetres are required in the centre of a protoplanetary disk. In the size range between millimetres and centimetres, aggregates bounce off each other rather than sticking together, and growth is stalled. Here we show in microgravity experiments that collisions between millimetre-sized grains lead to sufficient electrical charging for aggregation to bridge this gap between the bouncing barrier and the onset of the streaming instability. We computationally simulate aggregation and find that models agree with the experimental data only if electrical charging is present. We therefore propose that collisional charging may promote early growth in the size gap that current models of planetesimal formation cannot account for. In our understanding of planetary formation, it is still unclear how millimetre-sized dust grains grow into centimetre-sized aggregates. Microgravity experiments now show that electrical charging of the grains leads to the formation of larger clumps.},

Recent advances in van der Waals material synthesis enable the exploration of Mott systems in the two-dimensional limit. Here we report characterization of the local electronic properties of single- and few-layer 1T-TaSe2 via spatial- and momentum-resolved spectroscopy involving scanning tunnelling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission. Our results indicate that electron correlation induces a robust Mott insulator state in single-layer 1T-TaSe2 that is accompanied by unusual orbital texture. Interlayer coupling weakens the insulating phase, as shown by reduction of the energy gap and quenching of the correlation-driven orbital texture in bilayer and trilayer 1T-TaSe2. This establishes single-layer 1T-TaSe2 as a useful platform for investigating strong correlation physics in two dimensions. The electrons that contribute to the Mott insulator state in single-layer 1T-TaSe2 are shown to also have a rich variation in their orbital occupation. As more layers are added, both the insulating state and orbital texture weaken.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting circuits extensively rely on the Josephson junction as a nonlinear electronic element for manipulating quantum information and mediating photon interactions. Despite continuing efforts in pushing the coherence of Josephson circuits, the best photon lifetimes have been demonstrated in microwave cavities. Nevertheless, architectures based on quantum memories require a qubit element for logical operations at the cost of introducing additional loss channels and limiting process fidelities. Here, we directly operate the oscillator as an isolated two-level system by tailoring its Hilbert space. Implementing a flux-tunable inductive coupling between two resonators, we can selectively Rabi drive the lowest eigenstates by dynamically activating a three-wave interaction through parametric flux modulation. Measuring the Wigner function confirms that we can prepare arbitrary states confined in the single-photon manifold, with measured coherence times limited by the oscillator intrinsic quality factor. This architectural shift in engineering oscillators with stimulated nonlinearity can be exploited for designing long-lived quantum modules and offers flexibility in studying non-equilibrium physics with photons in a field-programmable simulator. A flux-tunable inductive coupling between two microwave superconducting resonators allows the operation of one of them as a two-level system. The lifetime is limited by the oscillator’s quality factor, offering potential for highly coherent qubits.},

  abstract     = {The accurate computation of Hamiltonian ground, excited and thermal states on quantum computers stands to impact many problems in the physical and computer sciences, from quantum simulation to machine learning. Given the challenges posed in constructing large-scale quantum computers, these tasks should be carried out in a resource-efficient way. In this regard, existing techniques based on phase estimation or variational algorithms display potential disadvantages; phase estimation requires deep circuits with ancillae, that are hard to execute reliably without error correction, while variational algorithms, while flexible with respect to circuit depth, entail additional high-dimensional classical optimization. Here, we introduce the quantum imaginary time evolution and quantum Lanczos algorithms, which are analogues of classical algorithms for finding ground and excited states. Compared with their classical counterparts, they require exponentially less space and time per iteration, and can be implemented without deep circuits and ancillae, or high-dimensional optimization. We furthermore discuss quantum imaginary time evolution as a subroutine to generate Gibbs averages through an analogue of minimally entangled typical thermal states. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of these algorithms via an implementation using exact classical emulation as well as through prototype circuits on the Rigetti quantum virtual machine and Aspen-1 quantum processing unit. The quantum imaginary time evolution and Lanczos algorithms offer a resource-efficient way to compute ground or excited states of target Hamiltonians on quantum computers. This offers promise for quantum simulation on near-term noisy devices.},

  abstract     = {Scrambling, a process in which quantum information spreads over a complex quantum system, becoming inaccessible to simple probes, occurs in generic chaotic quantum many-body systems, ranging from spin chains to metals and even to black holes. Scrambling can be measured using out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), which are closely tied to the growth of Heisenberg operators. We present a general method to calculate OTOCs of local operators in one-dimensional systems based on approximating Heisenberg operators as matrix product operators (MPOs). Contrary to the common belief that such tensor network methods work only at early times, we show that the entire early growth region of the OTOC can be captured using an MPO approximation with modest bond dimension. We analytically establish the goodness of the approximation by showing that, if an appropriate OTOC is close to its initial value, then the associated Heisenberg operator has low entanglement across a given cut. We use the method to study scrambling in a chaotic spin chain with $$201$$ sites. On the basis of these data and previous results, we conjecture a universal form for the dynamics of the OTOC near the wavefront. We show that this form collapses the chaotic spin chain data over more than 15 orders of magnitude. A general method is proposed to calculate the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) in one-dimensional systems. Motivated by the results obtained from its application to various systems, a universal form for the dynamics of OTOCs is conjectured.},

  abstract     = {The three-dimensional structure of nucleons (protons and neutrons) is embedded in so-called generalized parton distributions, which are accessible from deeply virtual Compton scattering. In this process, a high-energy electron is scattered off a nucleon by exchanging a virtual photon. Then, a highly energetic real photon is emitted from one of the quarks inside the nucleon, which carries information on the quark’s transverse position and longitudinal momentum. By measuring the cross-section of deeply virtual Compton scattering, Compton form factors related to the generalized parton distributions can be extracted. Here, we report the observation of unpolarized deeply virtual Compton scattering off a deuterium target. From the measured photon-electroproduction cross-sections, we have extracted the cross-section of a quasifree neutron and a coherent deuteron. Due to the approximate isospin symmetry of quantum chromodynamics, we can determine the contributions from the different quark flavours to the helicity-conserved Compton form factors by combining our measurements with previous ones probing the proton’s internal structure. These results advance our understanding of the description of the nucleon structure, which is important to solve the proton spin puzzle. The internal structure of the neutron has now been probed by highly energetic photons scattering off it. Combined with previous results for protons, these measurements reveal the contributions of quark flavours to the nucleon structure.},

Democratic elections are one such behaviour. Over the past few decades, physicists have explored scaling patterns in voting and the dynamics of political opinion formation (for example, see refs. 8–13). Here, we define the concepts of negative representation, in which a shift in electorate opinions produces a shift in the election outcome in the opposite direction, and electoral instability, in which an arbitrarily small change in electorate opinions can dramatically swing the election outcome, and prove that unstable elections necessarily contain negatively represented opinions. Furthermore, in the presence of low voter turnout, increasing polarization of the electorate can drive elections through a transition from a stable to an unstable regime, analogous to the phase transition by which some materials become ferromagnetic below their critical temperatures. Empirical data suggest that the United States’ presidential elections underwent such a phase transition in the 1970s and have since become increasingly unstable. In a mathematical model of democratic elections, electoral instability is shown to be linked to negative representation, which occurs when a shift in electoral opinions pushes the election outcome in the opposite direction.},

  abstract     = {The prediction that laser plasma heating distorts the electron distribution function away from Maxwellian and towards a super-Gaussian distribution dates back four decades1. In conditions relevant to inertial confinement fusion, however, no direct evidence of this so-called ‘Langdon effect’ has previously been observed. Here we present measurements of the spatially and temporally resolved Thomson scattering spectrum that indicate the presence of super-Gaussian electron distribution functions consistent with existing theory2. In such plasmas, ion acoustic wave frequencies increase monotonically with the super-Gaussian exponent3. Our results show that the measured power transfer between crossed laser beams mediated by ion acoustic waves requires a model that accounts for the non-Maxwellian electron distribution function, whereas the standard Maxwellian calculations overpredict power transfer over a wide region of parameter space. Including this effect is expected to improve the predictive capability of crossed-beam energy transfer modelling at the National Ignition Facility in California and may restore a larger operable design space for inertial confinement fusion experiments. This is also expected to motivate further inquiry in other areas affected by non-Maxwellian electron distribution functions, such as laser absorption, heat transport and X-ray spectroscopy. In inertial confinement fusion experiments, the effect of the overlapping laser beams on the plasma is predicted to lead to a distortion of the electron distribution function, which has now been observed in experiments.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical standards for measuring gas pressure up to 7 MPa based on a piston–cylinder system are known with relative uncertainties on the order of 1 ppm (ref. 1). The challenges in an experimental realization lie in determining the effective area of special pressure balances and in accounting for the pressure distortion. Comparisons of the mechanical pressure standard with independent methods to exclude sources of systematic uncertainty are currently available only around 0.1 MPa at the required uncertainty levels. Here, such an independent cross-check is performed up to 7 MPa based on electrical measurements of helium gas. Enabled by recent progress in ab initio calculations, pressure can be accessed through measurement of the dielectric constant. By using theoretical values for the polarizability and the virial coefficients of helium, the change in capacitance and hence the pressure can be determined up to 7 MPa. The relative uncertainty of this method is below 5 ppm and can serve as a new primary pressure standard complementary to the mechanical pressure standard. This answers the long-standing question whether a pressure standard based on capacitance measurements could be devised2. The measurement of the dielectric constant combined with ab initio calculations of the polarizability and the virial coefficient of helium provides a new primary pressure standard, which is complementary to the mechanical standard.},

  abstract     = {The performance of semiconductor devices is fundamentally governed by charge-carrier dynamics within the active materials1–6. Although advances have been made towards understanding these dynamics under steady-state conditions, the importance of non-equilibrium phenomena and their effect on device performances remains elusive7,8. In fact, the ballistic propagation of carriers is generally considered to not contribute to the mechanism of photovoltaics (PVs) and light-emitting diodes, as scattering rapidly disrupts such processes after carrier generation via photon absorption or electric injection9. Here we characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of carriers immediately after photon absorption in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite films using femtosecond transient absorption microscopy (fs-TAM) with a 10 fs temporal resolution and 10 nm spatial precision. We found that non-equilibrium carriers propagate ballistically over 150 nm within 20 fs of photon absorption. Our results suggest that in a typical perovskite PV device operating under standard conditions, a large fraction of carriers can reach the charge collection layers ballistically. The ballistic transport distance appears to be limited by energetic disorder within the materials, probably due to disorder-induced scattering. This provides a direct route towards optimization of the ballistic transport distance via improvements in materials and by minimizing the energetic disorder. Our observations reveal an unexplored regime of carrier transport in perovskites, which could have important consequences for device performance. Charge-carrier dynamics are fundamental to the operation and performance of semiconductor devices. In methylammonium lead iodide perovskites, carriers in the non-equilibrium regime after excitation propagate ballistically over 150 nm within 20 fs.},

  abstract     = {Although the recently predicted topological magnetoelectric effect 1 and the response to an electric charge that mimics an induced mirror magnetic monopole 2 are fundamental attributes of topological states of matter with broken time-reversal symmetry, so far they have not been directly observed in experiments. Using a SQUID-on-tip 3, acting simultaneously as a tunable scanning electric charge and as an ultrasensitive nanoscale magnetometer, we induce and directly image the microscopic currents generating the magnetic monopole response in a graphene quantum Hall electron system. We find a rich and complex nonlinear behaviour, governed by the coexistence of topological and non-topological equilibrium currents, that is not captured by the monopole models 2. Furthermore, by imaging the equilibrium currents of individual quantum Hall edge states, we reveal that the edge states, which are commonly assumed to carry only a chiral downstream current, in fact carry a pair of counterpropagating currents 4, in which the topological downstream current in the incompressible region is counterbalanced by a non-topological upstream current flowing in the adjacent compressible region. The intricate patterns of the counterpropagating equilibrium-state orbital currents provide insights into the microscopic origins of the topological and non-topological charge and energy flow in quantum Hall systems. The microscopic quantum Hall edge currents and the equilibrium currents that generate the mirror magnetic monopoles in time-reversal-symmetry-broken topological matter are directly imaged in the quantum Hall state in graphene by using a SQUID-on-tip.},

  abstract     = {When electrons in a solid are excited by light, they can alter the free energy landscape and access phases of matter that are out of reach in thermal equilibrium. This accessibility becomes important in the presence of phase competition, when one state of matter is preferred over another by only a small energy scale that, in principle, is surmountable by the excitation. Here, we study a layered compound, LaTe3, where a small lattice anisotropy in the a–c plane results in a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) along the c axis1,2. Using ultrafast electron diffraction, we find that, after photoexcitation, the CDW along the c axis is weakened and a different competing CDW along the a axis subsequently emerges. The timescales characterizing the relaxation of this new CDW and the reestablishment of the original CDW are nearly identical, which points towards a strong competition between the two orders. The new density wave represents a transient non-equilibrium phase of matter with no equilibrium counterpart, and this study thus provides a framework for discovering similar states of matter that are ‘trapped’ under equilibrium conditions. Short pulses of light shift the balance between two competing charge density wave phases, allowing the weaker one to manifest transiently while suppressing the stronger one. This shows that competing phases can be tuned in a non-equilibrium setting.},

  abstract     = {Partially filled Landau levels host competing electronic orders. For example, electron solids may prevail close to integer filling of the Landau levels before giving way to fractional quantum Hall liquids at higher carrier density1,2. Here, we report the observation of an electron solid with non-collinear spin texture in monolayer graphene, consistent with solidification of skyrmions3—topological spin textures characterized by quantized electrical charge4,5. We probe the spin texture of the solids using a modified Corbino geometry that allows ferromagnetic magnons to be launched and detected6,7. We find that magnon transport is highly efficient when one Landau level is filled ($$\nu =1$$), consistent with quantum Hall ferromagnetic spin polarization. However, even minimal doping immediately quenches the magnon signal while leaving the vanishing low-temperature charge conductivity unchanged. Our results can be understood by the formation of a solid of charged skyrmions near $$\nu =1$$, whose non-collinear spin texture leads to rapid magnon decay. Data near fractional fillings show evidence of several fractional skyrmion solids, suggesting that graphene hosts a highly tunable landscape of coupled spin and charge orders. The authors use spin waves to demonstrate that charged quantum Hall skyrmions exist away from integer filling. They also see evidence of several fractional skyrmion states.},

  abstract     = {Integrated optics provides a versatile platform for quantum information processing and transceiving with photons1–8. The implementation of quantum protocols requires the capability to generate multiple high-quality single photons and process photons with multiple high-fidelity operators9–11. However, previous experimental demonstrations were faced by major challenges in realizing sufficiently high-quality multi-photon sources and multi-qubit operators in a single integrated system4–8, and fully chip-based implementations of multi-qubit quantum tasks remain a significant challenge1–3. Here, we report the demonstration of chip-to-chip quantum teleportation and genuine multipartite entanglement, the core functionalities in quantum technologies, on silicon-photonic circuitry. Four single photons with high purity and indistinguishablity are produced in an array of microresonator sources, without requiring any spectral filtering. Up to four qubits are processed in a reprogrammable linear-optic quantum circuit that facilitates Bell projection and fusion operation. The generation, processing, transceiving and measurement of multi-photon multi-qubit states are all achieved in micrometre-scale silicon chips, fabricated by the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor process. Our work lays the groundwork for large-scale integrated photonic quantum technologies for communications and computations. Four single-photon states are generated and entangled on a single micrometre-scale silicon chip, and provide the basis for the demonstration of chip-to-chip quantum teleportation.},

  abstract     = {Advanced quantum technologies require scalable and controllable quantum resources1,2. Gaussian states of multimode light, such as squeezed states and cluster states, are scalable quantum systems3–5, which can be generated on demand. However, non-Gaussian features are indispensable in many quantum protocols, especially to reach a quantum computational advantage6. Embodying non-Gaussianity in a multimode quantum state remains a challenge as non-Gaussian operations generally cannot maintain coherence among multiple modes. Here, we generate non-Gaussian quantum states of a multimode light field by removing a single photon in a mode-selective manner from a Gaussian state7. To highlight the potential for continuous-variable quantum technologies, we first demonstrated the capability to generate negativity of the Wigner function in a controlled mode. Subsequently, we explored the interplay between non-Gaussianity and quantum entanglement and verify a theoretical prediction8 about the propagation of non-Gaussianity along the nodes of photon-subtracted cluster states. Our results demonstrate large-scale non-Gaussianity with great flexibility along with an ensured compatibility with quantum information protocols. This range of features makes our approach ideal to explore the physics of non-Gaussian entanglement9,10 and to develop quantum protocols, which range across quantum computing11,12, entanglement distillation13 and quantum simulations14. Continuous-variables quantum information processing requires non-Gaussian states and operations. The generation of non-Gaussian quantum states of a multimode field is now reported through a mode-selective photon-subtraction scheme},

Systems of individually controlled neutral atoms, interacting with each other when excited to Rydberg states, have emerged as a promising platform for this task, particularly for the simulation of spin systems. Here, we review the techniques necessary for the manipulation of neutral atoms for the purpose of quantum simulation—such as quantum gas microscopes and arrays of optical tweezers—and explain how the different types of interactions between Rydberg atoms allow a natural mapping onto various quantum spin models. We discuss recent achievements in the study of quantum many-body physics in this platform, and some current research directions beyond that. This Review Article outlines the techniques necessary for the manipulation of neutral atoms and making use of their interactions, when excited to Rydberg states, to achieve the goal of quantum simulation of many-body physics.},

  abstract     = {Control of the structure and function of three-dimensional multicellular tissues depends critically on the spatial and temporal coordination of cellular physical properties, yet the organizational principles that govern these events and their disruption in disease remain poorly understood. Using a multicellular mammary cancer organoid model, we map here the spatial and temporal evolution of positions, motions and physical characteristics of individual cells in three dimensions. Compared with cells in the organoid core, cells at the organoid periphery and the invasive front are found to be systematically softer, larger and more dynamic. These mechanical changes are shown to arise from supracellular fluid flow through gap junctions, the suppression of which delays the transition to an invasive phenotype. These findings highlight the role of spatiotemporal coordination of cellular physical properties in tissue organization and disease progression. A platform for probing the mechanics and migratory dynamics of a growing model breast cancer reveals that cells at the invasive edge are faster, softer and larger than those in the core. Eliminating the softer cells delays the transition to invasion.},

  abstract     = {A model of coupled molecular biochemical oscillators is proposed to study non-equilibrium thermodynamics of synchronization. Under general considerations, we find that chemical interactions within an ensemble of autonomous oscillators break detailed balance and thus cost energy. This extra energy cost, in addition to the energy dissipated for driving each individual oscillator, is necessary to power the coupling interactions such as oscillator–oscillator exchange reactions, which are responsible for correcting the phase error in each individual noisy oscillator with respect to the collective oscillation of the whole ensemble. By solving the steady-state distribution of the many-oscillator system analytically and numerically, we show that the system reaches its synchronized state through a non-equilibrium phase transition as energy dissipation increases. The critical energy dissipation per period depends on both the frequency and strength of the exchange reaction, which reveals an optimal (efficient) design for achieving maximum synchronization with a fixed energy budget. We apply our general theory to the Kai system in the cyanobacterial circadian clock and predict a relationship between the KaiC ATPase activity and synchronization of the KaiC hexamers. The theoretical framework established here can be extended to study thermodynamics of collective behaviours in other non-equilibrium active systems. The energy cost for the synchronization of biochemical oscillators is determined under general conditions. This framework reveals a relationship between the KaiC ATPase activity and the synchronization of the KaiC hexamers.},

  abstract     = {The nematic electronic state and its associated critical fluctuations have emerged as a potential candidate for the superconducting pairing in various unconventional superconductors. However, in most materials their coexistence with magnetically ordered phases poses a significant challenge in determining their importance. Here, by combining chemical and hydrostatic physical pressure in FeSe0.89S0.11, we access a nematic quantum phase transition isolated from any other competing magnetic phases. From quantum oscillations in high magnetic fields, we trace the evolution of the Fermi surface and electronic correlations as a function of applied pressure and detect a Lifshitz transition that separates two distinct superconducting regions. One emerges from the nematic phase with a small Fermi surface and strong electronic correlations, while the other one has a large Fermi surface and weak correlations that promotes nesting and stabilization of a magnetically ordered phase at high pressures. The absence of mass divergence at the nematic quantum phase transition suggests that the nematic fluctuations could be quenched by the strong coupling to the lattice or local strain effects. A direct consequence is the weakening of superconductivity at the nematic quantum phase transition in the absence of magnetically driven fluctuations. Using sulfur doping and pressure, the authors separate the nematic and magnetic phase transitions in FeSe. They find that a Lifshitz transition sits between two independent superconducting domes where nematic critical fluctuations remain finite.},

  abstract     = {Electrical currents in a quantum spin Hall insulator are confined to the boundary of the system. The charge carriers behave as massless relativistic particles whose spin and momentum are coupled to each other. Although the helical character of those states is already established by experiments, there is an open question regarding how those edge states interact with each other when they are brought into close spatial proximity. We employ an inverted HgTe quantum well to guide edge channels from opposite sides of a device into a quasi-one-dimensional constriction. Our transport measurements show that, apart from the expected quantization in integer steps of 2e2/h, we find an additional plateau at e2/h. We combine band structure calculations and repulsive electron–electron interaction effects captured within the Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid model and Rashba spin–orbit coupling to explain our observation in terms of the opening of a spin gap. These results may have direct implications for the study of one-dimensional helical electron quantum optics, and for understanding Majorana and para fermions. Little is known about how edge states in topological materials interact with each other. Here, a quantum spin Hall insulator is used to show that when edge states are brought close together, additional gaps appear in the spectrum.},

While it allows fast and sensitive electromechanical measurements, it also introduces back-action forces from electron tunnelling that randomly perturb the mechanical state. Despite the stochastic nature of this back-action, it has been predicted to create self-sustaining coherent mechanical oscillations under strong coupling conditions. Here, we verify this prediction using real-time measurements of a vibrating carbon nanotube transistor. This electromechanical oscillator has some similarities with a laser. The single-electron transistor pumped by an electrical bias acts as a gain medium and the resonator acts as a phonon cavity. Although the operating principle is unconventional because it does not involve stimulated emission, we confirm that the output is coherent. We demonstrate other analogues of laser behaviour, including injection locking, classical squeezing through anharmonicity and frequency narrowing through feedback. In a nanobeam that is strongly coupled to a single-electron transistor, electron tunnelling back-action induces self-sustaining mechanical oscillations. This oscillator can be compared to a phonon laser and can be stabilized.},

  abstract     = {Conversion between signals in the microwave and optical domains is of great interest both for classical telecommunication and for connecting future superconducting quantum computers into a global quantum network. For quantum applications, the conversion has to be efficient, as well as operate in a regime of minimal added classical noise. While efficient conversion has been demonstrated using mechanical transducers, they have so far all operated with a substantial thermal noise background. Here, we overcome this limitation and demonstrate coherent conversion between gigahertz microwave signals and the optical telecom band with a thermal background of less than one phonon. We use an integrated, on-chip electro-optomechanical device that couples surface acoustic waves driven by a resonant microwave signal to an optomechanical crystal featuring a 2.7 GHz mechanical mode. We initialize the mechanical mode in its quantum ground state, which allows us to perform the transduction process with minimal added thermal noise, while maintaining an optomechanical cooperativity &amp;gt;1, so that microwave photons mapped into the mechanical resonator are effectively upconverted to the optical domain. We further verify the preservation of the coherence of the microwave signal throughout the transduction process. Electro-optomechanical conversion between optical and microwave photons is achieved with minimal added noise by cooling the mechanical oscillator to its quantum ground state. This has potential for future coherence-preserving transduction.},

  abstract     = {Origami is rapidly transforming the design of robots1,2, deployable structures3–6 and metamaterials7–14. However, as foldability requires a large number of complex compatibility conditions that are difficult to satisfy, the design of crease patterns is limited to heuristics and computer optimization. Here we introduce a systematic strategy that enables intuitive and effective design of complex crease patterns that are guaranteed to fold. First, we exploit symmetries to construct 140 distinct foldable motifs, and represent these as jigsaw puzzle pieces. We then show that when these pieces are fitted together they encode foldable crease patterns. This maps origami design to solving combinatorial problems, which allows us to systematically create, count and classify a vast number of crease patterns. We show that all of these crease patterns are pluripotent—capable of folding into multiple shapes—and solve exactly for the number of possible shapes for each pattern. Finally, we employ our framework to rationally design a crease pattern that folds into two independently defined target shapes, and fabricate such pluripotent origami. Our results provide physicists, mathematicians and engineers with a powerful new design strategy. The crease patterns for origami-based mechanical metamaterials can fold into myriad 3D shapes, but predicting foldability is no simple task. A framework for designing foldable patterns offers a neat alternative to extensive computer optimization.},

  abstract     = {Mechanisms to control cell division are essential for cell proliferation and survival1. Bacterial cell growth and division require the coordinated activity of peptidoglycan synthases and hydrolytic enzymes2–4 to maintain mechanical integrity of the cell wall5. Recent studies suggest that cell separation is governed by mechanical forces6,7. How mechanical forces interact with molecular mechanisms to control bacterial cell division in space and time is poorly understood. Here, we use a combination of atomic force microscope imaging, nanomechanical mapping and nanomanipulation to show that enzymatic activity and mechanical forces serve overlapping and essential roles in mycobacterial cell division. We find that mechanical stress gradually accumulates in the cell wall, concentrated at the future division site, culminating in rapid (millisecond) cleavage of nascent sibling cells. Inhibiting cell wall hydrolysis delays cleavage; conversely, locally increasing cell wall stress causes instantaneous and premature cleavage. Cells deficient in peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity fail to locally decrease their cell wall strength and undergo natural cleavage, instead forming chains of non-growing cells. Cleavage of these cells can be mechanically induced by local application of stress with an atomic force microscope. These findings establish a direct link between actively controlled molecular mechanisms and passively controlled mechanical forces in bacterial cell division. Atomic force microscopy reveals that the accumulation of mechanical stress works together with enzymatic activity to ensure the rapid cleavage of dividing bacteria.},

  abstract     = {The interplay between strong electron interactions and band topology is a new frontier in the search for exotic quantum phases. The Kondo insulator SmB6 has emerged as a promising platform because its correlation-driven bulk gap is predicted to host topological surface modes entangled with f electrons, spawning heavy Dirac fermions1–4. Unlike the conventional surface states of non-interacting topological insulators, heavy Dirac fermions are expected to harbour spontaneously generated quantum anomalous Hall states5, non-Abelian quantum statistics6,7, fractionalization8 and topological order6–8. However, the small energy scales required to probe heavy Dirac fermions have complicated their experimental realization. Here we use high-energy-resolution spectroscopic imaging in real and momentum space on SmB6. On cooling below 35 K, we observe the opening of an insulating gap that expands to 14 meV at 2 K. Within the gap, we image the formation of linearly dispersing surface states with effective masses reaching 410 ± 20 me (where me is the mass of the electron). Our results demonstrate the presence of correlation-driven heavy surface states in SmB6, in agreement with theoretical predictions1–4. Their high effective mass translates to a large density of states near zero energy, which magnifies their susceptibility to the anticipated novel orders and their potential utility. High-energy-resolution spectroscopic measurements performed on the Kondo insulator SmB6 reveal the presence of correlation-driven heavy surface states—the heavy Dirac fermions—and shed light on the search for the correlated topological materials.},

  abstract     = {Quantum spin Hall insulators are two-dimensional materials that host conducting helical electron states strictly confined to the one-dimensional boundaries. These edge channels are protected by time-reversal symmetry against single-particle backscattering, opening new avenues for spin-based electronics and computation. However, the effect of the interelectronic Coulomb repulsion also has to be taken into account, as two-particle scattering is not impeded by topological protection and may strongly affect the edge state conductance. Here, we explore the impact of electronic correlations on highly localized edge states of the unique quantum spin Hall material bismuthene on SiC(0001) (ref. 1). Exploiting the advantage of having an accessible monolayer substrate system, we use STM/STS to visualize the close-to-perfect one-dimensional confinement of the edge channels and scrutinize their suppressed density of states at the Fermi level. On the basis of the observed spectral behaviour and its universal scaling with energy and temperature, we demonstrate the correspondence with a (helical) Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid. In particular, the extracted interaction parameter K is directly relevant to the fundamental question of the temperatures at which the quantized conductance (a hallmark of quantum spin Hall materials) will become obscured by correlations2. Scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy study of the conductive edge state in a two-dimensional topological insulator reveals the interplay of topology and electronic correlations.},

  abstract     = {Ferroic orders can be classified by the symmetry of their order parameters, and ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and ferro-toroidal orders have already been observed. The ferro-rotational order1–3, whose order parameter is an axial vector invariant under both time-reversal and spatial-inversion operations, is the final ferroic to be identified and has a vector order parameter. This order is closely related to a number of phenomena such as polar vortices4, giant magnetoelectric coupling5 and spin-helicity-driven ferroelectricity6, but it has received little attention so far. Here, using high-sensitivity rotational-anisotropy second-harmonic generation, we have exploited the electric quadrupole contribution to the second-harmonic generation to directly couple to this centrosymmetric ferro-rotational order in an archetype of type-II multiferroics, RbFe(MoO4)2. We found that two domain states with opposite ferro-rotational vectors emerge with distinct populations at the critical temperature Tc ≈ 195 K and gradually evolve to reach an even ratio at lower temperatures. Moreover, we have identified the ferro-rotational order phase transition as weakly first order and have revealed its coupling field as a unique combination of the induced electric quadrupole second-harmonic generation and the incident fundamental electric fields. The authors use optical spectroscopy to show that RbFe(MoO4)2 hosts a ferro-rotational phase. This is the final form of ferroic order to be observed.},

These are short-lived effects that should lead to measurable changes in electrical transport, which can be characterized using an ultrafast device architecture based on photoconductive switches9. Here, we report the observation of a light-induced anomalous Hall effect in monolayer graphene driven by a femtosecond pulse of circularly polarized light. The dependence of the effect on a gate potential used to tune the Fermi level reveals multiple features that reflect a Floquet-engineered topological band structure4,5, similar to the band structure originally proposed by Haldane10. This includes an approximately 60 meV wide conductance plateau centred at the Dirac point, where a gap of equal magnitude is predicted to open. We find that when the Fermi level lies within this plateau the estimated anomalous Hall conductance saturates around 1.8 ± 0.4 e2/h. A transient topological response in graphene is driven by a short pulse of light. When the Fermi energy is in the predicted band gap the Hall conductance is around two conductance quanta. An ultrafast detection technique enables the measurement.},

The motion of a mechanical eigenmode can be efficiently cooled into the quantum regime using photons2–4, but not other degrees of freedom. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet powerful method for cooling, amplification and self-oscillation using electrons. This is achieved by applying a constant (d.c.) current of electrons through a suspended nanotube in a dilution refrigerator. We demonstrate cooling to 4.6 ± 2.0 quanta of vibrations. We also observe self-oscillation, which can lead to prominent instabilities in the electron transport through the nanotube. We attribute the origin of the observed cooling and self-oscillation to an electrothermal effect. This work shows that electrons may become a useful resource for cooling the mechanical vibrations of nanoscale systems into the quantum regime. The back-action of electrons can cool a nanomechanical oscillator to a few-quantum state when a current flows through a suspended nanotube. The electron back-action, which is attributed to an electrothermal effect, also induces self-oscillations.},

  abstract     = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measures the single-particle excitations of a many-body quantum system with energy and momentum resolution, providing detailed information about strongly interacting materials1. ARPES directly probes fermion pairing, and hence is a natural technique to study the development of superconductivity in systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to unitary Fermi gases. In these systems, a remnant gap-like feature persists in the normal state2. Developing a quantitative understanding of these so-called pseudogap regimes may elucidate details about the pairing mechanisms that lead to superconductivity, but this is difficult in real materials partly because the microscopic Hamiltonian is not known. Here, we report on the development of ARPES to study strongly interacting fermions in an optical lattice using a quantum gas microscope. We benchmark the technique by measuring the occupied single-particle spectral function of an attractive Fermi–Hubbard system across the BCS–BEC crossover and comparing the results to those of quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We find evidence for a pseudogap that opens well above the expected critical temperature for superfluidity. This technique may also be applied to the doped repulsive Hubbard model, which is expected to exhibit a pseudogap at temperatures close to those achieved in recent experiments3. A technique analogous to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy used in materials characterization has been developed for interacting Fermi gases in an optical lattice, providing information on the single-particle excitations in a many-body system.},

  abstract     = {Decoherence plays a major role in our current understanding of the conceptual foundations of quantum physics1. In many instances, decoherence is also a threat that must be countered (for instance, in quantum information processing or quantum technologies). While decoherence has been extensively studied for simple, well-isolated systems such as single atoms or ions2, much less is known for many-body systems where interparticle correlations and interactions can drastically alter the dissipative dynamics3–6. Here, we study experimentally the decoherence of a gas of strongly interacting bosons in an optical lattice exposed to near-resonant light and spontaneous emission. We observe an anomalous subdiffusion in momentum space, associated with a universal slowing down ∝1/t1/2 of the loss of spatial coherence. This algebraic decay reflects the emergence of slowly relaxing many-body states5, akin to the subradiant states of many excited emitters4. These results, supported by theoretical predictions, provide an important benchmark in the understanding of open many-body systems. Strongly interacting bosons in an optical lattice exhibit anomalous subdiffusive evolution when subjected to a dissipative process. The experimental observations are attributed to a mechanism termed ‘interaction-impeding of decoherence’.},
