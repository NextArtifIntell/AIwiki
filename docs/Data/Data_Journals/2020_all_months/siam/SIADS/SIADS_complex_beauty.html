In particular, we derive explicit formulas for the generalization of the first Lyapunov coefficient to this setting. This generically determines the direction of branching (super- versus subcriticality), but in general this differs from any fixed smoothening of the vector field. We focus on nonsmooth nonlinearities of the form $u_i|u_j|$, but our results are formulated in broader generality for systems in any dimension with piecewise smooth nonlinear part. In addition, we discuss some codimension-one degeneracies and apply the results to a model of a shimmying wheel.},

  abstract     = {Progression through different synchronized and desynchronized regimes in brain networks has been reported to reflect physiological and behavioral states, such as working memory and attention. Moreover, intracranial recordings of epileptic seizures show a progression towards synchronization as brain regions are recruited and the seizures evolve. In this paper, we build on our previous work on noise- induced transitions on networks to explore the interplay between transitions and synchronization. We consider a bistable dynamical system that is initially at a stable equilibrium (quiescent) that coexists with an oscillatory state (active). The addition of noise will typically lead to escape from the quiescent to the active state. If a number of such systems are coupled, these escapes can spread sequentially in the manner of a “domino effect.” We illustrate our findings numerically in an example system with three coupled nodes. We first show that a symmetrically coupled network with amplitude-dependent coupling exhibits new phenomena of accelerating and decelerating domino effects modulated by the strength and sign of the coupling. This is quantified by numerically computing escape times for the system with weak coupling. We then apply phase-amplitude-dependent coupling and explore the interplay between synchronized and desynchronized dynamics in the system. We consider escape phases between nodes where the cascade of noise-induced escapes is associated with various types of partial synchrony along the sequence. We show examples for the three-node system in which there is multistability between in-phase and antiphase solutions where solutions switch between the two as the sequence of escapes progresses.},

  abstract     = {A Koopman decomposition of a complex system leads to a representation in which nonlinear dynamics appear to be linear. The existence of a linear framework with which to analyze nonlinear dynamical systems brings new strategies for prediction and control, while the approach is straightforward to apply to large datasets using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). However, it can be challenging to connect the output of DMD to a Koopman analysis since there are relatively few analytical results available, while the DMD algorithm itself is known to struggle in situations involving the propagation of a localized structure through the domain. Motivated by these issues, we derive a series of Koopman decompositions for localized, finite-amplitude solutions of classical nonlinear PDEs for which transformations to linear systems exist. We demonstrate that nonlinear traveling wave solutions to both the Burgers and KdV equations have two Koopman decompositions; one of which converges upstream and another which converges downstream of the soliton or front. These results are shown to generalize to the interaction of multiple solitons in the KdV equation. The existence of multiple expansions in space and time has a critical impact on the ability of DMD to extract Koopman eigenvalues and modes---which must be performed within a temporally and spatially localized window to correctly identify the separate expansions. We provide evidence that these features may be generic for isolated nonlinear structures by applying DMD to a moving breather solution of the sine-Gordon equation.},

When spatio-temporal noise is introduced in the equation for the activator, we derive a stochastic ODE that describes the motion of a single spike on a slow time scale. The steady state is described by a density distribution for spike positions, obtained via the corresponding Fokker--Planck PDE. For sufficiently small noise level, the spike performs random fluctuations near the center of the domain. As noise level is increased, the spike can deviate from the domain center but remains effectively “trapped” within a certain subinterval that includes the center. For even larger noise levels, the spike starts to undergo large excursions that eventually collide with the domain boundary and temporarily trap the spike there. By reformulating this problem in terms of mean first passage time, we derive the expected time for the spike to collide with the boundary. Several new open problems are also presented.},

The pressure losses at the junctions of the pipes and vessels are quadratic with or without switches according to the direction of the flow. Stability and net flow of the equilibria of the unforced systems is investigated. Pumping solutions are defined and proven to exist in case of nonlinear pressure losses at the junctions.

  abstract     = {Deterministic models of vegetation often summarize, at a macroscopic scale, a multitude of intrinsically random events occurring at a microscopic scale. We bridge the gap between these scales by demonstrating convergence to a mean-field limit for a general class of stochastic models representing each individual ecological event in the limit of large system size. The proof relies on classical stochastic coupling techniques that we generalize to cover spatially extended interactions. The mean-field limit is a spatially extended non-Markovian process characterized by nonlocal integro-differential equations describing the evolution of the probability for a patch of land to be in a given state (the generalized Kolmogorov equations (GKEs) of the process). We thus provide an accessible general framework for spatially extending many classical finite-state models from ecology and population dynamics. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach through a detailed comparison of our limiting spatial model and the finite-size version of a specific savanna-forest model, the so-called Staver--Levin model. There is remarkable dynamic consistency between the GKEs and the finite-size system in spite of almost sure forest extinction in the finite-size system. To resolve this apparent paradox, we show that the extinction rate drops sharply when nontrivial equilibria emerge in the GKEs, and that the finite-size system&#39;s quasi-stationary distribution (stationary distribution conditional on nonextinction) closely matches the bifurcation diagram of the GKEs. Furthermore, the limit process can support periodic oscillations of the probability distribution and thus provides an elementary example of a jump process that does not converge to a stationary distribution. In spatially extended settings, environmental heterogeneity can lead to waves of invasion and front-pinning phenomena.},

In the new fictitious time $\tau$, it is then proved that any solution exists for all $\tau \in \mathbb{R}$ and that it is uniquely extended as a holomorphic function to a strip of fixed width. As a by-product, a global power series representation of the solutions of the $N$-body problem is obtained. Notably, our global time-renormalizations remain valid in the limit when one of the masses vanishes.

To model thermal effects, the proposed modeling approach extends the classical chemical reaction network by adding two parameters to each direct (reaction) edge, depicting, respectively, the instantaneous internal energy change after the firing of the reaction and the variation of the reaction rate with respect to the temperature. For systems possessing thermodynamic equilibria, our modeling approach provides a compact formulation of the dynamics where reaction topology and thermodynamic information are presented simultaneously. Finally, using this formulation and the Legendre transformation, we show that nonisothermal detailed balanced network systems admit some fundamental properties: dissipativeness, the detailed balancing of each equilibrium, the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium, and the asymptotic stability of each equilibrium.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the model proposed by Gandhi et al. in [J. R. Soc. Interface, 15 (2018), 20180508], we propose a two-component reaction-advection-diffusion model for vegetation density and soil water concentration on a curved terrain with elevation given by $z = \zeta(x,y)$ and metric tensor $g(x,y)$. It accounts for downhill flow of soil water, spatially dependent effective evaporation of soil water, and vertical rainfall on a curved surface. In the singularly perturbed limit of slow vegetation diffusion $0 &lt; \varepsilon^2 \ll 1$, we use a hybrid asymptotic-numerical method to construct a localized quasi-equilibrium one-spot solution corresponding to one spot of a spotted vegetation pattern. We derive an ODE for the slow motion of the spot, finding that it is governed by three factors that arise at two different orders in $\varepsilon$. The leading order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2|\log\varepsilon|)$ effects are that of soil water advection and effective evaporation rate, the first driving the spot uphill while the second drives it toward regions of slow effective evaporation (e.g., valleys). Entering at $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$ are effects due to surface curvature along with higher order contributions of advection and variable evaporation rate. The combined effect of these three factors is encoded in the gradient of the regular part of a surface Green&#39;s function for a second order linear operator of the form $\Delta_g + {v}(x,y)\cdot\nabla + V(x,y)$ for some velocity vector ${v}(x,y)$ and effective potential $V(x,y)$, where $\Delta_g$ is the Laplace--Beltrami operator corresponding to metric tensor $g(x,y)$. We compute this quantity using the analytic-numerical framework that we first introduced in [Nonlinearity, 33 (2019), pp. 643--674], and demonstrate that it is critical for the accurate prediction of spot motion. All numerical results are confirmed by finite element solutions of the full PDE system.},

For a special class of vortex knots---toroidal knots---we give a full characterization of both their energetic and dynamical stabilities. In addition to providing explicit expressions for the relevant waveforms, we derive explicit formulas for their stability boundaries. These include simple links and different realizations of a trefoil knot. It is shown that a ring of more than 7 filaments can potentially be stablized by giving it a slight twist and connecting neighboring filaments on a torus. In addition to rings, (helical) filament lattice configurations are also considered and are found to be dynamically stable for all rotation frequencies and also energetically stable for sufficiently fast rotations. Numerical simulations are used to compare the Klein--Majda--Damodaran model with the full three-dimensional (3D) Gross--Pitaevskii equations as well as to confirm the analytical theory.

We give simple testable criteria for the occurrence of nonautonomous tipping from the herbivore-dominating equilibrium to the plant-only equilibrium using global properties of the autonomous frozen system with fixed-in-time parameters. To begin with, we use classical autonomous bifurcation analysis to identify a codimension-three degenerate Bogdanov--Takens bifurcation: the source of a dangerous subcritical Hopf bifurcation and the organizing center for bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping). Then, we introduce the concept of basin instability for equilibria to identify parameter paths along which genuine nonautonomous rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs without crossing any classical autonomous bifurcations. We explain nonautonomous R-tipping in terms of maximal canard trajectories and produce nonautonomous tipping diagrams in the plane of the magnitude and rate of a parameter shift to uncover intriguing R-tipping tongues and wiggling tipping-tracking bifurcation curves. Discussion of nontrivial dynamics arising from the interaction between B-tipping and R-tipping identifies “points of no return” where tipping cannot be prevented by the parameter trend reversal and “points of return tipping” where tipping is inadvertently induced by the parameter trend reversal. Our results give new insight into the sensitivity of ecosystems to the magnitudes and rates of environmental change. Finally, a comparison between “tilted” saddle-node and subcritical Hopf normal forms reveals some universal tipping properties due to basin instability, a generic dangerous bifurcation, or the combination of both.},

  abstract     = {The Kuramoto model is a system of nonlinear differential equations that is often used to model synchronization between coupled oscillators in a network. A particular form of synchronization is phase-locking whereby the oscillators rotate at a common frequency with fixed angle differences. It has been observed that the oscillators will phase-lock if their natural frequencies have small differences, and conversely, that they won&#39;t if the natural frequencies have large differences. In [Bronski and Ferguson, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 17 (2018), pp. 128--156] Bronski and the author gave upper and lower bounds for the volume of the set of natural frequencies for which the Kuramoto model exhibits phase-locking. This was done under the assumption that any two oscillators influence each other with equal strength. In this paper the author generalizes these upper and lower bounds by removing this assumption. Similar to [Bronski and Ferguson, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 17 (2018), pp. 128--156], where the upper and lower bounds are sums over spanning trees of the network, our generalized upper and lower bounds are sums over certain directed subgraphs of the network. In particular, our lower bound and one of our upper bounds are sums over divergent directed spanning trees. We also relate our results to observations by Poignard, Pereira, Pade in [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 78 (2018), pp. 372--394] and Pade and Pereira in [APS March Meeting Abstracts, 2015, M45.011] on how changes in the network can affect synchronization.},

This is based on a finite dimensional Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser (KAM) theory for quasi-periodically forced reversible systems with multidimensional Liouvillean frequency. As we know, the results existing in the literature deal with two-dimensional frequency and exploit the theory of continued fractions to control the small divisor problem. The results in this paper partially extend the analysis to higher-dimensional frequency and impose a nonresonance condition weaker than the Brjuno condition, thus allowing a class of Liouvillean frequencies. The main idea in KAM theory is to perform a first normal form reduction, in which the nonresonance condition is required to solve the homological equation, and then to impose further Melnikov conditions on the small divisors by discarding some values of the parameters $\lambda$, the proper frequency of the unperturbed oscillator. The overall strategy of this paper comes from the literature [H. Cheng, W. Si, and J. Si, J. Dynam. Differential Equations, 32 (2020), pp. 705--739], but the method is still in the spirit of Hou and You [Invent.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the success of the Koopman operator in dynamical systems analysis has also fueled the development of Koopman operator-based control frameworks. In order to preserve the relatively low data requirements for an approximation via dynamic mode decomposition, a quantization approach was recently proposed in [S. Peitz and S. Klus, Automatica J. IFAC, 106 (2019), pp. 184--191]. This way, control of nonlinear dynamical systems can be realized by means of switched systems techniques, using only a finite set of autonomous Koopman operator-based reduced models. These individual systems can be approximated very efficiently from data. The main idea is to transform a control system into a set of autonomous systems for which the optimal switching sequence has to be computed. In this article, we extend these results to continuous control inputs using relaxation. This way, we combine the advantages of the data efficiency of approximating a finite set of autonomous systems with continuous controls, as the data requirements increase only linearly with the input dimension. We show that when using the Koopman generator, this relaxation---realized by linear interpolation between two operators---does not introduce any error for control affine systems. This allows us to control high-dimensional nonlinear systems using bilinear, low-dimensional surrogate models. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated using several examples with increasing complexity, from the Duffing oscillator to the chaotic fluidic pinball.},

Here we generalize the map to study the effects of light-dark forcing in a hierarchical system consisting of a central circadian oscillator that drives a peripheral circadian oscillator. We develop techniques to reduce the higher-dimensional phase space of the coupled system to derive a generalized two-dimensional entrainment map. Determining the nature of various fixed points, together with an understanding of their stable and unstable manifolds, leads to conditions for existence and stability of periodic orbits of the circadian system. We use the map to investigate how various properties of solutions depend on parameters and initial conditions including the time to and direction of entrainment. We show that the concepts of phase advance and phase delay need to be carefully assessed when considering hierarchical systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we revisit the folded node and the bifurcations of secondary canards at resonances $\mu\in \mathbb N$. In particular, we prove for the first time that pitchfork bifurcations occur at all even values of $\mu$. Our approach relies on a time-reversible version of the Melnikov approach in [M. Wechselberger, Dynam. Syst., 17 (2002), pp. 215--233] used in [M. Wechselberger, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 4 (2005), pp. 101--139] to prove the transcritical bifurcations for all odd values of $\mu$. It is known that the secondary canards produced by the transcritical and the pitchfork bifurcations only reach the Fenichel slow manifolds on one side of each transcritical bifurcation for all $0&lt;\epsilon\ll 1$. In this paper, we provide a new geometric explanation for this fact, relying on the symmetry of the normal form and a separate blowup of the fold lines. We also show that our approach for evaluating the Melnikov integrals of the folded node---based upon local characterization of the invariant manifolds by higher order variational equations and reducing these to an inhomogeneous Weber equation---applies to general, quadratic, time-reversible, unbounded connection problems in $\mathbb R^3$. We conclude the paper by using our approach to present a new proof of the bifurcation of periodic orbits from infinity in the Falkner--Skan equation.},

  abstract     = {Spatially localized two-dimensional spot patterns occur for a wide variety of two component reaction-diffusion systems in the singular limit of a large diffusivity ratio. Such localized, far-from-equilibrium patterns are known to exhibit a wide range of different instabilities such as breathing oscillations, spot annihilation, and spot self-replication behavior. Prior numerical simulations of the Schnakenberg and Brusselator systems have suggested that a localized peanut-shaped linear instability of a localized spot is the mechanism initiating a fully nonlinear spot self-replication event. From a development and implementation of a weakly nonlinear theory for shape deformations of a localized spot, it is shown through a normal form amplitude equation that a peanut-shaped linear instability of a steady-state spot solution is always subcritical for both the Schnakenberg and Brusselator reaction-diffusion systems. The weakly nonlinear theory is validated by using the global bifurcation software pde2path [H. Uecker, D. Wetzel, and J. D. Rademacher, Numer. Math. Theory Methods Appl., 7 (2014), pp. 58--106] to numerically compute an unstable, non-radially symmetric, steady-state spot solution branch that originates from a symmetry-breaking bifurcation point.},

  abstract     = {Permanent charge is the major structural quantity of an ion channel. It defines the ion channel and its interaction with boundary conditions plays the predominate role for ionic flow properties or functions of the ion channel. In this work, we investigate effects of large magnitude permanent charges of a simple form on the ionic flow of a 1:1 solution (an ionic mixture with one positive charged ion species and one negatively charged ion species). The analysis is based on a quasi-one-dimensional classical steady-state Poisson--Nernst--Planck model. Our findings include (i) large permanent charges produce flux and current saturations at large transmembrane electric potentials; (ii) large permanent charges inhibit the flux of co-ions (ions with the same charge sign) but could either enhance or reduce the flux of counter-ions (ions with opposite charge signs), depending on boundary conditions and the channel geometry; (iii) the magnitude of the co-ion flux is decreasing with an increase in magnitude of the large permanent charge but the counter-ion flux could either decease or increase with an increase in magnitude of the large permanent charge, depending on boundary conditions and the channel geometry, and quite significantly; (iv) large permanent charges are responsible for the counterintuitive declining phenomenon---an increase in the electrochemical potential of counter-ion species in a particular manner leads to a reduction of the counter-ion flux. We would like to stress that the model in this paper includes only the ideal components of the electrochemical potentials so the model cannot be used to study some critical properties of ion channels such as selectivity and gating. Our work should be viewed as the first step of future analyses/numerics with more structural detail and more correlations between ions included. The basic findings in this work should provide guidance for further investigation.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a framework which allows the study of stability robustness of equilibria of a nonlinear system in the face of parametric uncertainties from the point of view of bifurcation theory. In this context, a branch of equilibria is stable if bifurcations (i.e., qualitative changes of the steady-state solutions) do not occur as one or more bifurcation parameters are varied. The work focuses specifically on Hopf bifurcations, where a stable branch of equilibria meets a branch of periodic solutions. It is of practical interest to evaluate how the presence of uncertain parameters in the system alters the result of analyses performed with respect to a nominal vector field. Note that in this article bifurcation parameters have a different meaning than uncertain parameters. To answer the question, the concept of robust bifurcation margins is proposed based on the idea of describing the uncertain system in a Linear Fractional Transformation fashion. The robust bifurcation margins can be interpreted as nonlinear analogues of the structural singular value, or $\mu$, which provides robust stability margins for linear time invariant systems. Their computation is formulated as a nonlinear program aided by a continuation-based multistart strategy to mitigate the issue of local minima. Application of the framework is demonstrated on two case studies from the power system and aerospace literature.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven method that models high-dimensional time series as a sum of spatiotemporal modes, where the temporal modes are constrained by linear dynamics. For nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting strongly coherent structures, DMD can be a useful approximation to extract dominant, interpretable modes. In many domains with large spatiotemporal data---including fluid dynamics, video processing, and finance---the dynamics of interest are often perturbations about fixed points or equilibria, which motivates the application of DMD to centered (i.e., mean-subtracted) data. In this work, we show that DMD with centered data is equivalent to incorporating an affine term in the dynamic model and is not equivalent to computing a discrete Fourier transform. Importantly, DMD with centering can always be used to compute eigenvalue spectra of the dynamics. However, in many cases DMD without centering cannot model the corresponding dynamics, most notably if the dynamics have full effective rank. Additionally, we generalize the notion of centering to extracting arbitrary, but known, fixed frequencies from the data. We corroborate these theoretical results numerically on three nonlinear examples: the Lorenz system, a surveillance video, and brain recordings. Since centering the data is simple and computationally efficient, we recommend it as a preprocessing step before DMD; furthermore, we suggest that it can be readily used in conjunction with many other popular implementations of the DMD algorithm.},

How do we combine our private beliefs with information we obtain from our social network? To understand the strategies humans use to do so, it is useful to compare them to observers that optimally integrate all evidence. Here we derive network models of rational (Bayes optimal) agents who accumulate private measurements and observe the decisions of their neighbors to make an irreversible choice between two options. The resulting information exchange dynamics has interesting properties: When decision thresholds are asymmetric, the absence of a decision can be increasingly informative over time. In a recurrent network of two agents, the absence of a decision can lead to a sequence of belief updates akin to those in the literature on common knowledge. On the other hand, in larger networks a single decision can trigger a cascade of agreements and disagreements that depend on the private information agents have gathered. Our approach provides a bridge between social decision making models in the economics literature, which largely ignore the temporal dynamics of decisions, and the single-observer evidence accumulator models used widely in neuroscience and psychology.},

  abstract     = {We study a convex optimization framework for bounding extreme events in nonlinear dynamical systems governed by ordinary or partial differential equations (ODEs or PDEs). This framework bounds from above the largest value of an observable along trajectories that start from a chosen set and evolve over a finite or infinite time interval. The approach needs no explicit trajectories. Instead, it requires constructing suitably constrained auxiliary functions that depend on the state variables and possibly on time. Minimizing bounds over auxiliary functions is a convex problem dual to the nonconvex maximization of the observable along trajectories. This duality is strong, meaning that auxiliary functions give arbitrarily sharp bounds, for sufficiently regular ODEs evolving over a finite time on a compact domain. When these conditions fail, strong duality may or may not hold; both situations are illustrated by examples. We also show that near-optimal auxiliary functions can be used to construct spacetime sets that localize trajectories leading to extreme events. Finally, in the case of polynomial ODEs and observables, we describe how polynomial auxiliary functions of fixed degree can be optimized numerically using polynomial optimization. The corresponding bounds become sharp as the polynomial degree is raised if strong duality and mild compactness assumptions hold. Analytical and computational ODE examples illustrate the construction of bounds and the identification of extreme trajectories, along with some limitations. As an analytical PDE example, we bound the maximum fractional enstrophy of solutions to the Burgers equation with fractional diffusion.},

We develop a formal series solution for the invariance equation, and show that the coefficients of the series solve certain boundary value problems (BVPs) on the line.

  abstract     = {Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are pathological voltage fluctuations that can occur in cardiac cells and are a potent source of potentially fatal arrhythmias. Recent works examining the mechanisms underlying EADs in minimal computational cardiac models have revealed that voltage-driven EADs are canard-induced mixed-mode oscillations whose properties are mediated by the rate at which these cells are paced. In this work, we analyze the mechanisms for the pacing-induced generation of different EAD behaviors in a reduced four-dimensional Luo--Rudy I model using slow-fast analysis. While previous explanations for EADs in this model have required manipulation of the underlying multitimescale structure, our approach does not and we find that the canard mechanism persists in generating EADs in this context. We also find that the canard mechanism gives a more complete explanation for the onset and properties of the EADs induced (e.g., EAD amplitude and number). In addition, we also find that the canards play an essential role in producing a richer set of behaviors than were seen in other minimal models, some of which have also been observed in experiments. These behaviors include pacing-induced termination of EADs, the periodic alternation of cardiac action potentials with and without EADs, as well as bistability between standard and EAD-containing action potentials at a fixed pacing rate. Finally, we show that this bistability can lead to hysteretic transitions between standard and arrhythmogenic action potentials under sufficiently slow oscillations in the pacing rate.},

  abstract     = {We propose a computational method (with acronym ALDI) for sampling from a given target distribution based on first-order (overdamped) Langevin dynamics which satisfies the property of affine invariance. The central idea of ALDI is to run an ensemble of particles with their empirical covariance serving as a preconditioner for their underlying Langevin dynamics. ALDI does not require taking the inverse or square root of the empirical covariance matrix, which enables application to high-dimensional sampling problems. The theoretical properties of ALDI are studied in terms of nondegeneracy and ergodicity. Furthermore, we study its connections to diffusion on Riemannian manifolds and Wasserstein gradient flows. Bayesian inference serves as a main application area for ALDI. In case of a forward problem with additive Gaussian measurement errors, ALDI allows for a gradient-free approximation in the spirit of the ensemble Kalman filter. A computational comparison between gradient-free and gradient-based ALDI is provided for a PDE constrained Bayesian inverse problem.},

A particular form of solution to these is designed which uses a new methodology for computing a spatiotemporally dependent optimal control. An $L^2$-error norm for trajectory locations over a finite-time horizon is combined with a penalty energy norm for the control velocity in defining the global cost function. A computational algorithm for cost minimization is developed, and theoretical results on global error and cost presented. Numerical simulations (using velocities which are specified, and obtained as data from computational fluid dynamics simulations) are used to demonstrate the efficacy and validity of the approach in determining the required spatiotemporally defined control velocity.},

  abstract     = {Delays are important phenomena arising in a wide variety of real-world systems, including biological ones, because of diffusion/propagation effects or as simplifying modeling elements. We propose here to consider delayed stochastic reaction networks, a class of networks that has received little attention until now. We demonstrate here that by restricting the delays to be phase-type distributed, one can represent the associated delayed reaction network as a reaction network with finite-dimensional state-space. In particular, we prove, for mass-action unimolecular and certain bimolecular networks, that the delayed stochastic reaction network is ergodic if and only if the delay-free network is ergodic as well. These results demonstrate that delays cause little to no harm to the ergodicity property of reaction networks as long as the delays are phase-type distributed, and this holds regardless of the complexity of their distribution. We also prove that the presence of those delays adds convolution terms in the moment equation but does not change the value of the stationary means compared to the delay-free case. The covariance, however, is influenced by the presence of the delays. Finally, the control of a certain class of delayed stochastic reaction network using a delayed antithetic integral controller is considered. It is proven that this controller achieves its goal provided that the delay-free network satisfies the conditions of ergodicity and output-controllability.},

  abstract     = {We study a model of the cell cycles of a large ensemble of cells that was conceived to explain the coupling between metabolism and the cell cycle observed in cell cycle related, metabolic oscillations in yeast continuous culture. An essential feature of the model is that a negative feedback mechanism robustly produces temporal clustering: cohorts of cells proceeding through the cell cycle in phase synchrony, a phenomenon that was observed in the yeast experiments. In this paper we focus on the possibility of temporal clustering in which different cohorts are of unequal sizes. We observe in numerical simulations of the model that the clusters tend very strongly toward having nearly equal numbers of cells. This is consistent with the available experimental data. We study the case of two unequal clusters analytically and conclude that solutions with two unequal clusters are locally asymptotically stable in the clustered subspace. However, local asymptotic stability of unbalanced clusters in the full phase space depends delicately on the parameters of the model. The global dynamics reveal a more robust picture. If clusters become unbalanced, the influence of the larger cluster can radically shift the basins of attraction of individual clusters, making it more likely for an unclustered cell to join a smaller cluster. We propose that this points to a general principle: systems that form temporal clusters via nonlocal coupling tend to form nearly equal clusters. Finally, we describe an exception. When the number of clusters is a composite, we observe that groups of clusters may decouple with different numbers of cells in each group.},

Precisely, we consider the four-dimensional oscillator associated to the Kepler system and carry out our program in three stages: axial-axial-energy rather than energy-axial-axial as is customary. This approach reveals the true role of the $\mathcal{KS}$ map and the bilinear relation. Our development allows for a global analysis at each reduction stage providing a complete description of each reduced space. The first reduced space is described by means of only six invariants leading to a nonsingular six-dimensional Poisson manifold. Then, the classical bilinear relation is replaced by the momentum map of a geometric reduction. Furthermore, the second reduced space is given as the product of two hyperboloids and has cones as singular strata. For the last stage, we distinguish among the possible sign of the energy. The positive and zero cases bring new noncompact reduced spaces which are described in detail.},

For the reduced-order model, we construct a robust feedback control based on the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ control method, which requires the solution of an associated high-dimensional Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs nonlinear PDE. The dimensionality of the Isaacs PDE is tackled by means of a separable representation of the control system, and a polynomial approximation ansatz for the corresponding value function. Our method proves to be effective for the robust stabilization of nonlinear dynamics up to dimension $d\approx 12$. We assess the robustness and optimality features of our design over a class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs, including nonlinear advection and reaction terms. The proposed design yields a feedback controller achieving optimal stabilization and disturbance rejection properties, along with providing a modeling framework for the robust control of PDEs under parametric uncertainties.},

Such events happen rarely, however, making it infeasible to use traditional methods to determine the slip rate. Here, in a model of a soliton-based mode-locked laser, quantification of the error rate is obtained using importance-sampled Monte Carlo simulations guided by soliton perturbation theory. Position slips are studied in two distinct cases: an overdamped regime where they are primarily direct and an underdamped regime where they typically involve oscillations. Quantification of the slip rate is shown to be more straightforward in the overdamped regime, but dynamic importance sampling is found to be necessary to accurately and efficiently capture error rates. Dynamic importance sampling is shown to be more difficult to implement in the underdamped regime due to the existence of multiple routes by which errors can occur.},

We first introduce the basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$ for this model and establish a threshold-type result on its global dynamics in terms of $\mathcal R_0$. More precisely, we show that the disease is uniformly persistent when $\mathcal R_0&gt;1$, while the disease-free periodic solution is globally attractive when $\mathcal R_0&lt;1$. Then we choose parameters to fit the schistosomiasis epidemic data in Hubei province of China. Our numerical simulations indicate that the schistosomiasis will continue to prevail in the near future unless more effective control measures are taken. A further sensitive analysis demonstrates that the parameters with a strong impact on the outcome are baseline transmission rate, recovery rate, schistosome egg output rate, contact rate between miracidia and snails, and cercariae output rate.},

In the absence of medical treatments and efficient vaccines, one of the control methods is to introduce Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected by the bacterium Wolbachia into a population of wild (uninfected) mosquitoes. The goal consists in achieving population replacement in finite time by driving the population of wild females towards extinction, while keeping Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes alive and persistent. We consider a two-dimensional competition model between wild Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes and those infected with Wolbachia. Our goal is to examine the basin of attraction of a desired equilibrium state which represents the population replacement. For this, we study how the stable manifold that forms the basin boundary of interest changes under parameter variation. To achieve this, we first combine tools from dynamical systems and geometric singular perturbation theory with numerical continuation methods. This allows us to present a strategy to get the desired population replacement with a minimum number of released infected mosquitoes in a human intervention by choosing an appropriate combination of initial conditions and parameter values. Second, we characterize traveling waves in a spatiotemporal extension of our model. To this aim, we propose a new method to calculate and visualize 3D invariant manifolds of an associated 4D dynamical system. In this way, we find uncountably many heteroclinic connections between stationary states (each associated with a wave front exhibiting the desired population replacement) as intersections of global invariant manifolds in the 4D phase space.},

To this aim, we put in place an algorithm based on the combination of two methods: first, we use the dynamic mode decomposition to create a mathematical model describing the mass transfer; second, we use the notion of Wasserstein distance (also known as earth mover&#39;s distance) to reconstruct the underlying velocity field that is responsible for the displacement. Finally, we consider a real-life application: the algorithm is employed to study the travel flows of people in large populated areas using, as input data, density profiles (i.e., the spatial distribution) of people in given areas at different time instants. These kinds of data are provided by the Italian telecommunication company TIM and are derived by mobile phone usage.},

  abstract     = {We study emergent behaviors of the swarm sphere model under attractive-repulsive couplings and present several sufficient frameworks leading to the complete and practical bicluster aggregations using two key ingredients (two-point correlation function and order parameter). From the modeling perspective, we consider a composite ensemble consisting of two subensembles, and the intracoupling strength in the same group is positive (attractive); in contrast, the inter coupling strength between different groups is negative (repulsive). For the modeling of frequency matrices, we classify them into four classes (fully identical, weakly identical, weakly nonidentical, and fully nonidentical) and present sufficient frameworks leading to emergent bicluster aggregations. More precisely, for the fully identical cases, we show that the complete bipolar aggregation emerges from some well-prepared initial data. For the weakly identical case, we show that the relative distances in the same group converge to zero; however, they are not well separated so that the complete bipolar aggregation fails. On the other hand, we prove that the practical bipolar aggregation occurs by letting the intercoupling strength tend to infinity. We also impose a specific structure on the frequency matrices to guarantee the complete bipolar aggregation for the weakly nonidentical case. Finally, we present several numerical examples to illustrate the robustness of our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {We develop a definition of rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) in discrete-time dynamical systems (maps) and prove results giving conditions under which R-tipping will or will not happen. Specifically, we study (possibly noninvertible) maps with a time-varying parameter subject to a parameter shift. We show that each stable path has a unique associated solution (a local pullback attractor) which stays near the path for all negative time. When the parameter changes slowly, this local pullback attractor stays near the path for all time, but if the parameter changes quickly, the local pullback attractor may move away from the path in positive time; this is the phenomenon of R-tipping. We demonstrate that forward basin stability is an insufficient condition to prevent R-tipping in maps of any dimension but that forward inflowing stability is sufficient. Furthermore, we show that R-tipping will happen when there is a certain kind of forward basin instability, and we prove precisely what happens to the local pullback attractor as the rate of the parameter change approaches infinity. We then highlight the differences between discrete- and continuous-time systems by showing that when a map is obtained by discretizing a flow, the pullback attractors for the map and flow can have dramatically different behavior; there may be R-tipping in one system but not in the other. We finish by applying our results to demonstrate R-tipping in the 2-dimensional Ikeda map.},

In the context of dynamical system analysis, the extracted dynamic modes are a generalization of global stability modes. We apply DMD to a data matrix whose rows are linearly independent, additive mixtures of latent time series. We show that when the latent time series are uncorrelated at a lag of one time-step then, in the large sample limit, the recovered dynamic modes will approximate, up to a columnwise normalization, the columns of the mixing matrix. Thus, DMD is a time series blind source separation algorithm in disguise but is different from closely related second-order algorithms such as the second-order blind identification (SOBI) method and the algorithm for multiple unknown signals extraction (AMUSE). All can unmix mixed stationary, ergodic Gaussian time series in a way that kurtosis-based independent components analysis fundamentally cannot. We use our insights on single-lag DMD to develop a higher lag extension, analyze the finite sample performance with and without randomly missing data, and identify settings where the higher lag variant can outperform the conventional single-lag variant. We validate our results with numerical simulations and highlight how DMD can be used in changepoint detection.},

  abstract     = {We study the stability of an oscillatory associative memory network consisting of $N$ coupled Kuramoto oscillators with applications in binary pattern retrieve. In this model, the coupling function consists of a Hebbian term and a second-order Fourier term with nonnegative strength $\varepsilon$. In [Phys. D, 197 (2004), pp. 134--148] Nishikawa, Hoppensteadt, and Lai studied the stability using the approach of linearization; the criteria for stability/instability is given by the spectrum of linearization which is a matrix of order $N$. In recent literature [SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 14 (2015), pp. 188--201], Hölzel and Krischer considered the model with $\varepsilon=0$ and introduced the orthogonality of binary patterns so that the eigenvalues of linearization can be calculated. In this paper, we will present conditions for stability/instability based on the gradient formulation. First, we use the potential estimate to derive a criteria for stability/instability by the spectrum of a matrix of order $N-1$. This potential estimate also gives convergence rate under some conditions. Second, we focus on the special case with mutually orthogonal memorized patterns. We find a sufficient and necessary condition for a binary pattern to be stable for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. For any other binary pattern we prove that there exists a critical value of $\varepsilon$ below which it is unstable. A lower bound for this critical strength is provided. A significant advantage of the results in this case is that the conditions for stability/instability are easy to verify and the lower bound of critical strength is easy to compute. Third, when the memorized patterns are not mutually orthogonal, we suggest a framework to transform it into the case of orthogonal memorized patterns. Simulations are presented to illustrate our results.},

Thus, the coupling strength becomes a time-dependent function and its temporal evolution is determined by a feedback rule incorporating the linear damping and the function of the relative distances between oscillators. Concerning the emergent behavior, we classify the types of an adaptive law: Hebbian and anti-Hebbian. For the Hebbian case, we see that the exponential complete synchronization emerges for some initial frameworks. On the other hand for the anti-Hebbian case, we determine a specific form of the feedback rule as a monomial function of degree 2. In this case, we construct the Lyapunov functional corresponding to the total energy and obtain the desired synchronization estimate using a dissipative property of the Lyapunov functional when the damping is sufficiently large. Moreover, we study a limit system derived from the adaptive dynamics by introducing a small learning rate. Here, we verify that the synchronization can occur with an algebraic rate which has not been observed in literature. Finally, we consider the constant network case in which the phase-locked state arises from the large coupling strength regime.},

We formulate a model of oscillators coupled through the new Laplacian and study the synchronizability of the network through the analysis of the spectrum of the Laplacian. We discuss analytical results providing bounds for the quantities of interest for synchronization and computational results showing that the hubs-attracting Laplacian generally has better synchronizability properties when compared to the classical one, with a low occurrence rate for the graphs where this is not true. Finally, two illustrative case studies of synchronization through the hubs-attracting Laplacian are considered.},

In this context, an interesting and important problem is to analyze the stability of the intralayer synchronization in such temporal networks. We prove that if the dynamical multiplex hypernetwork for the time-average topology possesses intralayer synchronization, then each layer of the time-varying multiplex hypernetwork will also be synchronized for sufficiently fast switching. Then through master stability function formalism, we analytically derive necessary and sufficient stability conditions of intralayer synchronous states for such temporal architecture in terms of a time-average network. In this regard, we are able to decouple the transverse error component of the intralayer synchronization states for some special cases. Also, we extend our study for nonlinear intralayer coupling functions as well as multilayer hypernetwork architectures. Finally, the theoretical findings are verified numerically by taking the network of paradigmatic chaotic Rössler oscillators.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, yet analysis and prediction of these systems remains a challenge. Koopman operator theory circumvents some of these issues by considering the dynamics in the space of observable functions on the state, in which the dynamics are intrinsically linear and thus amenable to standard techniques from numerical analysis and linear algebra. However, practical issues remain with this approach, as the space of observables is infinite dimensional and selecting a subspace of functions in which to accurately represent the system is a nontrivial task. In this work we consider time-delay observables to represent nonlinear dynamics in the Koopman operator framework. We prove the surprising result that Koopman operators for different systems admit universal (system-independent) representations in these coordinates, and give analytic expressions for these representations. In addition, we show that for certain systems a restricted class of these observables form an optimal finite-dimensional basis for representing the Koopman operator, and that the analytic representation of the Koopman operator in these coordinates coincides with results computed by the dynamic mode decomposition. We provide numerical examples to complement our results. In addition to being theoretically interesting, these results have implications for a number of linearization algorithms for dynamical systems.},

More recently, numerical approximations of the operator have enabled the analysis of a large number of deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems in a completely data-driven, essentially equation-free pipeline. Discrete- or continuous-time numerical algorithms (integrators, nonlinear equation solvers, optimization algorithms are themselves dynamical systems. In this paper, we use this insight to leverage the Koopman operator framework in the data-driven study of such algorithms and discuss benefits for analysis and acceleration of numerical computation. For algorithms acting on high-dimensional spaces by quickly contracting them toward low-dimensional manifolds, we demonstrate how basis functions adapted to the data help to construct efficient reduced representations of the operator.

Our approach describes the spatio-temporal filtering induced by the afferent and recurrent connectivities (with arbitrary synaptic response kernels) using operators acting on the input moments. This algebraic viewpoint provides intuition about how the network ingredients shape the input-output mapping for moments, as well as cumulants.

  abstract     = {We investigate the dynamics of a limit of interacting FitzHugh--Nagumo neurons in the regime of large interaction coefficients. We consider the dynamics described by a mean-field model given by a nonlinear evolution partial differential equation representing the probability distribution of one given neuron in a large network. The case of weak connectivity previously studied displays a unique, exponentially stable, stationary solution. Here, we consider the case of strong connectivities, and exhibit the presence of possibly nonunique stationary behaviors or nonstationary behaviors. To this end, using Hopf--Cole transformation, we demonstrate that the solutions exponentially concentrate, as the connectivity parameter diverges, around singular Dirac measures centered at the zeros of a time-dependent continuous function satisfying a complex partial differential equation. We next characterize the points at which this measure concentrates. We show there are infinitely many possible solutions and exhibit a particular solution corresponding to a Dirac measure concentrated on a time-dependent point satisfying an ordinary differential equation identical to the original FitzHugh--Nagumo system. We conjecture that the system selects only this particular solution and converges to it, through informed heuristic arguments and numerical simulations. This solution may thus feature multiple stable fixed points or periodic orbits, respectively corresponding to a clumping of the whole system at rest, or a synchronization of cells on a periodic solution. Numerical simulations of neural networks with a relatively modest number of neurons and finite coupling strength agree with these predictions away from the bifurcations of the limit system, showing that the asymptotic equation recovers the main properties of more realistic networks.},

A, 382 (2018), pp. 382--386] recently suggested that trajectories of ODE systems that optimize the infinite-time average of a certain observable can be localized using sublevel sets of a function that arise when bounding such averages using so-called auxiliary functions. In this paper we demonstrate that this idea is viable and allows for the computation of extremal unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) for polynomial ODE systems. First, we prove that polynomial optimization is guaranteed to produce auxiliary functions that yield near-sharp bounds on time averages, which is required in order to localize the extremal orbit accurately. Second, we show that points inside the relevant sublevel sets can be computed efficiently through direct nonlinear optimization. Such points provide good initial conditions for UPO computations. As a proof of concept, we then combine these methods with a single-shooting Newton--Raphson algorithm to study extremal UPOs for a nine-dimensional model of sinusoidally forced shear flow. We discover three previously unknown families of UPOs, one of which simultaneously minimizes the mean energy dissipation rate and maximizes the mean perturbation energy relative to the laminar state for Reynolds numbers approximately between 81.24 and 125.},

Instead of a selector, a recently developed new version of Conley index theory for multivalued maps [B. Batko, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 16 (2017), pp. 1587--1617; B. Batko and M. Mrozek, SIAM J.

  abstract     = {The integral control of positive systems using nonnegative control input is an important problem arising in among others, biochemistry, epidemiology, and ecology. An immediate solution is to use an ON-OFF nonlinearity between the controller and the system. However, this solution is available only when controllers are implemented in computer systems. When this is not the case, like in biology, alternative approaches need to be explored. Based on recent research in the control of biological systems [C. Briat, A. Gupta, and M. Khammash, Cell Systems, 2 (2016), pp. 17--28; C. Briat, C. Zechner, and M. Khammash, ACS Synthetic Biol., 5 (2016), pp. 1108--1116], we propose to develop a theory for the integral control of positive systems using nonnegative controls based on the so-called antithetic integral controller and two positively regularized integral controllers, the so-called exponential integral controller and logistic integral controller. For all these controllers, we establish several qualitative results, which we connect to standard results on integral control. We also obtain additional results which are specific to the type of controllers. For instance, we show an interesting result stipulating that if the gain of the antithetic integral controller is suitably chosen, then the local stability of the equilibrium point of the closed-loop system does not depend on the choice for the coupling parameter, an additional parameter specific to this controller. Conversely, we also show that if the coupling parameter is suitably chosen, then the equilibrium point of the closed-loop system is locally stable regardless of the value of the gain. For the exponential integral controller, we can show that the local stability of the equilibrium point of the closed-loop system is independent of the gain of the controller and the gain of the system. The stability depends only on the exponential rate of the controller, again a parameter that is specific to this type of controller. Several examples are given for illustration.},

  abstract     = {Differential equations with random parameters have gained significant prominence in recent years due to their importance in mathematical modeling and data assimilation. In many cases, random ordinary differential equations (RODEs) are studied by using Monte Carlo methods or by direct numerical simulation techniques using polynomial chaos (PC), i.e., by a series expansion of the random parameters in combination with forward integration. Here we take a dynamical systems viewpoint and focus on the invariant sets of differential equations such as steady states, stable/unstable manifolds, periodic orbits, and heteroclinic orbits. We employ PC to compute representations of all these different types of invariant sets for RODEs. This allows us to obtain fast sampling, geometric visualization of distributional properties of invariants sets, and uncertainty quantification of dynamical output such as periods or locations of orbits. We apply our techniques to a predator-prey model, where we compute steady states and stable/unstable manifolds. We also include several benchmarks to illustrate the numerical efficiency of adaptively chosen PC depending upon the random input. Then we employ the methods for the Lorenz system, obtaining computational PC representations of periodic orbits, stable/unstable manifolds, and heteroclinic orbits.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and analyze two general dynamical models for unidirectional movement of particles along a circular chain and an open chain of sites. The models include a soft version of the simple exclusion principle, that is, as the density in a site increases the effective entry rate into this site decreases. This allows one to model and study the evolution of “traffic jams&quot; of particles along the chain. A unique feature of these two new models is that each site along the chain can have a different size. Although the models are nonlinear, they are amenable to rigorous asymptotic analysis. In particular, we show that the dynamics always converges to a steady state, and that the steady-state densities along the chain and the steady-state output flow rate from the chain can be derived from the spectral properties of a suitable matrix, thus eliminating the need to numerically simulate the dynamics until convergence. This spectral representation also allows for powerful sensitivity analysis, i.e., understanding how a change in one of the parameters in the models affects the steady state. We show that the site sizes and the transition rates from site to site play different roles in the dynamics, and that for the purpose of maximizing the steady-state output (or production) rate the site sizes are more important than the transition rates. We also show that the problem of finding parameter values that maximize the production rate is tractable. We believe that the models introduced here can be applied to study various natural and artificial processes including ribosome flow during mRNA translation, the movement of molecular motors along filaments of the cytoskeleton, pedestrian and vehicular traffic, evacuation dynamics, and more.},

These Prandtl numbers are applicable to the earth&#39;s mantle and to gases under high pressure. We rigorously identify conditions that guarantee synchronization between the observed system and the model, then confirm the applicability of these results via numerical simulations. Our numerical experiments show that the analytically derived conditions for synchronization are far from sharp; that is, synchronization often occurs even when sufficient conditions of our theorems are not met. We also develop estimates on the convergence of an infinite Prandtl model to a large (but finite) Prandtl number generated set of observations. Numerical simulations in this hybrid setting indicate that the mathematically rigorous results are accurate, but of practical interest only for extremely large Prandtl numbers.},

In this work, we formalize the problem of learning the continuous-time Koopman operator with deep neural networks in a measure-theoretic framework. Our approach induces two types of models, differential and recurrent form, the choice of which depends on the availability of the governing equations and data. We then enforce a structural parameterization that renders the realization of the Koopman operator provably stable. A new autoencoder architecture is constructed, such that only the residual of the dynamic mode decomposition is learned. Finally, we employ mean-field variational inference on the aforementioned framework in a hierarchical Bayesian setting to quantify uncertainties in the characterization and prediction of the dynamics of observables. The framework is evaluated on a simple polynomial system, the Duffing oscillator, and an unstable cylinder wake flow with noisy measurements.},

This six-parameter family generalizes Hénon&#39;s ubiquitous 2D map and provides a local approximation for the dynamics of more general 4D maps. We show that the bounded dynamics of Moser&#39;s family is organized by a codimension-three bifurcation that creates four fixed points---a bifurcation analogous to a doubled, saddle-center---which we call a quadfurcation. In some sectors of parameter space a quadfurcation creates four fixed points from none, and in others it is the collision of a pair of fixed points that re-emerge as two or possibly four. In the simplest case the dynamics is similar to the cross product of a pair of Hénon maps, but more typically the stability of the created fixed points does not have this simple form. Up to two of the fixed points can be doubly elliptic and surrounded by bubbles of invariant two-tori; these dominate the set of bounded orbits. The quadfurcation can also create one or two complex-unstable (Krein) fixed points. Special cases of the quadfurcation correspond to a pair of weakly coupled Hénon maps near their saddle-center bifurcations.},

In this paper we propose a new version of such a methodology, a framework for its analysis, and numerical evidence of the practicality of the method proposed. Our starting point is an ensemble of overdamped Langevin diffusions which interact through a single preconditioner computed as the empirical ensemble covariance. We demonstrate that the nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation arising from the mean-field limit of the associated stochastic differential equation (SDE) has a novel gradient flow structure, built on the Wasserstein metric and the covariance matrix of the noisy flow. Using this structure, we investigate large time properties of the Fokker--Planck equation, showing that its invariant measure coincides with that of a single Langevin diffusion, and demonstrating exponential convergence to the invariant measure in a number of settings. We introduce a new noisy variant on ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) algorithms found from the original SDE by replacing exact gradients with ensemble differences; this defines the ensemble Kalman sampler (EKS). Numerical results are presented which demonstrate its efficacy as a derivative-free approximate sampler for the Bayesian posterior arising from inverse problems.},

  abstract     = {Center manifold reduction is a standard technique in bifurcation theory, reducing the essential features of local bifurcations to equations in a small number of variables corresponding to critical eigenvalues. This method can be applied to admissible differential equations for a network, but it bears no obvious relation to the network structure. A fully inhomogeneous network is one in which all nodes and couplings can be different. For this class of networks, there are general circumstances in which the center manifold reduced equations inherit a network structure of their own. This structure arises by decomposing the network into path components, which connect to each other in a feedforward manner. Critical eigenvalues can then be associated with specific components, and the network structure on the center manifold depends on how these critical components connect within the network. This observation is used to analyze codimension-1 and codimension-2 local bifurcations. For codimension-1, only one critical component is involved, and generic local bifurcations are saddle-node and standard Hopf. For codimension-2, we focus on the case when one component is downstream from the other in the feedforward structure. This gives rise to four cases: steady or Hopf upstream combined with steady or Hopf downstream. Here the generic bifurcations, within the realm of network-admissible equations, differ significantly from generic codimension-2 bifurcations in a general dynamical system. In each case, we derive singularity-theoretic normal forms and unfoldings, present bifurcation diagrams, and tabulate the bifurcating states and their stabilities.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses structures of state space in quasiperiodically forced dynamical systems. We develop a theory of ergodic partition of state space in a class of measure-preserving and dissipative flows, which is a natural extension of the existing theory for measure-preserving maps. The ergodic partition result is based on eigenspace at eigenvalue 0 of the associated Koopman operator, which is realized via time-averages of observables, and provides a constructive way to visualize a low-dimensional slice through a high-dimensional invariant set. We apply the result to the systems with a finite number of attractors and show that the time-average of a continuous observable is well defined and reveals the invariant sets, namely, a finite number of basins of attraction. We provide a characterization of invariant sets in the quasiperiodically forced systems. A theoretical result on uniform boundedness of the invariant sets is presented. The series of theoretical results enables numerical analysis of invariant sets in the quasiperiodically forced systems based on the ergodic partition and time-averages. Using this, we analyze a nonlinear model of complex power grids that represents the short-term swing instability, named the coherent swing instability. We show that our theoretical results can be used to understand stability regions in such complex systems.},

For the continuous and discrete Kuramoto models with time delay on a general digraph, we provide two frameworks leading to the complete synchronization in terms of system parameters (maximal time delay and depth of spanning tree) and initial data. In related literature on Cucker--Smale flocking, the linear structure of the velocity coupling is crucially used in the matrix theory-based approach. However, the phase coupling function in the Kuramoto model is sinusoidal so that we cannot use the matrix theory directly as it is. To circumvent this difficulty, we lift the Kuramoto model to the second-order system by introducing an auxiliary frequency variable. In this second-order formulation, the Kuramoto model enjoys several similar mathematical structures as for the Cucker--Smale flocking model. Then we use a network structure containing a spanning tree and inductive argument on the propagation of frequency information along a spanning tree in the network to derive a complete synchronization estimate.},

This allows us to initialize the continuation of codimension one equilibria and cycle bifurcations emanating from these codimension two bifurcation points. The normal form coefficients are derived in the functional analytic perturbation framework for dual semigroups (sun-star calculus) using a normalization technique based on the Fredholm alternative. The obtained expressions give explicit formulas which have been implemented in the freely available numerical software package DDE-BifTool. While our theoretical results are proven to apply more generally, the software implementation and examples focus on DDEs with finitely many discrete delays. Together with the continuation capabilities of DDE-BifTool, this provides a powerful tool to study the dynamics near equilibria of such DDEs. The effectiveness is demonstrated on various models.},

For the case of countable state set, characterization of synchronization is provided in term of the spectral subspace corresponding to the Lyapunov exponent $-\infty$. In addition, for cases of both finite and countable state sets, the mechanism of partial synchronization is described by partitioning the state set into synchronized subsets.

We focus on identifying parameter regimes supporting experimentally observed decrease in oscillation amplitude and loss of anti-phase stability that has inspired the development of the HKB model. We show that a combination of cross-talk and nonlinearity in the coupling, along with physiologically relevant time delay, is able to quantitatively account for both drop in oscillation amplitude and loss of anti-phase stability in a frequency dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transition between discrete and rhythmic movements could be captured by this model.

We find several classes of continuous families of periodic orbits (principal periodic orbits) of this system, and we analyze their stability. In particular, these principal periodic orbits are stable both when the dumbbell arm points to the primary body and for a large circular orbital radius. At all times, this class of stable orbits has one of the dumbbell masses closer to the primary body, implying that axisymmetric bodies captured in these orbits have a hidden face relative to the primary body. This is an example of synchronous rotation without tidal locking. Moreover, we show that periodic points of the Poincaré map of the equations of motion do not necessarily correspond to periodic orbits of the dumbbell, which is a consequence of one of the symmetries of the Hamiltonian of the KD system.},

  abstract     = {A common method for analyzing the effects of molecular noise in chemical reaction networks is to approximate the underlying chemical master equation by a Fokker--Planck equation and to study the statistics of the associated chemical Langevin equation. This so-called system-size expansion involves performing a perturbation expansion with respect to a small dimensionless parameter $\epsilon =\Omega^{-1}$, where $\Omega$ characterizes the system size. For example, $\Omega$ could be the mean number of proteins produced by a gene regulatory network. In the deterministic limit $\Omega\rightarrow \infty$, the chemical reaction network evolves according to a system of ordinary differential equations based on classical mass action kinetics. In this paper we develop a phase reduction method for chemical reaction networks that support a stable limit cycle in the deterministic limit. We present a variational principle for the phase reduction, yielding an exact analytic expression for the resulting phase dynamics. We demonstrate that this decomposition is accurate over timescales that are exponential in the system size $\Omega$. This contrasts with the phase equation obtained under the system-size expansion, which is only accurate up to times $O(\Omega)$. In particular, we show that for a constant $C$, the probability that the system leaves an $O(\zeta)$ neighborhood of the limit cycle before time $T$ scales as $T\exp(-C\Omega b\zeta^2)$, where $b$ is the rate of attraction to the limit cycle. We illustrate our analysis using the example of a chemical Brusselator.},

In spite of recent progress toward data based inference of single-layer networks, to reconstruct complex systems with a multiplex structure remains largely open. In this paper, we articulate a mean-field based maximum likelihood estimation framework to address this problem. In a concrete manner, we reconstruct a class of prototypical duplex network systems hosting two categories of spreading dynamics, and we show that the structures of both layers can be simultaneously reconstructed from time series data. In addition to validating the framework using empirical and synthetic duplex networks, we carry out a detailed analysis to elucidate the impacts of network and dynamics parameters on the reconstruction accuracy and the robustness.},

Such barriers and enhancers of transport can be located directly from the deterministic component of the velocity field without diffusive or stochastic simulations. Here we extend these results to compressible flows and to diffusive concentration fields affected by sources or sinks, as well as by spontaneous decay. We construct diffusive transport extremizers with and without constraining them on a specific initial concentration distribution. For two-dimensional flows, we obtain explicit differential equations and a diagnostic scalar field that identify the most observable extremizers with pointwise uniform transport density. We illustrate our results by uncovering diffusion barriers and enhancers in analytic, numerical, and observational velocity fields.},

  abstract     = {A recently introduced technique, local orthogonal rectification (LOR), provides a way to derive coordinate systems that are tailored to locating objects of interest within flows in arbitrary dimensions. In this work, we apply LOR to identify periodic orbits and study the transient dynamics nearby. In the LOR method, the standard approach of finding periodic orbits by solving for fixed points of a Poincaré return map is replaced by the solution of a boundary value problem with fixed endpoints, and the computation provides information about the stability of the identified orbit. We detail the general method and derive theory to show that once a periodic orbit has been identified with LOR, the LOR coordinate system allows us to characterize the stability of the periodic orbit, to continue the orbit with respect to system parameters, to identify invariant manifolds attendant to the periodic orbit, and to compute the asymptotic phase associated with points in a neighborhood of the periodic orbit in a novel way. All of this analysis can be done in a computationally synergistic manner within the “one-stop shop” of the LOR framework. We illustrate these ideas, along with the importance of the invariant manifolds for organizing the flow in the approach to a stable periodic orbit in $\mathbb{R}^3$, using the Goodwin oscillator and a polynomial system featuring a period-doubling bifurcation.},
