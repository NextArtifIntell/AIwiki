  abstract     = {A recent problem of interest in inverse problems has been the study of eigenvalue problems arising from scattering theory and their potential use as target signatures in nondestructive testing of materials. Toward this pursuit we introduce a new eigenvalue problem related to Maxwell&#39;s equations that is generated from a comparison of measured scattering data to that of a nonstandard auxiliary scattering problem. This choice of auxiliary problem permits the application of regularity results for Maxwell&#39;s equations in order to show that a related interior transmission problem possesses the Fredholm property, which is used to establish that the eigenvalues are discrete. We investigate the properties of this new class of eigenvalues and show that the eigenvalues may be determined from measured scattering data, concluding with a simple demonstration of this result.},

  abstract     = {The monotonicity-based approach has become one of the fundamental methods for reconstructing inclusions in the inverse problem of electrical impedance tomography. Thus far, the method has not been proven to be able to handle extreme inclusions that correspond to some parts of the studied domain becoming either perfectly conducting or perfectly insulating. The main obstacle has arguably been establishing suitable monotonicity principles for the corresponding Neumann-to-Dirichlet boundary maps. In this work, we tackle this shortcoming by first giving a convergence result in the operator norm for the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map when the conductivity coefficient decays to zero and/or grows to infinity in some given parts of the domain. This allows passing the necessary monotonicity principles to the limiting case. Subsequently, we show how the monotonicity method generalizes to not only the definite case of reconstructing either perfectly conducting or perfectly insulating inclusions but also the indefinite case where the perturbed conductivity can take any values between, and including, zero and infinity.},

Nonlinear Helmholtz eigenfunctions with $N[u]= \pm |u|^{p-1} u$ were first considered by Gutiérrez [Math. Ann., 328 (2004), pp. 1--25]. We show that for suitable nonlinearities and for every $f \in H^{k+4}(\mathbb{S}^{n-1})$ of sufficiently small norm, there is a nonlinear Helmholtz function taking the form $u(r, \omega) = r^{-(n-1)/2} ( e^{-i\lambda r} f(\omega) + e^{+i\lambda r} b(\omega) + O(r^{-\epsilon})), \text{ as } r \to \infty, \quad \epsilon &gt; 0$, for some $b \in H^{k}(\mathbb{S}^{n-1})$. Moreover, we prove the result in the general setting of asymptotically conic manifolds. The proof uses an elaboration of anisotropic Sobolev spaces defined by Vasy [A minicourse on microlocal analysis for wave propagation, in Asymptotic Analysis in General Relativity, London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser. 443, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2018, pp. 219--374], between which the Helmholtz operator $\Delta - \lambda^2$ acts invertibly. These spaces have a variable spatial weight $\mathsf{l}_\pm$, varying in phase space and distinguishing between the two “radial sets” corresponding to incoming oscillations, $e^{-i\lambda r}$, and outgoing oscillations, $e^{+i\lambda r}$. Our spaces have, in addition, module regularity with respect to two different “test modules” and have algebra (or pointwise multiplication) properties that allow us to treat nonlinearities $N[u]$ of the form specified above.},

For a porous domain that is perforated by cavities with diameter proportional to their mutual distance the homogenization limit is analyzed. We extend the results for compressible one-phase flow with polytropic pressure laws and prove that the effective motion is governed by a nonlocal version of the Cahn--Hilliard equation. Crucial for the analysis is the convolution-like structure of the nonlocal capillarity term that allows us to equip the system with a generalized convex free energy. Moreover, the capillarity term accounts not only for the energetic interaction within the fluid but also for the interaction with a solid wall boundary.},

Our approach relies on a quite accurate dispersive analysis for the acoustic part, governed by the well-known Bogoliubov dispersion relation for the elementary excitations of the weakly interacting Bose gas. Once we have a control of the acoustic dispersion, the a priori bounds provided by the energy and Bresch--Desjardins entropy type estimates lead to the strong convergence. Moreover, for well-prepared data we show that the limit is a Leray weak solution, namely, it satisfies the energy inequality.

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the study of the stability of the steady normal shock structure in potential flows under an unsteady perturbation. The dynamic stability problem is formulated as the well-posedness problem of an initial boundary value problem of a nonlinear wave equation in a cornered space domain with a free boundary. The corner singularity is the essential difficulty and there is no result available even for the linear problem without the symmetry assumptions, i.e., “even” or “odd” traces vanish on the solid boundary, which allows extension from the cornered space domain to the half-space domain, as in the previous works. In this paper, we first obtain an existence result for the initial boundary value problem of linear hyperbolic equations of second order in a cornered space domain without such symmetry assumptions. The key idea is based on the construction of a new auxilliary problem, which allows us to reduce the linear problem to a new one that can be even extended to a half-space domain such that the existence of $H_\eta^2$-solutions can be established. However, due to the lack of the symmetry assumptions, the low regularity of the extended coefficients block us from obtaining the higher regularity of the solutions in the extended domain, which is necessary for the iteration to the nonlinear problem. In order to deal with it, new hyperbolic type and elliptic type estimates in the cornered space domain are established carefully. The results on the general linear problems can be applied to the linearized problem that we are concerned with in this paper. Due to the loss of regularity in the estimates of the linearized problem, a modified Nash--Moser iteration is developed.},

We prove flocking behavior---the emergence of global alignment for regular, nonvacuous solutions of the $n$-dimensional models based on short-range topological communication. Moreover, global regularity (and hence unconditional flocking) of the one-dimensional model is proved via an application of a De Giorgi-type method. To handle the nonsymmetric singular kernels that arise with our topological communication, we develop a new analysis for local fractional elliptic operators (interesting in its own right) encountered in the construction of our class of models.},

The inequality that we prove in $L^p$ holds for practically any thin domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^3$ and any vector field ${$u$}\in W^{1,p}(\Omega).$ The constants in the estimate are asymptotically optimal in terms of the domain thickness $h.$ This in particular solves the problem of finding the asymptotics of the optimal constant in the classical Korn second inequality in $L^p$ for thin domains in terms of the domain thickness in almost full generality. The remarkable fact is that the interpolation inequality reduces the problem of estimating the gradient $\nabla{$u$}$ in terms of the strain $e({$u$})$ to the easier problem of estimating only the vector field ${$u$}$ in terms of $e({$u$}),$ which is a Korn--Poincaré inequality.},

Under the assumption that the initial perturbation around an equilibrium state is sufficiently small, the global well-posedness issue has been established in [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 48 (2016), pp. 3090--3122]. However, as indicated by Choi, the large-time behavior of these solutions has remained an open problem. In this article, we resolve this problem by proving convergence to its associated equilibrium with the optimal rate which is the same as that of the heat equation. Particularly, the optimal convergence rates of the higher-order spatial derivatives of the solutions are also obtained. Moreover, for well-chosen initial data, we also show the lower bounds on the convergence rates. Our method is based on Hodge decomposition, low-frequency and high-frequency decomposition, delicate spectral analysis, and energy methods.},

We prove the existence of center-manifolds for generic models of this type, and study the reduced, finite-dimensional dynamics near bifurcations of (possibly) patterned steady states in the layer problem. Theoretical results are complemented with detailed examples and numerical simulations covering systems of local and nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations, neural field models, and delay-differential equations. We provide analytical foundations for numerical observations recently reported in the literature, such as spatio-temporal canards and slow passages through Hopf bifurcations in spatially extended systems subject to slow parameter variations. We also provide a theoretical analysis of slow passage through a Turing bifurcation in local and nonlocal models.},

More precisely, given a target function $u_T$ and a time horizon $T&gt;0$, we aim to construct all the initial conditions for which the viscosity solution coincides with $u_T$ at time $T$. As is common in this kind of nonlinear equation, the target might not be reachable. We first study the existence of at least one initial condition leading the system to the given target. The natural candidate, which indeed allows determining the reachability of $u_T$, is the one obtained by reversing the direction of time in the equation, considering $u_T$ as terminal condition. In this case, we use the notion of backward viscosity solution, which provides existence and uniqueness for the terminal-value problem. We also give an equivalent reachability condition based on a differential inequality, which relates the reachability of the target with its semiconcavity properties. Then, for the case when $u_T$ is reachable, we construct the set of all the initial conditions for which the viscosity solution coincides with $u_T$ at time $T$. Note that, in general, such initial conditions are not unique. Finally, for the case when the target $u_T$ is not necessarily reachable, we study the projection of $u_T$ on the set of reachable targets, obtained by solving the problem backward and then forward in time. This projection is then identified with the solution of a fully nonlinear obstacle problem and can be interpreted as the semiconcave envelope of $u_T$, i.e., the smallest reachable target bounded from below by $u_T$.},

We will demonstrate existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for $TV\cap L^{\infty}$ initial datum and provide stability estimates. Moreover, we investigate the convergence of the nonlocal transport equation to the corresponding local conservation law when the nonlocal reach tends to zero. For quadratic flux functions (including Burgers&#39; equation and the Lighthill--Whitham--Richards traffic flow model), we establish convergence to a weak solution of the local conservation law for “symmetric” nonlocal terms. For specific quasi-convex and quasi-concave initial datum we even obtain convergence to the local entropy solution. We demonstrate that for “nonsymmetric” nonlocal approximations the solution cannot converge to the entropy solution or even a weak solution. We conclude with additional numerical examples showing that convergence appears to hold for more general initial datum.},

  abstract     = {The ability to manipulate the propagation of waves on subwavelength scales is important for many different physical applications. In this paper, we consider a honeycomb-lattice of subwavelength resonators and prove, for the first time, the existence of a Dirac dispersion cone at subwavelength scales. As shown in [Ammari, Hiltunen, and Yu, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 238 (2020), pp. 1559--1583], near the Dirac points, the use of honeycomb crystals of subwavelength resonators as near-zero materials has great potential. Here, we perform the analysis for the example of bubbly crystals, which is a classic example of subwavelength resonance, where the resonant frequency of a single bubble is known as the Minnaert resonance. Our first result is to derive an asymptotic formula for the quasi-periodic Minnaert resonance frequencies close to the symmetry points K in the Brilloun zone. Then we obtain the linear dispersion relation of a Dirac cone. Our findings in this paper are illustrated in the case of circular bubbles, where the multipole expansion method provides an efficient technique for computing the band structure.},

  abstract     = {Transonic shocks play a pivotal role in design of supersonic nozzles in gas dynamics. Previous studies have shown that for stationary compressible Euler flows in rectilinear ducts with constant cross-sections, they are not stable under perturbations of upcoming supersonic flows and back pressures at the exits of the ducts, while expanding the nozzle and frictions have stabilization effects. In this paper we study the Rayleigh flows, namely the effects of heat-exchange, on stabilization of transonic shocks, in two-dimensional rectilinear ducts. We proved that for given heat-exchange per unit mass of gas, almost all the associated unidimensional transonic shocks are stable, provided that the perturbations of the upstream supersonic flows and downstream back pressures satisfy some symmetry conditions, while for given heat-exchange per unit volume of gas, the resultant unidimensional transonic shocks are not stable. Mathematically we study a nonlinear free-boundary problem of a system of conservation laws of hyperbolic-elliptic composite-mixed type. The proof depends on decoupling the elliptic and hyperbolic part of the subsonic Euler system in Lagrangian coordinates by characteristic decomposition. Since heat-exchange introduces complicated interactions in the Euler system, we need to study a general linear variable-coefficient first-order elliptic-hyperbolic strongly coupled system with nonlocal boundary conditions, by Fourier analysis and careful investigation of reduced boundary value problems of ordinary differential equations.},

Further, we prove that an admissible set of source functions (including harmonic functions) having a convex-polygonal support can be uniquely identified by a single far-field pattern. A class of radiating sources is characterized, and the extension of the radiated field across a corner point is proven impossible.

The flow satisfies the slip condition on the walls of the duct, and the state of the flow is given at the inlet of the duct. The solution is constructed by the method of characteristics. The main difficulty for the global existence is that a uniform a priori $C^1$ norm estimate of the solution is hard to obtain, especially when the solution tends to vacuum state. We derive a group of characteristic decompositions for the 2D steady full Euler system. Using these decompositions, we obtain uniform a priori estimates for the derivatives of the solution. A sufficient condition for the appearance of vacuum is also given. We show that if there is a vacuum then the vacuum is always adjacent to one of the walls, and the interface between gas and vacuum must be straight.

In the framework of ill-prepared initial data, we show the convergence in law to a weak martingale solution of a stochastic incompressible Navier--Stokes system. The result holds true for any arbitrary nonlinear forcing term with suitable growth. The proof is based on the analysis of acoustic waves but since we are dealing with a stochastic partial differential equation, the existing deterministic tools for treating this second-order equation break down. Although this might seem a minor modification, to handle the acoustic waves in the stochastic compressible Navier--Stokes system, we produce suitable dispersive estimate for a first-order system of equations, which are an added value to the existing theory. As a by-product of this dispersive estimate analysis, we are also able to prove a convergence result in the case of the zero-electron-mass limit for a stochastic fluid dynamical plasma model.},

  abstract     = {This paper rigorously establishes the stabilization effect of a background magnetic field on electrically conducting fluids, a phenomenon that has been widely observed in physical experiments and numerical simulations. This study is based on a 2 dimensional (2D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system in which the velocity equation involves no dissipation and there is only damping in the vertical component equation. Without the magnetic field, the corresponding vorticity equation is a 2D Euler-like equation with an extra Riesz transform type term. The global in time regularity and the stability near the trivial solution are well known open problems. When coupled with the magnetic field through the MHD system, the background magnetic field stabilizes the fluid, and the velocity as well as the vorticity remain small if they are initially so and decay algebraically in time. To overcome the difficulties due to the lack of full dissipation or damping, we construct suitable Lyapunov functionals and reduce the system to wave type equations.},

We study its time evolution in a mean-field limit where the number $N$ of charged particles gets large while the coupling to the radiation field is rescaled by $1/\sqrt{N}$. At time zero we assume almost all charged particles to be in the same one-body state (a Bose--Einstein condensate) and the photons to be close to a coherent state. In the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$ we show that the time evolution preserves the condensate as well as the coherent structure and that it can be approximated by the Maxwell--Schrödinger system, which models the coupling of a nonrelativistic particle to the classical electromagnetic field. Our result is obtained by an extension of the method of counting, introduced in [P. Pickl, Lett. Math.

Moreover, it is extended to allow for the study of the spectral problem associated with quadratic star-even operators, which arise when considering the spectral problem associated with second-order-in-time Hamiltonian PDEs. In conjunction with the Hamiltonian-Krein index (HKI) the Krein matrix is used to study two problems: conditions leading to Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcations for small spatially periodic waves, and the location and Krein signature of small eigenvalues associated with, e.g., $n$-pulse problems. For the first case we consider in detail a first-order-in-time fifth-order KdV-like equation. In the latter case we use a combination of Lin&#39;s method, the HKI, and the Krein matrix to study the spectrum associated with $n$-pulses for a second-order-in-time Hamiltonian system which is used to model the dynamics of a suspension bridge.},

We obtain explicit formulas of radially symmetric stationary solutions and such configurations give rise to the ring patterns and concentric airy patterns. These explicit formulas empower us to study the global bifurcation and asymptotic behaviors of the solutions, within which the cell population density has $\delta$-type spiky structures when the chemotaxis rate is large. The explicit formulas are also used to study the uniqueness and quantitative properties of nontrivial stationary radial patterns ruled by several threshold phenomena determined by the chemotaxis rate. We find that all nonconstant radial stationary solutions must have the cellular density be compactly supported unless for a discrete sequence of bifurcation values at which there exist strictly positive small-amplitude solutions. The hierarchy of free energy shows that in the radial class the inner ring solution has the least energy while the constant solution has the largest energy, and all these theoretical results are illustrated through bifurcation diagrams. A natural extension of our results to $\mathbb R^2$ yields the existence, uniqueness, and closed-form solution of the problem in this whole space. Our results are complemented by numerical simulations that demonstrate the existence of nonradial stationary solutions in the disk.},

Our approach is based on a new improvement of flatness argument together with an iteration process based on scaling arguments and perturbation by linear functions. Our results can be seen as an extension of the corresponding ones obtained in [L. Silvestre and B. Sirakov, Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 39 (2014), pp. 1694--1717] in the case of bounded coefficients and no quadratic term.},

  abstract     = {In recent years there has been an emerging interest in PDE-like flows defined on finite graphs, with applications in clustering and image segmentation. In particular for image segmentation and semisupervised learning Bertozzi and Flenner [Multiscale Model. Simul., 10 (2012), pp. 1090--1118] developed an algorithm based on the Allen--Cahn (AC) gradient flow of a graph Ginzburg--Landau functional, and Merkurjev, Kostić, and Bertozzi [SIAM J. Imaging Sci., 6 (2013), pp. 1903--1930] devised a variant algorithm based instead on graph Merriman--Bence--Osher (MBO) dynamics. This work offers rigorous justification for this use of the MBO scheme in place of AC flow. First, we choose the double-obstacle potential for the Ginzburg--Landau functional and derive well-posedness and regularity results for the resulting graph AC flow. Next, we exhibit a “semidiscrete” time-discretization scheme for AC flow of which the MBO scheme is a special case. We investigate the long-time behavior of this scheme and prove its convergence to the AC trajectory as the time-step vanishes. Finally, following a question raised by Van Gennip, Guillen, Osting, and Bertozzi [Milan J. Math., 82 (2014), pp. 3--65], we exhibit results toward proving a link between double-obstacle AC flow and mean curvature flow on graphs. We show some promising $\Gamma$-convergence results and translate to the graph setting two comparison principles used by Chen and Elliott [Proc. Math. Phys. Sci., 444 (1994), pp. 429--445] to prove the analogous link in the continuum.},

The functions in these estimates belong to a wider scope of (weighted) Lebesgue spaces than the previous regularizing estimates. For the estimates in homogeneous Sobolev spaces, never seen before, we only need functions lying in Lebesgue spaces instead of weighted Lebesgue spaces; i.e., no loss of weight occurs in this case.},

  abstract     = {A number of practically important imaging problems involve inverting the generalized Radon transform (GRT) ${\mathcal R}$ of a function $f$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. On the other hand, not much is known about the spatial resolution of the reconstruction from discretized data. In this paper we study how accurately and with what resolution the singularities of $f$ are reconstructed. The GRT integrates over a fairly general family of surfaces ${\mathcal S}_y$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Here $y$ is the parameter in the data space, which runs over an open set ${\mathcal V}\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. Assume that the data $g(y)=({\mathcal R} f)(y)$ are known on a regular grid $y_j$ with step-sizes $O(\epsilon)$ along each axis, and suppose ${\mathcal S}=\text{singsupp}(f)$ is a piecewise smooth surface. Let $f_\epsilon$ denote the result of reconstruction from the discrete data. We obtain explicitly the leading singular behavior of $f_\epsilon$ in an $O(\epsilon)$-neighborhood of a generic point $x_0\in{\mathcal S}$, where $f$ has a jump discontinuity. We also prove that under some generic conditions on ${\mathcal S}$ (which include, e.g., a restriction on the order of tangency of ${\mathcal S}_y$ and ${\mathcal S}$), the singularities of $f$ do not lead to nonlocal artifacts. For both computations, a connection with the uniform distribution theory turns out to be important. Finally, we present a numerical experiment, which demonstrates a good match between the theoretically predicted behavior and actual reconstruction.},

  abstract     = {The vortex method is a common numerical and theoretical approach used to implement the motion of an ideal flow, in which the vorticity is approximated by a sum of point vortices, so that the Euler equations read as a system of ordinary differential equations. Such a method is well justified in the full plane, thanks to the explicit representation formulas of Biot and Savart. In an exterior domain, we also replace the impermeable boundary by a collection of point vortices generating the circulation around the obstacle. The density of these point vortices is chosen in order that the flow remains tangent at midpoints between adjacent vortices and that the total vorticity around the obstacle is conserved. In this work, we provide a rigorous justification of this method for any smooth exterior domain, one of the main mathematical difficulties being that the Biot--Savart kernel defines a singular integral operator when restricted to a curve (here, the boundary of the domain). We also introduce an alternative method---the fluid charge method---which, as we argue, is better conditioned and therefore leads to significant numerical improvements.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and study a diffuse interface model describing cell motility. We provide a detailed rigorous analysis of the model in dimension 1 and formally derive the sharp interface limit in any dimension. The model integrates the most important physical processes involved in cell motility, such as incompressibility, internal stresses exerted by the cytoskeleton seen as an active gel, and dynamic contact lines. The resulting nonlinear system couples a degenerate fourth order parabolic equation of Cahn--Hilliard type for the phase variable with a convection-reaction-diffusion equation for the active potential. The sharp interface limit leads to a Hele-Shaw type free boundary problem which includes the effects of surface tension and an additional destabilizing term at the free boundary. This additional term can be seen as a nonlinear Robin type boundary condition with the “wrong” sign. Such a boundary condition reflects the active nature of the cell, e.g., protrusion formation. We rigorously investigate the properties of this model in one dimension and prove the appearance of nontrivial traveling wave solutions for the limit problem when the key physical parameter exceeds a certain critical value. Although minimal, this new Hele-Shaw model, with Robin&#39;s unconventional boundary condition, is rich enough to describe the universal property of migrating cells that has been recently described by various theoretical biophysical models.},

  abstract     = {The generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is a universal model for particle velocity in a viscoelastic medium. In this paper, we consider the GLE family with fractional memory kernels. We show that, in the critical regime where the memory kernel decays like $1/t$ for large $t$, the mean squared displacement (MSD) of particle motion grows linearly in time up to a slowly varying (logarithm) term. Moreover, we establish the well-posedness of the GLE in this regime. This solves an open question from [S. A. McKinley and H. D. Nguyen, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 50 (2018), pp. 5119--5160] and completes the answer to the conjecture put forward in [R. Morgado et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 89 (2002), 100601] on the relationship between memory kernel decay and anomalously diffusive behavior. Under slightly stronger assumptions on the memory kernel, we construct an Abelian-Tauberian framework that leads to robust bounds on the deviation of the MSD around its asymptotic trend. This bridges the gap between the GLE memory kernel and the spectral density of anomalously diffusive particle motion characterized in [G. Didier and K. Zhang, J. Time Ser. Anal., 38 (2017), pp. 395--416].},

The purpose of this paper is to show that the blow-up rate of the stress depends not only on the shape of the inclusions, but also on the given boundary data, when hard inclusions are close to the matrix boundary. First, when the boundary of inclusion is partially relatively parallel to that of the matrix, we establish the gradient estimates for Lamé systems with partially infinite coefficients and find that they are bounded for some boundary data $\varphi$ while some $\varphi$ will increase the blow-up rate. In order to identify such a novel blow-up phenomenon, we further consider the general $m$-convex inclusion cases and uncover the dependence of the blow-up rate on the inclusion&#39;s convexity $m$ and the boundary data&#39;s order of growth $k$ in all dimensions. In particular, the sharpness of these blow-up rates is also presented for some prescribed boundary data.},

This, in particular, gives a refined regularity scale for the multivariate Haar wavelets. The classification of attractors of the highest possible regularity is addressed. The relation between the surface regularity and the Hölder regularity of multivariate refinable functions and wavelets is found.

As a tool for variational problems, these are well-suited objects for the study (at different length-scales) of oscillation and concentration effects of convergent sequences of measures. Important properties of multiscale Young measures such as compactness, representation of nonlinear compositions, localization principles, and differential constraints are extensively developed in the second part of this paper.

We devise a scheme which, by appropriate rescaling of coefficients and finding a common reference space for all Feller semigroups involved, allows deriving the form of the limit equation formally.

  abstract     = {We consider several models (including both multidimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs), possibly ill-posed), subject to very strong damping and quasi-periodic external forcing. We are interested in studying response solutions (i.e., quasi-periodic solutions with the same frequency as the forcing). Under some regularity assumptions on the nonlinearity and forcing, without any arithmetic condition on the forcing frequency $\omega$, we show that the response solutions indeed exist. Moreover, the solutions we obtained possess optimal regularity in $\varepsilon$ (where $\varepsilon$ is the inverse of the coefficients multiplying the damping) when we consider $\varepsilon$ in a domain that does not include the origin $\varepsilon=0$ but has the origin on its boundary. We also show that response solutions are continuous in $\varepsilon$ at $0$. However, in general, the solutions may fail to be differentiable with respect to $\varepsilon$ at $\varepsilon=0$. In this paper, we allow multidimensional systems and we do not require that the unperturbed equations under consideration are Hamiltonian. One advantage of the method in the present paper is that it gives results for analytic, finitely differentiable and low regularity forcing, and nonlinearity, respectively. As a matter of fact, we do not even need that the forcing is continuous. Notably, we obtain results when the forcing is in $L^2$ space and the nonlinearity is just Lipschitz as well as in the case that the forcing is in $H^1$ space and the nonlinearity is $C^{1 + {Lip}}$. In the proof of our results, we reformulate the existence of response solutions as a fixed point problem in appropriate spaces of smooth functions.},

This is in particular the case for the time-harmonic Maxwell equations, whose solutions are the electromagnetic fields. In this paper, emphasis is put on the electric field. We study the regularity in terms of the fractional order Sobolev spaces $H^s$, $s\in[0,1]$. Precisely, our first goal is to determine the regularity of the electric field and of its curl, that is, to find some regularity exponent $\tau\in(0,1)$, such that they both belong to $H^s$, for all $s\in[0,\tau)$. After that, one can derive error estimates. Here, the error is defined as the difference between the exact field and its approximation, where the latter is built with Nédélec&#39;s first family of finite elements. In addition to the regularity exponent, one needs to derive a stability constant that relates the norm of the error to the norm of the data: this is our second goal. We provide explicit expressions for both the regularity exponent and the stability constant with respect to the coefficients. We also discuss the accuracy of these expressions, and we provide some numerical illustrations.},

We assume small data, analytic volume force, and no-slip boundary conditions. Analytic regularity is quantified in so-called countably normed, corner-weighted spaces with homogeneous norms. Implications of this analytic regularity include exponential smallness of Kolmogorov $N$-widths of solutions, exponential convergence rates of mixed $hp$-discontinuous Galerkin finite element and spectral element discretizations, and model order reduction techniques.},

Carleman, Acta Math., 60 (1933), pp. 91--146], and the initial argument of Carleman was developed in [A. Pulvirenti and B. Wennberg, Comm. Math. Phys., 183 (1997), pp. 145--160; C. Mouhot, Comm.

We answer this question and establish such a Gaussian lower bound for solutions to the Boltzmann equation without cutoff, in the case of hard and moderately soft potentials, with spatial periodic conditions, and under the sole assumption that hydrodynamic quantities (local mass, local energy, and local entropy density) remain bounded. The paper is mostly self-contained, apart from the $L^\infty$ upper bound and weak Harnack inequality on the solution established, respectively in [L. Silvestre, Comm. Math.

  abstract     = {The time evolution of a collisionless plasma is modeled by the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system which couples the Vlasov equation (the transport equation) with the Maxwell equations of electrodynamics. We consider the case that the plasma is located in a bounded container $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^3$, for example a fusion reactor. Furthermore, there are external currents, typically in the exterior of the container, that may serve as a control of the plasma if adjusted suitably. We model objects, which are placed in space, via given matrix-valued functions $\varepsilon$ (the permittivity) and $\mu$ (the permeability). A typical aim in fusion plasma physics is to keep the amount of particles hitting $\partial\Omega$ as small as possible (since they damage the reactor wall), while the control costs should not be too exhaustive (to ensure efficiency). This leads to a minimizing problem with a PDE constraint. This problem is analyzed in detail. In particular, we prove existence of minimizers and establish an approach to derive first order optimality conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the one-dimensional version of a specific member of the (abcd) family of Boussinesq systems having the higher possible dispersion and eigenvalues with nontrivial zeros. We will establish two different long time existence results for the solutions of the Cauchy problem. The first result concerns the system ${ {\partial}_t\zeta+(1+\partial_x^2)\partial_xv+\partial_x(\zeta v)=0,\, \partial_tv+(1+\partial_x^2)\partial_x\zeta+\frac{1}{2}\partial_x(v^2)=0}$ without a small parameter. If the initial data is of order $O(\varepsilon)$, we prove that the existence time scale is of $1/\varepsilon^{\frac{4}{3}}$, which improves the result $1/\varepsilon$ that could be obtained by a “dispersive&quot; method (that is, using essentially the dispersive properties of the linear part). The second result is about the system ${ \partial_t\zeta+(1+\epsilon\partial_x^2)\partial_xv+\epsilon\partial_x(\zeta v)=0,\, \partial_tv+(1+\epsilon\partial_x^2)\partial_x\zeta+\frac{\epsilon}{2}\partial_x(v^2)=0} $, which involves a small parameter $\epsilon$ in front of the dispersive and nonlinear terms and which is the form obtained when the system is derived from the water wave system in the KdV/Boussinesq regime. If the initial data is of order $O(1)$, we obtain the existence time scale $1/{\epsilon^{\frac{2}{3}}}$, which improves the result $1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$ obtained by a dispersive method. These results were not included in the previous papers dealing with similar issues because of the presence of zeros in the phases. The proof involves normal form transformations suitably modified away from the zero set of the phases.},

These metrics are natural discrete counterparts to the Kantorovich metric $\mathbb{W}_2$, defined using a Benamou--Brenier-type formula. Under mild assumptions we prove an asymptotic upper bound for the discrete transport metric $\mathcal{W}_\mathcal{T}$ in terms of $\mathbb{W}_2$, as the size of the mesh $\mathcal{T}$ tends to 0. However, we show that the corresponding lower bound may fail in general, even on certain one-dimensional and symmetric two-dimensional meshes. In addition, we show that the asymptotic lower bound holds under an isotropy assumption on the mesh, which turns out to be essentially necessary. This assumption is satisfied, e.g., for tilings by convex regular polygons, and it implies Gromov--Hausdorff convergence of the transport metric.},

We prove relative entropy and Wasserstein error estimates for the difference between the time marginals of the effective and original dynamics as well as an entropy error bound for the corresponding path space measures. A comparison with the averaging principle for systems with time-scale separation reveals that, unlike in the reversible setting, the effective dynamics for a nonreversible system need not agree with the averaged equations. We present a thorough comparison for the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process and make a conjecture about necessary and sufficient conditions for when averaged and effective dynamics agree for nonlinear nonreversible processes. The theoretical results are illustrated with suitable numerical examples.},

In some cases, we prove that the thickness of the interface is exactly of order $\varepsilon$, which is the optimal thickness estimate. We note that the comparison principle does not hold for our equation because of the nonlocal term so that the methods that were employed in the earlier studies of the standard Allen--Cahn equation do not work. We will therefore take a different approach, which is based on the fine analysis of the long-time behavior of the corresponding nonlocal ODEs and some energy estimates.},

Up to now rigorous justifications have only been obtained for dissipation functionals of the flow field. We prove that the formula holds on the level of the Stokes equation (with variable viscosity). We consider a regime where the number $N$ of particles suspended in the fluid goes to infinity while their size $R$ and the volume fraction $\phi=NR^3$ approach zero. We establish $L^\infty$ and $L^p$ estimates for the difference of the microscopic solution to the solution of the homogenized equation. Here we assume that the particles are contained in a bounded region and are well separated in the sense that the minimal distance is comparable to the average one.

Math. Sci., 15 (2017), pp. 165--184]. The Burgers--Hilbert equation is $u_t+(\frac{u^2}{2})_x={H}[u]$, where ${H}$ is the Hilbert transform, a nonlocal operator. We show stability and uniqueness for these solutions among a larger class than the uniqueness result in Bressan and Zhang. We show stability and uniqueness for the Bressan--Zhang solutions in the large class of solutions which are measurable and bounded, satisfy at least one entropy condition, and verify a strong trace condition. We do not have smallness assumptions. We make no assumptions on the discontinuities in the solutions we consider. We use the relative entropy method and theory of shifts (see Vasseur [Handbook of Differential Equations: Evolutionary Equations, 4 (2008), pp. 323--376]). Our results also apply to a more general class of nonlocal equations beyond the Burgers--Hilbert equation.},

Fundamental solutions of the transformed thermo-elasto-dynamic equations are constructed explicitly by the Hörmander method. Simple- and double-layer potential boundary integral operators are introduced in the transformed domain, and their coercivity is established. Based on the estimates of various boundary integral operators in the transformed domain, existence and uniqueness results of solutions are established in the time domain. These results may serve as a mathematical foundation for the semidiscretization and full-discretization schemes based on the boundary element method and the convolution quadrature method for time domain boundary integral equations arising in thermoelasticity.},

Assuming that $u_0$ is front-like, that is, $u_0(x)$ is close to $p(0)$ for $x\approx -\infty$ and close to $0$ for $x\approx \infty$, we aim to determine the long-time dynamical behavior of the solution $u(t,x)$ by using the notion of propagation terrace introduced by Ducrot, Giletti, and Matano [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 366 (2014), pp. 5541--5566]. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a propagating terrace for a very large class of nonlinearities and show the convergence of the solution $u(t,x)$ to the terrace as $t\to\infty$ under various conditions on $f$ or $u_0$. We first consider the special case where $u_0$ is a Heaviside type function and prove the converge result without requiring any nondegeneracy on $f$. Furthermore, if $u_0$ is more general such that it can be trapped between two Heaviside type functions, but not necessarily monotone, we show that the convergence result remains valid under a rather mild nondegeneracy assumption on $f$. Last, in the case where $f$ is a nondegenerate multistable nonlinearity, we show the global and exponential convergence for a much larger class of front-like initial data.},

Our proof relies on the study of a---self-similar---rescaled family of solutions. We first identify the asymptotic behavior of the solutions by deriving a convergence result in the sense of the Young measures. Then we strengthen this convergence by deriving suitable fractional Sobolev compactness estimates. As a by-product, our main result allows us to obtain asymptotic results for a class of piecewise constant stochastic processes with memory.},

  abstract     = {In order to study the asymptotic behavior of a fluid in a domain of small thickness $\varepsilon$, it is common to use that the norm of the pressure $p_\varepsilon$ in $L^q$, $q&gt;1$, is smaller than $C\|\nabla p_\varepsilon\|_{W^{-1,q}}/\varepsilon$. Our purpose in the present paper is to improve this estimate by showing that in fact $p_\varepsilon$ can be decomposed as the sum of two terms: the first one is of order $1/\varepsilon$ with respect to $\nabla p_\varepsilon$ but it belongs to the Sobolev space $W^{1,q}$ and not only to $L^q$; the second one only belongs to $L^q$ but it is of order one with respect to $\nabla p_\varepsilon$. This result also allows us to improve the classical estimate for Korn&#39;s constant in an elastic thin domain providing a decomposition of the deformation which contains terms with a stronger regularity. The advantage of these expansions is that they simplify the study of the asymptotic behavior of continuum mechanics problems in thin domains since they give an additional compactness. As examples we provide two applications in fluid mechanics and linear elasticity.},

In this model, each particle $i$ carries two attributes: the spatial location $X_t^i\in \mathbb{T}^d$, and the type $\Xi_t^i\in {1,\ldots,n}$. While $X_t^i$ is a standard (independent) diffusion process, the evolution of the type $\Xi_t^i$ is described by pairwise interactions between different particles under a series of chemical reactions described by a chemical reaction network. We prove that, as $N \to \infty$, the stochastic system has a mean field limit which is described by a nonlocal reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. In particular, we obtain a quantitative propagation of chaos result for the interacting particle system. Our proof is based on the relative entropy method used recently by Jabin and Wang [Invent. Math., 214 (2018), pp. 523--591]. The key ingredient of the relative entropy method is a large deviation estimate for a special partition function, which was proved previously by combinatorial estimates.

It is shown that when posed with no-flux/no-flux/Dirichlet boundary conditions in smoothly bounded planar domains and along with appropriate assumptions on regularity of the initial data, under a smallness condition exclusively involving the total initial population mass $m$ an associated initial-boundary value problem admits a globally defined generalized solution; in particular, this hypothesis is fully explicit and independent of the initial size of further solution components. Moreover, the obtained solution is seen to enjoy a certain temporally averaged boundedness property which, inter alia, rules out any finite-time collapse into persistent Dirac-type measures, as well as convergence to such singular profiles in the large time limit.},

In this paper, we consider its general type, called the Kuramoto--Daido model, and provide local sensitivity analysis for the Kuramoto--Daido model with random inputs in initial data, distributed natural frequencies, coupling strengths, and coupling functions. This model exhibits interplay between random effects and synchronization nonlinearity. Our local sensitivity analysis provides some understanding on the robustness of emergent dynamics of the random Kuramoto--Daido model in a large coupling regime, including propagation and asymptotic decay of uncertainties and continuous dependence of phase and frequency variations in the random parameter space with respect to the variations on the initial data.},

There is a parameter $b$ in [0,1] and the type of the lattice associated with a minimal assembly varies depending on $b$. There are several thresholds defined by a number $B=0.1867\ldots.$ If $b \in [0, B)$, a minimal assembly is associated with a rectangular lattice whose ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is in $[\sqrt{3}, 1)$; if $b \in [B, 1-B]$, a minimal assembly is associated with a square lattice; if $b \in (1-B, 1]$, a minimal assembly is associated with a rhombic lattice with an acute angle in $[\frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{\pi}{2})$. Only when $b=1$ is this rhombic lattice a hexagonal lattice.

The main access to the problem is chosen through the Hamiltonian representation of any Vlasov system, first put forward in [J. Fröhlich, A. Knowles, and S. Schwarz, Comm. Math. Phys., 288 (2009), pp. 1023--1059] and generalized in [R. A. Neiss and P. Pickl, J. Stat. Phys., 178 (2020), pp. 472--498; R. A. Neiss, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 231 (2019), pp. 115--151]. The method transforms the problem into a setup of complex valued $\mathcal{L}^2$ functions with phase equivariant Hamiltonian. Through Marsden--Weinstein symmetry reduction [J. Marsden and A. Weinstein, Rep. Math. Phys., 5 (1974), pp. 121--130], the problem is mapped on a Hamiltonian system on the quotient manifold $\mathbb{S}^{\mathcal{L}^2}/\mathbb{S}^1$, which actually proves to be necessary to close many trajectories of the dynamics. As a toy model to apply the method we use the harmonic Vlasov system, a nonrelativistic Vlasov equation with attractive harmonic two-body interaction potential. The simple structure of this model allows us to compute all of its solutions directly and therefore test the benefits of the Hamiltonian formalism and symmetry reduction in Vlasov systems.},

In a mesoscopic regime, it is well known that the dynamics of a large Kuramoto ensemble in a random media is governed by the Kuramoto--Sakaguchi--Fokker--Planck (in short, parabolic Kuramoto--Sakaguchi) equation for one-oscillator distribution function. For this parabolic Kuramoto--Sakaguchi equation, we present a global existence of weak solutions in any finite-time interval. Furthermore, we rescale the kinetic equation using the diffusion scaling, and formally derive a drift-diffusion equation by using Hilbert-like expansion in a small parameter $\varepsilon$. For the rigorous justification of this asymptotic limit, we introduce a new free energy functional ${\mathcal E}$ consisting of total mass, kinetic energy, entropy functional, and interaction potential and show the uniform boundedness of this free energy with respect to the small parameter $\varepsilon$. This uniform boundedness of ${\mathcal E}$ combined with $L^1$-compactness argument enables us to derive the drift-diffusion equation. We also classified all ${\mathcal C}^2$-stationary solutions to the drift-diffusion equation in terms of synchronization parameters $\kappa$ and $\sigma$.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to an analysis of singular perturbations of inequality problems. For a general variational-hemivariational inequality, it is shown rigorously that under appropriate conditions, as the singular perturbation parameter approaches zero, the solution of the singularly perturbed problem converges to the solution of the limiting problem. As corollaries of this general result, we have similar convergence results for singularly perturbed problems of “pure” hemivariational inequalities and of variational inequalities. The results are illustrated in the study of an obstacle plate bending problem.},

The initial values are merely $L^2$ functions with possibly infinite energy. In this context, the notion of integral convexity, i.e., the convexity of the variational integral and not of the integrand, plays the crucial role; surprisingly, this type of convexity is weaker than the convexity of the integrand. We demonstrate this by means of certain quasi-convex and nonconvex integrands.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we are concerned with the system of Euler equations with time-dependent damping like $-\frac{\mu}{(1+t)^\lambda}u$ for physical parameters $\lambda\ge 0$ and $\mu&gt;0$. It is well known that, when $0\le \lambda1$, the damping effect becomes really weak and can be neglected, which makes the dynamic system essentially behave like a hyperbolic system, and the singularity of solutions like shock waves will form. However, in the critical case $\lambda=1$, when $02$, the system is expected to possess global solutions. Here, we are particularly interested in the asymptotic behavior of the solutions in the critical case. By a heuristical analysis (variable scaling technique), we realize that, in this critical case, the hyperbolicity and the damping effect both play crucial roles and cannot be neglected. We first artfully construct the asymptotic profile, a special linear wave equation with time-dependent damping, which is totally different from the case of $0\leq\lambda0$, whose profile is a self-similar solution to the corresponding parabolic equation. Then we rigorously prove that the solutions time-asymptotically converge to the solutions of linear wave equations with critical time-dependent damping. The convergence rates shown are optimal, by comparing with the linearized equations. The proof is based on the technical time-weighted energy method, where the time-weight is dependent on the parameter $\mu$.},

For a positive volume fraction of holes, the approach is just the standard oscillating test function method; for a vanishing volume fraction of holes, we study asymptotic behaviors of properly rescaled cell problems and use them to build oscillating test functions.

First, assuming that the drift ${b}$ has nonnegative weak divergence in $L^{n/2, \infty }(\Omega )$, we establish existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ or $D^{1,p}(\Omega)$ for any $p$ with $n&#39; = n/(n-1)0$ when the domain $\Omega$ is bounded. These gradient estimates go beyond the borderlines and are based on the global Hölder regularity by the De Giorgi--Nash--Moser methods as well as the Miranda--Nirenberg interpolation inequalities. By duality, these results enable us to obtain a quite general uniqueness result as well as an existence result for weak solutions belonging to $\bigcap_{p&lt; n&#39; }W^{1,p}(\Omega)$. Finally, we prove a uniqueness result for exterior problems, which implies in particular that (very weak) solutions are unique in both $L^{n/(n-2),\infty}(\Omega)$ and $L^{n,\infty}(\Omega )$.},

  abstract     = {We study the eigenvalue problem for a one-dimensional Dirac operator with a spatially varying “mass” term. It is well-known that when the mass function has the form of a kink, or domain wall, transitioning between strictly positive and strictly negative asymptotic mass, $\pm\kappa_\infty$, at $\pm\infty$, the Dirac operator has a simple eigenvalue of zero energy (geometric multiplicity equal to one) within a gap in the continuous spectrum, with corresponding exponentially localized zero mode. We consider the eigenvalue problem for the one-dimensional Dirac operator with mass function defined by “gluing” together $n$ domain wall--type transitions, assuming that the distance between transitions, $2 \delta$, is sufficiently large, focusing on the illustrative cases $n = 2$ and $3$. When $n = 2$ we prove that the Dirac operator has two real simple eigenvalues of opposite sign and of order $e^{- 2 |\kappa_\infty| \delta}$. The associated eigenfunctions are, up to $L^2$ error of order $e^{- 2 |\kappa_\infty| \delta}$, linear combinations of shifted copies of the single domain wall zero mode. For the case $n = 3$, we prove the Dirac operator has two nonzero simple eigenvalues as in the two domain wall case and a simple eigenvalue at energy zero. The associated eigenfunctions of these eigenvalues can again, up to small error, be expressed as linear combinations of shifted copies of the single domain wall zero mode. When $n &gt; 3$ no new technical difficulty arises and the result is similar. Our methods are based on a Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction/Schur complement strategy, which maps the Dirac operator eigenvalue problem for eigenstates with near-zero energies to the problem of determining the kernel of an $n \times n$ matrix reduction, which depends nonlinearly on the eigenvalue parameter. The class of Dirac operators we consider controls the bifurcation of topologically protected “edge states” from Dirac points (linear band crossings) for classes of Schrödinger operators with domain wall modulated periodic potentials in one and two space dimensions. The present results may be used to construct a rich class of defect modes in periodic structures modulated by multiple domain walls.},

  abstract     = {We are concerned with the suitability of the main models of compressible fluid dynamics for the Lighthill problem for shock diffraction by a convex corned wedge, by studying the regularity of solutions of the problem, which can be formulated as a free boundary problem. In this paper, we prove that there is no regular solution that is subsonic up to the wedge corner for potential flow. This indicates that, if the solution is subsonic at the wedge corner, at least a characteristic discontinuity (vortex sheet or entropy wave) is expected to be generated, which is consistent with the experimental and computational results. Therefore, the potential flow equation is not suitable for the Lighthill problem so that the compressible Euler system must be considered. In order to achieve the nonexistence result, a weak maximum principle for the solution is established, and several other mathematical techniques are developed. The methods and techniques developed here are also useful to the other problems with similar difficulties.},

  abstract     = {The work presented here emanates from questions arising from experimental observations of the propagation of surface water waves. The experiments in question featured a periodically moving wavemaker located at one end of a flume that generated unidirectional waves of relatively small amplitude and long wavelength when compared with the undisturbed depth. It was observed that the wave profile at any point down the channel very quickly became periodic in time with the same period as that of the wavemaker. One of the questions dealt with here is whether or not such a property holds for model equations for such waves. In the present discussion, this is examined in the context of the Korteweg--de Vries equation using the recently developed version of the inverse scattering theory for boundary-value problems put forward by Fokas and his collaborators. It turns out that solutions of the Korteweg--de Vries equation generated by periodic forcing at the boundary do exhibit asymptotic temporal periodicity at any fixed point down the channel. However, a more subtle issue to do with conservation of mass fails to hold at the second order in a small parameter, which is the typical wave amplitude divided by the undisturbed depth.},

Moreover, we give a condition on the growth rate of the initial tangential velocity such that there is a back-flow point of the Prandtl boundary layer under the adverse pressure gradient. In the appendix, we present two examples showing that the back-flow point appears either when the flow distance is long in the streamwise direction for a given initial monotonic tangential velocity field or when the initial tangential velocity grows slowly in a large neighborhood of the boundary for a fixed flow distance in the streamwise direction.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with resolvent estimates on the real axis for the Helmholtz equation posed in the exterior of a bounded obstacle with Dirichlet boundary conditions when the obstacle is trapping. There are two resolvent estimates for this situation currently in the literature: (i) in the case of elliptic trapping the general “worst case” bound of exponential growth applies, and examples show that this growth can be realized through some sequence of wavenumbers; (ii) in the prototypical case of hyperbolic trapping where the Helmholtz equation is posed in the exterior of two strictly convex obstacles (or several obstacles with additional constraints) the nontrapping resolvent estimate holds with a logarithmic loss. This paper proves the first resolvent estimate for parabolic trapping by obstacles, studying a class of obstacles the prototypical example of which is the exterior of two squares (in two dimensions) or two cubes (in three dimensions), whose sides are parallel. We show, via developments of the vector-field/multiplier argument of Morawetz and the first application of this methodology to trapping configurations, that a resolvent estimate holds with a polynomial loss over the nontrapping estimate. We use this bound, along with the other trapping resolvent estimates, to prove results about integral equation formulations of the boundary value problem in the case of trapping. Feeding these bounds into existing frameworks for analyzing finite and boundary element methods, we obtain the first wavenumber-explicit proofs of convergence for numerical methods for solving the Helmholtz equation in the exterior of a trapping obstacle.},

We show that this distribution generically concentrates in precisely one well of $f|_{\overline\Omega}$ when $h\to 0^{+}$ but can nevertheless concentrate in both wells when $f|_{\overline\Omega}$ admits sufficient symmetries. This phenomenon corresponds to the so-called tunneling effect in semiclassical analysis. We also investigate in this setting the asymptotic behavior when $h\to 0^{+}$ of the first exit point distribution from $\Omega$ of $(X_t)_{t\ge 0}$ when $X_0$ is distributed according to the quasi-stationary distribution.},

We find that in order to be able to capture partial swelling in the long term the new model requires fewer structural assumptions on the nonlinear swelling rates than were required for a model with linear diffusion. Furthermore, if the nonlinear diffusion effects for calcium ions dominate over their production, in the long term all mitochondria will either be still intact or have completed swelling. On the other hand, if the calcium ion production dominates the nonlinear diffusion effects, some mitochodria will also remain in the intermediate state where swelling has been initiated but not completed.},

The main purpose of the present paper is to fill this gap by deriving simple (inverse) factorial expansions for these functions and provide sharp and realistic bounds on their error terms. Analogous results for the Ferrers functions and the closely related Gegenbauer function are also included. In the cases that \nu is an integer or 2\mu is an odd integer, many of these new expansions terminate and provide finite representations in terms of simple functions. Most of these representations appear to be new. It is well known that the hypergeometric series can be regarded as a large-c asymptotic expansion for the hypergeometric function F(a,b;c;z). We also derive computable bounds for the remainder term of this expansion. To the best of our knowledge, no such estimates have been given in the literature prior to this paper.},

For a better description of short-range interactions of the material with the solid wall, various dynamic boundary conditions have been considered in recent times. In this paper we study a Cahn--Hilliard model with a dynamic boundary condition that has recently been proposed by Liu and Wu [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 233 (2019), pp. 167--247]. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a global weak solution to this model by interpreting the problem as a suitable gradient flow of the total free energy which contains volume as well as surface contributions. The formulation involves an inner product which couples bulk and surface quantities in an appropriate way. For our proof we use an implicit time discretization and we show that the obtained approximate solutions converge to a weak solution of the Cahn--Hilliard system. We point out that Liu and Wu used a slightly stronger notion of a weak solution in their corresponding well-posedness result. However, they needed very strong assumptions on the domain and its boundary which are not necessary for our approach.},

As recently shown by Lannes, the equations for the fluid motion can be reduced to a set of two evolution equations on the surface elevation and the horizontal discharge. The presence of the object is accounted for by a constraint on the discharge under the object; the pressure exerted by the fluid on this object is then the Lagrange multiplier associated with this constraint. Our goal in this paper is to prove the well-posedness of this fluid-structure interaction problem in the shallow water approximation under the assumption that the flow is axisymmetric without swirl. We write the fluid equations as a quasilinear hyperbolic mixed initial boundary value problem and the solid equation as a second order ODE coupled to the fluid equations. Finally we prove the local in time well-posedness for this coupled problem, provided some compatibility conditions on the initial data are satisfied.},

Formally, the behavior of modulated periodic waves on large space and time scales may be described through the use of Whitham modulation theory. The application of Whitham theory, however, is based on formal asymptotic (WKB) methods, thus removing a layer of rigor that would otherwise support their predictions. In this study, we aim at rigorously verifying the predictions of the Whitham theory, as it pertains to the modulational stability of periodic waves, in the context of the so-called conduit equation, a nonlinear dispersive PDE governing the evolution of the circular interface separating a light, viscous fluid rising buoyantly through a heavy, more viscous, miscible fluid at small Reynolds numbers. In particular, using rigorous spectral perturbation theory, we connect the predictions of Whitham theory to the rigorous spectral (in particular, modulational) stability of the underlying wave trains. This makes rigorous recent formal results on the conduit equation obtained by Maiden and Hoefer.},

In all subdomains (the fracture and the adjacent matrix blocks) the flow is governed by Richards&#39; equation. The submodels are coupled by physical transmission conditions expressing the continuity of the normal fluxes and of the pressures. We start by analyzing the case of a fracture having a fixed width-length ratio, called $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. Then we take the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$ and give a rigorous proof for the convergence toward effective models. This is done in different regimes, depending on how the ratio of porosities and permeabilities in the fracture, respectively, in the matrix, scale in terms of $\varepsilon$, and leads to a variety of effective models. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical upscaling results.},

  abstract     = {In this work we investigate some regularization properties of the incompressible Euler equations and of the fractional Navier--Stokes equations where the dissipative term is given by $(-\Delta)^\alpha$ for a suitable power $\alpha \in (0,\frac{1}{2})$ (the only meaningful range for this result). Assuming that the solution $u \in L^\infty _t(C^\theta_x)$ for some $\theta \in (0,1)$ we prove that $u \in C^\theta_{t,x}$, the pressure $p\in C^{2\theta-}_{t,x}\cap C^0_t(C^{2\theta}_x)$, and the kinetic energy $e \in C^{\frac{2\theta}{1-\theta}}_t$. This result was obtained for the Euler equations in [P. Isett, Regularity in time along the coarse scale flow for the incompressible Euler equations, ŭlhttps://arXiv.org/abs/1307.0565, 2013] with completely different arguments and we believe that our proof, based on a regularization and a commutator estimate, gives a simpler insight into the result.},

  abstract     = {This work considers properties of the logarithm of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet boundary map for the conductivity equation in a Lipschitz domain. It is shown that the mapping from the (logarithm of) the conductivity, i.e., the (logarithm of) the coefficient in the divergence term of the studied elliptic partial differential equation, to the logarithm of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map is continuously Fréchet differentiable between natural topologies. Moreover, for any essentially bounded perturbation of the conductivity, the Fréchet derivative defines a bounded linear operator on the space of square integrable functions living on the domain boundary, although the logarithm of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map itself is unbounded in that topology. In particular, it follows from the fundamental theorem of calculus that the difference between the logarithms of any two Neumann-to-Dirichlet maps is always bounded on the space of square integrable functions. All aforementioned results also hold if the Neumann-to-Dirichlet boundary map is replaced by its inverse, i.e., the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.},

The main interest of the present paper is that it applies to a wide variety of force fields with a polynomial growth at infinity. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution in weighted Lebesgue spaces depending on $E$ under the form of a strongly continuous semigroup. We also prove the existence and uniqueness of a stationary state, by using an appropriate splitting of the fractional Laplacian and by proving a weak and strong maximum principle. We then study the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the solution. The semigroup has a property of regularization in fractional Sobolev spaces, as well as a gain of integrability and positivity which we use to obtain polynomial or exponential convergence to equilibrium in weighted Lebesgue spaces.},

  abstract     = {We consider discrete analogues of two well-known open problems regarding invariant measures for dispersive PDE, namely, the invariance of the Gibbs measure for the continuum (classical) Heisenberg model and the invariance of white noise under focusing cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation. These continuum models are completely integrable and connected by the Hasimoto transform; correspondingly, we focus our attention on discretizations that are also completely integrable and also connected by a discrete Hasimoto transform. We consider these models on the infinite lattice ${\mathbb{Z}}$. Concretely, for a completely integrable variant of the classical Heisenberg spin chain model (introduced independently by Haldane, Ishimori, and Sklyanin) we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for initial data following a Gibbs law (which we show is unique) and show that the Gibbs measure is preserved under these dynamics. In the setting of the focusing Ablowitz--Ladik system, we prove invariance of a measure that we will show is the appropriate discrete analogue of white noise. We also include a thorough discussion of the Poisson geometry associated to the discrete Hasimoto transform introduced by Ishimori that connects the two models studied in this article.},

When $f$ is positive bistable, that is, $f$ has two positive stable equilibrium points, Kawai and Yamada [J. Differential Equations, 261 (2016), pp. 538--572] have shown that asymptotic behaviors of solutions (except for vanishing) as $t\to\infty$ can be mainly classified into two types of spreading phenomena, which correspond to two positive stable equilibrium points. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whole asymptotic profiles of solutions as $t\to\infty$ when spreading occurs. In particular, we will prove that, under certain conditions, any spreading solution which corresponds to a larger positive stable equilibrium point of $f$ approaches a so-called propagating terrace connecting 0 and the larger positive stable equilibrium point. This terrace function consists of a semi-wave corresponding to a smaller positive stable equilibrium point and a traveling wave connecting two positive stable equilibrium points with speed slower than that of the semi-wave.},

The issue is to obtain rigorously cross-diffusion systems à la Shigesada--Kawasaki--Teramoto as the limit of relaxed systems in which the cross-diffusion and reaction coefficients are nonlocal. We start from the existence result established by Fontbona and Méléard for a general class of nonlocal systems and study the corresponding asymptotic as the convolution kernels tend to Dirac masses, but only in the case of (strictly) triangular systems with bounded coefficients. Our approach is based on a new result of compactness for the Kolmogorov equation, which is reminiscent of the celebrated duality lemma of Michel Pierre.},
