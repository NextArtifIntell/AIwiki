  abstract     = {We introduce and analyze parallelizable algorithms to compress and accurately reconstruct finite simplicial complexes that have nontrivial automorphisms. The compressed data---called a complex of groups---amounts to a functor from (the poset of simplices in) the orbit space to the 2-category of groups, whose higher structure is prescribed by isomorphisms arising from conjugation. Using this functor, we show how to algorithmically recover the original complex up to equivariant simplicial isomorphism. Our algorithms are derived from generalizations (by Bridson--Haefliger, Carbone--Rips, and Corson, among others) of the classical Bass--Serre theory for reconstructing group actions on trees.},

  abstract     = {Computing the theta series of an arbitrary lattice, and more specifically a related quantity known as the flatness factor, has been recently shown to be important for lattice code design in various wireless communication setups. However, the theta series is in general not known in closed form, excluding a small set of very special lattices. In this article, motivated by the practical applications as well as the mathematical problem itself, a simple approximation of the theta series of a lattice is derived. A rigorous analysis of its accuracy is provided. In relation to this, maximum-likelihood decoding in the context of compute-and-forward relaying is studied. Following previous work, it is shown that the related metric can exhibit a flat behavior, which can be characterized by the flatness factor of the decoding function. Contrary to common belief, we note that the decoding metric can be rewritten as a sum over a random lattice only when at most two sources are considered. Using a particular matrix decomposition, a link between the random lattice and the code lattice employed at the transmitter is established, which leads to an explicit criterion for code design, in contrast to implicit criteria derived previously. Finally, candidate lattices are examined with respect to the proposed criterion using the derived theta series approximation.},

In 2007, Parrilo asked if convex forms are always sums of squares. A few years later, Blekherman answered the question in the negative by showing through volume arguments that for high enough number of variables, there must be convex forms of degree as low as 4 that are not sums of squares. Remarkably, no examples are known to date. In this paper, we show that all convex forms in 4 variables and of degree 4 are sums of squares. We also show that if a conjecture of Blekherman related to the so-called Cayley--Bacharach relations is true, then the same statement holds for convex forms in 3 variables and of degree 6. These are the two minimal cases where one would have any hope of seeing convex forms that are not sums of squares (due to known obstructions). A main ingredient of the proof is the derivation of certain “generalized Cauchy--Schwarz inequalities” which could be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Geometric complexity theory is an approach towards the separation of fundamental algebraic complexity classes. Two papers by Mulmuley and Sohoni [K. D. Mulmuley and M. Sohoni, SIAM J. Comput., 31 (2001), pp. 496--526; SIAM J. Comput., 38 (2008), pp. 1175--1206] pursue this goal via representation theoretic multiplicities in coordinate rings of specific group varieties. The papers also conjecture that the vanishing behavior of these multiplicities would be sufficient to separate complexity classes (so-called occurrence obstructions). The existence of such strong occurrence obstructions was recently disproved in 2016 in two successive papers, [C. Ikenmeyer and G. Panova, Adv. Math., 319 (2017), pp. 40--66] and [P. Bürgisser, C. Ikenmeyer, and G. Panova, J. Amer. Math. Soc., 32 (2019), pp. 163--193]. This raises the question of whether separating group varieties via representation theoretic multiplicities is stronger than separating them via occurrences. This paper provides for the first time a setting where separating with multiplicities can be achieved, while separation with occurrences is provably impossible. Our setting is surprisingly simple and natural: We study the variety of products of homogeneous linear forms (the so-called Chow variety) and the variety of polynomials of bounded border Waring rank (i.e., a higher secant variety of the Veronese variety). As a side result we prove a slight generalization of Hermite&#39;s reciprocity theorem, which proves Foulkes&#39;s conjecture for a new infinite family of cases.},

This generalizes previous results by the authors for measurements with two outcomes. Free spectrahedra arise from matricial relaxations of linear matrix inequalities. A particular free spectrahedron which we define in this work is the matrix jewel. We find that the compatibility of arbitrary measurements corresponds to the inclusion of the matrix jewel into a free spectrahedron defined by the effect operators of the measurements under study. We subsequently use this connection to bound the set of (asymmetric) inclusion constants for the matrix jewel using results from quantum information theory and symmetrization. The latter translate to new lower bounds on the compatibility of quantum measurements. Among the techniques we employ are approximate quantum cloning and mutually unbiased bases.},

The narrowness of bottlenecks is a fundamental complexity measure in the algebraic geometry of data.

The bottleneck degree is a measure of the complexity of computing all bottlenecks of an algebraic variety, using, for example, numerical homotopy methods.

We prove that for any $G$-action, there exists a pair of rational differential invariants, called classifying invariants, that can be used to construct signatures. We derive a formula for the degree of a signature curve in terms of the degree of the original curve, the size of its symmetry group, and some quantities depending on a choice of classifying invariants. We show that all generic curves have signatures of the same degree, and this degree is the sharp upper bound.

  abstract     = {A topological approach to the study of genetic recombination, based on persistent homology, was introduced by Chan, Carlsson, and Rabadán in 2013. This associates a sequence of signatures called barcodes to genomic data sampled from an evolutionary history. In this paper, we develop theoretical foundations for this approach. First, we clarify the motivation for the topological approach by presenting a novel formulation of the underlying inference problem. Specifically, we introduce and study the novelty profile, a simple, stable statistic of an evolutionary history which not only counts recombination events but also quantifies how recombination creates genetic diversity. We propose that the (hitherto implicit) goal of the topological approach to recombination is the estimation of novelty profiles. We then study the problem of obtaining a lower bound on the novelty profile using barcodes. We focus on a low-recombination regime, where the evolutionary history can be described by a directed acyclic graph called a galled tree, which differs from a tree only by isolated topological defects. We show that in this regime, under a complete sampling assumption, the first barcode yields a lower bound on the novelty profile, and hence on the number of recombination events. For $i&gt;1$, the $i{\rm th}$ barcode is empty. In addition, we use a stability principle to strengthen these results to ones which hold for any subsample of an arbitrary evolutionary history. To establish these results, we describe the topology of the Vietoris--Rips filtrations arising from evolutionary histories indexed by galled trees. As a step toward a probabilistic theory, we also show that for a random history indexed by a fixed galled tree and satisfying biologically reasonable conditions, the intervals of the first barcode are independent random variables. Using simulations, we explore the sensitivity of these intervals to recombination.},

  abstract     = {We show that one can reconstruct the shape of a room with planar walls from the first-order echoes received by four nonplanar microphones placed on a drone with generic position and orientation. Both the cases where the source is located in the room and on the drone are considered. If the microphone positions are picked at random, then with probability one, the location of any wall is correctly reconstructed as long as it is heard by four microphones. Our algorithm uses a simple echo sorting criterion to recover the wall assignments for the echoes. We prove that if the position and orientation of the drone on which the microphones are mounted do not lie on a certain set of dimension at most 5 in the six-dimensional space of all drone positions and orientations, then the wall assignment obtained through our echo sorting criterion must be the right one and thus the reconstruction obtained through our algorithm is correct. Our proof uses methods from computational commutative algebra.},

  abstract     = {We define a notion of morphism between combinatorial codes, making the class of all combinatorial codes into a category Code. We show that morphisms can be used to remove redundant information from a code and that morphisms preserve convexity. We use the latter fact to define a partial order on all codes in which the class of convex codes forms a down-set. We investigate minimal obstructions to convexity in the form of &quot;minimally nonconvex&quot; codes, which lie on the boundary of this down-set. In particular, we show that there are infinitely many minimally nonconvex codes and construct a minimally nonconvex code with no local obstructions. We conclude by giving an algebraic formulation of our results.},

  abstract     = {We propose the use of persistent homology in a supervised way. We believe homological persistence is fundamentally not about decomposition theorems but a central role is played by a choice of metrics. Choosing a pseudometric between persistent vector spaces leads to a model. Fitting this model is what we believe supervised homological persistence is. We develop theory behind constructing such models and we give evidence of the usefulness of this approach in concrete data analysis tasks.},
