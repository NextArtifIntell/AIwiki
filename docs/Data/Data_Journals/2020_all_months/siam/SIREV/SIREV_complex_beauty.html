  abstract     = {The first and featured review is on the book Introduction to Numerical Methods for Variational Problems, by Hans Petter Langtangen and Kent-Andre Mardal. It is one of the last books co-authored by Hans Petter Langtangen, who was a very influential, enthusiastic researcher and teacher, and nevertheless a very kind person. I met him several times during my time on the editorial board of SISC, where he used to be the editor-in-chief. The scientific community in the field of scientific computing owes a lot to him. The reviewer of the book, Akil Narayan, has written a very careful and diligent review on this book pointing out its nonstandard features, which let it stand out from the crowd and make it very worthwhile reading. The featured review is followed by Daniele Boffi&#39;s review on the book Convection-Diffusion Problems. An Introduction to Their Analysis and Numerical Solution, by Martin Stynes and David Stynes. Daniele recommends the book as a “concise and well-organized introduction to the approximation of convection-diffusion problems.” Among our reviews, we have three more books related to data science: Neural Networks and Statistical Learning, by Ke-Lin Du and M. N. S. Swamy, which is reviewed by Jan Pablo Burgard with the comment that the book “can be seen as a central reference point for the mathematical understanding and implementation of the core ideas of neuronal networks and statistical learning techniques&#39;&#39;; John Harlim&#39;s Data-Driven Computational Methods: Parameter and Operator Estimations, very positively reviewed by Nikolas Kantas; and the book Mathematics for Machine Learning, by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Og. Finally, I would like to mention the book by Doug Arnold on Finite Element Exterior Calculus, which is reviewed by the expert Ralf Hiptmair, who praises the book as “a work bridging the divide sometimes separating what is labeled pure and applied mathematics.”},

  abstract     = {We study the time correlation functions of coupled linear Langevin dynamics with and without inertial effects, both analytically and numerically. The model equation represents the physical behavior of a harmonic oscillator in two or three dimensions in the presence of friction, additive noise, and an external field with both rotational and deformational components. This simple model plays pivotal roles in understanding more complicated processes. The analytical solution presented serves as a test of numerical integration schemes, and its derivation is presented in a fashion that allows it to be repeated directly in a classroom. While the results in the absence of fields (equilibrium) or confinement (free particle) are omnipresent in the literature, we write down, apparently for the first time, the full nonequilibrium results that may correspond, e.g., to a Hookean dumbbell embedded in a macroscopically homogeneous shear or mixed flow field. We demonstrate how the inertial results reduce to their noninertial counterparts in the nontrivial limit of vanishing mass. While the results are derived using basic integrations over Dirac delta distributions, we also provide alternative approaches involving (i) Fourier transforms, which seem advantageous only if the measured quantities also reside in Fourier space, and (ii) a Fokker--Planck equation and the moments of the probability distribution. The results, verified by numerical experiments, provide additional means of measuring the performance of numerical methods for such systems. It should be emphasized that this article provides specific details regarding the derivations of the time correlation functions as well as the implementations of various numerical methods, so that it can serve as a standalone piece for lessons in the framework of Itô stochastic differential equations and calculus.},

  abstract     = {This issue of SIAM Review presents two papers in the Education section. The first paper, “Time Correlation Functions of Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Langevin Dynamics: Derivations and Numerics Using Random Numbers,” is coauthored by Xiaocheng Shang and Martin Krog̈er. Langevin dynamics is a term describing a mathematical model of the dynamics of molecular systems which uses stochastic differential equations. This model extends the molecular dynamics to allow for describing effects due to friction caused by solvent or air molecules or other phenomena that perturb the system. In this paper, the authors present the model equation for the behavior of a harmonic oscillator in two or three dimensions in the presence of friction, additive noise, and an external field with both rotational and deformational components. They study the time correlation function of the dynamics analytically and numerically. The paper provides a good illustration of the tools of stochastic calculus on a nontrivial application and helps evaluate the numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The authors argue that the fair assessment of the efficiency and accuracy of numerical solvers for SDEs requires access to analytical reference solutions. However, deriving relevant analytical formulae is possible only for very simple cases. Here a two-dimensional nontrivial benchmark problem is analyzed and an exact solution is derived. The analysis in the paper includes also a discussion on inertial effects. The model equation formulated in section 2 is interesting because it arises in multiple applications. Furthermore, the absence of the restoring force or the external field in the model leads to popular special cases. Among those are the random walk, diffusion models, the motion of atoms in the presence of gravitational or centrifugal potential, nanomagnets subjected to magnetic fields, Brownian oscillators, rotational relaxation of molecules trapped in a three-dimensional crystal, and many others. Relevant literature describing those models is provided. The authors describe a direct approach to the derivation of the time correlation functions for general Langevin dynamics, as well as an approach that uses Fourier transforms and the Wiener--Khinchin theorem, and a complementary approach via the associated Fokker--Planck equation. The last portion of the paper contains the description of two numerical methods and numerical experience. The second paper presents “An Introduction to Quantum Computing, without the Physics,” written by Giacomo Nannicini. This paper introduces discrete mathematicians and computer scientists to quantum computing. While quantum computing uses certain quantum phenomena to perform computation, many scientists may learn about its principles without acquiring deeper knowledge of quantum physics. The author starts with a set of assumptions that are satisfied by a quantum computing device. From those assumptions further properties are derived in a rigorous way. The necessary concepts are formally introduced and all statements are supplied with mathematical proofs. The author adopts a model of computation, which is known as the quantum circuit model. Quoting from the paper, it works as follows: - The quantum computer has a state that is contained in a quantum register and is initialized in a predefined way. - The state evolves by applying operations specified in advance in the form of an algorithm. - At the end of the computation, some information on the state of the quantum register is obtained by means of a special operation, called a measurement. At the beginning of the paper, some properties of the tensor product are reviewed, which are used to express states and operations in a quantum device. For example, qubits are the quantum counterparts of the bits in our computers and the state of a $q$-qubit quantum register is identified with a unit vector in the space $(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes q}$, where $\mathbb{C}^2$ is the complex Euclidean space. The exposition proceeds with the introduction and analysis of the types of states and their properties, the quantum phenomena of superposition and enlargement, measurement gates, and the input-output model for quantum computations. The second portion of the paper discusses several quantum algorithms including a numerical implementation of Grover&#39;s algorithm. It may be of interest that, although quantum computing is able to solve some problems much faster than the classical computer, it is still not known to solve NP-complete problems efficiently. The paper concludes with a section containing notes for further reading. According to the author&#39;s experience, the paper provides material for a graduate-level module in quantum computing for mathematicians and computer scientists. It is recommended to split the material into five lectures/meetings of 90--120 minutes each. The last meeting would aim at providing a hands-on numerical experience based on section 6 of the paper. The audience should be familiar with linear algebra and with basic concepts in computing such as Turing machines and algorithmic complexity.},

  abstract     = {In mechanics, one often describes microscopic processes such as those leading to friction between relative interfaces using macroscopic variables (relative velocity, temperature, etc.) in order to avoid models of intangible complexity. As a consequence, such macroscopic models are frequently nonsmooth, a prominent example being the Coulomb law of friction. In many cases, these models are perfectly adequate for engineering purposes. Formally, however, since the Fundamental Theorem of Existence and Uniqueness does not apply to these situations, one generally expects that these models possess forward nonuniqueness of solutions. Consequently, numerical computations of such systems might possibly unknowingly discard certain solutions. In this paper, we try to shed further light on this issue by studying solutions of a simple friction oscillator subject to stiction friction. The stiction law is a simple nonsmooth model of friction that is a modification of Coulomb based on the fundamental observation that the dynamic friction force, when the mass is in motion, is smaller than the static friction force during stick. The resulting piecewise smooth vector field of this discontinuous model does not follow the classical Filippov convention, and the concept of a Filippov solution cannot be used. Furthermore, some Carathéodory solutions, i.e., absolutely continuous solutions satisfying the differential equation in a weaker sense, are nonphysical. Therefore, we introduce the concept of stiction solutions. These are the Carathéodory solutions that are physically relevant, i.e., the ones that follow the stiction law. However, we find that some of the stiction solutions are forward nonunique in subregions of the slip onset. We call these solutions singular, in contrast to the regular stiction solutions that are forward unique. In order to further understanding of the nonunique dynamics, we then introduce a general regularization of the model. This gives a singularly perturbed problem that captures the main features of the original discontinuous problem. Using geometric singular perturbation theory, we identify a repelling slow manifold that separates the forward slipping from the forward sticking solutions, leading to high sensitivity to the initial conditions. On this slow manifold we find canard trajectories that have the physical interpretation of delaying the slip onset. Most interestingly, we find that these new solutions do not correspond to stiction solutions in the piecewise-smooth limit, and are therefore seemingly nonphysical, yet they are robust and appear generically in the class of regularizations we consider. Finally, we show that the regularized problem has a family of periodic orbits interacting with the canards. We observe that this family has a saddle stability and that it connects, in the rigid body limit, the two regular, slip-stick branches of the discontinuous problem, which are otherwise disconnected.},

  abstract     = {In this section we present “A Stiction Oscillator with Canards: On Piecewise Smooth Nonuniqueness and Its Resolution by Regularizing Using Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory,” by Elena Bossolini, Morten Brøns, and Kristian Uldall Kristiansen. This is the highlighted SIGEST version of an article that first appeared in the SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems in 2017. The article focuses on a deceptively simple mechanical model: a rigid block moving on a flat surface. The block is attached to a spring and thereby subjected to harmonic forcing, as illustrated in Figure 1. The novelty lies in the fact that the friction between the block and the surface is modeled as stiction, so that the force of friction when the block is sticking can be greater than the force of friction when the block is slipping on the surface. The model takes the form of a discontinuous ODE system that cannot be understood using Filipov&#39;s methodology. The authors shed light on nonuniqueness issues arising at the onset of slip, and introduce the notion of regular and singular stiction solutions. To address uniqueness they consider a regularized model and identify a slow manifold that separates sticking and slipping solutions. Some trajectories, in the form of canards, correspond to a delay in the onset of slipping. The work builds on sophisticated ideas from dynamical systems theory, giving clear explanations of many subtle concepts. High quality graphics and computational experiments are used to illustrate the theory. In preparing the SIGEST version, the authors have provided additional references to recent work in this field, notably with respect to blow up of solutions and the use of geometric singular perturbation theory to understand how smooth systems approach nonsmooth ones.},

Surprisingly, our model performs as well as popular forecasters for the 2012 and 2016 U.S. presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial races. Although contagion and voting dynamics differ, our work suggests a valuable approach for elucidating how elections are related across states. It also illustrates the effect of accounting for uncertainty in different ways, provides an example of data-driven forecasting using dynamical systems, and suggests avenues for future research on political elections.

  abstract     = {The field of network synchronization has seen tremendous growth following the introduction of the master stability function (MSF) formalism, which enables the efficient stability analysis of synchronization in large oscillator networks. However, to make further progress we must overcome the limitations of this celebrated formalism, which focuses on global synchronization and requires both the oscillators and their interaction functions to be identical, while many systems of interest are inherently heterogeneous and exhibit complex synchronization patterns. Here, we establish a generalization of the MSF formalism that can characterize the stability of any cluster synchronization pattern, even when the oscillators and/or their interaction functions are nonidentical. The new framework is based on finding the finest simultaneous block diagonalization of matrices in the variational equation and does not rely on information about network symmetry. This leads to an algorithm that is error-tolerant and orders of magnitude faster than existing symmetry-based algorithms. As an application, we rigorously characterize the stability of chimera states in networks with multiple types of interactions.},

Modeling these as noise in the velocity field leads to a random deviation from each trajectory. This deviation is examined within the context of small (multiplicative) stochasticity applying to a two-dimensional unsteady flow operating over a finite time. These assumptions are motivated precisely by standard availability expectations of realistic velocity data. Explicit expressions for the deviation&#39;s expected size and anisotropy are obtained using an Itô calculus approach, thereby characterizing the uncertainty in the Lagrangian trajectory&#39;s final location with respect to lengthscale and direction.

  abstract     = {We are fortunate to have three topically diverse papers featured in Research Spotlights in the current issue. The first of these, “Stochastic Sensitivity: A Computable Lagrangian Uncertainty Measure for Unsteady Flows,&quot; deals with modeling uncertainties in velocity data for the purpose of quantifying their influence when computing Lagrangian particle trajectories of fluids. One application that author Sanjeeva Balasuriya gives for pursuing this line of research is climate and environmental modeling: ocean and atmospheric models utilize velocity data to understand the movement of such quantities of interest as pollutants and plankton, and the trajectories of these quantities of interest have an impact on the environment and climate. This paper fills a gap in the current literature by addressing specifically the impact of velocity uncertainties---including those due to measurement error, turbulence at subgrid levels, or other effects uncaptured by the model---on trajectories. It offers the reader a “set of rigorous computational tools&quot; to quantify the resulting Lagrangian uncertainties as a “physically interpretable field.&quot; The final section contains an extensive discussion in which the author considers connections of this work to uncertainty quantification and illuminates important remaining research directions. The second article, coauthored by Yuanzhao Zhang and Adilson E. Motter, is entitled “Symmetric-Independent Stability Analysis of Synchronization Patterns.&quot; The stability of synchronization patterns in complex networks is important to understand because of the “significant ramifications in various biological and technical systems&quot; in the absence of such analysis. The key innovation in the present work is the introduction of a new algorithm to find the finest simultaneous block diagonalization (SBD) for any given set of self-adjoint matrices. This permits the extension of the master stability function (MSF) formalism since the proposed method now allows for the optimal separation of perturbation modes from which the stability of arbitrary synchronization patterns can then be undertaken. The authors provide a convincing demonstration of the strength of the new approach by applying their method to characterize permanently stable chimera-like states in multilayer networks. The paper includes a gentle introduction to matrix $*$-algebras and their relevance in developing the new algorithm; code for the latter is available on a GitHub repository, along with test problems. Importantly, the reader should note the potential for SBD in applications beyond the topic considered here---indeed, the authors suggest it may be relevant in other applications that involve many matrices such as control of network systems and semidefinite programming. The subject of the last of the three articles is extremely timely, as the title “Forecasting Elections Using Compartmental Models of Infection&quot; itself suggests. Authors Alexandria Volkening, Daniel F. Linder, Mason A. Porter, and Grzegorz A. Rempala propose a data-driven mathematical model of the temporal evolution of political opinions during U.S. elections. Key features include the explicit modeling of how states influence each other through a compartmental model of disease dynamics, treating “voting intentions as contagions” that spread between states. Data fitting with polling data is used to specify the values of the parameters in the model, and the model predictions are compared to election outcomes from several recent U.S. elections. The initial model is expanded to a stochastic differential equations model in an effort to capture and quantify uncertainty in a given race. The authors are clear in describing their simplifications in modeling, yet the comparison reveals their forecasting method “performs as well as popular analysts.&quot; In the interest of transparency and in an effort to encourage more readers to become engaged in the remaining research questions, all codes and data associated with the article are available to the public. And yes, the authors also provide a link where the reader can find their model&#39;s forecast for the 2020 U.S. election!},

  abstract     = {The prevalence of convolution in applications within signal processing, deep neural networks, and numerical solvers has motivated the development of numerous fast convolution algorithms. In many of these problems, convolution is performed on terabytes or petabytes of data, so even constant factors of improvement can significantly reduce the computation time. We leverage the formalism of bilinear algorithms to describe and analyze all of the most popular approaches. This unified lens permits us to study the relationship between different variants of convolution as well as to derive error bounds and analyze the cost of the various algorithms. We provide new derivations, which predominantly leverage matrix and tensor algebra, to describe the Winograd family of convolution algorithms as well as reductions between 1D and multidimensional convolution. We provide cost and error bounds as well as experimental numerical studies. Our experiments for two of these algorithms, the overlap-add approach and Winograd convolution algorithm with polynomials of degree greater than one, show that fast convolution algorithms can rival the accuracy of the fast Fourier transform without using complex arithmetic. These algorithms can be used for convolution problems with multidimensional inputs or for filters larger than size of four, extending the state of the art in Winograd-based convolution algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Finding the convolution of two vectors is a ubiquitous task in applied mathematics. Signal processing, image processing, deep neural networks, the numerical solution of partial differential equations, and other current applications require the computation of convolutions, often on terabytes or petabytes of data. Convolution was incognito when it was first introduced to each of us. In grade school, we were taught how to multiply two (n)-digit numbers (a) and (b) by finding the (n^2) products (a_ib_j) of the individual digits and applying the convolution formula \beginalign* &amp;\qquad\qquad \big(a_0+a_1 10^1+ḑots+a_n-1 10^n-1\big) \big(b_0+b_1 10^1+ḑots +b_n-1 10^n-1\big) &amp;\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad=(a_0b_0)+ (a_0b_1+a_1b_0)10^1+ḑots +(a_n-1b_n-1)10^2n-2. \endalign* Kolmogorov thought that the complexity of the grade school recipe was optimal: no other algorithm would compute the product \(ab\) using less than \(\mathcalO(n^2)\) one-digit products. However, he was proved to be wrong when in 1960 Anatoly Karatsuba formulated an algorithm that only requires \(\mathcalO(n^łog_2(3))\) one-digit products (\(łog_2(3)\approx 1.58\)). This was the first example of a fast algorithm to compute convolutions. The Survey and Review paper in this issue of SIAM Review, “Derivation and Analysis of Fast Bilinear Algorithms for Convolution,” by Caleb Ju and Edgar Solomonik, provides an overview of the many algorithms now available in this area. The authors systematize their exposition by using the formalism of bilinear algorithms: the different approaches are described by means of a unified linear algebra framework based on the observation that all algorithms proceed by first transforming linearly the input vectors, then computing a pointwise product of the transformed vectors, and then transforming the product (many readers will have seen this pattern at work when using Fourier and other transforms). The paper provides numerical experiments and compares the cost and stability of the different alternative techniques. It will be useful to different groups of readers. Applied mathematicians working on areas where convolutions are required will certainly benefit from reading this streamlined survey. In addition, the material connects seemingly unrelated concepts from elementary interpolation, linear algebra, polynomial algebra, Fourier transforms, etc., and it will be enlightening for SIAM readers who teach or study different applied mathematics undergraduate or graduate courses.},

  abstract     = {These are difficult times, but some circumstances make the work in our Book Reviews section even more difficult. Due to delivery difficulties during the coronavirus pandemic, some publishers temporarily switched from the delivery of physical books for reviews to the delivery of ebooks. This is an understandable and obvious measure at the moment. However, the Springer-Verlag publishing house has decided, even independently of and before the crisis, to send review copies only as PDF bearing the ugly watermark “Book Review Copy for Personal Use Only” and no longer provides printed copies of the respective books. Many reviewers prefer a physical book and consider it a small compensation for the considerable work they invest in the quality of their reviews. We have already noticed that under these conditions it is much more difficult to attract reviewers to Springer books. So in future we will probably only be able to report on books from this publisher to a lesser extent, even though very good books often come from this publishing house. Nevertheless, we have been able to compile six informative reviews in this section. It starts with the featured review of Dante Kalise on the book Crowds in Equations: An Introduction to the Microscopic Modeling of Crowds, by Bertrand Maury and Sylvain Faure. This review was very diligently written by an expert in dynamical systems and control and praises the book in its summary as an “updated account of the mathematical modeling of crowd motion phenomenass.” Among the other reviews, the book recommendation by Christian Klingenberg, senior expert in conservation laws, stands out. It is on the book Numerical Methods for Conservation Laws: From Analysis to Algorithms, by Jan Hesthaven. He recommends the book as one that provides “a comprehensive and up-to-date view of the subject of numerics for conservation laws.” Furthermore, the young expert on shape and topology optimization Stephan Schmidt takes a closer look at the book Applications of the Topological Derivative Method, by Antonio André Novotny, Jan Sokołowski, and Antoni Żochowski. Stephan recommends it for experts searching for cutting edge research results rather than for novices looking for an introduction into the field. In addition we have three more reviews which provide balanced opinions on the respective books.},

  abstract     = {This issue of SIAM Review contains two papers in the Education section. The first paper, “Hodge Laplacians on Graphs,” is presented by Lek-Heng Lim. The classical Hodge Laplacian is a differential operator defined on any manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric. In this paper, the author provides an accessible introduction to what he calls graph-theoretic Hodge theory. The Hodge Laplacian on a graph is a higher-order generalization of the graph Laplacian. The reader needs only knowledge of linear algebra and graph theory in order to follow the exposition; however, much broader knowledge in mathematics would help one fully understand and appreciate this theory. The author&#39;s approach is to derive a large part of cohomology theory in finite dimensions by analyzing the simple structure of $AB=0$ for two matrices $A$ and $B$. The Hodge Laplacian is the matrix $A^{\ast} A + BB^{\ast}$. The topological aspects involved are presented entirely in the terminology of graphs. The paper contains a discussion of fundamental concepts such as Hodge decomposition, harmonic vector fields, and coboundary operators of first and higher order. The author introduces real Euclidean vector spaces of totally antisymmetric (alternating) functions on ordered sets of $k$-cliques ($k$-cochains) and shows that the permutation of arguments of an alternating function changes its value by the sign of the permutation. He defines notions like combinatorial gradient and combinatorial curl, which become instrumental in developing Helmholtz-type decomposition for graphs. The paper contains discrete analogues to statements about smooth vector fields, such as “a vector field is curl-free and divergence-free if and only if it is a harmonic vector field.” Some attention is paid to computing the quantities appearing in the theoretical analysis and to modern data applications of this theory. This ties in neatly with our recent Research Spotlights article on “Random Walks on Simplicial Complexes and the Normalized Hodge 1-Laplacian,” by Michael T. Schaub, Austin R. Benson, Paul Horn, Gabor Lippner, and Ali Jadbabaie (SIAM Review, 62 (2) (2020), pp. 353--391). The second paper presents “An Elementary Proof of a Matrix Tree Theorem for Directed Graphs,” written by Patrick De Leenheer. In graph theory, Kirchhoff&#39;s matrix tree theorem, named after Gustav Kirchhoff, establishes the number of spanning trees in a graph. For a connected undirected graph, the number of spanning trees, rooted at any vertex of it, is equal to the determinant of the reduced Laplacian matrix associated with the graph. Evidently, this number can be computed in polynomial time. The result has been generalized by W. T. Tutte in 1948 to the case of directed graphs. Given a directed graph with labeled vertices, we can define two Laplacians: $L_1$ is the difference of the in-degree matrix minus the adjacency matrix of the graph, while $L_2$ is the difference of the out-degree matrix and the transposed adjacency matrix. For a fixed vertex $v_r$, two reduced Laplacians $L_1^r$ and $L_2^r$ are obtained by removing the $r$th row and the $r$th column from $L_1$ and $L_2$, respectively. The Tutte&#39;s theorem states that the numbers of outgoing and incoming directed spanning trees rooted at $v_r$ are equal to the determinant of $L_1^r$ and $L_2^r$, respectively. The author provides a proof of this result. Additional observation relates the number of the spanning trees to the eigenvectors of the two Laplacians, corresponding to the eigenvalue zero. The results generalize to weighted graphs.},

  abstract     = {Rank-revealing matrix decompositions provide an essential tool in spectral analysis of matrices, including the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and related low-rank approximation techniques. QR with Column Pivoting (QRCP) is usually suitable for these purposes, but it can be much slower than the unpivoted QR algorithm. For large matrices, the difference in performance is due to increased communication between the processor and slow memory, which QRCP needs in order to choose pivots during decomposition. Our main algorithm, Randomized QR with Column Pivoting (RQRCP), uses randomized projection to make pivot decisions from a much smaller sample matrix, which we can construct to reside in a faster level of memory than the original matrix. This technique may be understood as trading vastly reduced communication for a controlled increase in uncertainty during the decision process. For rank-revealing purposes, the selection mechanism in RQRCP produces results that are the same quality as the standard algorithm, but with performance near that of unpivoted QR (often an order of magnitude faster for large matrices). We also propose two formulas that facilitate further performance improvements. The first efficiently updates sample matrices to avoid computing new randomized projections. The second avoids large trailing updates during the decomposition in truncated low-rank approximations. Our truncated version of RQRCP also provides a key initial step in our truncated SVD approximation, TUXV. These advances open up a new performance domain for large matrix factorizations that will support efficient problem-solving techniques for challenging applications in science, engineering, and data analysis.},

  abstract     = {The SIGEST article in this issue, “Randomized Projection for Rank-Revealing Matrix Factorizations and Low-Rank Approximations,” by Jed A. Duersch and Ming Gu, concerns the use of randomization to reduce the bottleneck in a central numerical linear algebra kernel. The authors consider QR factorization, which is a key component in algorithms for constructing stable bases, for solving least-squares problems, and generally for summarizing or extracting insights from data. Column pivoting is the standard technique for dealing with cases where the target matrix is not of full rank, or where the rank is in doubt. However, for large-scale problems column pivoting requires substantial communication between different levels of computer memory, which severely limits the overall efficiency. The authors therefore propose a strategy for choosing pivots based on randomization rather than exhaustive search. This approach reduces communication complexity while increasing uncertainty in the quality of the factorization in a controlled manner. The article makes use of clear pseudocode listings in order to summarize both the original deterministic strategies and the newly developed randomized approaches; see Algorithms 1 to 6. The authors also explain how a Bayesian framework can be set up to quantify the uncertainty introduced by the use of random projections. Extensive, large-scale tests are conducted using Fortran with OpenMP, an application programming interface that supports shared-memory multiprocessing. The original article appeared in the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing in 2017, and the main idea has subsequently proved to be effective for a number of related tasks. In creating this highlighted article for the SIGEST section, the authors have revised the introductory material, providing additional context; reorganized the document structure and added new visualizations; updated and extended the computational experiments, while making this section more compact and easier to interpret; and discussed recent developments in the field and provided references to the growing literature.},

We test the model using data from the U.S. Congress over the past 150 years and find that our predictions are consistent with the two major political parties&#39; historical trajectories.

Finally, we extend our analysis to two real-world metaplexes: a landscape and a brain metaplex. We corroborate that the internal structure of the nodes in a metaplex can dominate the global dynamics (brain metaplex) or play a regulatory role (landscape metaplex) in the influence of the interconnection between nodes.},

  abstract     = {In this issue, Research Spotlights features two exciting and topically diverse articles. The authors of the first article introduce the notion of a metaplex and use it to describe and study dynamics of complex systems having both exo- and endostructure. Unlike previous works where both the exo- and endostructures of the complex systems are assumed representable by networks, in “Metaplex Networks: Influence of the Exo-Endo Structure of Complex Systems on Diffusion,&quot; by Ernesto Estrada, Gissell Estrada-Rodriguez, and Heiko Gimperlein, the assumption is that the endostructure can be described by a continuous space. The authors give several important examples of complex networks that exhibit such features: one example is a climate system where the processes inside the regions (a.k.a. nodes) “are well described by aerodynamics and fluid dynamics, while the causal influence between regions is well described by a network of interactions.&quot; The study of the dynamics on the metaplex offers the opportunity to better understand the individual contributions of the endo- and exo- components to the global behavior of the system. The significance of this claim is highlighted through the application to a landscape metaplex in Madagascar and to the visual cortex metaplex of the macaque: the metaplex dynamics shows that different factors are responsible for global behavior in each case. Because the study of metaplexes utilizes tools from a broad range of areas, “suggests the relevance of network theory for old problems in these fields,&quot; and has the potential to become more widely applicable with the aid of computationally efficient methods like model order reduction, the article should appeal to many SIREV readers. The second article, “Why Are U.S. Parties So Polarized? A `Satisficing&#39; Dynamical Model,&quot; is a timely one. In this work, authors Vicky Chuqiao Yang, Daniel M. Abrams, Georgia Kernell, and Adilson E. Motter develop a mathematical model for the ideological polarity in U.S. political parties. Like the well-known Downsian model, the new model considers voter population distributed in a one-dimensional so-called ideology space. However, unlike the Downsian model that assumes “citizens cast their vote for the ideologically closest party, and parties adjust their positions to maximize votes,&quot; the new, differential equations--based model is based on the concept of voters who make so-called satisficing decisions, i.e., decisions made randomly among positions the voters deem are satisfactory. Thus, while the former method predicts, incorrectly, that both parties should converge to the median voter&#39;s position, the authors&#39; new model is shown to be better able to fit the empirical data. Indeed, the results for the proposed model suggest that “appealing to an extreme segment of the electorate can be a winning political strategy,&quot; even, perhaps ironically, in the absence of changes to voters&#39; ideological positions. Readers are invited to explore the supplementary material for some extensions to the model presented in the article and are encouraged to consider future work in expanding their model.},

  abstract     = {In a pedagogical but exhaustive manner, this survey reviews the main results on input-to-state stability (ISS) for infinite-dimensional systems. This property allows for the estimation of the impact of inputs and initial conditions on both the intermediate values and the asymptotic bound on the solutions. ISS has unified the input-output and Lyapunov stability theories and is a crucial property in the stability theory of control systems as well as for many applications whose dynamics depend on parameters, unknown perturbations, or other inputs. In this paper, starting from classic results for nonlinear ordinary differential equations, we motivate the study of the ISS property for distributed parameter systems. Then fundamental properties are given, such an ISS superposition theorem and characterizations of (global and local) ISS in terms of Lyapunov functions. We explain in detail the functional-analytic approach to ISS theory of linear systems with unbounded input operators, with special attention devoted to ISS theory of boundary control systems. The Lyapunov method is shown to be very useful for both linear and nonlinear models, including parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations. Next, we show the efficiency of the ISS framework in studying the stability of large-scale networks, coupled either via the boundary or via the interior of the spatial domain. ISS methodology allows for the reduction of the stability analysis of complex networks, by considering the stability properties of its components and the interconnection structure between the subsystems. An extra section is devoted to ISS theory of time-delay systems with the emphasis on techniques that are particularly suited for this class of systems. Finally, numerous applications are considered for which ISS properties play a crucial role in their study. The survey contains recent as well as classical results on systems theory and suggests many open problems.},

  abstract     = {Andrii Mirochenko and Christophe Prieur are the authors of “Input-to-State Stability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems: Recent Results and Open Questions,” the Survey and Review paper in this issue of SIAM Review. Introduced in the late 1980s by E. Sontag, the notion of input-to-state stability (ISS) revolutionized the control theory of finite-dimensional systems. The ISS framework has provided a range of powerful tools that, for instance, make it possible to study networks of large numbers of components and develop approaches that are robust against disturbances due to measurement or modeling errors, hidden dynamics, external disturbances, etc. On the other hand, many problems of current interest (fluid-structure interactions, aircraft wings, flexible elements in multibody systems, etc.) require the control of systems described by partial differential equations, delay differential equations, and other models where the state space is infinite-dimensional. The aim of this survey is to describe the application of ISS to such infinite-dimensional problems. The paper starts by presenting an abstract framework that allows for a unified treatment of a wide variety of techniques and problems. Sections 5--8 are more applied and successively consider systems of parabolic or hyperbolic partial differential equations, systems built up from interconnected components, and systems with delays. The long list of references and open problems will make the survey valuable for people working in this area. In addition, by reading the paper, many colleagues will acquaint themselves with modern tools in control theory and a raft of problems of current interest that require the control of infinite-dimensional systems.},

  abstract     = {I am writing these lines in April 2020 while science is in lockdown mode globally. They will be published in about two months, hopefully when we are mostly out of the lockdown. Because of this time lag, I will avoid further remarks with relevance to the current situation and try to do business as usual. The first and featured review, of the book Nonlocal Modeling, Analysis, and Computation, by Qiang Du, has been written by the postdoc Christian Vollmann, who himself wrote his doctoral thesis on numerics with nonlocal operators. The review is written in a very knowledgeable way, gives a good classification of the book into the currently very intensively researched field of nonlocal problems, and recommends reading the work. In addition, this time we have many reviews in the context of dynamical systems. Julien Arino reports on the book Dynamical System Models in the Life Sciences and Their Underlying Scientific Issues, by Y. M. Wan, which he plans to test ride in his next appropriate course. James Meiss highly recommends Numerical Bifurcation Analysis of Maps: From Theory to Software, by Yuri A. Kuznetsov and Hil G. E. Meijer. Michał Misiurewicz reviews the book Continuous and Discontinuous Piecewise-Smooth One-Dimensional Maps, by V. Avrutin, L. Gardini, I. Sushko, and F. Tramontana, and recommends it for specialists. Patrick Shipman praises Dynamical Systems with Applications Using Python, by Stephen Lynch, because it is “uniquely successful in teaching a branch of mathematics together with computing while inspiring students to look at references and explorations beyond the text.” Warwick Tucker gives an impression on the book Rigorous Numerics in Dynamics, edited by Jan Bouwe van den Berg and Jean-Philippe Lessard, and recommends it for experienced readers in the fields of dynamical systems and rigorous computations. Furthermore, in his review of Robert Johansson&#39;s book Numerical Python: Scientific Computing and Data Science Applications with Numpy, SciPy and Matplotlib, Charles Jekel recommends the book to readers “interested in learning the Python ecosystem for numerical and scientific work&#39;&#39;; and Martin Schmidt&#39;s review of Nonlinear Optimization, by Francisco J. Aragón, Miguel A. Goberna, Marco A. López, and Margarita M. L. Rodríguez, recommends it for its “nicely illustrated material.”},

One of the simplest ways to generate data for least-squares problems is with random sampling of a function. We discuss theory and algorithms for stability of the least-squares problem using random samples. The main lesson from our discussion is that the intuitively straightforward (``standard&quot;) density for sampling frequently yields suboptimal approximations, whereas sampling from a non-standard density, called the induced distribution, yields near-optimal approximations. We present a recent theory that demonstrates why sampling from the induced distribution is optimal and provide several numerical experiments that support the theory.

The eigenvalue result is well known to a broad scientific community. The treatment of eigenvectors is more complicated, with a perturbation theory that is not so well known outside a community of specialists. We give two different proofs of the main eigenvector perturbation theorem. The first, a block-diagonalization technique inspired by the numerical linear algebra research community and based on the implicit function theorem, has apparently not appeared in the literature in this form. The second, based on complex function theory and on eigenprojectors, as is standard in analytic perturbation theory, is a simplified version of well-known results in the literature. The second derivation uses a convenient normalization of the right and left eigenvectors defined in terms of the associated eigenprojector, but although this dates back to the 1950s, it is rarely discussed in the literature. We then show how the eigenvector perturbation theory is easily extended to handle other normalizations that are often used in practice. We also explain how to verify the perturbation results computationally. We conclude with some remarks about difficulties introduced by multiple eigenvalues and give references to work on perturbation of invariant subspaces corresponding to multiple or clustered eigenvalues. Throughout the paper we give extensive bibliographic commentary and references for further reading.},

  abstract     = {The Education section of SIAM Review presents three papers in this issue. In the first paper Lloyd N. Trefethen reviews “Eight Perspectives on the Exponentially Ill-Conditioned Equation $\varepsilon y&#39;&#39; - x y&#39; + y = 0$.” This paper illustrates how an ensemble of mathematical techniques can come together to provide interesting insights into a mathematical structure, looking at it through various lenses. Equations of this type were formulated long ago and can be considered as versions of equations related to Hermite polynomials. When analyzing the equation, we start by addressing the existence and uniqueness of its solution. The next step takes us to its numerical solution. Applying a numerical method faces the challenge of ill-conditioning, and, at that point, backward error analysis becomes an important tool and provides crucial help. To gain another perspective, we may conduct asymptotic analysis. The problem discussed in the paper has an analytic solution, but this is not always the case. The method of boundary layer analysis allows us to treat more general problems with small parameters. That method provides a means to obtain approximate solutions that are accurate for small values of $\varepsilon$. The solutions become exact in the limit when $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$. Further perspective is brought by the theory of dynamical systems. While continuous-time dynamical systems are described by differential equations and therefore deal with the same subject, the theory of dynamical systems emphasizes the geometrical analyses of the problems. In that context, we observe slow-fast, critical, attracting, and repelling manifolds looking at our differential equation. Further discussion includes the framework of Sturm--Liouville operators, spectral theory, sensitivity analysis via adjoints and singular value decomposition, PDE theory, and some perspectives from physics. The author concludes that many other mathematical tools, some subject to increased interest recently, may also be relevant and could bring interesting new observations to this classical problem. The second paper, “First-Order Perturbation Theory for Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors,” by Anne Greenbaum, Ren-Cang Li, and Michael L. Overton, discusses the behavior of the eigenvalues and the normalized eigenvectors of a complex square matrix, which is subjected to perturbations. This question---the focus of many scientific studies---has been addressed in two different ways, both reflected upon in this paper. The first approach is based on the analytic perturbation theory. We consider a matrix-valued analytic function depending on a complex parameter in a particular area; the matrix of interest is the image of a given parameter value. The widely known classical results pertain to the existence of convergent power expansions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for Hermitian matrices or self-adjoint linear operators subjected to real analytic perturbations. The recent advances in numerical linear algebra inspire the second approach to perturbation theory for matrices. This line of research leads to perturbation bounds rather than expansions. The goals are to identify methods for bounding the change in the eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors when a given matrix is subjected to a perturbation with a given norm and structure. In this paper, the authors consider general square matrices, which are not necessarily Hermitian or normal ones. The authors provide a theorem addressing the perturbations of a simple eigenvalue and the corresponding right and left eigenvectors. The statement of the perturbation theorem is first discussed informally and then supplied with two different proofs. In this way, the reader is provided with a formal as well as an intuitive understanding of the essence and the flavor of both methodologies. Additionally, the paper contains a discussion on the numerical verification of the formulae for the derivatives of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors. The authors provide two examples illustrating that the results do not hold when the eigenvalue is not simple. The paper includes a fairly extensive reference list, helpful to those who seek to gain more in-depth insight. The third contribution, written by Ling Guo, Akil Narayan, and Tao Zhou, is “Constructing Least-Squares Polynomial Approximations.” This paper deals with a popular and widely used method for constructing a mathematical model using observed data. The goal is to identify a mathematical model of a function $f$ by choosing an element from a prescribed finite-dimensional vector space such as the space of polynomials of a fixed degree. It is assumed that $f$ is a $w$-weighted square-integrable real-valued function over a given domain. The function $f$ is deterministic, but it is observed at random points. The approximation error is evaluated with respect to the $L^2_w$-norm. The function samples are gathered from observational data, which is assumed to be exact, not noisy. The authors argue that the lack of noise makes this setup different from the setup of statistical regression. In the large-sample limit, it is expected that the approximation converges to the projection of $f$ onto the finite-dimensional model space, rather than to $f$ itself. After formulating the problem, the analysis in the one-dimensional case is presented: functions of a single variable are approximated by using polynomials. This example helps to explain the notation and the general problem setting, as well as to understand the challenges which occur in high dimensions. The approximation error is calculated approximately based on discretizing the definition domain. The main portion of the paper deals with the behavior of the approximate solution and of the error when the sample size increases. Various strategies for sampling are discussed, which bring the authors to the following conclusions. Preference should be given to the technique using a random choice of sample points over points from a grid formed by tessellation. Furthermore, it makes sense to generate biased random samples depending on the weighting density $w$. In the last section of the paper, the authors mention alternatives and further extensions for computing approximations in high dimensions known in the extant literature.},

  abstract     = {The SIGEST article in this issue, “First-Order Methods for Nonconvex Quadratic Minimization,” by Yair Carmon and John C. Duchi, looks at the minimization of quadratic functions that are (a) potentially indefinite and (b) have been regularized either via a trust-region constraint or a cubic penalty term. This task forms an important component in many nonlinear optimization algorithms. The SIGEST award is based on the 2019 SIAM Journal on Optimization (SIOPT) article [6]. In adapting the article for the SIGEST section, the authors have included subsequent work that appeared in the 2018 Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference [5]. Both papers considered the same underlying optimization problem, but studied different large-scale solution techniques: gradient descent and Krylov subspace methods. The overall aim is to establish global convergence and computational complexity results. By combining the analyses of both algorithms into one paper, the authors present SIREV readers with a broad perspective, highlighting the similarities and differences between the approaches and placing them within the wider context of large-scale optimization. They also include a new result: Section 6 studies the randomized Krylov subspace method from the NeurIPS paper combined with the majorization scheme from the SIOPT paper. The resulting analysis recovers the strongest known convergence guarantees for second-order stationary points with considerably more ease than prior work, and with a method bearing strong resemblance to practical implementations of Newton-type methods. In addition, this article features an expanded Introduction section describing concurrent and subsequent work and a rewritten discussion section providing further perspective into the conceptual differences between the analysis of gradient descent and Krylov subspace techniques. The material here gives SIREV readers a window into the current state of the art in large-scale optimization.},

  abstract     = {Using graphs to model pairwise relationships between entities is a ubiquitous framework for studying complex systems and data. Simplicial complexes extend this dyadic model of graphs to polyadic relationships and have emerged as a model for multinode relationships occurring in many complex systems. For instance, biological interactions occur between sets of molecules and communication systems include group messages that are not pairwise interactions. While Laplacian dynamics have been intensely studied for graphs, corresponding notions of Laplacian dynamics beyond the node-space have so far remained largely unexplored for simplicial complexes. In particular, diffusion processes such as random walks and their relationship to the graph Laplacian---which underpin many methods of network analysis, including centrality measures, community detection, and contagion models---lack a proper correspondence for general simplicial complexes. Focusing on coupling between edges, we generalize the relationship between the normalized graph Laplacian and random walks on graphs by devising an appropriate normalization for the Hodge Laplacian---the generalization of the graph Laplacian for simplicial complexes---and relate this to a random walk on edges. Importantly, these random walks are intimately connected to the topology of the simplicial complex, just as random walks on graphs are related to the topology of the graph. This serves as a foundational step toward incorporating Laplacian-based analytics for higher-order interactions. We demonstrate how to use these dynamics for data analytics that extract information about the edge-space of a simplicial complex that complements and extends graph-based analysis. Specifically, we use our normalized Hodge Laplacian to derive spectral embeddings for examining trajectory data of ocean drifters near Madagascar and also develop a generalization of personalized PageRank for the edge-space of simplicial complexes to analyze a book copurchasing dataset.},

  abstract     = {The current issue of SIAM Review features the Research Spotlights article “Random Walks on Simplicial Complexes and the Normalized Hodge 1-Laplacian,&quot; coauthored by Michael T. Schaub, Austin R. Benson, Paul Horn, Gabor Lippner, and Ali Jadbabaie. Simplicial complexes (SCs) allow one to model multimode relationships in a way that standard graph models, which hinge on pairwise relationships between nodes, do not. Consider that a $k$-simplex is a subset of a finite set of vertices of cardinality $k+1$. Whereas a standard undirected graph consists of nodes and edges (essentially, 0- and 1-simplices), an SC can carry more information: it is a set of simplices with the property that for any element of the set, its subsets are also among the elements in the set. A general SC can therefore contain information about $k$-simplices for $k &gt; 1$. While SCs have the ability to model more complex relationships, such as biological interactions that occur between sets of molecules, the authors claim that, until now, little has been done to generalize the notion of Laplacian dynamics relative to the underlying graph to SCs. To this end, the authors therefore propose generalizing the notion of the graph Laplacian by defining an appropriately normalized Hodge Laplacian for the SC and then relating it to a random walk on edges. The normalized Hodge Laplacian under this interpretation can be used to extract information about a simplicial complex in a way that is reminiscent of graph-Laplacian-based analyses for graphs. Interestingly, the correct normalization requires “lifting” to a higher dimensional space. Although the article involves digesting what may for many readers be several new definitions and concepts, the table of contents, exposition, and illustrated examples aim to make the article accessible to all. The treatment of the topic is comprehensive, including discussion of how to construct SCs as well as associated computational costs. About a third of the main body of the article is devoted to demonstration of their approach on applications. Readers will find promptings for future research projects scattered throughout the article.},

  abstract     = {In a previous issue of SIAM Review, I started my introduction to the Survey and Review section by saying that it is safe to bet that most readers use matrices in their work. I would also safely bet that most readers have used the (discrete or continuous) Fourier transform at some point, since, for reasons I have not yet completely understood, Fourier techniques appear in all kinds of unrelated areas of applied mathematics, including many where there is no apparent connection with sinusoidal functions. The paper that follows, “Phase Retrieval: Uniqueness and Stability,” by Philipp Grohs, Sarah Koppensteiner, and Martin Rathmair, studies the problem of recovering a function (f(x)) from the knowledge of the magnitude (|\widehatf(x)|) of its Fourier transform (\widehatf(x)). In applications, including quantum mechanics, astronomy, radar, and speech recognition, this problem has been very relevant for a long time. The most salient application is in the field of diffraction imaging, where one tries to determine an object from diffraction patterns. The study of the structure of crystals by x-ray diffraction got von Laue the 1914 Nobel Prize in Physics, and since then there have been at least another 11 Nobel Prizes related to diffraction imaging. The paper has three sections in addition to the introduction. Sections 3 and 4 are, respectively, devoted to the discrete and continuous Fourier transforms. Section 2 presents a general theory of phase retrieval and successively addresses two questions: (i) to what extent may a function (f) be recovered from the knowledge of the magnitude (|Tf|), where (T) is a linear transformation, and (ii) if the recovery is possible, what happens when (|Tf|) undergoes small perturbations? Since the material has many useful applications and is related to a number of different branches of applied mathematics, it will be of interest to a wide range of readers.},

  abstract     = {The frame for the Book Reviews section this time is formed by the books of two very well known and successful SIAM Fellows. In his featured review Akhtar Khan introduces the new book by Boris Mordukhovich, Variational Analysis and Applications. He praises the very extensive work as being “not only of great benefit to the research community actively engaged in variational analysis” but also encouraging “newcomers who are willing to learn the subject.” The section concludes with my review of Gilbert Strang&#39;s very contemporary book on Linear Algebra and Learning from Data, which from my point of view fulfills all wishes for an introductory mathematical work for data scientists. In between we find 6 more reviews of current books. Krešimir Josić reports on the book A Course in Networks and Markets by Rafael Pass and recommends it because of its mathematical depth. Anita Layton reviews the book Mathematical Modelling and Biomechanics of the Brain, starting with a report on a very drastic incidental real experiment. She recommends the book for beginners and established researchers in the field. The area of optimal control is addressed in two further books: Alain Bensoussan&#39;s book Estimation and Control of Dynamical Systems, reviewed by Jan Palczewski, and Paweł Olejnik, Jan Awrejcewicz, and Michal Fečkan&#39;s Modeling, Analysis and Control of Dynamical Systems with Friction and Impacts, reviewed by David Simpson. Finally, we have two books on systems biology in our section. Mehrshad Sadria and Anita Layton recommend the book A First Course in Systems Biology by Eberhard Voit as a good introduction into the field. And for advanced readers Mehdi Sadeghpour recommends the 3rd edition of the book Stochastic Modelling for Systems Biology by Darren Wilkinson.},

  abstract     = {In this work we introduce a new operator based approach to matrix analysis. Our main technical tool comprises an extension of a tool introduced long ago by MacMahon to analyze the partitions of natural numbers: the Omega operator calculus. More precisely, we construct an operator acting linearly on absolutely convergent matrix valued expansions which selects appropriate terms of those expansions. In the context of our framework a new representation of matrix valued functions is available. Our representation is simple, requiring only the computation of matrix inverses and basic manipulations of the Taylor series of scalar functions. To show the usefulness of our approach we obtain fundamental results related to the basic theory of ODEs, perturbative calculations, multiple integrals involving the matrix exponential, the Sylvester equation, the multivariate Faà di Bruno formula, Hermite polynomials, queuing theory, and graph theory.},

  abstract     = {The Education section of SIAM Review presents three papers in this issue. In the first paper Robert M. Corless and Leili Rafiee Sevyeri discuss “The Runge Example for Interpolation and Wilkinson&#39;s Examples for Rootfinding.” The authors use several classical examples in numerical analysis to discuss propagation of error and the role of sensitivity and the conditioning of the functions subject to numerical procedures. The first example was brought to the fore by Carl Runge in 1901 when exploring the approximation error occurring in polynomial interpolation. The effect illustrated by this example is also referred to as Runge&#39;s phenomenon. It consists of oscillation at the edges of the domain of the function, which is observed when the function is approximated by interpolation using a high-degree polynomial over a uniform grid. This example plays an important role and is used in many numerical analysis textbooks because it illustrates pitfalls and limitations of high-degree polynomial interpolation. It reveals that using higher degree polynomials does not always improve the accuracy of the approximation. The second example is a classical polynomial, introduced by J. H. Wilkinson in his paper “The Evaluation of the Zeros of Ill-Conditioned Polynomials. Part I&quot; [Numer. Math., 1 (1959), pp. 150--166]. It illustrates a difficulty when finding the root of a polynomial, which stems from the sensitivity of the polynomial at the location of the roots, with respect to perturbations in its coefficients. Wilkinson&#39;s polynomial is also frequently used in the context of eigenvalue calculation. In that case, computing eigenvalues of a matrix by first calculating the coefficients of the matrix&#39;s characteristic polynomial and then calculating its roots may result in a very ill-conditioned problem even if the original problem is well conditioned. The characteristic polynomial can be very sensitive to perturbations in its coefficients near its roots. The authors bring the theory of backward error analysis and conditioning to the reader&#39;s attention. This approach explains the phenomena of the presented examples and is in harmony with the numerical experience thus far. The second paper is titled “Mathematics + Cancer: An Undergraduate `Bridge&#39; Course in Applied Mathematics.” It is presented by Tracy L. Stepien, Eric J. Kostelich, and Yang Kuang. The authors share their insightful experience with a one-semester modeling course based on mathematical models for cancer occurrence and growth, as well as models describing the effect of certain cancer treatments. The targeted audience is undergraduate students who have completed standard courses on calculus, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and introductory probability and statistics. The offer of such a course supports various goals. It helps develop modeling skills for students in applied mathematics while at the same time exposing students to many mathematical ideas and enabling them to make informed choices about future specialization in the various branches of applied mathematics and statistics. Additionally, the students come in contact with compelling scientific as well as social problems and see the impact of applied mathematics on real life. Finally, a research component in the course provides invaluable experience to the enrolled students. The paper discusses the structure and organization of the course. The main portion of it provides an overview of various modules whose suggested length is one or two weeks. The topics encompass statistical models regarding the occurrence of cancer depending on age, the growth of the population of cancer cells, the evolution of resistance to treatment, tumor dynamics at the cellular and tissue levels, the measurement and assessment of treatment efficacy, short-term forecasts of tumor progression, the use of statistics in designing clinical trials, and many others. Finally, the public health perspective is brought into the picture: how much cancer might be preventable by a healthy life style, how much is due to environmental exposure, and how much might be due to hereditary reasons or random mutations. The reader will find a sample syllabus, homework problem sets, and computer lab descriptions in the supplementary materials. The authors themselves aim to give students experience in reading research papers and do not use textbooks. However, they mention suitable textbooks for those teachers who would prefer to follow one. Extensive references to relevant literature are included. Finally, the authors point out that their course might be used as a template for other courses of similar type based on topics drawn from other areas of the mathematical sciences. The third contribution is the paper by Antônio Neto on “Matrix Analysis and Omega Calculus.” The first ideas giving rise to Omega calculus were presented by MacMahon in his book Combinatory Analysis published by Cambridge University Press in 1915--1916. The main subject there is the solution of linear Diophantine systems composed of equalities and inequalities; in this context, the author involves results on partitions of natural numbers. In that framework, the so-called Omega operator is applied systematically to each equation and inequality. The final outcome of the procedure is a generating function describing all the solutions of the Diophantine system. The methodology is referred to as MacMahon&#39;s partition analysis (MPA) or Omega calculus. Frequently, the latter is identified with the Omega package, which contains numerical methods based on MPA. In the current paper, Antônio Neto presents an extension of Omega operator calculus to matrix-valued functions. The focus is placed on the matrix exponential functions, which have many applications. The extended Omega operator is defined based on the matrix exponential series and the Neumann series with the use of the Frobenius norm for square matrices. Application of the Omega operator to the theory of differential equations, to graph theory, and to other areas is discussed. The paper contains a compact and easy-to-apply method to compute multiple integrals involving matrix exponentials based on MPA. The author stipulates that the presented definition and method generalize and unify previous work. The material is accessible to advanced undergraduate students in applied mathematics who have knowledge in calculus including Taylor series of scalar functions, various norms, matrix operations and inversion, and matrix exponentials.},

  abstract     = {Many problems in nature, being characterized by a parameter, are of interest both with a fixed parameter value and with the parameter approaching an asymptotic limit. Numerical schemes that are convergent in both regimes offer robust discretizations, which can be highly desirable in practice. The asymptotically compatible schemes studied in an earlier published version of this paper meet such objectives for a class of parametrized problems. An extended version of the abstract mathematical framework is established rigorously here, together with applications to the numerical solution of both nonlocal models and their local limits. In particular, the framework can be applied to nonlocal models of diffusion and a general state-based peridynamic system parametrized by the horizon radius. Recent findings have exposed the risks associated with some discretizations of nonlocal models when the horizon radius is proportional to the discretization parameter. Thus, it is desirable to develop asymptotically compatible schemes for such models so as to offer robust numerical discretizations to problems involving nonlocal interactions on multiple scales. This work provides new insight in this regard through a careful analysis of related conforming finite element discretizations, and the finding is valid under minimal regularity assumptions on exact solutions. It reveals that for the nonlocal models under consideration and their local limit, as long as the finite element space contains continuous piecewise linear functions, the Galerkin finite element approximation is always asymptotically compatible. For piecewise constant finite elements, whenever applicable, it is shown that a correct local limit solution can also be obtained as long as the discretization (mesh) parameter decreases faster than the modeling (horizon) parameter does. These results can be used to guide future computational studies of nonlocal problems. Some other applications, such as the fractional PDE limit of nonlocal models, and open questions are also presented.},

  abstract     = {The SIGEST article in this issue, “Asymptotically Compatible Schemes for Robust Discretization of Parametrized Problems with Applications to Nonlocal Models,” by Xiaochuan Tian and Qiang Du, concerns differential equation models that (a) involve a physical parameter, and (b) change their nature when this parameter reaches an asymptotic limit. The work is motivated by nonlocal peridynamic models in continuum mechanics, which reduce to classical differential equation models as the horizon parameter tends to zero. In this setting, a numerical method is said to be asymptotically compatible if it produces approximations that are robust in such a limit. This is an important property which allows us to avoid inaccurate or unphysical numerical solutions from inappropriate choices of model and discretization parameters. The authors develop a general framework that relies on minimal assumptions. Their high-level results, provided in Theorems 2.6 to 2.8, are neatly summarized in Figure 2.1. The results are then applied to finite element discretizations of nonlocal diffusion and peridynamic models. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate the results. The original article appeared in the SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis (SINUM) in 2014. As indicated by its high citation count, this work is relevant to many circumstances where multiscale or nonlocal effects are present; examples include viscosity limits in nonlinear conservation laws, phase field models with sharp interfaces, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The original SINUM article presented an asymptotically compatible framework for self-adjoint problems. In converting their article into SIGEST form, the authors have extended the results to cover both self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint problems with parameter-dependent data. Here, some modifications, and new notation, were required to distinguish between operators and their adjoints, between test and trial functions, and between the associated function spaces. The authors also reorganized the derivation of the main results and streamlined the presentation of numerical experiments. In addition, they have discussed subsequent developments in the field, increasing the size of the bibliography from 40 to 63, and highlighted some current challenges. We also note that the results in the original SINUM article formed part of the 2017 Columbia University Ph.D. dissertation of the first author, Xiaochuan Tian, who was subsequently awarded an Association for Woman in Mathematics Dissertation Prize.},

It arises in various applications in fields such as biology, materials science, and finance. This article spotlights the unusual behavior of sticky Brownian motions from the perspective of applied mathematics, and provides tools to efficiently simulate them. We show that a sticky Brownian motion arises naturally for a particle diffusing on $\mathbb{R}_+$ with a strong, short-ranged potential energy near the origin. This is a limit that accurately models mesoscale particles, those with diameters $\approx 100$nm$-10\mu$m, which form the building blocks for many common materials. We introduce a simple and intuitive sticky random walk to simulate sticky Brownian motion, which also gives insight into its unusual properties. In parameter regimes of practical interest, we show that this sticky random walk is two to five orders of magnitude faster than alternative methods to simulate a sticky Brownian motion. We outline possible steps to extend this method toward simulating multidimensional sticky diffusions.},

We present a variety of statistically motivated loss functions for various scenarios. We provide a generalized framework for computing gradients and handling missing data that enables the use of standard optimization methods for fitting the model.

  abstract     = {Tensors, or multiway arrays, are often used for storage of high-dimensional data. In order to have compression, completion, or interpretation of such data, the data tensor is factored according to a proposed model consistent with some belief about the data. The first Research Spotlights article, “Generalized Canonical Polyadic Tensor Decomposition,&quot; by David Hong, Tamara G. Kolda, and Jed A. Duersch, treats the problem of finding a low-rank tensor decomposition that minimizes a cost functional defined from a componentwise loss function. The difference between the proposed generalized canonical polyadic (GCP) decomposition and the well-known CP decomposition is the flexibility in the choice of loss function, which can be tailored to reflect the appropriate statistical likelihood of a model given the data: low rankness of the tensor is enforced as a constraint. The main result of the paper is in Theorem 3, which addresses the computation of the gradients of a cost function defined in terms of any loss function that is continuously differentiable with respect to its second argument. Their result reveals an elegant expression for the gradients that enables the use of existing kernels for finding CP decompositions to be employed in their algorithm to compute the GCP. The authors use extensive numerical testing, highlighting the flexibility of their algorithm and its ability to efficiently handle missing data while simultaneously illustrating the potential gain to the data analyst in choosing loss functions more consistent with the data. A variety of applications are considered, including analysis of a chat network and explaining factors for mouse neural activity. A “sticky” diffusion process, as defined in the second Research Spotlights article, “Sticky Brownian Motion and Its Numerical Solution,&quot; refers to solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that can spend finite time on a lower-dimensional boundary. Materials like concrete, paint, and toothpaste have something in common: in the limit, the dynamics of the collection of mesoscale particles of which each is comprised approaches a sticky diffusion process. Sticky Brownian motion (SBM), the simplest example of a sticky diffusion process, is the primary focus of the present work. The goals of authors Nawaf Bou-Rabee and Miranda C. Holmes-Cerfon are to call the attention of the greater applied mathematics community to the topic of sticky diffusions as well as to offer a numerical method to allow for simulation of a sticky diffusion with a relatively large time step. These goals are evident in the presentation of material. The mathematical setup of an SBM is given in section 2. Beginning with the Brownian dynamics equations and assumptions on the potential energy function, the dynamics of the probability density are discussed, including asymptotic behavior in the “sticky limit.&quot; The authors discuss how to find the generator of the SBM and give some examples. The generator is the basis for the numerical method they develop in section 3, which the authors claim is orders of magnitude faster than alternative methods to simulate a sticky Brownian motion. The authors complement their presentation with a mathematical literature review of some additional methods for characterizing SBM. The final section serves as a well-considered road map for the reader interested in extending this work to a higher-dimensional setting.},

  abstract     = {This survey article addresses the class of continuous-time systems where a system modeled by ordinary differential equations is coupled with a static or time-varying set-valued operator in the feedback. Interconnections of this form model certain classes of nonsmooth systems, including sweeping processes, differential inclusions with maximal monotone right-hand side, complementarity systems, differential and evolution variational inequalities, projected dynamical systems, and some piecewise linear switching systems. Such mathematical models have seen applications in electrical circuits, mechanical systems, hysteresis effects, and many more. When we impose a passivity assumption on the open-loop system, and regard the set-valued operator in the feedback as maximally monotone, we obtain a set-valued Lur&#39;e dynamical system. In this article we review the mathematical formalisms, their relationships, main application fields, well-posedness (existence, uniqueness, continuous dependence of solutions), and stability of equilibria. An exhaustive bibliography is provided.},

  abstract     = {Bernard Brogliato and Aneel Tanwani are the authors of “Dynamical Systems Coupled with Monotone Set-Valued Operators: Formalisms, Applications, Well-Posedness, and Stability,” the Survey and Review paper in this issue. To get a feeling for the problems being dealt with, the reader may have a look at the electrical circuit in Figure 4.1(c) (also shown on the cover). Kirchhoff&#39;s voltage law yields (L\dot x = -Rx+łambda); (x) is the current through the resistor, and (L\dot x), (-Rx) and (łambda) are, respectively, the drops in voltage across the inductor, the resistor, and the diode. This would be a differential equation for (x) if (łambda) were a known function of (x), which it isn&#39;t. For any (łambda &gt;0), i.e., whenever the voltage at the cathode is higher than at the anode, the (ideal) diode does not conduct, which implies that (x) coincides with the current (i) from the source. Therefore when (x) takes the value (i), all we can say about (łambda) is that it lies in the set ((0,\infty)). We have encountered an equation of the general format studied in the paper: (\dot x = f(t,x)+G(t,x)), \(x\in\mathbb R^n\), (w\in\mathbb R^m), where (w) is required to belong to a set (-a̧l F(t,Hx,Jw)) ((G), (H), and (J) are matrices). The diode circuit also illustrates the concept of complementarity: either the diode does not conduct ((łambda &gt;0) and (x-i=0)) or it does, and then (łambda = 0), (x-i&gt;0). Similar complementarity problems are frequent in mechanics; a bouncing ball either has a positive height and gets no force from the floor or has zero height and then receives an upward reaction force. In addition to complementarity problems, the general format in the paper includes sweeping processes, maximal monotone differential equations, evolution inequalities, and additional related formalisms. The authors describe numerous applications to electrical circuits, mechanical systems, and other fields. With 592 references and five appendices that provide mathematical background, the article has much to offer those interested in an area that is certainly important in modeling.},
