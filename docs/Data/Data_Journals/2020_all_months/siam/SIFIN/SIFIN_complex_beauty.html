  abstract     = {In this paper, we adopt a flexible filtering procedure to extract information from high-frequency data. Specifically, we provide a parsimonious framework to integrate realized measures from high-frequency index and derivative prices. In a simulation study, we document the incremental information offered by realized measures and show that even though high-frequency index prices help identify spot variance and jump price dynamics, it is the addition of high-frequency option prices that enables variance jumps to be identified. A series of empirical studies based on the S&amp;P 500 index and options show that estimation precision improves with the addition of information from intraday option prices.},

  abstract     = {Anomalous diffusions arise as scaling limits of continuous-time random walks whose innovation times are distributed according to a power law. The impact of a nonexponential waiting time does not vanish with time and leads to different distribution spread rates compared to standard models. In financial modeling this has been used to accommodate random trade duration in the tick-by-tick price process. We show here that anomalous diffusions are able to reproduce the market behavior of the implied volatility more consistently than the usual Lévy or stochastic volatility models. Two distinct classes of underlying asset models are analyzed: one with independent price innovations and waiting times, and one allowing dependence between these two components. These models capture the well-known paradigm according to which shorter trade duration is associated with higher return impact of individual trades. We fully describe these processes in a semimartingale setting leading to no-arbitrage pricing formulas, study their statistical properties, and in particular observe that skewness and kurtosis of asset returns do not tend to zero as time goes by. We finally characterize the large-maturity asymptotics of call option prices, and find that the convergence rate to the spot price is slower than in standard Lévy regimes, which in turn yields a declining implied volatility term structure and a slower time decay of the skew.},

  abstract     = {The rough Heston model has recently attracted the attention of many finance practitioners and researchers as it maintains the basic structure of the classical Heston model while having descriptive capabilities in terms of microstructural foundations of the market. Using the fact that the characteristic function of log-price in this model could be expressed in terms of the solution of a nonlinear parametric fractional Riccati differential equation not admitting a closed-form solution, devising efficient numerical schemes for pricing and calibration under this model has become a crucial need in the computational finance community. Although the fractional Adams method has been used in most of the recent studies on the rough Heston model, this method suffers from some stability and convergence issues in treating the problem. In this paper, we present a numerical method based on Newton--Kantorovich quasi-linearization to solve the nonlinearity issue followed by spectral collocation based on “polyfractonomials&quot; to approximate the fractional derivative in an accurate and efficient manner. We provide sufficient conditions under which our method is convergent and the order of convergence is also obtained. In order to guarantee the specified convergence rate, we first prove some regularity results on the linearized problem and then employ the proposed scheme to solve a practical calibration problem from the SPX options market. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated by comparing the obtained results with those of the fractional Adams method as well as a fast hybrid scheme based on fractional power series expansion.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the optimal exercise of an American call executive stock option (ESO) written on a stock whose drift parameter falls to a lower value at a change point, an exponentially distributed random time independent of the Brownian motion driving the stock. Two agents, who do not trade the stock, have differing information on the change point and seek to optimally exercise the option by maximizing its discounted payoff under the physical measure. The first agent has full information and observes the change point. The second agent has partial information and filters the change point from price observations. This scenario is designed to mimic the positions of two employees of varying seniority, a fully informed executive and a partially informed less senior employee, each of whom receives an ESO. The partial information scenario yields a model under the observation filtration $\widehat{\mathbb{F}}$ in which the stock drift becomes a diffusion driven by the innovations process, an $\widehat{\mathbb{F}}$-Brownian motion also driving the stock under $\widehat{\mathbb{F}}$, and the partial information optimal stopping value function has two spatial dimensions. We rigorously characterize the free boundary PDEs for both agents, establish shape and regularity properties of the associated optimal exercise boundaries, and prove the smooth pasting property in both information scenarios, exploiting some stochastic flow ideas to do so in the partial information case. We develop finite difference algorithms to numerically solve both agents&#39; exercise and valuation problems and illustrate that the additional information of the fully informed agent can result in exercise patterns which exploit the information on the change point, lending credence to empirical studies which suggest that privileged information of bad news is a factor leading to early exercise of ESOs prior to poor stock price performance.},

The nominal pricing kernel is constructed in a multiplicative manner that allows for closed-form pricing of vanilla inflation products suchlike zero-coupon swaps, year-on-year swaps, caps and floors, and the exotic limited-price-index swap. We study the conditions necessary for the multiplicative nominal pricing kernel to give rise to short rate models for the nominal interest rate process. The proposed class of pricing kernel models retains the attractive features of a nominal multicurve interest rate model, such as closed-form pricing of nominal swaptions, and it isolates the so-called inflation convexity-adjustment term arising from the covariance between the underlying stochastic drivers. We conclude with examples of how the model can be calibrated to EUR data.},

Roughly stated, a market is informationally efficient with respect to $\mathbb{G}$ if and only if there exists an equivalent probability measure that makes the price process normalized by the value of a money market account a martingale with respect to $\mathbb{G}$ if and only if the market satisfies no free lunch with vanishing risk and no dominance with respect to $\mathbb{G}$.

  abstract     = {Treating high dimensionality is one of the main challenges in the development of computational methods for solving problems arising in finance, where tasks such as pricing, calibration, and risk assessment need to be performed accurately and in real-time. Among the growing literature addressing this problem, Gass et al. [Finance Stoch., 22 (2018), pp. 701--731] propose a complexity reduction technique for parametric option pricing based on Chebyshev interpolation. As the number of parameters increases, however, this method is affected by the curse of dimensionality. In this article, we extend this approach to treat high-dimensional problems: Additionally, exploiting low-rank structures allows us to consider parameter spaces of high dimensions. The core of our method is to express the tensorized interpolation in the tensor train format and to develop an efficient way, based on tensor completion, to approximate the interpolation coefficients. We apply the new method to two model problems: American option pricing in the Heston model and European basket option pricing in the multidimensional Black--Scholes model. In these examples, we treat parameter spaces of dimensions up to 25. The numerical results confirm the low-rank structure of these problems and the effectiveness of our method compared to advanced techniques.},

By using a dynamic programming approach, we first provide a dual formulation of the seller&#39;s (superhedging) price for the European option as the supremum, over a suitable set of equivalent probability measures $Q \in {\cal Q}$, of the $f$-evaluation/expectation under $Q$ of the payoff. We also establish a characterization of the seller&#39;s (superhedging) price as the initial value of the minimal supersolution of a constrained backward stochastic differential equation with default. Moreover, we provide some properties of the terminal profit made by the seller, and some results related to replication and no-arbitrage issues.

On a fixed probability space, we are given a standard Brownian motion and a pair of random variables $(\tau, \zeta) \in (0,+\infty) \times E$, with $E \subset \mathbb{R}^m$, that enlarge the reference filtration, i.e., the one generated by the Brownian motion. These random variables can be interpreted financially as a default time and an associated mark. After introducing a BSDE driven by the Brownian motion and the random measure associated to $(\tau, \zeta)$, we define the dynamic risk measure $(\rho_t)_{t \in [0,T]}$, for a fixed time $T &gt; 0$, induced by its solution. We prove that $(\rho_t)_{t \in [0,T]}$ can be decomposed in a pair of risk measures, acting before and after $\tau$, and we characterize its properties giving suitable assumptions on the driver of the BSDE. Furthermore, we prove an inequality satisfied by the penalty term associated to the robust representation of $(\rho_t)_{t \in [0,T]}$ and we discuss the dynamic entropic risk measure case, providing examples where it is possible to write explicitly its decomposition and simulate it numerically.},

  abstract     = {Reinsurance counterparty credit risk (RCCR) is the risk of a loss arising from the fact that a reinsurance company is unable to fulfill her contractual obligations toward the ceding insurer. RCCR is an important risk category for insurance companies which, so far, has been addressed mostly via qualitative approaches. In this paper we therefore study value adjustments and dynamic hedging for RCCR. We propose a novel model that accounts for contagion effects between the default of the reinsurer and the price of the reinsurance contract. We characterize the value adjustment in a reinsurance contract via a partial integro-differential equation and derive the hedging strategies using a quadratic method. The paper closes with a simulation study which shows that dynamic hedging strategies have the potential to significantly reduce RCCR.},

To maximize revenues, the broker considers trading in a currency triplet which consists of the illiquid pair and two other liquid currency pairs. The liquid pairs in the triplet are chosen so that one of the pairs is redundant. The broker is risk-neutral and accounts for model ambiguity in the FX rates to make her strategy robust to model misspecification. When the broker is ambiguity neutral (averse) the trading strategy in each pair is independent (dependent) of the inventory in the other two pairs in the triplet. We employ simulations to illustrate how the robust strategies perform. For a range of ambiguity aversion parameters, we find the mean profit and loss (P&amp;L) of the strategy increases and the standard deviation of the P&amp;L decreases as ambiguity aversion increases.},

We propose a dynamic risk-indifference pricing criterion derived from fully-dynamic risk measures on the $L_p$-spaces for $p\in [1,\infty]$. The concept of fully-dynamic risk measures extends the one of dynamic risk measures by adding the actual possibility of changing the risk perspectives over time. This family is then characterized by a double time index. Our framework fits well the study of both short- and long-term investments. In this paper we analyze whether the risk-indifference pricing criterion actually provides a proper convex price system. It turns out that, depending on $p$, this is not always the case. Then an extension of the framework beyond $L_p$ becomes necessary. Furthermore, we consider the relationship of the fully-dynamic risk-indifference price with no-good-deal bounds. We shall provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the fully-dynamic risk measures so that the corresponding risk-indifference prices satisfy the no-good-deal bounds. Remarkably, the use of no-good-deal bounds also provides a method to select the risk measures and thus construct a proper fully-dynamic risk-indifference price system within the $L_2$-spaces.},

We propose a deep neural network (DNN) architecture to describe the underlying control process. The DNN consists of $K$ subnetworks, where $K$ is the total number of decision steps. The feedback control function is determined solely by the network parameters. In this way, the multiperiod portfolio optimization problem is linked to a training problem of the DNN, that can be efficiently computed by the standard optimization techniques for network training. We offer a sufficient condition for the algorithm to converge for a general utility function and general asset return dynamics including serially dependent returns. Specifically, under the condition that the global minimum of the DNN training problem is attained, we prove that the algorithm converges with the quadratic utility function when the risky asset returns jointly follow multivariate autoregressive (1) models and/or multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (1,1) models. Numerical examples demonstrate the superior performance of the DNN algorithm in various return dynamics for a high-dimensional portfolio (up to 100 dimensions).},

Since such assets are not traded at all times, we argue that the natural underlying for derivative risk-neutral valuation is not the asset itself but rather a contract that, when the asset is in trade suspensions upon maturity, cash settles the last quoted price plus the interest accrued since the last quote update. Combining some elements from semimartingale time changes and potential theory, we devise martingale dynamics and no-arbitrage relations for such a price process, provide Fourier transform--based pricing formulae for derivatives, and study the asymptotic behavior of the obtained formulae as a function of the halt parameters. The volatility surface analysis reveals that the short-term skew of our model is typically steeper than that of the underlying Lévy models, indicating that the presence of a trade suspension risk is consistent with the well-documented stylized fact of volatility skew persistence/explosion. A simple calibration example to market option prices is provided.},

  abstract     = {Node centrality is one of the most important and widely used concepts in the study of complex networks. Here, we extend the paradigm of node centrality in financial and economic networks to consider the changes of node “importance” produced not only by the variation of the topology of the system but also as a consequence of the external levels of risk to which the network as a whole is subjected. Starting from the “Susceptible-Infected” (SI) model of epidemics and its relation to the communicability functions of networks, we develop a series of risk-dependent centralities for nodes in (financial and economic) networks. We analyze here some of the most important mathematical properties of these risk-dependent centrality measures. In particular, we study the newly observed phenomenon of ranking interlacement, by means of which two entities may interlace their ranking positions in terms of risk in the network as a consequence of the change in the external conditions only, i.e., without any change in the topology. We test the risk-dependent centralities by studying two real-world systems: the network generated by collecting assets of the S&amp;P 100 and the corporate board network of the U.S. top companies, according to Forbes in 1999. We found that a high position in the ranking of the analyzed financial companies according to their risk-dependent centrality corresponds to companies more sensitive to the external market variations during the periods of crisis.},

  abstract     = {We formulate the multiperiod, time consistent mean-CVAR (conditional value at risk) asset allocation problem in a form amenable to numerical computation. Our numerical algorithm can impose realistic constraints such as no shorting, no leverage, and discrete rebalancing. We focus on long term (i.e., 30 year) strategies, which would be typical of an investor in a defined contribution pension plan. A comparison with precommitment mean-CVAR strategies shows that adding the time consistent constraint compares unfavorably with the pure precommitment strategy. Since the precommitment strategy computed at time zero is identical to a time consistent strategy based on an alternative objective function, the time zero precommitment mean-CVAR strategy is implementable in this case. Hence it would seem that there is little to be gained from enforcing time consistency.},

  abstract     = {It has often been stated that, within the class of continuous stochastic volatility models calibrated to vanillas, the price of a VIX future is maximized by the Dupire local volatility model. In this article we prove that this statement is incorrect: we build a continuous stochastic volatility model in which a VIX future is strictly more expensive than in its associated local volatility model. More generally, in our model, strictly convex payoffs on a squared VIX are strictly cheaper than in the associated local volatility model. This corresponds to an inversion of convex ordering between local and stochastic variances, when moving from instantaneous variances to squared VIX, as convex payoffs on instantaneous variances are always cheaper in the local volatility model. We thus prove that this inversion of convex ordering, which is observed in the S&amp;P 500 market for short VIX maturities, can be produced by a continuous stochastic volatility model. We also prove that the model can be extended so that, as suggested by market data, the convex ordering is preserved for long maturities.},

Here it is shown how various delta-type hedging strategies perform and can be evaluated in such markets in the case of European options. A precise characterization of the hedging cost, the replication cost caused by the volatility fluctuations, is presented in an asymptotic regime of rapid mean reversion for the volatility fluctuations. The optimal dynamic asset based hedging strategy in the considered regime is identified as the so-called practitioners&#39; delta hedging scheme. It is moreover shown that the performances of the delta-type hedging schemes are essentially independent of the regularity of the volatility paths in the considered regime and that the hedging costs are related to a Vega risk martingale whose magnitude is proportional to a new market risk parameter. It is also shown via numerical simulations that the proposed hedging schemes which derive from option price approximations in the regime of rapid mean reversion are robust: the practitioners&#39; delta hedging scheme that is identified as being optimal by our asymptotic analysis when the mean reversion time is small seems to be optimal with arbitrary mean reversion times.},

Within this model we treat portfolio optimization problems for power utility functions. Using a suitable representation of the fractional part, followed by a reasonable approximation we show that it is possible to cast the problem in the classical stochastic control framework. This approach is generic for fractional processes. We derive explicit solutions and obtain as a by-product the Laplace transform of the integrated volatility. In order to get rid of some undesirable features we introduce a new model for the rough path scenario which is based on the Marchaud fractional derivative. We provide a numerical study to underline our results.},

In the context of Basel III and IV as well as Solvency II, regulatory capital calculation is carried out through the tools of monetary risk measures. The notion of risk aversion that we focus on has four equivalent formulations: through consistency with second-order stochastic dominance, conditional expectations, or portfolio diversification, and through expected social impact. The class of monetary risk measures representing this notion of risk aversion is referred to as consistent risk measures. We characterize the class of consistent risk measures by establishing an Expected Shortfall (ES)-based representation, and as a by-product, we obtain new results on the representation of convex risk measures. We present several examples where consistent risk measures naturally appear. Using the obtained representation results, we study risk sharing and optimal investment problems and find several new analytical solutions.},

In this paper we show that the XVA equations are well-posed, including in the realistic case where capital is deemed fungible as a source of funding for variation margin. This intertwining of capital at risk and the FVA, added to the fact that the KVA is part of capital at risk, leads to a system of backward SDEs (BSDEs) of the McKean type (anticipated BSDEs) for the FVA and the KVA, with coefficients entailing a conditional risk measure of the one-year-ahead increment of the martingale part of the FVA. This is first considered in the case of a hypothetical bank without debt. In the practical case of a defaultable bank, the resulting anticipated BSDEs, which are stopped before the default of the bank, are solved likewise after reduction to a reference market filtration.},

We introduce a general framework to express the superhedging and market model prices for an informed agent. Our key insight is that an informed agent can be seen as a regular agent who can restrict her attention to a certain subset of possible paths. We use results of Hou and Obłój [Finance Stoch., 22 (2018), pp. 511--567], on the robust approach with beliefs to establish the pricing-hedging duality for an informed agent. Our results cover a number of scenarios, including information arriving before trading starts, arriving after the static position in European options is formed but before dynamic trading starts, or arriving at some point before maturity. For the latter we show that the superhedging value satisfies a suitable dynamic programming principle, which is of independent interest. Finally, we explore how our results allow us to develop robust valuation of information.},
