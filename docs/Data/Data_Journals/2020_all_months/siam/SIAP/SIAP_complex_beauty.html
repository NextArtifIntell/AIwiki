  abstract     = {In this work, we provide an algorithm to compute efficiently and accurately the full outgoing modal Green&#39;s kernel for the scalar wave equation in local helioseismology under spherical symmetry. Due to the high computational cost of a full Green&#39;s function, current helioseismic studies rely on single-source computations. However, a more realistic modelization of the helioseismic products (cross-covariance and power spectrum) requires the full Green&#39;s kernel. In the classical approach, the Dirac source is discretized and one simulation gives the Green&#39;s function on a line. Here, we propose a two-step algorithm which, with two simulations, provides the full kernel on the domain. Moreover, our method is more accurate, as the singularity of the solution due to the Dirac source is described exactly. In addition, it is coupled with the exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann boundary condition, providing optimal accuracy in approximating the outgoing Green&#39;s kernel, which we demonstrate in our experiments. In addition, we show that high-frequency approximations of the nonlocal radiation boundary conditions can represent accurately the helioseismic products.},

The model consists of a nonlocal transport equation for the predator, coupled to an ordinary differential equation for the prey. We deduce a system of 3 ODEs for some integral quantities of the transport equation, which generalizes some classical Lotka--Volterra systems. By taking an asymptotic regime of fast hunger variation, we find that this system provides new interpretations of classical Holling-type functional responses. We also show that, with a small extension, the system can reproduce predator-prey role reversal bistability results observed in the literature. We next establish a well-posedness result for the nonlocal transport equation. Finally, we show that in the basin of attraction of the nontrivial equilibrium, the asymptotic behavior of the original coupled PDE-ODE system is completely described by solutions of the ODE system.},

This paper focuses on the impact of habitat shift driven by climate change on the persistence and propagation of a population with birth pulse. We first present a class of impulsive reaction-diffusion models with heterogeneous nonlinear reaction in high-dimensional space and study their threshold dynamics. We provide the persistence criterion of the system in bounded domains, and prove the existence, uniqueness, and global attraction of a positive steady state. Then we extend the results from bounded domains to the whole space. Our results indicate how the speed of the shifting habitat edge and impulsive reproduction (or harvesting) rate determine the persistence and extinction of the population. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.},

It takes the form of a nonlinear equation that describes evolution of reacting species concentration at the boundary coupled to a diffusion equation. Using analytic techniques, this coupled system of equations is reduced to a singular integrodifferential equation (IDE). A numerical approximation of this equation is developed that achieves greater than first-order accuracy in time and greater than second-order accuracy in space, despite the presence of a singular temporal convolution kernel and a discontinuous boundary condition. The mathematical model was validated using Bio-FET data, and stochastic regression was employed to separate signal from noise. Results show that our IDE provides a robust way of estimating important parameters such as diffusion coefficients and kinetic rate constants.},

These tensors shall be symmetric and traceless. We write down the explicit expressions. The order parameters to describe the local anisotropy are then chosen as some of the invariant tensors averaged about the density function. Next, we discuss the classification of local anisotropy by the symmetry of the whole infinitesimal volume. This mesoscopic symmetry can be recognized by the value of the order parameter tensors in the sense of maximum entropy state. For some sets of order parameter tensors involving different molecular symmetries, we give the classification of mesoscopic symmetries, in which the threefold, fourfold, and polyhedral symmetries are examined.},

This class of novel materials have exhibited superb mechanical properties, such as high strength combined with other desired features. The strength of crystalline materials is associated with the motion of dislocations. In this paper, we derive a stochastic continuum model based on the Peierls--Nabarro framework for interlayer dislocations in a bilayer HEA from an atomistic model that incorporates the atomic level randomness. We use asymptotic analysis and limit theorem in the convergence from the atomistic model to the continuum model. The total energy in the continuum model consists of a stochastic elastic energy in the two layers, and a stochastic misfit energy that accounts for the interlayer nonlinear interaction. The obtained continuum model can be considered as a stochastic generalization of the classical, deterministic Peierls--Nabarro model for the dislocation core and related properties. This derivation also validates the stochastic model adopted by Zhang et al. [Acta Mater., 166 (2019), pp. 424--434].},

The examples are radial flows of similarity type and describe a spherically symmetric and continuous wave moving toward the origin. At time of focusing, both the density and the velocity become unbounded at the origin. This is followed by an expanding shock wave which slows down as it interacts with the incoming flow. While unbounded radial Euler flows have been known since the work of Guderley [Luftfahrtforschung, 19 (1942), pp. 302--311], those are at the borderline of the regime covered by the Euler model: The upstream pressure field vanishes identically (either because of vanishing temperature or vanishing density there). In contrast, the solutions we build exhibit an everywhere strictly positive pressure field, demonstrating that the geometric effect of wave focusing is strong enough on its own to drive the primary flow variables to infinity.},

  abstract     = {Biological cells and membranes need to be properly shaped to fulfill many fundamental functions. This shaping is often aided by the aggregation of membrane-bound proteins that both sense the membrane curvature and shape it. Therefore, these protein inclusions interact with each other through the deformation of the membrane that they influence, and a key question is to understand the law that governs their interaction. Whereas the theoretical case of isotropic proteins is well understood, an important feature of many such proteins is their anisotropic interaction with the membrane. Here, we derive an interaction law for rigid circular membrane inclusions which impose an anisotropic contact angle on the surrounding membrane. We include the effects of both membrane bending and tension. Using asymptotic analysis, we identify two distinguished limits corresponding to weak anisotropy/weak tension and strong anisotropy/strong tension, respectively. The resulting laws exhibit a bistability in the equilibrium separation of inclusions. Inclusions with very weak anisotropy equilibrate with large separation, those with very strong anisotropy equilibrate with small separation, while there is a range of anisotropies for which both equilibria are stable. Our results provide a theoretical mechanism for the global aggregation of inclusions seen both in experiments and simulations.},

We use here a completely different mathematical approach, which allows us to consider very general forms of environmental variations and to give an analytic description of the full trajectories of adaptation, including the transient phase, before a stationary behavior is reached. The main idea behind our approach is to study a bivariate distribution of two “fitness components&quot; that contains enough information to describe the distribution of fitness at any time. This distribution solves a degenerate parabolic equation that is dealt with by defining a multidimensional cumulant generating function associated with the distribution and solving the associated transport equation. We apply our results to several examples and check their accuracy using stochastic individual-based simulations as a benchmark. These examples illustrate the importance of being able to describe the transient dynamics of adaptation to understand the development of drug resistance in pathogens.},

In this paper, we develop a new continuum model for the coupling and sliding motions of grain boundaries that avoids the time-consuming calculation of the long-range elastic interaction. In this model, the long-range elastic interaction is replaced by a constraint of Frank&#39;s formula. The constrained evolution problem in our new continuum model is further solved by using the projection method. Effects of the coupling and sliding motions in our new continuum model and relationship with the classical motion by curvature model are discussed.

In this paper, we examine the dynamical consequences of the invasion of mixotrophs in a system that is a limiting case of the chemostat. The model is a hybrid of a competition model describing the competition between autotroph and mixotroph populations for a limiting resource, and a predator--prey-type model describing the interaction between autotroph and herbivore populations. Our results show that mixotrophs are able to invade in both autotrophic environments and environments described by interactions between autotrophs and herbivores. The interaction between autotrophs and herbivores might be in equilibrium or cycle. We find that invading mixotrophs have the ability to both stabilize and destabilize autotroph-herbivore dynamics depending on the competitive ability of mixotrophs. The invasion of mixotrophs can also result in multiple attractors.},

  abstract     = {We study analytically and numerically the minimizers for the Cahn--Hilliard energy functional with a symmetric quartic double-well potential and under a strong anchoring condition (i.e., the Dirichlet condition) on the boundary of an underlying bounded domain. We show a bifurcation phenomenon determined by the boundary value and a parameter that describes the thickness of a transition layer separating two phases of an underlying system of binary mixtures. For the case that the boundary value is exactly the average of the two pure phases, if the bifurcation parameter is larger than or equal to a critical value, then the minimizer is unique and is exactly the homogeneous state. Otherwise, there are exactly two symmetric minimizers. The critical bifurcation value is inversely proportional to the first eigenvalue of the negative Laplace operator with the zero Dirichlet boundary condition. For a boundary value that is larger (or smaller) than that of the average of the two pure phases, the symmetry is broken and there is only one minimizer. We also obtain the bounds and morphological properties of the minimizers under additional assumptions on the domain. Our analysis utilizes the notion of the Nehari manifold and connects it to the eigenvalue problem for the negative Laplacian with the homogeneous boundary condition. We numerically minimize the functional $E$ by solving the gradient-flow equation of $E$, i.e., the Allen--Cahn equation, with the designated boundary conditions, and with random initial values. We present our numerical simulations and discuss them in the context of our analytical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the inverse acoustic scattering problem with phaseless total-field data at a fixed frequency. An approximate factorization method is developed to numerically reconstruct both the location and shape of the unknown scatterer from the phaseless total-field data generated by incident plane waves at a fixed frequency and measured on the circle $\partial B_R$ with a sufficiently large radius $R$. The theoretical analysis of our method is based on the asymptotic property in the operator norm from $H^{1/2}({\mathbb S}^1)$ to $H^{-1/2}({\mathbb S}^1)$ of the phaseless total-field operator defined in terms of the phaseless total-field data measured on $\partial B_R$ with large enough $R$, where $H^s({\mathbb S}^1)$ is a Sobolev space on the unit circle ${\mathbb S}^1$ for real number $s$, together with the factorization of a modified far-field operator. The asymptotic property of the phaseless total-field operator is also established in this paper with the theory of oscillatory integrals. The unknown scatterer can be either an impenetrable obstacle of sound-soft, sound-hard, or impedance type, or an inhomogeneous medium with a compact support, and the proposed inversion algorithm does not need to know the boundary condition of the unknown obstacle in advance. Numerical examples are also carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our inversion method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a factorization type method for inverse scattering problems with phaseless data.},

  abstract     = {Large-time asymptotic solutions for the reaction-diffusion front between one static reactant and one diffusing reactant are known. These states apply to single-step reactions with a mean-field reaction rate proportional to $\rho^m \alpha^n$ (with $m,n\ge1$), where $\rho, \alpha$ are concentrations of the diffusing and static reactants, respectively. Such reaction kinetics commonly arise in, for example, simple corrosion models of a porous solid, subject to a diffusing reactant. Here we address a more complex two-step corrosion reaction for oxidation of uranium in a water-vapor environment. In this case, additional complexity arises through a pair of coupled reaction fronts (one with $m=2, n=1$ and the other with $m=3, n=1$). Furthermore, we allow for material expansion owing to the corrosion process and a strong dependence of diffusion coefficients on the static reactant distribution. In the large-time limit there are four main asymptotic regions, comprising two diffusion layers and two reaction fronts. Asymptotic matching of these regions allows us to construct a large-time solution that gives analytical predictions for the positions of the two propagating fronts, thickness of the diffusion layers, and concentration of diffusing species outside of the fronts. This is the first mechanistic model of uranium oxidation in water vapor and predicts a thin propagating subsurface (hydride) layer, as recently observed in atom-probe tomography experiments.},

In addition, we prove that interval truncation and finite section method, which are employed to regularize the singular differential expressions and the infinite number of coupled equations, are spectrally exact. This means that all spectral points are approximated and no spectral pollution occurs, thus confirming, for the first time, that numerical eigenvalue approximations for the highly nonnormal MHD dynamo problems are reliable.},

Motivated by phase-separation processes observed in lipid monolayers in film-balance experiments, the starting point of the model is the Cahn--Hilliard equation coupled with the equations of linear elasticity, the so-called Cahn--Larché system. Owing to the fact that the mechanical deformation takes place on a macrosopic scale whereas the phase separation happens on a microscopic level, a multiscale approach is imperative. We assume the pattern of the evolving microstructure to have an intrinsic length scale associated with it, which, after nondimensionalization, leads to a scaled model involving a small parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$, which is suitable for periodic-homogenization techniques. The problem is formally homogenized using the method of two-scale asymptotic expansions, which leads to a model of distributed-microstructure type in the limit. Finally, numerical simulations based on finite elements showcase the model behavior of the distributed-microstructure model.},

  abstract     = {Human movement facilitates the spatial spread of infectious diseases and poses a serious threat to disease prevention and control. A large number of spatial epidemic models have been proposed and analyzed in the past few decades. The vast majority of these studies focus on establishing a threshold result between disease persistence and extinction in terms of the basic reproduction number. In reality, disease eradication is difficult and even impossible for many infectious diseases. Thus, it is crucial to understand how population dispersal affects the total infection size and its distribution across the environment. Based on a susceptible-infected-susceptible patch model with standard incidence, some general results on the number of infections over all patches and disease prevalence in each patch are obtained. For the two-patch submodel, we give a complete classification of the model parameter space as to whether dispersal is beneficial or detrimental to disease control. Particularly, fast diffusion decreases the basic reproduction number but may increase the total infection size, highlighting the necessity of evaluating control measures with other quantities besides the basic reproduction number. Higher infection risk means higher disease prevalence in the two-patch case. However, numerical simulations find that the patch with the highest risk of infection may not have the highest disease prevalence when three or more patches are concerned. Besides spatial heterogeneity and diffusion coefficient, the total infection size is also significantly affected by patch connectivity.},

We found that this assumption has two consequences: (i) the blocking time is finite, and (ii) the characteristics issuing from the points where the retained particle concentration reaches its maximum are not uniquely determined. The exact solution is constructed by a modified method of characteristics, which removes the ambiguity by using an additional blocking line equation derived from the original problem. The weak singularity of the solution on the blocking line is described. A simple sufficient coefficient condition for the unique solvability of the problem is derived.},

The plane stress problem of linear elasticity for a plate with multiple straight cracks is solved by using integral representations of complex potentials. The resulting system of singular integro-differential equations is reduced to a system of Fredholm equations of the second kind. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are discussed. The numerical results are presented for two straight cracks located on the same straight line.

There are two classes of resonances, corresponding to poles of a scattering problem. A sequence of resonances has an imaginary part that is nonzero and on the order of the width $\varepsilon$ of the slits; these are associated with Fabry--Perot resonance, with field enhancement of order $1/\varepsilon$ in the slits. The focus of this study is another class of resonances which become real valued at normal incidence, when the Bloch wavenumber $\kappa$ is zero. These are embedded eigenvalues of the scattering operator restricted to a period cell, and the associated eigenfunctions extend to surface waves of the slab that lie within the radiation continuum. When $0&lt;|\kappa|\ll 1$, the real embedded eigenvalues will be perturbed as complex-valued resonances, which induce the Fano resonance phenomenon. We derive the asymptotic expansions of embedded eigenvalues and their perturbations as resonances when the Bloch wavenumber becomes nonzero. Based on the quantitative analysis of the diffracted field, we prove that the Fano-type anomalies occur for the transmission of energy through the slab, and we show that the field enhancement is of order $1/(\kappa\varepsilon)$, which is stronger than Fabry--Perot resonance.},

  abstract     = {The Debye--Hückel (DH) equation is a fundamental physical model in chemical thermodynamics that describes the free energy (chemical potential, activity) of an ion in electrolyte solutions. We derive, analyze, and verify a generalized DH equation from a fourth-order Poisson--Bikerman theory that accounts for steric and correlation effects of ions and water treated as nonuniform spheres with voids. The derivation yields Debye and correlation lengths that include the steric effect. We perform asymptotic analyses in detail and show that generalized DH and Debye models reduce to their classical counterparts when these effects vanish in limiting cases. Moreover, the generalized DH model is shown to differ much from Hückel&#39;s model as their approximations of Born solvation energies are inverse of each other in terms of fitting parameters and ionic strength. Numerical evidence also verifies this finding which may explain why extended DH models need more parameters generally without physical hints to fit experimental data over wide ranges of composition, temperature, and pressure. The generalized DH model needs only the same three parameters for all different ions in a binary or ternary electrolyte solution to fit each experimental data curve of mean activities at various concentrations (up to 6 mol/kg), temperatures (25 to 300 $\operatorname{^{\circ}{C}}$), and pressures (1.01 to 85.5 bars).

  abstract     = {The current paper proposes a parametric eigenvalue problem for the Helmholtz equation on the plane based on two well-known physical models of emission from two-dimensional (2-D) microcavity lasers. The first model has been developed for passive, either lossy or lossless, open cavities and is usually referred to as the Complex-Frequency Eigenvalue Problem. The second model, named the Lasing Eigenvalue Problem (LEP), has been tailored to characterize emission from open cavities, filled in with gain material, on the threshold of nonattenuating in time radiation. Our generalized model contains both of them as special cases. We reduce the original problem to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for a set of boundary integral equations with weakly singular kernels and formulate it as a parametric eigenvalue problem for a holomorphic Fredholm operator-valued function, which is convenient for mathematical and numerical analysis. Using this formulation and fundamental results of the theory of holomorphic operator-valued functions, we study the properties of the spectrum. For numerical solution of the problem, we propose a Nyström method, prove its convergence, and derive error estimates in the eigenvalue approximation. Combining this discretization with the residual inverse iteration technique, we compute approximate solutions of LEP and compare them with the exact ones and with the results obtained using other numerical methods.},

This regularization is a simple postprocessing low-pass filter for the Fourier series of a phantom. We also study the adjoint and the normal operator of the X-ray transform on the flat torus. The X-ray transform is unitary on the flat torus. We have implemented the Torus CT method using MATLAB and tested it with simulated data with promising results.

  abstract     = {In this paper, based on geometric singular perturbation analysis of a quasi--one-dimensional Poisson--Nernst--Planck model for ionic flows, we study the problem of zero current condition for ionic flows through membrane channels with a simple profile of permanent charges. For ionic mixtures of multiple ion species, under an equal diffusion constant condition, Eisenberg, Liu, and Xu [Nonlinearity, 28 (2015), pp. 103--128] derived a system of two equations for determining the reversal potential and an equation for the reversal permanent charge. The equal diffusion constant condition is significantly degenerate from physical points of view. For unequal diffusion coefficients, the analysis becomes extremely challenging. This work will focus only on two ion species, one positively charged (cation) and one negatively charged (anion), with two arbitrary diffusion coefficients. Dependence of reversal potential on channel geometry and diffusion coefficients has been investigated experimentally, numerically, and analytically in simple setups, in many works. In this paper, we identify two governing equations for the zero current, which enable one to mathematically analyze how the reversal potential depends on the channel structure and diffusion coefficients. In particular, we are able to show, with a number of concrete results, that the possible different diffusion constants indeed make significant differences. The inclusion of channel structures is also far beyond the situation where the Goldman--Hodgkin--Katz (GHK) equation might be applicable. A comparison of our result with the GHK equation is provided. The dual problem of reversal permanent charges is briefly discussed too.},

  abstract     = {The skin is the largest organ of the human body, offering an accessible interface for the administration of drugs. The main obstacle to transdermal drug delivery is the skin&#39;s barrier properties, due essentially to the stratum corneum, the skin&#39;s outermost layer, which is impermeable to most drugs. There are several techniques used to modify the barrier properties of the stratum corneum and to enhance the permeation of drugs through the skin. One popular approach to overcome this barrier is iontophoresis, a technique where electric fields are applied to enhance the transport, by adding an electric potential gradient to a concentration gradient. Several factors affect iontophoresis transdermal drug delivery (TDD). Among them the mechanical properties of skin play an important role. The skin behaves like a viscoelastic material, and it is well known that transport in viscoelastic media is non-Fickian. Consequently, the traditional Fickian advection-diffusion iontophoretic models are inappropriate. As aging induces huge modifications in the mechanical properties of the skin, the models presented in this paper can provide clinicians with guidelines for personalized TDD. The paper is concerned with the analysis and numerical simulation of a non-Fickian viscoelastic model for iontophoretic transdermal drug transport. A multilayer approach is followed, where the polymeric drug reservoir and the properties of the main skin layers are taken into account. Numerical simulations illustrate the effect of aging in TDD and shed light on how to include it in personalized TDD protocols.},

Our model includes a stochastic component which can account for uncertainty in the problem and thus includes a Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation with viscosity. We discuss the model in the presence and absence of stochastic effects and suggest numerical methods for simulating the model. We discuss two different notions of an optimal path when there is uncertainty in the problem. Finally, we compare the optimal paths suggested by the model at different levels of uncertainty and observe that as the size of the uncertainty tends to zero (and thus the viscosity in the equation tends to zero), the optimal path tends toward the deterministic optimal path.},

Rich dynamical behavior and bifurcation phenomena of the state-dependent impulsive models by extending special ODE systems have been studied intensively. In this study, we aim at constructing a general modeling framework of a state-dependent impulsive system and generalizing analytical methods for its dynamical behavior. To do this, we propose a state-dependent impulsive model based on the generalized Kolmogorov model. The existence and global stability of the semitrivial periodic solution (STPS) is discussed initially. By defining a one-parameter family of discrete maps for the proposed system, we completely investigated the transcritical, pitchfork, and backward bifurcations of this generalized state-dependent impulsive model near the STPS with respect to all of the key parameters. Consequently, we showed the existence and stability of a positive order-1 periodic solution near the STPS. Further, we discussed the existence and stability of a positive order-2 periodic solution via flip bifurcation. Finally, we showed that the main results can be easily applied to specialized models in the fields of integrated pest management and the control of infectious disease.},

As mentioned by Holling (without mathematical model), we divide the population of predators into the searching and the handling predators. In this article we study some properties of this model and conclude by proving that the model converges to the classical Rosenzweig--MacArthur model by using an appropriate rescaling. This convergence property is observed by using numerical simulations. We also apply this model to the Canadian snowshoe hares and the lynx.},

  abstract     = {When modeling transport of a chemical species to a colony of bacteria in a biofilm, it is computationally expensive to treat each bacterium even as a point sink, let alone to capture the finite nature of each bacterium. Instead, models tend to treat the bacterial and extracellular matrix domains as a single phase, over which an effective bulk uptake is imposed. In this paper, we systematically derive the effective equations that should govern such a system, starting from the microscale problem of a chemical diffusing through a colony of finite-sized bacteria, within which the chemical species can also diffuse. The uptake within each bacterium is a nonlinear function of the concentration; across the bacterial membrane the concentration flux is conserved and the concentration ratio is constant. We upscale this system using homogenization via the method of multiple scales, investigating the two distinguished limits for the effective uptake and the effective diffusivity, respectively. This work is a natural sequel to Dalwadi et al. [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 78 (2018), 1300--1329], the main difference in this current work being nonlinear uptake within the bacteria and a general partition coefficient across the bacterial membrane. The former results in a significantly more involved general asymptotic analysis, and the latter results in the merging of two previous distinguished limits. We catalogue the different types of microscale behavior that can occur in this system and the effect they have on the observable macroscale uptake. In particular, we show how the nonlinearities in microscale uptake should be modified when upscaled to an effective uptake and how different microscale uptake properties and behaviors, such as chemically depleted regions within the bacteria, can lead to the same observed uptake.},

In a previous paper [N. Sugimoto, J. Fluid. Mech., 244 (1992), pp. 55--78], it has been shown that this device also allows the propagation of acoustic solitons. In the present paper, the mathematical properties of the coupled system are analyzed: formation of singularity in finite time, existence of entropy solutions in fractional bounded variation spaces, and uniqueness with a single family of entropies. New results are also deduced about weakly coupled systems. Numerical simulations illustrate these findings.},

We work at a fixed temperature and study the reduced stable equilibria in terms of the edge length, $\lambda$, of the regular polygon, $E_K$, with $K$ edges. We analytically compute a novel “ring solution” in the $\lambda \to 0$ limit, with a unique point defect at the center of the polygon for $K \neq 4$. The ring solution is unique. For sufficiently large $\lambda$, we deduce the existence of at least $[K/2 ]$ classes of stable equilibria and numerically compute bifurcation diagrams for reduced equilibria on a pentagon and hexagon, as a function of $\lambda^2$, thus illustrating the effects of geometry on the structure, locations, and dimensionality of defects in this framework.},

  abstract     = {The problem of simulating solid-state dewetting of thin films in three dimensions (3D) by using a sharp-interface approach is considered in this paper. Based on the thermodynamic variation, a speed method is used for calculating the first variation to the total surface energy functional. The speed method shares more advantages than the traditional use of parameterized curves (or surfaces); e.g., it is more intrinsic, and its variational structure (related with the Cahn--Hoffman ${\xi}$-vector) is clearer. By making use of the first variation, necessary conditions for the equilibrium shape of the solid-state dewetting problem are given, and a kinetic sharp-interface model which includes the surface energy anisotropy is also proposed. This sharp-interface model describes the interface evolution in 3D which occurs through surface diffusion and contact line migration. By solving the proposed model, we perform numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of patterned films, e.g., the evolution of a cuboid and pinch-off of a long cuboid. Numerical simulations in 3D demonstrate the performance of the sharp-interface approach to capture many of the complexities observed in solid-state dewetting experiments.},

However, the critical case when the growth rate is null is rarely treated. The aim of this paper is to provide a method that can be applied in many situations to prove that in the critical case, the process converges in temporal average to the extinction set.

For this coupled PDE-ODE system, we first employ a multiscale asymptotic expansion to derive amplitude equations near codimension-one Hopf bifurcation points for both in-phase and antiphase synchronization modes. The resulting normal form equations pertain to any vector nonlinearity restricted to the ODE compartments. In our first example, we apply our weakly nonlinear theory to a coupled PDE-ODE system with Sel&#39;kov membrane kinetics, and show that the symmetric steady state undergoes supercritical Hopf bifurcations as the coupling strength and the diffusivity vary. We then consider the PDE diffusive coupling of two Lorenz oscillators. It is shown that this coupling mechanism can have a stabilizing effect, characterized by a significant increase in the Rayleigh number required for a Hopf bifurcation. Within the chaotic regime, we can distinguish between synchronous chaos, where both the left and right oscillators are in-phase, and chaotic states characterized by the absence of synchrony. Finally, we compute the largest Lyapunov exponent associated with a linearization around the synchronous manifold that only considers odd perturbations. This allows us to predict the transition to synchronous chaos as the coupling strength and the diffusivity increase.},

In order to describe the spatial dynamics of diapausing species, we propose a novel model involving (a) seasonal succession to distinguish the normal growth period, diapause period, and postdiapause period; (b) a diffusion term to represent the random movement of species; and (c) a maturation delay term to describe the developmental duration of species. We first study the model in a bounded domain for the survival and establishment of a species. The extinction and persistence of the species can be predicted by the basic reproduction ratio $\mathcal {R}_0$. Then we investigate the model in an unbounded domain for the spreading of the species. Our results show that the minimal wave speed for a periodic traveling wave is equal to the spreading speed. Numerical simulations are performed to validate theoretical results and in particular to compare the effects of two diapausing strategies: diapausing in the adult stage and in the immature stage.},

After that, we formulate the inverse problem as a constrained optimization problem with an appropriate regularization and prove the existence and stability of the regularized minimizers. To facilitate the numerical solution of the nonlinear nonconvex constrained optimization, we introduce a feasible Lagrangian and its discrete variant.

Using this complex analysis method, we also design nonelliptical neutral coated inclusions with anisotropic conductivity. Neutral coated inclusions do not perturb a background uniform field when they are inserted into a homogeneous matrix. Although coated inclusions of various shapes are neutral to a single field, only concentric ellipses or confocal ellipsoids can be neutral to all uniform fields. This paper presents our work relating to the construction of nonelliptical coated inclusions with anisotropic conductivity in two dimensions that are neutral to all uniform fields, where the assignment of the flux condition on the boundary of the core depends on the applied background field. Using these neutral inclusions, we obtain cylindrical neutral inclusions in three dimensions, with no flux applied to the boundary of the core and with the anisotropic conductivity function of the shell given in accordance with the background uniform field.},

Thus we describe a new nonlinear optimization approach to solve the equivalent problem leading to a community detection strategy based on $TV_Q$. The proposed approach relies on the use of a fast first-order method that embeds a tailored active-set strategy. We report extensive numerical comparisons with standard matrix-based approaches and the Generalized RatioDCA approach for nonlinear modularity eigenvectors, showing that our new method compares favorably with state-of-the-art alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by a problem in the management of ecological populations, we study the bifurcation structure known as period adding structure for a family of one-dimensional bimodal piecewise linear maps. This structure is rather degenerate compared to the general case usually addressed in the literature. The degeneracy affects both the type of border collision bifurcations constituting the bifurcation structure and the number and location of the bifurcation points in the parameter space. We provide rigorous theoretical results that yield a complete description of the degenerate border collision bifurcations and a full determination of the bifurcation structure. This allows us to extend partial results previously reported about a similar problem. From an ecological point of view, we provide numerical simulations showing potential risks and opportunities associated with the bifurcation structure studied here. Moreover, we provide examples of applications of our results to some well-known population models, showing that the period adding structure ranges from very simple to very intricate.},

Here we provide a mesoscopic kinetic foundation for the widely used ZINB model based on the biochemical reaction kinetics underlying transcription. Using multiscale modeling and simplification techniques, we show that the ZINB distribution of mRNA abundance and the related phenomenon of transcriptional bursting naturally emerge from a three-state stochastic transcription model. We further reveal a nontrivial quantitative relationship between dropout events and transcriptional bursting, which provides novel insights into how the burst size and burst frequency affect the dropout rate. Two different biophysical origins of overdispersion are also clarified at the single-cell level.},

  abstract     = {Cell division is a process that involves many biochemical steps and complex biophysical mechanisms. To simplify the understanding of what triggers cell division, three basic models that subsume more microscopic cellular processes associated with cell division have been proposed. Cells can divide based on the time elapsed since their birth, their size, and/or the volume added since their birth---the timer, sizer, and adder models, respectively. Here, we propose unified adder-sizer models and investigate some of the properties of different adder processes arising in cellular proliferation. Although the adder-sizer model provides a direct way to model cell population structure, we illustrate how it is mathematically related to the well-known model in which cell division depends on age and size. Existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to our 2+1-dimensional PDE model are proved, leading to the convergence of the discretized numerical solutions and allowing us to numerically compute the dynamics of cell population densities. We then generalize our PDE model to incorporate recent experimental findings of a system exhibiting mother-daughter correlations in cellular growth rates. Numerical experiments illustrating possible average cell volume blowup and the dynamical behavior of cell populations with mother-daughter correlated growth rates are carried out. Finally, motivated by new experimental findings, we extend our adder model cases where the controlling variable is the added size between DNA replication initiation points in the cell cycle.},

  abstract     = {Community structure underpins many complex networked systems and plays a vital role when components in some modules of the network come under attack or failure. Here, we study the generalized $k$-core ($Gk$-core) percolation over a modular random network model. Unlike the archetypal giant component based quantities, $Gk$-core can be viewed as a resilience metric tailored to gauge the network robustness subject to spreading virus or epidemics paralyzing weak nodes, i.e., nodes of degree less than $k$, and their nearest neighbors. We develop two complementary frameworks, namely, the generating function formalism and the rate equation approach, to characterize the $Gk$-core of modular networks. Through extensive numerical calculations and simulations, it is found that $G2$-core percolation undergoes a continuous phase transition while $Gk$-core percolation for $k\ge3$ displays a first-order phase transition for any fraction of interconnecting nodes. The influence of interconnecting nodes tends to be more visible nearer the percolation threshold. We find by studying modular networks with two Erdös--Rényi modules that the interconnections between modules affect the $G2$-core percolation phase transition in a way similar to an external field in a spin system, where Widom&#39;s identity regulating the critical exponents of the system is fulfilled. However, this analogy does not seem to exist for $Gk$-core with $k\ge3$ in general.},

The method replaces the friction in underdamped Langevin dynamics with a dynamical variable, updated according to a negative feedback loop control law as in the Nosé--Hoover thermostat. Using a hypocoercivity analysis we show that the law of Adaptive Langevin dynamics converges exponentially rapidly to the stationary distribution, with a rate that can be quantified in terms of the key parameters of the dynamics. This allows us in particular to obtain a central limit theorem with respect to the time averages computed along a stochastic path. Our theoretical findings are illustrated by numerical simulations involving classification of the MNIST data set of handwritten digits using Bayesian logistic regression.},

A feature of significant interest in these systems is the mean square displacement (MSD) of the particles. Long-time asymptotic approximations of the MSD have been established, via the Tauberian theorem, for systems in which the distribution of the step durations is asymptotically a power law of infinite variance. We extend these results, using elementary analysis, and obtain closed-form expressions as well as power law bounds for the MSD in equilibrium, and representations of the MSD as sums of superlinear, linear, and sublinear terms. We show that the superlinear components are determined by the mean and asymptotics of the step durations, but also that the linear and sublinear components (whose size has implications for the accuracy of the asymptotic approximation) depend on the entire distribution function.},

The system lets the pedestrians spend time at and move along walls by means of sticky boundaries and boundary diffusion. As an alternative to Neumann-type boundary conditions, sticky boundaries and boundary diffusion have a “smoothing” effect on pedestrian motion. When these effects are active, the pedestrian paths are semimartingales with the first-variation part absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure $dt$ rather than an increasing process (which in general induces a measure singular with respect to $dt$) as is the case under Neumann boundary conditions. We show that the proposed mean-field model for pedestrian motion admits a unique weak solution and that it is possible to control the system in the weak sense, using a Pontryagin-type maximum principle. We also relate the mean-field type control problem to the social cost minimization in an interacting particle system. We study the novel model features numerically, and we confirm empirical findings on pedestrian crowd motion in congested corridors.},

Here, we develop a two-dimensional model for the concurrent evolution of the GB/TJ network based upon the microscopic mechanism of motion, the motion of line defects (disconnections) in the GB that have both dislocation and step character. The evolution involves thermally activated disconnection formation/annihilation and migration of multiple disconnections modes/types. We propose this crystallography-respecting continuum model for the disconnection mechanism of GB/TJ dynamics derived with a variational approach based on the principle of maximum energy dissipation. The resultant TJ dynamics is reduced to an optimization problem with constraints that account for local microstructure geometry, conservation of Burgers vectors, and thermal-kinetic limitations on disconnection fluxes. We present an analysis of and numerical simulations based upon our model to demonstrate the dependence of the GB and TJ mobilities and the TJ drag effect on the disconnection properties, and we compare the predictions with molecular dynamics and experimental observations.},

Nonlinear Sci., 23 (2013), pp. 777--805]. These correspond to arbitrary phase shifts of the wrinkled pattern in the transverse direction. While such behavior is normally associated with problems in the presence of a continuous symmetry group, an unloaded rectangular sheet possesses only a finite symmetry group. In order to understand this phenomenon, we consider a simpler problem more amenable to analysis---a finite-length beam on a nonlinear softening foundation under axial compression. We first obtain asymptotic results via amplitude equations that are valid as a certain nondimensional beam length becomes sufficiently large. We deduce that any two phase shifts of a solution differ from one another by exponentially small terms in that length. We validate this observation with numerical computations, indicating the presence of solution orbits for sufficiently long beams. We refer to this as “hidden asymptotic symmetry.”},

In order to account for the horizontal connectivity of V1 in such a context, a diffusion process compatible with the geometry of the space is defined following the classical approach of K.-T. Sturm [Ann. Probab., 26 (1998), pp. 1--55]. The construction of our distance function neither requires any group parameterization of the family of RPs nor involves any differential structure. As such, it adapts to nonparameterized sets of RPs, possibly obtained through numerical procedures; it also allows us to model the lateral connectivity arising from nondifferential metrics such as the one induced on a pinwheel surface by a family of filters of vanishing scale. On the other hand, when applied to the classical framework of Gabor filters, this construction yields a distance approximating the sub-Riemannian structure proposed as a model for V1 by Citti and Sarti [J. Math. Imaging Vision Archive, 24 (2006), pp. 307--326], thus showing itself to be consistent with existing cortex models.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the evolution of the vortex filament equation (VFE): $X_t = X_s \wedge X_{ss},$ taking $M$-sided regular polygons with nonzero torsion as initial data. Using algebraic techniques backed by numerical simulations, we show that the solutions are polygons at rational times, as in the zero-torsion case. However, unlike in that case, the evolution is not periodic in time; moreover, the multifractal trajectory of the point $X(0,t)$ is not planar and appears to be a helix for large times. These new solutions of VFE can be used to illustrate numerically that the smooth solutions of VFE given by helices and straight lines share the same instability as those already established for circles. This is accomplished by showing the existence of variants of the so-called Riemann&#39;s nondifferentiable function that are as close to smooth curves as desired when measured in the right topology. This topology is motivated by some recent results on the well-posedness of VFE, which prove that the self-similar solutions of VFE have finite renormalized energy.},

  abstract     = {Microsilica particles arise as a byproduct of silicon furnace operation, created inside high temperature flames due to the combustion reaction of silicon monoxide with oxygen. These nanoparticles, which grow as silicon dioxide vapor condenses on the surface of existing particles, are used in a variety of composite materials. The size and quality of the particles affect the performance of the material used for such applications, and hence control of these quantities is of importance to manufacturers. Motivated by this, we derive a mathematical model that connects local thermal and chemical concentrations conditions to the formation and growth of microsilica particles. We consider two distinct reductions of our general model: the case of initially well-mixed or spatially homogeneous chemical species (modeling the region within the flame or reaction zone), and the case of initially spatially separated chemical species, in which diffusion will play a dominant role in providing material to a combustion front (modeling a larger cross section, which contains a reaction zone with limiting quantities of fuel which must diffuse into the reaction zone). In both cases, we provide asymptotic solutions for the temperature, chemical concentrations, and number density function of microsilica particles in the oxygen rich limit, and compare them to numerical simulations. Motivated by realistic furnace control mechanisms, we treat the relative quantity of oxygen to other fuel components and the saturation concentration of silicon dioxide as control parameters, discussing how each may be used to modify the properties (such as size and abundance) of microsilica particles formed. One physically interesting finding is the theoretical description of a bimodal distribution for microsilica particle size which was previously observed in experiments.},

We demonstrate a robust and scalable SPCA algorithm by formulating it as a value-function optimization problem. This viewpoint leads to a flexible and computationally efficient algorithm. The approach can further leverage randomized methods from linear algebra to extend SPCA to the large-scale (big data) setting. Our proposed innovation also allows for a robust SPCA formulation which obtains meaningful sparse principal components in spite of grossly corrupted input data. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated using both synthetic and real world data, and show exceptional computational efficiency and diagnostic performance.},

In the case of weak-strong competition where the invasive competitor is stronger than the local one, it is shown that solutions converge uniformly to the semipositive equilibrium such that the invasive species survives while the local species becomes extinct, and vice versa. In the case of weak-weak competition, solutions converge uniformly to the positive equilibrium such that both invasive and local species coexist.

Dendritic cell therapy is an immunotherapy that capitalizes on the critical role dendritic cells play in shaping the immune response. We formulate a mathematical model employing ordinary differential and delay differential equations to understand the effectiveness of dendritic cell vaccines, accounting for cell trafficking with a blood and tumor compartment. We reduce our model to a system of ordinary differential equations. Both models are validated using experimental data from melanoma-induced mice. The simplicity of our reduced model allows for mathematical analysis and admits rich dynamics observed in a clinical setting, such as periodic solutions and bistability. We give thresholds for tumor elimination and existence. Bistability, in which the model outcomes are sensitive to the initial conditions, emphasizes a need for more aggressive treatment strategies, since the reproduction number below unity is no longer sufficient for elimination. A sensitivity analysis exhibits the parameters most significantly impacting the reproduction number, thereby suggesting the most efficacious treatments to use together with a dendritic cell vaccine.},

We present a variation of the Stekloff eigenvalue problem which overcomes both of these issues by the introduction of a certain operator in the boundary condition, and we provide numerical examples to examine the practical consequences of this variation.

  abstract     = {A bound state in the continuum (BIC) on a periodic structure sandwiched between two homogeneous media is a guided mode with a frequency and a wavenumber such that propagating plane waves with the same frequency and wavenumber exist in the homogeneous media. Optical BICs are of significant current interest since they have applications in lasing, sensing, filtering, switching, and many light emission processes, but they cannot be excited by incident plane waves when the structure consists of linear materials. In this paper, we study the diffraction of a plane wave by a periodic structure with a second-order nonlinearity, assuming the corresponding linear structure has a BIC and the frequency and wavenumber of the incident wave are one-half of those of the BIC. Based on a scaling analysis and a perturbation theory, we show that the incident wave may induce a very strong second harmonic wave dominated by the BIC and also a fourth harmonic wave that cannot be ignored. The perturbation theory reveals that the amplitude of the BIC is inversely proportional to a small parameter depending on the amplitude of the incident wave and the nonlinear coefficient. In addition, a system of four nonlinearly coupled Helmholtz equations (the four-wave model) is proposed to model the nonlinear process. Numerical solutions of the four-wave model are presented for a periodic array of circular cylinders and used to validate the perturbation results.},

We added mortality of individual honey bees to an existing model of thermoregulation as an approach to model the elevated losses of bees that are reported worldwide. The aim of this analysis is to obtain a better fundamental understanding of the consequences of individual mortality during winter. This model resembles the well-known Keller--Segel model. In contrast to the often studied Keller--Segel models, our model includes a chemotactic coefficient of which the sign can change as honey bees have a preferred temperature: When the local temperature is too low, they move toward higher temperatures, whereas the opposite is true for too high temperatures. Our study shows that we can distinguish two states of the colony: one in which the colony size is above a certain critical number of bees in which the bees can keep the core temperature of the colony above the threshold temperature and one in which the core temperature drops below the critical threshold and the mortality of the bees increases dramatically, leading to a sudden death of the colony. This model behavior may help explain the globally observed honey bee colony losses during winter.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a stochastic SIRS epidemic model with an incidence rate that is sufficiently general and that covers many incidence rate models considered to date in the literature. We classify the extinction and permanence by introducing $\lambda$, a real-valued threshold. We show that if $\lambda0$, the epidemic becomes strongly stochastically permanent. This result substantially generalizes and improves the related results in the literature. Moreover, the mathematical development in this paper is interesting in its own right. The essential difficulties lie in that the dynamics of the susceptible class depend explicitly on the removed class resulting in a three-dimensional system rather than a two-dimensional system. Consequently, the methodologies developed in the literature are not applicable here. One of the main ingredients in the analyses is this: Though it is not possible to compare solutions in the interior and on the boundary for all $t\in[0,\infty)$, approximation in a long but finite interval $[0,T]$ can be carried out. Then, using the ergodicity of the solution on the boundary and exploiting the mutual interplay between the distance of solutions in the interior and solutions on the boundary and the exponential decay or growth (depending on the sign of the Lyapunov exponent), one can classify the behavior of the system. The convergence to the invariant measure is established under the total variation norm together with the corresponding rate of convergence. To demonstrate, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate our results.},

There are several methods for constructing such ${{x}_n}_{n=0}^\infty$. However, in general, those methods do not guarantee $\lim_{n\to\infty}{x}_n=0$. Moreover, in actual computations, they yield an approximate solution ${\widehat{x}_n}_{n=0}^N$ different from the truncated true solution ${{x}_n}_{n=0}^N$ and coinciding with the solution of the system being truncated at $N$ with ${x}_{N+1}$ set to 0. This work establishes sufficient conditions for the existence of an asymptotically vanishing solution to the system and provides the rate of convergence of the solution to the truncated system. Those results are used to analyze systems of second-order difference equations arising in the boundary-value problems in electrostatics, heat conduction, fluid mechanics, and elastostatics when a medium contains an inhomogeneity having the shape of either a torus or two unequal spheres. In particular, when $m=1$ in those problems, $\|\widehat{x}_n - {x}_n\|$ decays exponentially as $N\to\infty$.},

Today, many important real-world applications in these areas are driven by neural networks. There are also growing applications in engineering, robotics, medicine, and finance. Despite their immense success in practice, there is limited mathematical understanding of neural networks. This paper illustrates how neural networks can be studied via stochastic analysis and develops approaches for addressing some of the technical challenges which arise. We analyze one-layer neural networks in the asymptotic regime of simultaneously (a) large network sizes and (b) large numbers of stochastic gradient descent training iterations. We rigorously prove that the empirical distribution of the neural network parameters converges to the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation. This result can be considered a law of large numbers for neural networks. In addition, a consequence of our analysis is that the trained parameters of the neural network asymptotically become independent, a property which is commonly called “propagation of chaos.”},

A unique feature of this model is the automatic onset of nucleation when the moist air parcel becomes supersaturated; this is made possible by a non-Lipschitz right-hand side of the differential equation, which allows for nontrivial smooth solutions. Here we prove under mild assumptions on the external forcing that this system of equations has a unique physically consistent solution, i.e., a solution with a nonzero droplet population in the supersaturated regime.},

  abstract     = {This work provides a mathematical understanding of the elastic fingering provoked by a large axial extension of a soft solid cylinder bonded between rigid plates. In this prototypical system model, a topological transition from a ground axis-symmetric meniscus is quasi-statically controlled by the applied displacement, which acts as the order parameter of a pitchfork bifurcation. Since the isotropic elastic energy becomes nonconvex under finite strains, geometric nonlinearity is of paramount importance for the loss of uniqueness of the solution of the boundary value problem. Nonetheless, physical nonlinearity in the elastic energy is found to exert an opposite stabilizing effect. It indeed penalizes the local stretching at the free boundary that would arise as a consequence of any change of its Gaussian curvature. The theoretical and numerical results are in agreement with recent experimental observations, showing that elastic fingering is strongly affected by the aspect ratio of the disc and can be even suppressed in soft materials with physical nonlinearity.},

  abstract     = {When cooling cells to preserve them during cryopreservation, cooling too quickly results in the formation of lethal intracellular ice, while cooling too slowly amplifies the toxic effects of the cryoprotective agents (CPAs) added to slow down ice formation. We derive a mathematical model for cell cryopreservation to understand and quantify these observations. We assume that the system has a spherical geometry of three different regions: ice, extracellular liquid medium, and cell. The two interfacial boundaries separating the three regions can move and must be determined as part of the solution. The presence of CPA lowers the freezing point of the system, and the cell membrane moves due to the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane. We use a combination of numerical and asymptotic methods to determine how the temperature, the CPA concentration, and concentration of an ion species internal and external to the cell evolve during cooling for a range of cooling rates across different timescales. We introduce two metrics to characterize the cell damage caused by freezing, accounting for supercooling and CPA toxicity. Given cell properties and the operating protocol of the cryopreservation process, we show how the damage metrics can be used to predict an optimal cooling rate. Our asymptotic analysis provides a computationally efficient framework from which to determine this optimal rate.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive voter models (AVMs) are simple mechanistic systems that model the emergence of mesoscopic structure from local networked processes driven by conflict and homophily. AVMs display rich behavior, including a phase transition from a fully fragmented regime of “echo-chambers” to a regime of long-time disagreement governed by low-dimensional quasi-stable manifolds. Many extant methods for approximating the behavior of AVMs are either restricted in scope, expensive in computation, or inaccurate in predicting important statistics. In this work, we develop a novel, second-order moment closure approximation method for binary-state rewire-to-random and rewire-to-same model variants. We incorporate a small amount of noise via a random mutation term, which renders the system ergodic. Using ergodicity, we then approximate the voting process, which is non-Markovian in the second moments of the system, with a Markovian term near the phase transition. This approximation exploits an asymmetry between different classes of voting events. The resulting scheme enables us to predict the location of the phase transition and the active edge density in the regime of persistent disagreement, across the entire space of parameters and opinion densities. Numerically, our results are nearly exact for the rewire-to-random model and competitive with extant approaches for the rewire-to-same model. Moreover, our computations display constant scaling in the mean degree, enabling approximations for denser systems than previously possible. We conclude with suggestions for model refinements and extensions.},

Often the underlying cost criterion is unknown, or only partly known, and the observed optimal solutions are corrupted by noise. In this paper we propose a systematic approach to infer unknown costs from noisy observations of optimal transportation plans. The algorithm requires only the ability to solve the forward optimal transport problem, which is a linear program, and to generate random numbers. It has a Bayesian interpretation and may also be viewed as a form of stochastic optimization. We illustrate the developed methodologies using the example of international migration flows. Reported migration flow data captures (noisily) the number of individuals moving from one country to another in a given period of time. It can be interpreted as a noisy observation of an optimal transportation map, with costs related to the geographical position of countries. We use a graph-based formulation of the problem, with countries at the nodes of graphs and nonzero weighted adjacencies only on edges between countries which share a border. We use the proposed algorithm to estimate the weights, which represent cost of transition, and to quantify uncertainty in these weights.},

To fulfill this constraint during any dynamics, the surface cell density is assumed to control cell migration toward the epidermis suprabasal region, as well as the balance between production of proliferating and of differentiated cells at cell division. The well-posedness of the model is fully studied, and the unique steady state is characterized.

  abstract     = {We study a hybrid impulsive reaction-advection-diffusion model given by a reaction-advection-diffusion equation composed with a discrete-time map in space dimension $n\in\mathbb N$. The reaction-advection-diffusion equation takes the form $u^{(m)}_t \!=\! {div}(A\nabla u^{(m)}-q u^{(m)}) + f(u^{(m)}) {for} (x,t)\in\mathbb R^n \times (0,1]$, for some function $f$, a drift $q$, and a diffusion matrix $A$. When the discrete-time map is local in space we use $N_m(x)$ to denote the density of population at a point $x$ at the beginning of reproductive season in the $m$th year, and when the map is nonlocal we use $u_m(x)$. The local discrete-time map is ${u^{(m)}(x,0) = g(N_m(x)) {for} x\in \mathbb R^n , N_{m+1}(x):=u^{(m)}(x,1) {for} x\in \mathbb R^n }$ for some function $g$. The nonlocal discrete time map is ${u^{(m)}(x,0) = u_{m}(x) {for} x\in \mathbb R^n , u_{m+1}(x) := g(\int_{\mathbb R^n} K(x-y)u^{(m)}(y,1) dy) {for} x\in \mathbb R^n}$, when $K$ is a nonnegative normalized kernel. Here, we analyze the above model from a variety of perspectives so as to understand the phenomenon of propagation. We provide explicit formulas for the spreading speed of propagation in any direction $e\in\mathbb R^n$. Due to the structure of the model, we apply a simultaneous analysis of the differential equation and the recurrence relation to establish the existence of traveling wave solutions. The remarkable point is that the roots of spreading speed formulas, as a function of drift, are exactly the values that yield blow-up for the critical domain dimensions, just as with the classical Fisher&#39;s equation with advection. We provide applications of our main results to impulsive reaction-advection-diffusion models describing periodically reproducing populations subject to climate change, insect populations in a stream environment with yearly reproduction, and grass growing logistically in the savannah with asymmetric seed dispersal and impacted by periodic fires.},

Using the measured boundary voltage data, cross-sectional images of an internal conductivity distribution are reconstructed. Taking advantage of its fast temporal resolution, time-difference EIT can be used for image-based monitoring of physiological functions such as lung ventilation and cardiac blood flow. Among numerous data collection protocols, we assume current injections and voltage measurements between adjacent pairs of electrodes. The measured voltage difference between the $j$th electrode pair subject to the current injection between the $k$th electrode pair, for example, changes with time and its time-series is called a voltage channel in this paper. Investigating shapes of voltage channels, a new technique called source consistency EIT (scEIT) is proposed to extract voltage channel data originating from a physiological function or source of interest. The proposed scEIT technique suggests each voltage channel can be expressed up to a scale factor and offset value from a single shape-reference voltage channel when there exists only one time-varying source. When multiple physiological sources exist to concurrently produce correspondingly different conductivity changes, measured voltage channels are influenced by all of the sources. Using the scEIT method, each voltage channel can be expressed as a weighted sum of multiple shape-reference voltage channels of the sources. The proposed scEIT technique is verified through numerical simulations and animal experiments. Future experimental studies of applying the scEIT technique to in vivo human experiments are proposed.},

Starting from a kinetic equation which describes the movement of robots based on alignment, collisions, and occasional long distance runs according to a Lévy distribution, we obtain a system of evolution equations for the fractional diffusion for long times. We show that the system allows efficient parameter studies for a search problem, addressing basic questions like the optimal number of robots needed to cover an area in a certain time. For shorter times, in the hyperbolic limit of the kinetic equation, the PDE model is dominated by alignment, irrespective of the long range movement. This is in agreement with previous results in swarming of self-propelled particles. The article indicates the novel and quantitative modeling opportunities which swarm robotic systems provide for the study of both emergent collective behavior and anomalous diffusion on the respective time scales.},

Upscaling procedures are applied and several classes of macroscopic models together with effective transport tensors are obtained, incorporating explicitly the local growth of the solid spheres.

  abstract     = {Stochastic oscillations are ubiquitous in many systems. For deterministic systems, the oscillator&#39;s phase has been widely used as an effective one-dimensional description of a higher dimensional dynamics, particularly for driven or coupled systems. Hence, efforts have been made to generalize the phase concept to the stochastic framework. One notion of phase due to Schwabedal and Pikovsky is based on the mean--return-time (MRT) of the oscillator but has so far been described only in terms of a numerical algorithm. Here we develop the boundary condition by which the partial differential equation for the MRT has to be complemented in order to obtain the isochrons (lines of equal phase) of a two-dimensional stochastic oscillator, and rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of the MRT isochron function (up to an additive constant). We illustrate the method with a number of examples: the stochastic heteroclinic oscillator (which would not oscillate in the absence of noise), the isotropic Stuart--Landau oscillator, the Newby--Schwemmer oscillator, and the Stuart--Landau oscillator with polarized noise. For selected isochrons we confirm by extensive stochastic simulations that the return-time from an isochron to the same isochron (after one complete rotation) is always the mean--first-passage time (irrespective of the initial position on the isochron). Put differently, we verify that Schwabedal and Pikovsky&#39;s criterion for an isochron is satisfied. In addition, we discuss how to extend the construction to arbitrary finite dimensions. Our results will enable development of analytical tools to study and compare different notions of phase for stochastic oscillators.},

Next, we study the distinguished limit of the model as the dimensionless parameters $\beta$ and $d$ go to zero with $d/\beta=O(1)$, where $\beta$ measures the relative strength of the electricity and $d$ is the thickness of the insulator. Analysis of the inner problem, which governs the interface profile near the contact line, shows the existence of a well-defined apparent contact angle. Thereafter, we propose a numerical method for the inner problem. The method is based on a conventional fixed-point algorithm and the Schwarz--Christoffel mapping in complex variables. Numerical results are presented for the interface and the apparent contact angle. Significant bending of the interface is observed near the contact line. The numerical results also show that the well-defined apparent contact angle depends on the applied electrical potential and the thickness of the insulator, and the relation agrees well with the Young--Lippmann equation.},

  abstract     = {Morphological dynamics of bilayer membrane is intrinsically coupled to the translational and orientational localization of membrane proteins. In this paper we are concerned with the orientational localization of membrane proteins induced by membrane curvature in the absence of protein interaction and correlation. Entropic free energy depending on the protein orientational distribution and the curvature free energy depending on the principal curvature vectors are introduced to assemble an energy functional for the coupled system. Application of the Onsager&#39;s variational principle gives rise to a generalized Smoluchowski equation with nonlocal potential to govern the temporal and angular variations of the protein orientation. We proved the existence of the stationary solutions of the equation as fixed points of a continuous nonlinear map. The uniqueness of the stationary solution is obtained through approximation in the Fourier space, where the expansion is reduced and the coefficients are related to the modified Bessel functions of the first kind. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to calculate these coefficients. Numerical examples reproduced the orientational preference of membrane proteins on bilayer tubules as indicated by the minimization of the energy functional.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the diffusion equation in a bounded interval with a stochastically gated interior barrier at the center of the domain. This represents a stochastically gated gap junction linking a pair of identical cells. Previous work has modeled the switching of the gate as a two-state Markov process and used the theory of diffusion in randomly switching environments to derive an expression for the effective permeability of the gap junction. In this paper we extend the analysis of gap junction permeability to the case of a gate with age-structured switching. The latter could reflect the existence of a set of hidden internal states such that the statistics of the non-Markovian two-state model matches the statistics of a higher-dimensional Markov process. Using a combination of the method of characteristics and transform methods, we solve the partial differential equations for the expectations of the stochastic concentration, conditioned on the state of the gate and after integrating out the residence time of the age-structured process. This allows us to determine the jump discontinuity of the concentration at the gap junction and thus the effective permeability. We then use stochastic analysis to show that the solution to the stochastic PDE is a certain statistic of a single Brownian particle diffusing in a stochastically fluctuating environment. In addition to providing a simple probabilistic interpretation of the stochastic PDE, this representation enables an efficient numerical approximation of the solution of the PDE by Monte Carlo simulations of a single diffusing particle. The latter is used to establish that our analytical results match those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations for a variety of age-structured distributions.},

  abstract     = {The well-studied selection problems involving Saffman--Taylor fingers or Taylor--Saffman bubbles in a Hele-Shaw channel are prototypical examples of pattern selection. Exact solutions to the corresponding zero-surface-tension problems exist for an arbitrary finger or bubble speed, but the addition of surface tension leads to a discrete set of solution branches, all of which approach a single solution in the limit in which the surface tension vanishes. In this sense, the surface tension selects a single physically meaningful solution from the continuum of zero-surface-tension solutions. Recently, we provided numerical evidence to suggest that the selection problem for a bubble propagating in an unbounded Hele-Shaw cell behaves in an analogous way to other finger and bubble problems in a Hele-Shaw channel; however, the selection of the ratio of bubble speeds to background velocity appears to follow a very different surface tension scaling to the channel cases. Here we apply techniques in exponential asymptotics to solve the selection problem analytically, confirming the numerical results, including the predicted surface tension scaling laws. Further, our analysis sheds light on the multiple tips in the shape of the bubbles along solution branches, which appear to be caused by switching on and off exponentially small wavelike contributions across Stokes lines in a conformally mapped plane. These results have ramifications for exotic-shaped Saffman--Taylor fingers as well as for the time-dependent evolution of bubbles propagating in Hele-Shaw cells.},

Therefore, the aim of the present work is to analyze the thermal response of multiple thermally interacting boreholes to subannual harmonic excitations using asymptotic expansion techniques. These methods exploit the large disparity in time and length scales of the problem and allow the derivation of explicit expressions for the sought thermal response.

As reported in recent literature, the method has revealed its potential for modeling nonequilibrium flows, while a thorough theoretical analysis is largely missing but desirable. We show that the method can yield nonhyperbolic moment systems if the distribution function is approximated by a linear combination of $\delta$-functions. On the other hand, if the $\delta$-functions are replaced by their Gaussian approximations with a common variance, we prove that the moment systems are strictly hyperbolic and preserve the dissipation property (or $H$-theorem) of the kinetic equation. In the proof, we also determine the equilibrium manifold that lies on the boundary of the state space. The proofs are quite technical and involve detailed analyses of the characteristic polynomials of the coefficient matrices.},

The Evans function computations are performed using both the method where the linearization is solved on a wedge space and the MATLAB-based numerical library STABLAB. The analysis is performed on the case of a thin film front against perturbations with a nonzero amount of surfactant, as well as on the case of a front in the thin-film--surfactant system. The results show numerically that there is a region in the parameter space associated with the problem in which neither of the considered fronts exhibit an instability caused by an unstable discrete spectrum, thus no exponential growth in the time of perturbations is expected to be observed.},

  abstract     = {The deformation and stability of a two-dimensional inextensible elastic cell in an inviscid uniform stream are investigated using a conformal mapping method. At low flow speeds equilibrium solutions are obtained using an asymptotic expansion, and the sequence of critical dimensionless pressures identified by [Flaherty, Keller, and Rubinow, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 23 (1972), pp. 446--455] for a circular cell exposed to a uniform transmural pressure is shown to play a crucial role. Below the smallest critical pressure a circular cell in a weak flow deforms into a near-elliptical shape with its major axis perpendicular to the flow, and above this critical pressure its major axis is aligned with the flow. At each subsequent critical pressure the bifurcations produce, in alternating sequence, cells with either one or two axes of symmetry. In the former case, cells with left-right symmetry and cells with top-bottom symmetry are found. Equilibria for general flow speeds are calculated numerically, and their linear stability is analyzed. Cells with two degrees of rotational symmetry whose longest chord is perpendicular to the uniform stream are found to be always stable. Other configurations are found to be stable only for certain parameter values. The nonlinear evolution of unstable cells subject to a small perturbation are computed numerically, and parameter values are located for which the cell falls into one of two distinct regular motions, either flipping over in alternating directions or bulging out to the side, while being intermittently propelled downstream with the flow.},

  abstract     = {The classical dam-break problem for the shallow water system with a dry/vacuum downstream state is revisited in the context of exact solutions which generalize the Riemann setup of a Heaviside jump between constant states to continuous initial data. Two main setups are considered, chosen to illustrate how local properties of the dependent variables at the vacuum point influence the evolution over different time scales. For the first case, the elevation (density) variable is initially continuous but not differentiable at the dry (vacuum) point: no gradient catastrophe develops in this variable, with the time evolution eventually merging into a single (shifted) Stoker wave. Conversely, for the second case, the elevation joins the dry state with vanishing first derivative and a curvature jump: for an instant in time a global gradient catastrophe at the fixed contact point forms and immediately evolves as a Stoker parabolic simple wave, allowing the contact point to split into two moving points, one at the dry bed and one at a fixed elevation, where curvature singularities persist at all times. Although in both cases shocks develop for the velocity field, these are nongeneric, in that, in contrast to the usual case, infinitely many conservation laws are satisfied at all times. Long time evolution is further analyzed with the help of new stretched “unfolding” variables to extract the details of the asymptotic approach to a rarefaction Stoker-like wave.},

  abstract     = {The inverse problem of electrical impedance tomography is severely ill-posed. In particular, the resolution of images produced by impedance tomography deteriorates as the distance from the measurement boundary increases. Such depth dependence can be quantified by the concept of distinguishability of inclusions. This paper considers the distinguishability of perfectly conducting ball inclusions inside a unit ball domain, extending and improving known two-dimensional results to an arbitrary dimension $d\geq2$ with the help of Kelvin transformations. The obtained depth-dependent distinguishability bounds are also proven to be optimal.},

  abstract     = {A common form of superhydrophobic surface is made out of a periodically grooved solid substrate, wherein cylindrical bubbles are trapped in a Cassie state. When a macroscopic temperature gradient is externally applied, Marangoni forces generate thermocapillary flow of characteristic magnitude $\mathcal{U}=-aG\sigma_T/\mu$, in which $2a$ is the groove width, $G$ the applied-gradient magnitude, $\mu$ the liquid viscosity, and $\sigma_T$ the derivative of interfacial-tension coefficient with respect to the temperature. We consider the case of a gradient which is applied parallel to the grooves. Assuming a highly conducting solid substrate, we seek to calculate the longitudinal velocity component, antiparallel to the applied gradient, and in particular its “slip” value, attained at large distances away from the surface. Normalized by $\mathcal{U}$, this value depends only upon the bubble protrusion angle and the solid fraction $\epsilon$. In this paper we consider the small solid-fraction limit $\epsilon\ll1$ and focus upon the case of a $90^\circ$ protrusion angle, for which this limit is known to be highly singular in the comparable problem of shear-driven flow [O. Schnitzer, Phys. Rev. Fluids, 1 (2016), 052101]. Using matched asymptotic expansions, we find that the dimensionless slip velocity is given by ${\pi^2}/{\sqrt{8\epsilon}} + \ln\epsilon +I - \ln(8\pi^2) + o(1)$. The first two terms in this expansion follow from a lubrication-type analysis of the narrow gap region separating two neighboring bubbles. The subsequent $O(1)$ terms follow from asymptotic matching with the bubble-scale region, where the bubbles appear to be touching. The solution in that region is obtained using conformal mapping techniques, with the constant $I$ given as an explicit integral, evaluated numerically to be 2.27.},
