We tried to make a revision for fixing the gap. However, with the help of mathematical software Lingo, we found that our lemma has counterexamples and its conclusion is incorrect. The Bollobás--Scott conjecture Spink and Tiba [3], “Every $r$-uniform hypergraph with $m$ edges has a vertex partition into $k$ sets with at most $m/k^r+o(m)$ edges in each set,” remains open for $r\ge4$ and seems difficult. The following result shows that Lemma 4 in [2] is wrong even in the case $k=2$.},

This paper studies the maximum possible number of cliques in a graph on $n$ vertices with a forbidden clique subdivision or immersion. We prove for $t$ sufficiently large that every graph on $n \geq t$ vertices with no $K_t$-immersion has at most $n2^{t+\log_2^2 t}$ cliques, which is sharp apart from the $2^{O(\log^2 t)}$ factor. We also prove that the maximum number of cliques in an $n$-vertex graph with no $K_t$-subdivision is at most $2^{1.817t }n$ for sufficiently large $t$. This improves on the best known exponential constant by Lee and Oum. We conjecture that the optimal bound is $3^{2t/3 +o(t)}n$, as we proved for minors in place of subdivision in earlier work.},

This produces the distribution with the least uncertainty in $X$, in the $l_2$ sense, given the support and the mean. We show that, for general norms, the support of the solution must be small in the sense that it does not contain any points from $\Omega$ in the interior of its convex hull. We then show that, under an appropriate choice of norm on the covariance, the solution is given by evaluating the tent functions associated with a Delaunay triangulation of the support at the mean. Moreover, when the Delaunay triangulation is not unique the space of solutions is the space of convex combinations of solutions associated with each possible triangulation. Solutions to special cases are presented, along with a special solution on the lattice which simultaneously minimizes three natural choices of norm.},

Geom., 53 (2015), pp. 245--260] proposed a sufficient combinatorial condition for a parallelohedron to be affinely Voronoi. We show that this condition holds for all 5-dimensional Voronoi parallelohedra. Consequently, the Voronoi conjecture in $\mathbb{R}^5$ holds if and only if every 5-dimensional parallelohedron is combinatorially Voronoi. Here, by saying that a parallelohedron $P$ is combinatorially Voronoi, we mean that $P$ is combinatorially equivalent to a Dirichlet--Voronoi polytope for some lattice $\Lambda$, and this combinatorial equivalence is naturally translated into equivalence of the tiling by copies of $P$ with the Voronoi tiling of $\Lambda$. We also propose a new condition which, if satisfied by a parallelohedron $P$, is sufficient to infer that $P$ is affinely Voronoi. The condition is based on the new notion of the Venkov complex associated with a parallelohedron and cohomologies of this complex.},

Additionally, we show that the two most frequently invoked subdivision algorithms in computer graphics, the Catmull--Clark and Doo--Sabin algorithms, correspond nicely to topological surgery operations on the induced weavings. The inherently topological formulation of our model permits a graphic designer to superimpose strand colors and geometric attributes---distances, angles, and curvatures---that conform to manufacturing or artistic criteria.},

Finding such constructions for a given graph or family of graphs is a challenging task. In this paper, we show that for a large class of Hajós merges and for any identification of a pair of vertices having distance at least five from each other, the resulting graph has an $S^1$-wedge summand in its neighborhood complex. Our results imply that for a bridgeless graph $G$ with a highly connected neighborhood complex, the final step in a Hajós construction must be a vertex identification with vertices at short distance from each other. We investigate this restriction in detail. We also introduce two graph construction algorithms using Hajós-type operations. We discuss the results of computational experiments in which we investigate the rank of the first homology group of the neighborhood complexes of graphs generated using these algorithms.},

Inference, 14 (1986), pp. 123--142] only in the regime where $|n - \ell m /2| = O(\sqrt{\ell m (\ell + m)})$ using a local central limit theorem. Our approach is to solve a related large deviation problem: we describe the tilted measure that produces configurations whose bounding rectangle has the given aspect ratio and is filled to the given proportion. Our results are sufficiently sharp to yield the first asymptotic estimates on the consecutive differences of these numbers when $n$ is increased by one and $m, \ell$ remain the same, hence significantly refining Sylvester&#39;s unimodality theorem and giving effective asymptotic estimates for related Kronecker and plethysm coefficients from representation theory.},

The anti-Ramsey number of $t$ edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees, denoted by $r(n,t)$, is defined as the maximum number of colors in an edge-coloring of $K_n$ containing no $t$ edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees. Jahanbekam and West [J. Graph Theory, 82 (2016), pp. 75--89] conjectured that for any fixed $t$, $r(n,t)=(\begin{smallmatrix}{n-2}{2}\end{smallmatrix})+t$ whenever $n\geq 2t+2 \geq 6$.

It is called $t$-union-free if for any two distinct subsets $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}$, each consisting of at most $t$ edges, it holds that $\cup_{A\in \mathcal{A}} A\neq \cup_{B\in \mathcal{B}} B$. Let $C_t(n,r)$ (resp., $U_t(n,r)$) denote the maximum number of edges of a $t$-cancellative (resp., $t$-union-free) $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices. Among other results, we show that for fixed $r\ge 3,t\ge 3$ and $n\rightarrow\infty$, $\Omega(n^{\lfloor\frac{2r}{t+2}\rfloor+\frac{2r\pmod{t+2}}{t+1}})=C_t(n,r)=O(n^{\lceil\frac{r}{\lfloor t/2\rfloor+1}\rceil})\text{ and } \Omega(n^{\frac{r}{t-1}})=U_t(n,r)=O(n^{\lceil\frac{r}{t-1}\rceil}),$ thereby significantly narrowing the gap between the previously known lower and upper bounds. In particular, we determine the Turán exponent of $C_t(n,r)$ when $2\mid t \text{ and } (t/2+1)\mid r$, and of $U_t(n,r)$ when $(t-1)\mid r$. The main tool used in proving the two lower bounds is a novel connection between these problems and sparse hypergraphs.},

An interval sequence is comprised of $n$ integer intervals $[a_i,b_i]$ such that $0\le a_i\leq b_i \le n-1$ and is said to be graphic/realizable if there exists a graph with degree sequence, say, $D=(d_1,\ldots,d_n),$ satisfying the condition $a_i\leq d_i\leq b_i$ for each $i\in[1,n]$. There is a characterization (also implying an $O(n)$ verifying algorithm) known for realizability of interval sequences, which is a generalization of the Erdös--Gallai characterization for graphic sequences. However, given any realizable interval sequence, there is no known algorithm for computing a corresponding graphic certificate in $o(n^2)$ time. In this paper, we provide an $O(n \log n)$ time algorithm for computing a graphic sequence for any realizable interval sequence. In addition, when the interval sequence is nonrealizable, we show how to find a graphic sequence having minimum deviation with respect to the given interval sequence in the same time. Finally, we consider variants of the problem, such as computing the most-regular graphic sequence and computing a minimum extension of a length $p$ nongraphic sequence to a graphic one.},

In $n$-fold ILPs nonzero entries only appear in the first $r$ rows of the matrix $\mathcal A$ and in small blocks of size $s\times t$ along the diagonal underneath. Despite this restriction, many optimization problems can be expressed in this form. It is known that $n$-fold ILPs are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) regarding the parameters $s, r,$ and $\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the greatest absolute value of any entry in $\mathcal A$. The state-of-the-art technique is a local search algorithm that subsequently moves in an improving direction where the number of iterations and the search for such an improving direction each take time $\Omega(n)$. This leads to a running time quadratic in $n$. We introduce a technique based on color coding which allows us to compute these improving directions in logarithmic time after a single initialization step. This yields an algorithm for $n$-fold ILPs with a running time that is near-linear in $nt$, the number of variables. More precisely, our algorithm runs in time $(rs\Delta)^{\mathcal{O}(r^2s + s^2)} L^2 nt \log^{\mathcal{O}(1)}(nt)$, where $L$ is the encoding length of the largest integer in the input. Further, in contrast to the algorithms in recent literature, we do not need to solve the LP relaxation in order to handle unbounded variables. Instead we give a structural lemma to introduce appropriate bounds. On the other hand, if we are given such an LP solution, the running time can be decreased by a factor of $L$.},

Our result also holds, and is even tight, when instead of disks we consider their topological generalization, namely, pseudo-disks, with a nonempty intersection. Our solution uses the equivalence that a hypergraph can be realized by stabbed pseudo-disks if and only if it is ABAB-free.

In this paper, we consider the analogous question under Hamming distance, which is the most important metric in coding theory. When $q\geqslant 4$ is a fixed prime power and $n$ goes to infinity, our main result shows that, for arbitrary positive proportion $\alpha,$ we can find $\alpha n$ distinct Hamming distances in $\Delta(I)$ if $|I|&gt;q^{(1-\beta)\cdot n},$ where $\beta$ is a positive number depending on $\alpha.$ Unlike using Fourier analytical method as usual, our main tools include the celebrated dependent random choice and some results from additive number theory and coding theory.

In this paper, we study whether some basic properties in Tutte&#39;s flow theory remain valid for this family of signed graphs. Specifically let $(G,\sigma)$ be a flow-admissible signed graph without long barbells. We show that it admits a nowhere-zero 6-flow and that it admits a nowhere-zero modulo $k$-flow if and only if it admits a nowhere-zero integer $k$-flow for each integer $k\geq 3$ and $k \not = 4$. We also show that each nowhere-zero positive integer $k$-flow of $(G,\sigma)$ can be expressed as the sum of some 2-flows. For general graphs, we show that every nowhere-zero $\frac{p}{q}$-flow can be normalized in such a way, that each flow value is a multiple of $\frac{1}{2q}$. As a consequence we prove the equality of the integer flow number and the ceiling of the circular flow number for flow-admissible signed graphs without long barbells.},

Our main result is an approximate version of the conjecture for bounded degree trees and large dense host graphs. We also show that our conjecture is asymptotically best possible. The proof of the approximate result relies on a second result, which we believe to be interesting on its own. Namely, we can embed any bounded degree tree into host graphs of minimum/maximum degree asymptotically exceeding $\frac k2$ and $\frac 43k$, respectively, as long as the host graph avoids a specific structure.},

  abstract     = {We introduce reroutable flows, a robust version of network flows in which link failures can be mitigated by rerouting the affected flow. An important new feature of this model, distinguishing it from existing robust network flow models, is that no flow can get lost in the network. Our goal is to compute maximum flows under this robustness requirement. We investigate different variants depending on the number of failing links, the capacities available for rerouting, and integrality requirements. While the most general versions of the model turn out to be $NP$-hard, we devise linear programming (LP) formulations and combinatorial algorithms for important special cases and provide approximation algorithms for the harder variants.},

Here, we characterize the resolvability of Hamming graphs in terms of a constrained linear system and deduce a novel but straightforward characterization of resolvability for hypercubes. We propose an integer linear programming method to assess resolvability rapidly and provide a more costly but definite method based on Gröbner bases to determine whether or not a set of vertices resolves an arbitrary Hamming graph. As proof of concept, we identify a resolving set of size 77 in the metric space of all octapeptides (i.e., proteins composed of eight amino acids) with respect to the Hamming distance; in particular, any octamer may be readily represented as a 77-dimensional real vector. Representing $k$-mers as low-dimensional numerical vectors may enable new applications of machine learning algorithms to symbolic sequences.},

  abstract     = {One of the central topics in the theory of random graphs deals with the phase transition in the order of the largest components. In the binomial random graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$, the threshold for the appearance of the unique largest component (also known as the giant component) is $p_g = n^{-1}$. More precisely, when $p$ changes from $(1-\varepsilon)p_g$ (subcritical case) to $p_g$ and then to $(1+\varepsilon)p_g$ (supercritical case) for $\varepsilon&gt;0$, with high probability the order of the largest component increases smoothly from $O(\varepsilon^{-2}\log(\varepsilon^3 n))$ to $\Theta(n^{2/3})$ and then to $(1 \pm o(1)) 2 \varepsilon n$. Furthermore, in the supercritical case, with high probability the largest components except the giant component are trees of order $O(\varepsilon^{-2}\log(\varepsilon^3 n))$, exhibiting a structural symmetry between the subcritical random graph and the graph obtained from the supercritical random graph by deleting its giant component. As a natural generalization of random graphs and connectedness, we consider the binomial random $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}^k(n,p)$ (where each $k$-tuple of vertices is present as a hyperedge with probability $p$ independently) and the following notion of high-order connectedness. Given an integer $1 \leq j \leq k-1$, two sets of $j$ vertices are called $j$-connected if there is a walk of hyperedges between them such that any two consecutive hyperedges intersect in at least $j$ vertices. A $j$-connected component is a maximal collection of pairwise $j$-connected $j$-tuples of vertices. Recently, the threshold for the appearance of the giant $j$-connected component in $\mathcal{H}^k(n,p)$ and its order were determined. In this article, we take a closer look at the subcritical random hypergraph. We determine the structure, order, and size of the largest $j$-connected components, with the help of a certain class of “hypertrees” and related objects. In our proofs, we combine various probabilistic and enumerative techniques, such as generating functions and couplings with branching processes. Our study will pave the way to establishing a symmetry between the subcritical random hypergraph and the hypergraph obtained from the supercritical random hypergraph by deleting its giant $j$-connected component.},

We present in this paper positive answers for the above two open problems by establishing a stronger result which states that, for every integer $k\ge 2$, every minor-$k$-colorable graph is open-neighborhood conflict-free $k$-colorable, where a graph $G$ is said to be minor-$k$-colorable if every minor of $G$ is $k$-colorable.},

Given a graph $H$ and an integer $k\geqslant 2$, let $f_{k}(n,H)$ be the smallest number of colors $c$ such that there exists a proper edge coloring of the complete graph $K_{n}$ with $c$ colors containing no $k$ vertex-disjoint color-isomorphic copies of $H$. Using algebraic properties of polynomials over finite fields, we give an explicit proper edge coloring of $K_{n}$ and show that $f_{k}(n, C_{4})=\Theta(n)$ when $k\geqslant 3$ and $n\rightarrow\infty$. The methods we used in the edge coloring may be of some independent interest. We also consider a related generalized Ramsey problem. For given graphs $G$ and $H,$ let $r(G,H,q)$ be the minimum number of edge colors (not necessarily proper) of $G$, such that the edges of every copy of $H\subseteq G$ together receive at least $q$ distinct colors. Establishing the relation to the Turán number of specified bipartite graphs, we obtain some general lower bounds for $r(K_{n,n},K_{s,t},q)$ with a broad range of $q$.},

Famous formulas exist in the literature for the braid index of a rational link by Murasugi and for its HOMFLY polynomial by Lickorish and Millett, but these rely on a special continued fraction expansion of the rational number in which all partial denominators are even (called the all-even form). In this paper we present an algorithmic way to transform a continued fraction given in nonalternating form into the all-even form.

In this paper, we determine the maximum product of the edge multiplicities in $(n,s,q)$-graphs if the congruence class of $q$ modulo ${s\choose 2}$ is in a certain interval of length about $3s/2$. The smallest case that falls outside this range is $(s,q)=(4,15)$, and here the answer is $a^{n^2+o(n^2)}$, where $a$ is transcendental assuming Schanuel&#39;s conjecture. This could indicate the difficulty of solving the problem in full generality. Many of our results can be seen as extending work by Bondy and Tuza [J.

This reduces the problem of determining when a given subgroup of an abelian group is a perfect code to the case of abelian 2-groups.

Discov., 33 (2019), pp. 252--291], suffered from many unproven or false assumptions in the literature. We prove this problem to be NP-hard and additionally show that a recent dynamic programming algorithm is essentially optimal. In this context, we study a broad family of circular string alignment problems. This family also serves as a key for our hardness reductions, and it is of independent (practical) interest in molecular biology. In particular, we show tight hardness and running time lower bounds for Circular Consensus String; notably, the corresponding noncircular version is easily linear-time solvable.},

We prove enumerative results related to statistics and patterns on $k$-arrangements, confirming several conjectures by Blitvić and Steingrímsson. In particular, one of their conjectures regarding the equidistribution of the number of descents over the derangement form and the permutation form of $k$-arrangements is strengthened in two interesting ways. Moreover, as one application of the so-called decrease value theorem, we calculate the generating function for a symmetric pair of Eulerian statistics over permutations arising in our study.

  abstract     = {In many proofs concerning extremal parameters of Berge hypergraphs one starts with analyzing that part of that shadow graph which is contained in many hyperedges. Capturing this phenomenon we introduce two new types of hypergraphs. A hypergraph ${\mathcal H}$ is a $t$-heavy copy of a graph $F$ if there is a copy of $F$ on its vertex set such that each edge of $F$ is contained in at least $t$ hyperedges of ${\mathcal H}$. ${\mathcal H}$ is a $t$-wise Berge copy of $F$ if additionally for distinct edges of $F$ those $t$ hyperedges are distinct. We extend known upper bounds on the Turán number of Berge hypergraphs to the $t$-wise Berge hypergraphs case. We asymptotically determine the Turán number of $t$-heavy and $t$-wise Berge copies of long paths and cycles and exactly determine the Turán number of $t$-heavy and $t$-wise Berge copies of cliques. In the case of 3-uniform hypergraphs, we consider the problem in more details and obtain additional results.},

  abstract     = {This paper initiates the study of the classic balanced graph partitioning problem from an online perspective: Given an arbitrary sequence of pairwise communication requests between $n$ nodes, with patterns that may change over time, the objective is to service these requests efficiently by partitioning the nodes into $L$ clusters, each of size $k$, such that frequently communicating nodes are located in the same cluster. The partitioning can be updated dynamically by migrating nodes between clusters. The goal is to devise online algorithms which jointly minimize the amount of intercluster communication and migration cost. The problem features interesting connections to other well-known online problems. For example, scenarios with $L = 2$ generalize online paging, and scenarios with $k = 2$ constitute a novel online variant of maximum matching. We present several lower bounds and algorithms for settings both with and without cluster-size augmentation. In particular, we prove that any deterministic online algorithm has a competitive ratio of at least $k$, even with significant augmentation. Our main algorithmic contributions are an $O(k \log k)$-competitive deterministic algorithm for the general setting with constant augmentation and a constant competitive algorithm for the maximum matching variant.},

  abstract     = {A well-studied geometric object in combinatorial optimization is the perfect matching polytope of a graph $G$---the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all perfect matchings of $G$. In any investigation concerning the perfect matching polytope, one may assume that $G$ is matching covered---that is, $G$ is a connected graph (of order at least two) and each edge of $G$ lies in some perfect matching. A graph $G$ is Birkhoff--von Neumann if its perfect matching polytope is characterized solely by nonnegativity and degree constraints. A result of Balas [North Holland Math. Stud., 59 (1981), pp. 1--13] implies that $G$ is Birkhoff--von Neumann if and only if $G$ does not contain a pair of vertex-disjoint odd cycles $(C_1,C_2)$ such that $G-V(C_1)-V(C_2)$ has a perfect matching. It follows immediately that the corresponding decision problem is in co-$\mathcal{NP}$. However, it is not known to be in $\mathcal{NP}$. The problem is in $\mathcal{P}$ if the input graph is planar---due to a result of Carvalho, Lucchesi, and Murty [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 92 (2004), pp. 319--324]. More recently, these authors, along with Kothari [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 32 (2018), pp. 1478--1504], have shown that this problem is equivalent to the seemingly unrelated problem of deciding whether a given graph is $\overline{C_6}$-free. The combinatorial diameter of a polytope is the diameter of its $1$-skeleton graph. A graph $G$ is PM-compact if the combinatorial diameter of its perfect matching polytope equals one. Independent results of Balinski and Russakoff [SIAM Rev., 16 (1974), pp. 516--525] and of Chvátal [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 18 (1975), pp. 138--154] imply that $G$ is PM-compact if and only if $G$ does not contain a pair of vertex-disjoint even cycles $(C_1,C_2)$ such that $G-V(C_1)-V(C_2)$ has a perfect matching. Once again the corresponding decision problem is in co-$\mathcal{NP}$, but it is not known to be in $\mathcal{NP}$. The problem is in $\mathcal{P}$ if the input graph is bipartite or is near-bipartite---due to a result of Wang et al. [Discrete Math., 313 (2013), pp. 772--783]. In this paper, we consider the “intersection” of the aforementioned problems. We give an alternative description of matching covered graphs that are Birkhoff--von Neumann as well as PM-compact; our description implies that the corresponding decision problem is in $\mathcal{P}$.},

  abstract     = {We unify several seemingly different graph and digraph classes under one umbrella. These classes are all, broadly speaking, different generalizations of interval graphs, and include, in addition to interval graphs, adjusted interval digraphs, complements of threshold tolerance graphs (known as co-TT graphs), bipartite interval containment graphs, bipartite co-circular arc graphs, and two-directional orthogonal ray bigraphs. (The last three classes coincide, but have been investigated in different contexts.) We show that all of the above classes are united by a common ordering characterization, the existence of a min ordering. However, because the presence or absence of reflexive relationships (loops) affects whether a graph or digraph has a min ordering, to obtain this result, we must define the graphs and digraphs to have those loops that are implied by their definitions. These have been largely ignored in previous work. We propose a common generalization of all these graph and digraph classes, namely signed-interval digraphs, characterized by the existence of a compact representation, a signed-interval model, which is a generalization of known representations of the graph classes. We show that the signed-interval digraphs are precisely those digraphs that are characterized by the existence of a min ordering when the loops implied by the model are considered part of the graph. We also offer an alternative geometric characterization of these digraphs. We show that co-TT graphs are the symmetric signed-interval digraphs, the adjusted interval digraphs are the reflexive signed-interval digraphs, and the interval graphs are the intersection of these two classes, namely, the reflexive and symmetric signed-interval digraphs. Similar results hold for bipartite interval containment graphs, bipartite co-circular arc graphs, and two-directional orthogonal ray bigraphs.},

The goal is to schedule as many jobs as possible nonpreemptively by their respective deadlines on $m$ identical parallel machines. For the last decade, the best approximation ratio known for the single-machine case ($m = 1$) has been $1-1/e - \epsilon \approx 0.632$ due to Chuzhoy, Ostrovsky, and Rabani [FOCS 2001] and [MOR 2006]. We break this barrier and give an improved 0.644-approximation. For the multiple-machine case, we give an algorithm whose approximation guarantee becomes arbitrarily close to 1 as the number of machines increases. This improves upon the previous best $1 - 1/ (1 + 1/m)^m$ approximation due to Bar-Noy et al. [STOC 1999] and [SICOMP 2009], which converges to 1-1/e as $m$ goes to infinity. Our result for the multiple-machine case extends to the weighted throughput objective where jobs have different weights, and the goal is to schedule jobs with the maximum total weight. Our results show that the 1 - 1/e approximation factor widely observed in various coverage problems is not tight for the nonpreemptive maximum throughput scheduling problem.},

We are interested in the parameterized complexity of $\mathcal{F}$-M-Deletion when the parameter is the treewidth of $G$, denoted by ${tw}$. Our objective is to determine, for a fixed ${\cal F}$, the smallest function $f_{{\cal F}}$ such that $\mathcal{F}$-M-Deletion can be solved in time $f_{{\cal F}}({tw}) \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ on $n$-vertex graphs. We prove that $f_{{\cal F}}({tw}) = 2^{2^{\mathcal{O} ({tw} \cdot\log {tw})}}$ for every collection ${\cal F}$, that $f_{{\cal F}}({tw}) = 2^{\mathcal{O} ({tw} \cdot\log {tw})}$ if ${\cal F}$ contains a planar graph, and that $f_{{\cal F}}({tw}) = 2^{\mathcal{O} ({tw})}$ if in addition the input graph $G$ is planar or embedded in a surface. We also consider the version of the problem where the graphs in ${\cal F}$ are forbidden as topological minors, called $\mathcal{F}$-TM-Deletion. We prove similar results for this problem, except that in the last two algorithms, instead of requiring $\mathcal{F}$ to contain a planar graph, we need it to contain a subcubic planar graph.

  abstract     = {A classic theorem of Erdös and Pósa [Canad. J. Math., 17 (1965), pp. 347--352] states that every graph has either $k$ vertex-disjoint cycles or a set of $O(k \log k)$ vertices meeting all its cycles. While the standard proof revolves around finding a large “frame” in the graph (a subdivision of a large cubic graph), an alternative way of proving this theorem is to use a ball packing argument of Kühn and Osthus [Random Structures Algorithms, 22 (2003), pp. 213--225] and Diestel and Rempel [Combinatorica, 25 (2005), pp. 111--116]. In this paper, we argue that the latter approach is particularly well suited for studying edge variants of the Erdös--Pósa theorem. As an illustration, we give a short proof of a theorem of Bruhn, Heinlein, and Joos [Combinatorica, 39 (2019), pp. 1--36] that cycles of length at least $\ell$ have the so-called edge-Erdös--Pósa property. More precisely, we show that every graph $G$ contains either $k$ edge-disjoint cycles of length at least $\ell$ or an edge set $F$ of size $O(k\ell \cdot \log (k\ell))$ such that $G-F$ has no cycle of length at least $\ell$. For fixed $\ell$, this improves on the previously best known bound of $O(k^2 \log k +k\ell)$.},

  abstract     = {An undirected graph $G$ is $d$-degenerate if every subgraph of $G$ has a vertex of degree at most $d$. By the classical theorem of Erdös and Gallai from 1959, every graph of degeneracy $d&gt;1$ contains a cycle of length at least $d+1$. The proof of Erdös and Gallai is constructive and can be turned into a polynomial time algorithm constructing a cycle of length at least $d+1$. But can we decide in polynomial time whether a graph contains a cycle of length at least $d+2$? An easy reduction from Hamiltonian Cycle provides a negative answer to this question: Deciding whether a graph has a cycle of length at least $d+2$ is NP-complete. Surprisingly, the complexity of the problem changes drastically when the input graph is 2-connected. In this case we prove that deciding whether $G$ contains a cycle of length at least $d+k$ can be done in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}\cdot|V(G)|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. In other words, deciding whether a 2-connected $n$-vertex $G$ contains a cycle of length at least $d+\log{n}$ can be done in polynomial time. Similar algorithmic results hold for long paths in graphs. We observe that deciding whether a graph has a path of length at least $d+1$ is NP-complete. However, we prove that if graph $G$ is connected, then deciding whether $G$ contains a path of length at least $d+k$ can be done in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. We complement these results by showing that the choice of degeneracy as the “above guarantee parameterization” is optimal in the following sense: For any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ it is NP-complete to decide whether a connected (2-connected) graph of degeneracy $d$ has a path (cycle) of length at least $(1+\varepsilon)d$.},

  abstract     = {We revisit the complexity of the classical $k$-Coloring problem parameterized by clique-width. This is a very well-studied problem that becomes highly intractable when the number of colors $k$ is large. However, much less is known on its complexity for small, concrete values of $k$. In this paper, we completely determine, under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), for any fixed constant $k$, the complexity of $k$-Coloring parameterized by clique-width. Specifically, we show that for all $k\ge 3,\epsilon&gt;0$, $k$-Coloring cannot be solved in time $O^*\left((2^k-2-\epsilon)^{{cw}}\right)$, and give an algorithm running in time $O^*\left((2^k-2)^{{cw}}\right)$. Thus, if the SETH is true, $2^k-2$ is the “correct” base of the exponent for every fixed $k$. Along the way, we also consider the complexity of $k$-Coloring parameterized by the related parameter modular treewidth (${mtw}$). In this case we show that the “correct” running time under the SETH is $O^*\big({k\choose \lfloor k/2\rfloor}^{{mtw}}\big)$. If we base our results on a weaker assumption (the ETH), they imply that $k$-Coloring cannot be solved in time $n^{o({cw})}$, even on instances with $O(\log n)$ colors.},

Previous work has shown that an envy-free allocation is likely to exist when $m=\Omega(n\log n)$ but not when $m=n+o(n)$, and left open the question of determining where the phase transition from non-existence to existence occurs. We show that, surprisingly, there is in fact no universal point of transition---instead, the transition is governed by the divisibility relation between $m$ and $n$. On the one hand, if $m$ is divisible by $n$, an envy-free allocation exists with high probability as long as $m\geq 2n$. On the other hand, if $m$ is not “almost” divisible by $n$, an envy-free allocation is unlikely to exist even when $m=\Theta(n\log n/\log\log n)$.},

Brown, Erdös, and Sós showed that the maximum number of edges of such a hypergraph on $n$ vertices, denoted as $f_r(n,v,e)$, satisfies $\Omega(n^{\frac{er-v}{e-1}})=f_r(n,v,e)=O(n^{\lceil\frac{er-v}{e-1}\rceil})$. For sufficiently large $n$ and $e-1\mid er-v$, the lower bound matches the upper bound up to a constant factor, which depends only on $r,v,e$; whereas for $e-1\nmid er-v$, in general it is a notoriously hard problem to determine the correct exponent of $n$. Among other results, we improve the above lower bound by showing that $f_r(n,v,e)=\Omega(n^{\frac{er-v}{e-1}}(\log n)^{\frac{1}{e-1}})$ for any $r,e,v$ satisfying $\gcd(e-1,er-v)=1$. The hypergraph we constructed is in fact $\mathscr{G}_r(ir-\lceil\frac{(i-1)(er-v)}{e-1}\rceil,i)$-free for every $2\le i\le e$, and it has several interesting applications in coding theory. The proof of the new lower bound is based on a novel application of the lower bound on the hypergraph independence number due to Duke, Lefmann, and Rödl.},

  abstract     = {Bootstrap percolation is a class of cellular automata with random initial state. Two-dimensional bootstrap percolation models have three rough universality classes, the most studied being the “critical” one. For this class the scaling of the quantity of greatest interest (the critical probability) was determined by Bollobás, Duminil-Copin, Morris, and Smith in terms of a simply defined combinatorial quantity called “difficulty,” so the subject seemed closed up to finding sharper results. However, the computation of the difficulty was never considered. In this paper we provide the first algorithm to determine this quantity, which is, surprisingly, not as easy as the definition leads to thinking. The proof also provides some explicit upper bounds, which are of use for bootstrap percolation. On the other hand, we also prove the negative result that computing the difficulty of a critical model is NP-hard. This two-dimensional picture contrasts with an upcoming result of Balister, Bollobás, Morris, and Smith on uncomputability in higher dimensions. The proof of NP-hardness is achieved by a technical reduction to the Set Cover problem.},

  abstract     = {The online Dial-a-Ride problem is a fundamental online problem in a metric space, where transportation requests appear over time and may be served in any order by a single server with unit speed. Restricted to the real line, online Dial-a-Ride captures natural problems like controlling a personal elevator. Tight results in terms of competitive ratios are known for the general setting and for online TSP on the line (where the source and target of each request coincide). In contrast, online Dial-a-Ride on the line has resisted tight analysis so far, even though it is a very natural online problem. We conduct a tight competitive analysis of the Smartstart algorithm that gave the best known results for the general, metric case. In particular, our analysis yields a new upper bound of 2.94 for open, nonpreemptive online Dial-a-Ride on the line, which improves the previous bound of 3.41 [S. O. Krumke, “Online Optimization Competitive Analysis and Beyond,” Habilitation thesis, Technische Universität Berlin, 2001]. The best known lower bound remains 2.04 [A.

In an earlier work, Lokshtanov and Ramanujan showed that both odd multiway node cut and odd multiway edge cut are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the size of the solution in undirected graphs. In this work, we focus on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and design a fixed-parameter algorithm. Our main contribution is a broadening of the shadow-removal framework to address parity problems in DAGs. We complement our FPT results with tight approximability as well as polyhedral results for two terminals in DAGs. Additionally, we show inapproximability results for odd multiway edge cut in undirected graphs even for two terminals.},

We completely solve this problem when $H$ is a clique, as well as more generally when $H$ is any regular graph with degree at least about half its number of vertices. We also characterize the extremal graphs when $H$ is an Erdös--Rényi random graph. The extremal structures turn out to have the similar form as the conjectured extremal structures for a well-studied but elusive problem of similar flavor with local constraints: to maximize the number of copies of a fixed clique in graphs in which all degrees have a fixed upper bound.},

  abstract     = {Karger used spanning tree packings [D. R. Karger, J. ACM, 47 (2000), pp. 46--76] to derive a near linear-time randomized algorithm for the global minimum cut problem as well as a bound on the number of approximate minimum cuts. This is a different approach from his well-known random contraction algorithm [D. R. Karger, Random Sampling in Graph Optimization Problems, Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 1995, D. R. Karger and C. Stein, J. ACM, 43 (1996), pp. 601--640]. Thorup developed a fast deterministic algorithm for the minimum $k$-cut problem via greedy recursive tree packings [M. Thorup, Minimum $k$-way cuts via deterministic greedy tree packing, in Proceedings of the Fortieth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, 2008, pp. 159--166]. In this paper we revisit properties of an LP relaxation for cͅut proposed by Naor and Rabani [Tree packing and approximating $k$-cuts, in Proceedings of the Twelfth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, Vol. 103, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2001, pp. 26--27], and analyzed in [C. Chekuri, S. Guha, and J. Naor, SIAM J. Discrete Math., 20 (2006), pp. 261--271]. We show that the dual of the LP yields a tree packing that, when combined with an upper bound on the integrality gap for the LP, easily and transparently extends Karger&#39;s analysis for mincut to the $k$-cut problem. In addition to the simplicity of the algorithm and its analysis, this allows us to improve the running time of Thorup&#39;s algorithm by a factor of $n$. We also improve the bound on the number of $\alpha$-approximate $k$-cuts. Second, we give a simple proof that the integrality gap of the LP is $2(1-1/n)$. Third, we show that an optimum solution to the LP relaxation, for all values of $k$, is fully determined by the principal sequence of partitions of the input graph. This allows us to relate the LP relaxation to the Lagrangean relaxation approach of Barahona [Oper. Res. Lett., 26 (2000), pp. 99--105] and Ravi and Sinha [European J. Oper. Res., 186 (2008), pp. 77--90]; it also shows that the idealized recursive tree packing considered by Thorup gives an optimum dual solution to the LP.},

  abstract     = {A graph $G$ is contractible to a graph $H$ if there is a set $X \subseteq E(G)$, such that $G/X$ is isomorphic to $H$. Here, $G/X$ is the graph obtained from $G$ by contracting all the edges in $X$. For a family of graphs $\cal F$, the $\mathcal{F}$-Contraction problem takes as input a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, and the objective is to output the largest integer $t$, such that $G$ is contractible to a graph $H \in {\cal F}$, where $|V(H)|=t$. When $\cal F$ is the family of paths, then the corresponding $\mathcal{F}$-Contraction problem is called Path Contraction. The problem Path Contraction admits a simple algorithm running in time $2^{n}\cdot n^{{\mathcal{O}}(1)}$. In spite of the deceptive simplicity of the problem, beating the $2^{n}\cdot n^{{\mathcal{O}}(1)}$ bound for Path Contraction seems quite challenging. In this paper, we design an exact exponential time algorithm for Path Contraction that runs in time ${{1.99987}^n}\cdot n^{{\mathcal O}(1)}$. We also define a problem called 3-Disjoint Connected Subgraphs and design an algorithm for it that runs in time $1.88^n\cdot n^{{\mathcal O}(1)}$. The above algorithm is used as a subroutine in our algorithm for Path Contraction.},

In this paper, we follow this route to examine the levelness property of order polytopes, a property generalizing Gorensteinness. This property has been recently characterized by Miyazaki [J. Algebra, 480 (2017), pp. 215--236] for the case of order polytopes. We provide an alternative characterization using weighted digraphs. Using this characterization, we give a new infinite family of level posets and show that determining levelness is in $\operatorname{co-NP}$. Moreover, we show how a necessary condition of levelness of [J. Algebra, 431 (2015), pp. 138--161] can be restated in terms of digraphs. We then turn to the more general family of alcoved polytopes. We give a characterization for levelness of alcoved polytopes using the Minkowski sum. Then we study several cases when the product of two polytopes is level. In particular, we provide an example where the product of two level polytopes is not level.},

We do so by refining the approach of Barvinok, which is based on his clever observation that a certain restriction on a set $S$ involving angles implies zero-freeness; we call sets satisfying this requirement angle-restricted. This allows us to reduce the question to a low-dimensional geometry problem (notably, independent of the size of the matrix!), which can then be solved more or less explicitly.

We study the boundedness of clique-width of hereditary graph classes closed under complementation. First, we extend the known classification for the $|{\cal H}|=1$ case by classifying the boundedness of clique-width for every set ${\cal H}$ of self-complementary graphs. We then completely settle the $|{\cal H}|=2$ case. In particular, we determine one new class of $(H,\overline{H})$-free graphs of bounded clique-width (as a side effect, this leaves only five classes of $(H_1,H_2)$-free graphs, for which it is not known whether their clique-width is bounded). Once we have obtained the classification of the $|{\cal H}|=2$ case, we research the effect of forbidding self-complementary graphs on the boundedness of clique-width. Surprisingly, we show that for every set ${\cal F}$ of self-complementary graphs on at least five vertices, the classification of the boundedness of clique-width for $({H,\overline{H}}\cup {\cal F})$-free graphs coincides with the one for the $|{\cal H}|=2$ case if and only if ${\cal F}$ does not include the bull.},

  abstract     = {In Defective Coloring we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and two integers ${\chi_d},\Delta^*$ and are asked if we can partition $V$ into ${\chi_d}$ color classes, so that each class induces a graph of maximum degree $\Delta^*$. We investigate the complexity of this generalization of Coloring with respect to several well-studied graph parameters and show that the problem is W-hard parameterized by treewidth, pathwidth, tree-depth, or feedback vertex set if ${\chi_d}=2$. As expected, this hardness can be extended to larger values of ${\chi_d}$ for most of these parameters, with one surprising exception: we show that the problem is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) and parameterized by feedback vertex set for any ${\chi_d}\neq 2$, and hence 2-coloring is the only hard case for this parameter. In addition to the above, we give an exponential time hypothesis-based lower bound for treewidth and pathwidth, showing that no algorithm can solve the problem in $n^{o({{pw}})}$, essentially matching the complexity of an algorithm obtained with standard techniques. We complement these results by considering the problem&#39;s approximability and show that, with respect to $\Delta^*$, the problem admits an algorithm which for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ runs in time $({{tw}}/\epsilon)^{O({{tw}})}$ and returns a solution with exactly the desired number of colors that approximates the optimal $\Delta^*$ within $(1+\epsilon)$. We also give a $({{tw}})^{O({{tw}})}$ algorithm which achieves the desired $\Delta^*$ exactly while 2-approximating the minimum value of ${\chi_d}$. We show that this is close to optimal, by establishing that no FPT algorithm can (under standard assumptions) achieve a better than 3/2-approximation to ${\chi_d}$, even when an extra constant additive error is also allowed.},

In this note we show that for $\delta &gt;0$ fixed, and $p \rightarrow 0$ such that $n^{\frac{1}{2}} p \rightarrow \infty$, the upper tail probability for the largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ is $\exp[-(1+o(1)) \min{\tfrac{(1+\delta)^2}{2}, \delta(1+\delta) } n^{2}p^{2}\log (1/p)].$ In the same regime of $p$, we show that the second largest eigenvalue $\lambda_2(\mathcal{G}_{n,p})$ of the adjacency matrix of $\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ satisfies $\mathbb{P}(\lambda_2(\mathcal{G}_{n,p})\ge \delta np) = \exp[-(1+o(1)) \tfrac{1}{2} \delta^2n^2p^2 \log (1/p)],$ where $\delta =\delta_n &lt; 1$ can depend on $n$ such that $\delta n^{\frac{1}{2}} p \rightarrow \infty$, which covers deviations of $\lambda_2(\mathcal{G}_{n,p})$ between $n^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $np$.

  abstract     = {The goal of fair division is to distribute resources among competing players in a “fair&quot; way. Envy-freeness is the most extensively studied fairness notion in fair division. Envy-free allocations do not always exist with indivisible goods, motivating the study of relaxed versions of envy-freeness. We study the envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) property, which states that no player prefers the bundle of another player following the removal of any single good, and prove the first general results about this property. We use the leximin solution to show existence of EFX allocations in several contexts, sometimes in conjunction with Pareto optimality. For two players with valuations obeying a mild assumption, one of these results provides stronger guarantees than the currently deployed algorithm on Spliddit, a popular fair division website. Unfortunately, finding the leximin solution can require exponential time. We show that this is necessary by proving an exponential lower bound on the number of value queries needed to identify an EFX allocation, even for two players with identical valuations. We consider both additive and more general valuations, and our work suggests that there is a rich landscape of problems to explore in the fair division of indivisible goods with different classes of player valuations.},

We mainly focus on asymptotic properties of the sequence $f_r^v(k,n),$ the number of $n$-array $k$-ary words that contain a given pattern $v$ exactly $r$ times. In addition, we study the asymptotic behavior of the random variable $X_n,$ the number of pattern occurrences in a random $n$-array word. The two topics are closely related through the identity $P(X_n=r) = $ $\frac{1}{k^n}f_r^v(k,n).$ In particular, we show that for any $r\geq 0,$ the Stanley--Wilf sequence $\bigl(f_r^v(k,n)\bigr)^{1/n}$ converges to a limit independent of $r,$ and we determine the value of the limit. We then obtain several limit theorems for the distribution of $X_n,$ including a central limit theorem, large deviation estimates, and the exact growth rate of the entropy of $X_n.$ Furthermore, we introduce a concept of weak avoidance and link it to a certain family of nonproduct measures on words that penalize pattern occurrences but do not forbid them entirely. We analyze this family of probability measures in a small parameter regime, where the distributions can be understood as a perturbation of a uniform measure. Finally, we extend some of our results for words, including the one regarding the equivalence of the limits of the Stanley--Wilf sequences, to pattern occurrences in permutations.},

Extremal examples which show optimality of the bound on $\delta(G)$ are very structured and, in particular, contain large independent sets. In analogy to the Ramsey--Turán theory, Balogh, Molla, and Sharifzadeh initiated the study of how the absence of such large independent sets influences sufficient minimum degree. We show the following two related results: (a) For any $r &gt; \ell \ge 2$, if $G$ is a graph satisfying $\delta(G) \ge \frac{r - \ell}{r - \ell + 1}n + \Omega(n)$ and $\alpha_\ell(G) =o(n)$, that is, a largest $K_\ell$-free induced subgraph has at most $o(n)$ vertices, then $G$ contains a $K_r$-factor. This is optimal for $\ell = r - 1$ and extends a result of Balogh, Molla, and Sharifzadeh who considered the case $r = 3$. (b) If a graph $G$ satisfies $\delta(G) = \Omega(n)$ and $\alpha_r^*(G) =o(n)$, that is, every induced $K_r$-free $r$-partite subgraph of $G$ has at least one vertex class of size $o(n)$, then it contains a $K_r$-factor. A similar statement is proven for a general graph $H$.},

We also present lower bounds concerning the number of monochromatic complete subgraphs within certain ranges of sizes, incomparable in nature to lower bounds previously proved by Conlon [Combinatorica, 32 (2012), pp. 171--186]. If furthermore one assumes that the largest monochromatic complete subgraph in $G$ is of size $(\frac{1}{2} + o(1))\log n$ (it is a well known open question whether such graphs exist), then for every constant $0 \le c \le \frac{1}{2}$ we determine (up to low order terms) the number of monochromatic complete subgraphs of size $c \log n$. We do so by proving a lower bound that matches (up to low order terms) a previous upper bound of Székely. For example, the number of monochromatic complete subgraphs of size $\frac{1}{2} \log n$ is $n^{\frac{1}{8}(4 - \log e \pm o(1))\log n} \simeq n^{0.32 \log n}$.},

This measure was recently introduced in [N. Alon et al., Adv. Neural Inf. Process.

We prove various hardness results for computing $\alpha$ either exactly or approximately. En route to our results, we also consider the maximum connected matching problem: determining the largest matching $N$ in a graph $G$ such that every two edges in $N$ are connected by an edge. We prove a nearly optimal $n^{1-\epsilon}$ hardness of approximation result (under randomized reductions) for connected matching in bipartite graphs (with both sides of cardinality $n$). Toward this end we define bipartite half-covers: a new combinatorial object that may be of independent interest. To our knowledge, the best previous hardness result for the maximum connected matching problem was that it is hard to approximate within some constant $\beta&gt;1$. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of bipartite graphs with $n$ vertices on each side of average degree $d$, achieving $\alpha=1/2-\epsilon$ for matchings of size sufficiently smaller than $n/d$.

  abstract     = {Mömke and Svensson presented a beautiful new approach for the traveling salesman problem on a graph metric (graph-TSP), which yields a 4/3-approximation guarantee on subcubic graphs as well as a substantial improvement over the 3/2-approximation guarantee of Christofides&#39;s algorithm on general graphs. The crux of their approach is to compute an upper bound on the minimum cost of a circulation in a particular network, $C(G,T)$, where $G$ is the input graph and $T$ is a carefully chosen spanning tree. The cost of this circulation is directly related to the number of edges in a tour output by their algorithm. Mucha subsequently improved the analysis of the circulation cost, proving that Mömke and Svensson&#39;s algorithm for graph-TSP has an approximation ratio of at most $13/9$ on general graphs. This analysis of the circulation is local, and vertices with degree four or five can contribute the most to its cost. Thus, hypothetically, there could exist a subquartic graph (a graph with degree at most four at each vertex) for which Mucha&#39;s analysis of the Mömke--Svensson algorithm is tight. We show that this is not the case and that Mömke and Svensson&#39;s algorithm for graph-TSP has an approximation guarantee of at most 25/18 on subquartic graphs.

  abstract     = {What is the chance that among a group of $n$ friends, there are $s$ friends all of whom have the same birthday? This is the celebrated birthday problem which can be formulated as the existence of a monochromatic $s$-clique $K_s$ ($s$-matching birthdays) in the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex of $K_n$ is uniformly colored with 365 colors (corresponding to birthdays). More generally, for a general connected graph $H$, let $T(H, G_n)$ be the number of monochromatic copies of $H$ in a uniformly random coloring of the vertices of the graph $G_n$ with $c_n$ colors. In this paper we show that $T(H, G_n)$ converges to ${Pois}(\lambda)$ whenever $\mathbb{E} T(H, G_n) \rightarrow \lambda$ and ${Var} T(H, G_n) \rightarrow \lambda$, that is, the asymptotic Poisson distribution of $T(H, G_n)$ is determined just by the convergence of its mean and variance. Moreover, this condition is necessary if and only if $H$ is a star-graph. In fact, the second-moment phenomenon is a consequence of a more general theorem about the convergence of $T(H,G_n)$ to a finite linear combination of independent Poisson random variables. As an application, we derive the limiting distribution of $T(H, G_n)$, when $G_n\sim G(n, p)$ is the Erdös--Rényi random graph. Multiple phase transitions emerge as $p$ varies from 0 to 1, depending on whether the graph $H$ is balanced or unbalanced.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of sampling from the Potts model on random regular graphs. It is conjectured that sampling is possible when the temperature of the model is in the so-called uniqueness regime of the regular tree, but positive algorithmic results have been for the most part elusive. In this paper, for all integers $q\geq 3$ and $\Delta\geq 3$, we develop algorithms that produce samples within error $o(1)$ from the $q$-state Potts model on random $\Delta$-regular graphs, whenever the temperature is in uniqueness, for both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. The algorithm for the antiferromagnetic Potts model is based on iteratively adding the edges of the graph and resampling a bichromatic class that contains the endpoints of the newly added edge. Key to the algorithm is how to perform the resampling step efficiently since bichromatic classes can potentially induce linear-sized components. To this end, we exploit the tree uniqueness to show that the average growth of bichromatic components is typically small, which allows us to use correlation decay algorithms for the resampling step. While the precise uniqueness threshold on the tree is not known for general values of $q$ and $\Delta$ in the antiferromagnetic case, our algorithm works throughout uniqueness regardless of its value. In the case of the ferromagnetic Potts model, we are able to simplify the algorithm significantly by utilizing the random-cluster representation of the model. In particular, we demonstrate that a percolation-type algorithm succeeds in sampling from the random-cluster model with parameters $p,q$ on random $\Delta$-regular graphs for all values of $q\geq 1$ and $p&lt;p_c(q,\Delta)$, where $p_c(q,\Delta)$ corresponds to a uniqueness threshold for the model on the $\Delta$-regular tree. When restricted to integer values of $q$, this yields a simplified algorithm for the ferromagnetic Potts model on random $\Delta$-regular graphs.},

  abstract     = {The broadcast congested clique model (BClique) is a message-passing model of distributed computation where $n$ nodes communicate with each other in synchronous rounds. First, in this paper we prove that there is a one-round, deterministic algorithm that reconstructs the input graph $G$ if the graph is $d$-degenerate, and rejects otherwise, using bandwidth $b=\mathcal{O}(d \cdot \log n)$. Then, we introduce a new parameter to the model. We study the situation where the nodes, initially, instead of knowing their immediate neighbors, know their neighborhood up to a fixed radius $r$. In this new framework, denoted ${{\sc BClique}}[r]$, we study the problem of detecting, in $G$, an induced cycle of length at most $k$ (${\sc Cycle}_{\leq k}$) and the problem of detecting an induced cycle of length at least $k+1$ (${\sc Cycle}_{&gt;k}$). We give upper and lower bounds. We show that if each node is allowed to see up to distance $r={\lfloor k/2 \rfloor + 1}$, then a polylogarithmic bandwidth is sufficient for solving ${\sc Cycle}_{&gt;k}$ with only two rounds. Nevertheless, if nodes were allowed to see up to distance $r=\lfloor k/3 \rfloor$, then any one-round algorithm that solves ${\sc Cycle}_{&gt;k}$ needs the bandwidth $b$ to be at least $\Omega(n/\log n)$. We also show the existence of a one-round, deterministic ${{\sc BClique}}$ algorithm that solves ${\sc Cycle}_{\leq k}$ with bandwitdh $b=\mathcal{O}(n^{1/\lfloor{k/2}\rfloor} \cdot \log n)$. On the negative side, we prove that, if $\epsilon \leq 1/3$ and $0 &lt; r \leq k/4 $, then any $\epsilon$-error, $R$-round, $b$-bandwidth algorithm in the ${{\sc BClique}}[r]$ model that solves problem ${\sc Cycle}_{\leq k}$ satisfies $R \cdot b = \Omega(n^{1/\lfloor{k/2}\rfloor})$.},

This so-called $(\Pi_A,\Pi_B)$-Recognition problem generalizes, amongst others, the recognition of 3-colorable, bipartite, split, and monopolar graphs. In this paper, we study whether certain fixed-parameter tractable $(\Pi_A,\Pi_B)$-Recognition problems admit polynomial kernels. In our study, we focus on the first level above triviality, where $\Pi_A$ is the set of $P_3$-free graphs (disjoint unions of cliques, or cluster graphs), the parameter is the number of clusters in the cluster graph $G[A]$, and $\Pi_B$ is characterized by a set $\mathcal{H}$ of connected forbidden induced subgraphs. We prove that, under the assumption that ${NP} \not\subseteq {coNP}/{poly}$, $(\Pi_A,\Pi_B)$-Recognition admits a polynomial kernel if and only if $\mathcal{H}$ contains a graph with at most two vertices. In both the kernelization and the lower bound results, we exploit the properties of a pushing process, which is an algorithmic technique used recently by Heggerness et al. and by Kanj et al. to obtain fixed-parameter algorithms for many cases of $(\Pi_A,\Pi_B)$-Recognition, as well as several other problems.},

The symmetric difference transformation (SD-transformation) of $f$ by a canonical set $S \subseteq V$ is a set function $g$ given by $g(X) = f(X \vartriangle S)$ for $X \subseteq V$, where $X \vartriangle S = (X \setminus S) \cup (S \setminus X)$ denotes the symmetric difference between $X$ and $S$. Submodularity and SD-transformations are regarded as the counterparts of convexity and affine transformations in a discrete space, respectively. However, submodularity is not preserved under SD-transformations, in contrast to the fact that convexity is invariant under affine transformations. This paper presents a characterization of SD-transformations preserving submodularity. Then, we are concerned with the problem of discovering a canonical set $S$, given the SD-transformation $g$ of a submodular function $f$ by $S$, provided that $g(X)$ is given by a function value oracle. A submodular function $f$ on $V$ is said to be strict if $f(X) + f(Y) &gt; f(X \cup Y) + f(X \cap Y)$ holds whenever both $X \setminus Y$ and $Y \setminus X$ are nonempty. We show that the problem is solved by using $\mathrm{O}(|V|)$ oracle calls when $f$ is strictly submodular, although it requires exponentially many oracle calls in general.},

  abstract     = {Given a graph $H$, the Turán number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H)$ is the largest number of edges in an $H$-free graph on $n$ vertices. We make progress on a recent conjecture of Conlon, Janzer, and Lee [More on the Extremal Number of Subdivisions, arXiv:1903.10631v1, 2019] on the Turán numbers of bipartite graphs, which in turn yields further progress on a conjecture of Erdös and Simonovits [Combinatorica, 1 (1981), pp. 25--42]. Let $s,t,k\geq 2$ be integers. Let $K_{s,t}^k$ denote the graph obtained from the complete bipartite graph $K_{s,t}$ by replacing each edge $uv$ in it with a path of length $k$ between $u$ and $v$ such that the $st$ replacing paths are internally disjoint. It follows from a general theorem of Bukh and Conlon [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS), 20 (2018), pp. 1747--1757] that $\mathrm{ex}(n,K_{s,t}^k)=\Omega(n^{1+\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{sk}})$. Conlon, Janzer, and Lee recently conjectured that for any integers $s,t,k\geq 2$, $\mathrm{ex}(n,K_{s,t}^k)=O(n^{1+\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{sk}})$. Among many other things, they settled the $k=2$ case of their conjecture. As the main result of this paper, we prove their conjecture for $k=3,4$. Our main results also yield infinitely many new so-called Turán exponents: rationals $r\in (1,2)$ for which there exists a bipartite graph $H$ with $\mathrm{ex}(n, H)=\Theta(n^r)$, adding to the lists recently obtained by Jiang, Ma, and Yepremyan [On Turán Exponents of Bipartite Graphs, arXiv:1806.02838, 2018], by Kang, Kim, and Liu [On the Rational Turán Exponent Conjecture, arXiv:1811.06916, 2018], and by Conlon, Janzer, and Lee. Our method builds on an extension of the Conlon--Janzer--Lee method. We also note that the extended method also gives a weaker version of the Conlon--Janzer--Lee conjecture for all $k\geq 2$.},

  abstract     = {A $k$-uniform hypergraph is said to be $r$-rainbow colorable if there is an $r$-coloring of its vertices such that every hyperedge intersects all $r$ color classes. Given as input such a hypergraph, finding a $r$-rainbow coloring of it is NP-hard for all $k \ge 3$ and $r \ge 2$. Therefore, one settles for finding a rainbow coloring with fewer colors (which is an easier task). When $r=k$ (the maximum possible value), i.e., the hypergraph is $k$-partite, one can efficiently $2$-rainbow color the hypergraph, i.e., $2$-color its vertices so that there are no monochromatic edges. In this work, we consider the next smaller value of $r=k-1$ and prove that in this case it is NP-hard to rainbow color the hypergraph with $q := \lceil \frac{k-2}{2} \rceil$ colors. In particular, for $k \le 6$, it is NP-hard to $2$-color $(k-1)$-rainbow colorable $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our proof follows the algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction problems. It proceeds by characterizing the polymorphisms associated with the approximate rainbow coloring problem, which are rainbow colorings of some product hypergraphs on vertex set $[r]^n$. We prove that any such polymorphism $f: [r]^n \to [q]$ must be $C$-fixing, i.e., there are a small subset $S$ of $C$ coordinates and a setting $a \in [q]^S$ such that fixing $x_{|S} = a$ determines the value of $f(x)$. The key step in our proof is bounding the sensitivity of certain rainbow colorings, thereby arguing that they must be juntas. Armed with the $C$-fixing characterization, our NP-hardness is obtained via a reduction from smooth Label Cover.},

  abstract     = {For integers $a\ge 2b&gt;0$, a circular $a/b$-flow is a flow that takes values from ${\pm b, \pm(b+1), \dots, \pm(a-b)}$. The Planar Circular Flow Conjecture states that every $2k$-edge-connected planar graph admits a circular $(2+\frac{2}{k})$-flow. The cases $k=1$ and $k=2$ are equivalent to the Four Color Theorem and Grötzsch&#39;s 3-Color Theorem. For $k\ge 3$, the conjecture remains open. Here we make progress when $k=4$ and $k=6$. We prove that (i) every 10-edge-connected planar graph admits a circular $5/2$-flow and (ii) every 16-edge-connected planar graph admits a circular 7/3-flow. The dual version of statement (i) on circular coloring was previously proved by Dvořák and Postle [Combinatorica, 37 (2017), pp. 863--886], but our proof has the advantages of being much shorter and avoiding the use of computers for case-checking. Further, it has new implications for antisymmetric flows. Statement (ii) is especially interesting because the counterexamples to Jaeger&#39;s original Circular Flow Conjecture are 12-edge-connected nonplanar graphs that admit no circular 7/3-flow. Thus, the planarity hypothesis of (ii) is essential.},

  abstract     = {Total dual integrality is a powerful and unifying concept in polyhedral combinatorics and integer programming that enables the refinement of geometric min-max relations given by linear programming strong duality into combinatorial min-max theorems. The definition of a linear inequality system being totally dual integral (TDI) revolves around the existence of optimal dual solutions that are integral and thus naturally applies to a host of combinatorial optimization problems that are cast as integer programs whose linear program (LP) relaxations have the TDIness property. However, when combinatorial problems are formulated using more general convex relaxations, such as semidefinite programs (SDPs), it is not at all clear what an appropriate notion of integrality in the dual program is, thus inhibiting the generalization of the theory to more general forms of structured convex optimization. (In fact, we argue that the rank-one constraint usually added to SDP relaxations is not adequate in the dual SDP.) In this paper, we propose a notion of total dual integrality for SDPs that generalizes the notion for LPs, by relying on an “integrality constraint&quot; for SDPs that is primal-dual symmetric. A key ingredient for the theory is a generalization to compact convex sets of a result of Hoffman for polytopes, fundamental for generalizing the polyhedral notion of total dual integrality introduced by Edmonds and Giles. We study the corresponding theory applied to SDP formulations for stable sets in graphs using the Lovász theta function and show that total dual integrality in this case corresponds to the underlying graph being perfect. We also relate dual integrality of an SDP formulation for the maximum cut problem to bipartite graphs. Total dual integrality for extended formulations naturally comes into play in this context.},

Using these tools we define a notion of a directed blockage in a digraph and prove a min-max theorem for directed path-width analogous to the result of Bienstock, Roberston, Seymour, and Thomas for blockages in graphs. Furthermore, we show that every digraph with directed path width $\geq k$ contains each arboresence of order $\leq k + 1$ as a butterfly minor. Finally we also show that every digraph admits a linked directed path-decomposition of minimum width, extending a result of Kim and Seymour on semi-complete digraphs.},

The classical setup assumes that the sequence of candidate rankings is uniformly distributed. Given a statistic on the symmetric group, one can instead weight each permutation according to an exponential function in the statistic. We play the game of best choice on the Ewens and Mallows distributions that are obtained in this way from the number of left-to-right maxima and number of inversions in the permutation, respectively. For each of these, we give the optimal strategy and probability of winning. Moreover, we introduce a general class of permutation statistics that always produces games of best choice whose optimal strategies are positional, which simplifies their analysis considerably.},

A robust version of this result, due to Rademacher, says that there must, in fact, be at least $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ triangles in any such graph. Another strengthening, due to the combined efforts of many authors starting with Erdös, says that any such graph must have an edge which is contained in at least $n/6$ triangles. Following Mubayi, we study the interplay between these two results, that is, between the number of triangles in such graphs and their book number, the largest number of triangles sharing an edge. Among other results, Mubayi showed that for any $1/6 \leq \beta 0$ such that any graph on $n$ vertices with at least $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor + 1$ edges and book number at most $\beta n$ contains at least $(\gamma -o(1))n^3$ triangles. He also asked for a more precise estimate for $\gamma$ in terms of $\beta$. We make a conjecture about this dependency and prove this conjecture for $\beta = 1/6$ and for $0.2495 \leq \beta &lt; 1/4$, thereby answering Mubayi&#39;s question in these ranges.},

We denote the family of r-uniform hypergraphs that are Berge copies of G by $B^rG$. For families of r-uniform hypergraphs $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{H}&#39;$, we denote by $R(\mathbf{H},\mathbf{H}&#39;)$ the smallest number n such that in any red-blue coloring of the (hyper)edges of $\mathcal{K}_n^r$ (the complete r-uniform hypergraph on n vertices) there is a monochromatic blue copy of a hypergraph in $\mathbf{H}$ or a monochromatic red copy of a hypergraph in $\mathbf{H}&#39;$. $R^c(\mathbf{H})$ denotes the smallest number n such that in any coloring of the hyperedges of $\mathcal{K}_n^r$ with c colors, there is a monochromatic copy of a hypergraph in $\mathbf{H}$.

In the case $r &lt; 2c$ we also obtain bounds on $R^c(B^rK_n)$. Moreover, we also determine the exact value of $R(B^3T_1,B^3T_2)$ for every pair of trees T_1 and T_2.},

We generalize the positive side of this dichotomy by providing an algorithm that solves the problem in polynomial time for any H with no C_4 subgraph. This gives a large class of constraints for which finding solutions to the Constraint Satisfaction Problem is NP-complete but finding paths in the solution space is in P. The algorithm uses a characterization of possible reconfiguration sequences (paths in Hom(G,H)), whose main part is a purely topological condition described in terms of the fundamental groupoid of H seen as a topological space.},

  abstract     = {The anti-Ramsey problem was introduced by Erdös, Simonovits, and Sós in 1970s. The anti-Ramsey number of a hypergraph H, ar(n,s, H), is the smallest integer c such that in any coloring of the edges of the s-uniform complete hypergraph on n vertices with exactly c colors, there is a copy of H whose edges have distinct colors. In this paper, we determine the anti-Ramsey numbers of linear paths and loose paths in hypergraphs for sufficiently large n and give bounds for the anti-Ramsey numbers of Berge paths. Similar exact anti-Ramsey numbers are obtained for linear/loose cycles, and bounds are obtained for Berge cycles. Our main tools are the path extension technique and stability results on hypergraph Turán problems of paths and cycles.},

  abstract     = {We study partial and budgeted versions of the well-studied connected dominating set problem. In the partial connected dominating set (PCDS) problem, we are given an undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ and an integer $n&#39;$, and the goal is to find a minimum subset of vertices that induces a connected subgraph of $G$ and dominates at least $n&#39;$ vertices. We obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with an $O(\ln \Delta)$ approximation guarantee for this problem, thereby significantly extending the results of Guha and Khuller [Algorithmica, 20(1998), pp. 374--387] for the connected dominating set problem. We note that none of the methods developed earlier can be applied directly to solve this problem. In the budgeted connected dominating set problem, there is a budget on the number of vertices we can select, and the goal is to dominate as many vertices as possible. We obtain a $\frac{1}{12}(1-\frac{1}{e})$ approximation algorithm for this problem. Finally, we show that our techniques extend to a more general setting where the profit function associated with a subset of vertices is a “special” submodular function. This generalization captures the connected dominating set problem with capacities and/or weighted profits as special cases. This implies an $O(\ln q)$ approximation (where $q$ denotes the quota) and $O(1)$ approximation algorithms for the partial and budgeted versions of these problems. While the algorithms are simple, the results make a surprising use of the greedy set cover framework in defining a useful profit function. Finally, we prove that (both edge and node) weighted versions of the PCDS problem are as hard as the more general group Steiner tree problem.},

In recent years, hypergraphs meeting this conjectured bound, known as $r$-Ryser hypergraphs, have been studied extensively. It was proved by Haxell, Narins, and Szabó that all 3-Ryser hypergraphs with matching number $\nu &gt; 1$ are essentially obtained by taking $\nu$ disjoint copies of intersecting 3-Ryser hypergraphs. Abu-Khazneh showed that such a characterization is false for $r = 4$ by giving a computer generated example of a 4-Ryser hypergraph with $\nu = 2$ whose vertex set cannot be partitioned into two sets such that we have an intersecting 4-Ryser hypergraph on each of these parts. Here we construct first infinite families of $r$-Ryser hypergraphs, for any fixed matching number $\nu &gt; 1$, that are truly nonintersecting in the sense that they do not contain two vertex disjoint intersecting $r$-Ryser subhypergraphs.},

  abstract     = {A $d$-dimensional bar-and-joint framework $(G,p)$, where $G$ is a graph and $p$ maps the vertices of $G$ to points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, is said to be globally rigid if every $d$-dimensional framework $(G,q)$ with the same graph and same edge lengths is congruent to $(G,p)$. Global rigidity of frameworks and graphs is a well-studied area of rigidity theory with a number of applications, including the localization problem of sensor networks. Motivated by this application we consider the new notion of unit ball global rigidity, which can be defined similarly, except that $(G,p)$ as well as $(G,q)$ are required to be unit ball frameworks in the above definition. In a unit ball framework two vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance is less than a fixed constant (which corresponds to the sensing radius in a sensor network). In this paper we initiate a theoretical analysis of this version of global rigidity and prove several structural results. Among others we identify families of frameworks (and corresponding graphs $G$) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for all $d\geq 1$ which are unit ball globally rigid without being globally rigid in the usual sense. These families contain minimally rigid graphs, too, which have fewer edges than any of the globally rigid graphs on the same number of vertices.},

In this work, we derive a variety of new bounds for the local properties problem and its variants, by extending the color energy technique---a variant of the additive energy technique from additive combinatorics (color energy was originally introduced by the last two authors [C. Pohoata and A. Sheffer, Combinatorica, 39 (2019), pp. 705--714]). We generalize the concept of color energy to higher color energies and combine these with bounds on the extremal numbers of even cycles. Let $f(n,k,\ell)$ denote the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of $K_n$ such that every $k$ vertices span at least $\ell$ colors. It can be easily shown that $f(n,k,\binom{k}{2}-\lfloor \frac{k}{2}\rfloor +2)=\Theta(n^2)$. Erdös and Gyárfás asked what happens when $\ell=\binom{k}{2}-\lfloor k/2\rfloor +1$, one away from the easy case, and derived the bound $f\left(n,k,\ell\right) =\Omega(n^{4/3})$. Our technique significantly improves this to $f(n,k,\binom{k}{2} - \lfloor k/2\rfloor +1) = \Omega(n^{2- 8/k})$.},

  abstract     = {Graph sparsification aims at compressing large graphs into smaller ones while preserving important characteristics of the input graph. In this work we study vertex sparsifiers, i.e., sparsifiers whose goal is to reduce the number of vertices. We focus on the following notions: (1) Given a digraph $G=(V,E)$ and terminal vertices $K \subset V$ with $|K| = k$, a (vertex) reachability sparsifier of $G$ is a digraph $H=(V_H,E_H)$, $K \subset V_H$ that preserves all reachability information among terminal pairs. Let $|V_H|$ denote the size of $H$. In this work we introduce the notion of reachability-preserving minors (RPMs), i.e., we require $H$ to be a minor of $G$. We show any directed graph $G$ admits an RPM $H$ of size $O(k^3)$, and if $G$ is planar, then the size of $H$ improves to $O(k^{2} \log k)$. We complement our upper bound by showing that there exists an infinite family of grids such that any RPM must have $\Omega(k^{2})$ vertices. (2) Given a weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and terminal vertices $K$ with $|K|=k$, an exact (vertex) cut sparsifier of $G$ is a graph $H$ with $K \subset V_H$ that preserves the value of minimum cuts separating any bipartition of $K$. We show that planar graphs with all the $k$ terminals lying on the same face admit exact cut sparsifiers of size $O(k^{2})$ that are also planar. Our result extends to flow and distance sparsifiers. It improves the previous best-known bound of $O(k^22^{2k})$ for cut and flow sparsifiers by an exponential factor and matches an $\Omega(k^2)$ lower-bound for this class of graphs.},

Given a large edge-weighted network $G$ with $k$ terminal vertices, compress it into a smaller network $H$ with the same terminals, such that every minimum terminal cut in $H$ approximates the corresponding one in $G$, up to a factor $q\geq 1$ that is called the quality. (The case $q=1$ is known also as a mimicking network.) We provide new insights about the structure of minimum terminal cuts, leading to new results for cut sparsifiers of planar graphs. Our first contribution identifies a subset of the minimum terminal cuts, which we call elementary, that generates all the others. Consequently, $H$ is a cut sparsifier if and only if it preserves all the elementary terminal cuts (up to this factor $q$). Our second and main contribution is to refine the known bounds in terms of $\gamma=\gamma(G)$, which is defined as the minimum number of faces that are incident to all the terminals in a planar graph $G$. We prove that the number of elementary terminal cuts is $O((2k/\gamma)^{2\gamma})$ (compared to $O(2^k)$ terminal cuts) and furthermore obtain a mimicking network of size $O(\gamma 2^{2\gamma} k^4)$, which is near-optimal as a function of $\gamma$. Our third contribution is a duality between cut sparsification and distance sparsification for certain planar graphs, when the sparsifier $H$ is required to be a minor of $G$. This duality connects problems that were previously studied separately, implying new results, new proofs of known results, and equivalences between open gaps.},

This supports a general Pattern Avoidance Conjecture in Euclidean spaces. The proofs are based mainly on the probabilistic method, but additional tools are forced by the geometric nature of the problem.

  abstract     = {The flip graph of triangulations has as vertices all triangulations of a convex $n$-gon and an edge between any two triangulations that differ in exactly one edge. An $r$-rainbow cycle in this graph is a cycle in which every inner edge of the triangulation appears exactly $r$ times. This notion of a rainbow cycle extends in a natural way to other flip graphs. In this paper we investigate the existence of $r$-rainbow cycles for three different flip graphs on classes of geometric objects: the aforementioned flip graph of triangulations of a convex $n$-gon, the flip graph of plane trees on an arbitrary set of $n$ points, and the flip graph of noncrossing perfect matchings on a set of $n$ points in convex position. In addition, we consider two flip graphs on classes of nongeometric objects: the flip graph of permutations of ${1,2,\dots,n}$ and the flip graph of $k$-element subsets of ${1,2,\dots,n}$. In each of the five settings, we prove the existence and nonexistence of rainbow cycles for different values of $r$, $n$, and $k$.},
