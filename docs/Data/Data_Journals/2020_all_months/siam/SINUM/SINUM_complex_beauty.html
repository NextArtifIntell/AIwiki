  abstract     = {An artificial boundary method is developed for solving the one-dimensional advection diffusion equation in the real line. In order to construct a fully discrete fast numerical algorithm with rigorous error analysis, we start with the two-step backward difference formula for time discretization of the advection diffusion equation in the whole real line. Then, we use the discrete analogue of the Laplace transform to derive a second-order time-stepping scheme in a bounded domain equipped with a discrete artificial boundary condition (ABC). The Galerkin finite element method is used for spatial discretization. To expedite the evaluation of time convolution involved in the discrete ABC, we propose a fast algorithm based on the best rational approximation of square root function in subdomains of the complex plane. An estimate for this best rational approximation enables us to prove optimal-order convergence of the fully discrete numerical scheme (integrating the fast approximation algorithm). Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the convergence of numerical solutions and the effectiveness of the proposed fast approximation algorithm.},

Toward this aim, we introduce a family of hybrid estimators in the statistical learning context whose convergence rates have the following properties: first, they are equal to those of spectral methods, and second, they are connected to the rates of spectral regularization in ill-posed inverse problems, provided that a suitable inverse proportionality relation between n and $\delta$ holds true. This family of estimators allows us to convert upper rates depending on $n$ to upper rates depending on $\delta$ and to convert lower rates vice versa, quantifying their deviation. The analysis is carried out under general source conditions in the case the rank of the forward operator is both finite and infinite, and, in the latter case, both by not making any assumptions on the eigenvalues and by assuming a polynomial eigenvalue decay.},

In this article a modification of the smoothness indicators used in the original algorithm is presented.

The family of sum-up rounding (SUR) algorithms provides a means to approximate feasible points of these relaxations, i.e., $[0,1]$-valued control trajectories, with ${0,1}$-valued points. The approximants computed by an SUR algorithm converge in a weak sense when the coarseness of the rounding grid of the SUR algorithm is driven to zero, which in turn induces norm convergence of the corresponding sequence of state vectors. We show that this approximation property can be transferred to MIOCPs with integer control variables distributed in more than one dimension when carrying out an appropriate grid refinement strategy. We deduce a norm convergence result for the state vector of elliptic PDE systems and provide computational results illustrating the applicability of the theoretical framework.},

It is shown that this development, in the case of strictly convex reflexive Banach spaces with strictly convex dual, gives rise to a class of nonlinear Petrov--Galerkin methods and, equivalently, abstract mixed methods with monotone nonlinearity. Under the Fortin condition, we prove discrete stability and quasi-optimal convergence of the abstract inexact method, with constants depending on the geometry of the underlying Banach spaces.

  abstract     = {Reduced model spaces, such as reduced bases and polynomial chaos, are linear spaces $V_n$ of finite dimension $n$ which are designed for the efficient approximation of certain families of parametrized PDEs in a Hilbert space $V$. The manifold $\cal M$ that gathers the solutions of the PDE for all admissible parameter values is globally approximated by the space $V_n$ with some controlled accuracy $\varepsilon_n$, which is typically much smaller than when using standard approximation spaces of the same dimension such as finite elements. Reduced model spaces have also been proposed in [Y. Maday et al., Internat. J. Numer. Methods Ergrg., 102 (2015), pp. 933--965] as a vehicle to design a simple linear recovery algorithm of the state $u\in \cal M$ corresponding to a particular solution instance when the values of parameters are unknown but a set of data is given by $m$ linear measurements of the state. The measurements are of the form $\ell_j(u)$, $j=1,\dots,m$, where the $\ell_j$ are linear functionals on $V$. The analysis of this approach in [P. Binev et al., SIAM/ASA J. Uncertain. Quantif., 5 (2017), pp. 1--29] shows that the recovery error is bounded by $\mu_n \varepsilon_n$, where $\mu_n=\mu(V_n,W)$ is the inverse of an inf-sup constant that describe the angle between $V_n$ and the space $W$ spanned by the Riesz representers of $(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_m)$. A reduced model space which is efficient for approximation might thus be ineffective for recovery if $\mu_n$ is large or infinite. In this paper, we discuss the existence and effective construction of an optimal reduced model space for this recovery method. We extend our search to affine spaces which are better adapted than linear spaces for various purposes. Our basic observation is that this problem is equivalent to the search of an optimal affine algorithm for the recovery of $\cal M$ in the worst case error sense. This allows us to peform our search by a convex optimization procedure. Numerical tests illustrate that the reduced model spaces constructed from our approach perform better than the classical reduced basis spaces.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies adaptive first-order system least-squares finite element methods (LSFEMs) for second-order elliptic partial differential equations in nondivergence form. Unlike the classical finite element methods which use weak formulations of PDEs that are not applicable for the nondivergence equation, the first-order least-squares formulations naturally have stable weak forms without using integration by parts, allow simple finite element approximation spaces, and have built-in a posteriori error estimators for adaptive mesh refinements. The nondivergence equation is first written as a system of first-order equations by introducing the gradient as a new variable. Then, two versions of least-squares finite element methods using simple $C^0$ finite elements are developed in the paper. One is the $L^2$-LSFEM which uses linear elements, and the other is the W-LSFEM with a mesh-dependent weight to ensure the optimal convergence. Under the assumption that the PDE has a unique solution, a priori and a posteriori error estimates are presented. With an extra assumption on the operator regularity, convergence in standard norms for the W-LSFEM is also discussed. $L^2$-error estimates are derived for both formulations. Extensive numerical experiments for continuous, discontinuous, and even degenerate coefficients on smooth and singular solutions are performed to test the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.},

In prior work we investigated the interplay between the local truncation error and the global error to construct error inhibiting general linear methods (GLMs) that control the accumulation of the local truncation error over time. We defined sufficient conditions that allow us to postprocess the final solution and obtain a solution that is two orders of accuracy higher than expected from truncation error analysis alone. In this work we extend this theory to the class of two-derivative GLMs. We define sufficient conditions that control the growth of the error so that the solution is one order higher than expected from truncation error analysis, and furthermore, define the construction of a simple postprocessor that will extract an additional order of accuracy. Using these conditions as constraints, we develop an optimization code that enables us to find explicit two-derivative methods up to eighth order that have favorable stability regions, explicit strong stability preserving (SSP) methods up to seventh order, and A-stable implicit methods up to fifth order. We numerically verify the order of convergence of a selection of these methods, and the total variation diminishing performance of some of the SSP methods. We confirm that the methods found perform as predicted by the theory developed herein.},

  abstract     = {Parametric sensitivity analysis is a critical component in the study of mathematical models of physical systems. Due to its simplicity, finite difference methods are used extensively for this analysis in the study of stochastically modeled reaction networks. Different coupling methods have been proposed to build finite difference estimators, with the “split coupling,” also termed the “stacked coupling,” yielding the lowest variance in the vast majority of cases. Analytical results related to this coupling are sparse and include an analysis of the variance of the coupled processes under the assumption of globally Lipschitz intensity functions [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 50 (2012), pp. 2237--2258]. Because of the global Lipschitz assumption utilized in [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 50 (2012), pp. 2237--2258], the main result there is only applicable to a small percentage of the models found in the literature, and it was conjectured that similar results should hold for a much wider class of models. In this paper we demonstrate this conjecture to be true by proving the variance of the coupled processes scales in the desired manner for a large class of non-Lipschitz models. We further extend the analysis to allow for time dependence in the parameters. In particular, binary systems with or without time-dependent rate parameters, a class of models that accounts for the vast majority of systems considered in the literature, satisfy the assumptions of our theory.},

We design a least squares method for discretization of the considered Helmholtz equations. In this method, an auxiliary unknown is introduced on the common interface of any two neighboring elements and a quadratic objective functional is defined by the jumps of the traces of the solutions of local Helmholtz equations across all the common interfaces, where the local Helmholtz equations are defined on elements and are imposed Robin-type boundary conditions given by the auxiliary unknowns. A minimization problem with the objective functional is proposed to determine the auxiliary unknowns. The resulting discrete system of the auxiliary unknowns is Hermitian positive definite and so it can be solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. Under some assumptions we show that the generated approximate solutions possess almost the same $L^2$ convergence order as the plane wave methods (for the case of constant wave number). Moreover, we construct a substructuring preconditioner for the discrete system of the auxiliary unknowns. Numerical experiments show that the proposed methods are very effective and have little “wave number pollution&quot; for the tested Helmholtz equations with large wave numbers.},

We first introduce the motion of a passive tracer particle in random flows using the Lagrangian formulation, which is modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Then we propose stochastic structure-preserving schemes to solve the SDEs and provide rigorous convergence analysis for the numerical schemes in computing effective diffusivity. The convergence analysis follows a probabilistic approach, which interprets the solution process generated by our numerical schemes as a Markov process. By exploring the ergodicity of the solution process, we obtain a convergence analysis of our method in computing long-time solutions of the SDEs. Most importantly, our analysis result reveals the equivalence of the definition of the effective diffusivity by solving discrete-type and continuous-type (i.e., Eulerian) corrector problems, which is fundamental and interesting. Finally, we present numerical results to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method and investigate the convection-enhanced diffusion phenomenon in two- and three-dimensional incompressible random flows.},

We solve two open problems: the first concerning the $\nu$-dependent asymptotic decay of eigenvalues of the resulting circulant in the nonsmooth case, the second concerning the required size in terms of $\nu$, $\lambda$ of the torus when using a smooth periodization.

However, the approximate velocity is not $H({div})$-conforming, and it can be shown that this is the reason that the EDG method is not pressure-robust, i.e., the error in the velocity depends on the continuous pressure. In this paper we present a local reconstruction operator that maps discretely divergence-free test functions to exactly divergence-free test functions. This local reconstruction operator restores pressure-robustness by only changing the right-hand side of the discretization, similar to the reconstruction operator recently introduced for the Taylor--Hood and mini elements by Lederer et al. [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 55 (2017), pp. 1291--1314]. We present an a priori error analysis of the discretization showing optimal convergence rates and pressure-robustness of the velocity error. These results are verified by numerical examples. The motivation for this research is that the resulting EDG method combines the versatility of discontinuous Galerkin methods with the computational efficiency of continuous Galerkin methods and accuracy of pressure-robust finite element methods.},

We propose a multilevel a posteriori estimator of the algebraic error. We prove that this estimator is reliable and efficient (represents a two-sided bound of the error), with a constant independent of the degree $p$. We next design a multilevel iterative algebraic solver from our estimator and show that this solver contracts the algebraic error on each iteration by a factor bounded independently of $p$. Actually, we show that these two results are equivalent. The $p$-robustness results rely on the work of Schöberl et al. [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 28 (2008), pp. 1--24] for one given mesh. We combine this with the design of an algebraic residual lifting constructed over a hierarchy of nested unstructured, possibly highly graded, simplicial meshes. The lifting includes a global coarse-level solve with the lowest polynomial degree one together with local contributions from the subsequent mesh levels. These contributions, of the highest polynomial degree $p$ on the finest mesh, are given as solutions of mutually independent local Dirichlet problems posed over overlapping patches of elements around vertices. The construction of this lifting can be seen as one geometric V-cycle multigrid step with zero pre- and one postsmoothing by (damped) additive Schwarz (block Jacobi). One particular feature of our approach is the optimal choice of the step-size generated from the algebraic residual lifting. Numerical tests are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.},

Moreover, we show that the lowest order HHJ method on a polygonal approximation of the disk does not succumb to the classic Babuška paradox, highlighting the geometrically nonconforming aspect of the HHJ method.},

The new schemes are a high-order analogue of the minimizing-movements approach for generating a time discrete approximation to a gradient flow by solving a sequence of optimization problems. In particular, each step entails minimizing the associated energy of the gradient flow plus a movement limiter term that is, in the classical context of steepest descent with respect to an inner product, simply quadratic. A variety of existing unconditionally stable numerical methods can be recognized as (typically just first-order-accurate-in-time) minimizing-movement schemes for their associated evolution equations, already requiring the optimization of the energy plus a quadratic term at every time step. Therefore, our approach gives a painless way to extend these to high-order-accurate-in-time schemes while maintaining their unconditional stability. In this sense, it can be viewed as a variational analogue of Richardson extrapolation.},

These include the fact that the velocity vector should be tangent to the given surface and the possible presence of degenerate modes (Killing fields) in the solution. We analyze a surface finite element method which provides solutions to these challenges. We consider an interior penalty method based on the well-known Brezzi--Douglas--Marini $H(div)$-conforming finite element space. The resulting spaces are tangential to the surface but require penalization of jumps across element interfaces in order to weakly maintain $H^1$ conformity of the velocity field. In addition our method exactly satisfies the incompressibility constraint in the surface Stokes problem. Second, we give a method which robustly filters Killing fields out of the solution. This problem is complicated by the fact that the dimension of the space of Killing fields may change with small perturbations of the surface. We first approximate the Killing fields via a Stokes eigenvalue problem and then give a method which is asymptotically guaranteed to correctly exclude them from the solution. The properties of our method are rigorously established via an error analysis and illustrated via numerical experiments.},

The derivation relies crucially on the availability of a spectral estimate for the linearized Allen--Cahn operator about the approximating solution in conjunction with a continuation argument and a variant of the elliptic reconstruction.

All existing branching random walk solutions are formulated based on the Hahn--Jordan decomposition $\Theta_V=\Theta^+_V-\Theta^-_V$, i.e., treating $\Theta_V$ as the difference of two positive operators $\Theta^\pm_V$, each of which characterizes the transition of states for one branch of particles. Despite the fact that the first moments of such models solve the Wigner equation, we prove that the bounds of corresponding variances grow exponentially in time, with the rate depending on the upper bound of $\Theta^\pm_V$ instead of $\Theta_V$. In other words, the decay of high-frequency components is totally ignored, resulting in a severe numerical sign problem. To fully utilize such a decay property, we turn to the stationary phase approximation for $\Theta_V$, which captures essential contributions from the stationary phase points as well as from the near-cancellation of positive and negative weights. The resulting branching random walk solutions are then proved to asymptotically solve the Wigner equation, but they gain a substantial reduction in variances, thereby ameliorating the sign problem. Numerical experiments in 4-D phase space validate our theoretical findings.},

These problems are discretized using the Galerkin method with nodal conforming finite elements of any (fixed) order on meshes with diameter $h = h(k)$, chosen to maintain accuracy as $k$ increases. The action of the preconditioner requires the solution of independent (parallel) subproblems (with impedance boundary conditions) on overlapping subdomains of diameter $H$ and overlap $\delta\leq H$. The solutions of these subproblems are linked together using prolongation/restriction operators defined using a partition of unity; this formulation was previously proposed in [J.-H. Kimn and M. Sarkis, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg., 196 (2007), pp. 1507--1514]. In numerical experiments (with $\delta \sim H$) for a model interior impedance problem, we observe robust (i.e., $k$-independent) GMRES convergence as $k$ increases, with $H\sim k^{-\alpha}$ and $\alpha \in [0,0.4]$ as $k$ increases. This provides a highly parallel, $k$-robust one-level domain decomposition method. We provide a supporting theory by studying the preconditioner applied to a range of absorptive problems, $k^2\mapsto k^2+ {i} \epsilon$, with absorption parameter $\epsilon$. Working in the Helmholtz “energy” inner product, and using the underlying theory of Helmholtz boundary-value problems, we prove a $k$-independent upper bound on the norm of the preconditioned matrix, valid for all $\vert \epsilon\vert \lesssim k^2$. We also prove a strictly positive lower bound on the distance of the field of values of the preconditioned matrix from the origin which holds when $\epsilon/k$ is constant or growing arbitrarily slowly with $k$. These results imply robustness of the preconditioner for the corresponding absorptive problem as $k$ increases (given an appropriate choice of $H$). Since it is known that the absorptive problem provides a good preconditioner for the pure Helmholtz problem when $\epsilon \sim k$, our results provide some theoretical support for the observed robustness of the preconditioner for the pure Helmholtz problem. Since the subdomains used in our preconditioner shrink only slowly (relative to the fine grid size) as $k$ increases, cheaper approximate (two- or multilevel) versions of the preconditioner analyzed here are important in practice and are reviewed here.},

We develop a numerical approximation to a hidden-memory variable-order space-time fractional diffusion equation, which provides a physically more relevant variable-order fractional diffusion equation modeling. However, due to the impact of the hidden memory, the resulting L-1 discretization loses its monotonicity that was crucial in the error analysis of the widely used L-1 discretizations of constant-order fractional diffusion equations and even variable-order fractional diffusion equations without hidden memory. We develop a novel decomposition of the L-1 discretization weights to address the nonmonotonicity of the numerical approximation to prove its optimal-order error estimate without any (often untrue) artificial regularity assumption of its true solutions, but only under the regularity assumptions of the variable order, the coefficients, and the source term.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a fast spectral-Galerkin method for solving PDEs involving an integral fractional Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which is built upon two essential components: (i) the Dunford--Taylor formulation of the fractional Laplacian; and (ii) Fourier-like biorthogonal mapped Chebyshev functions (MCFs) as basis functions. As a result, the fractional Laplacian can be fully diagonalized, and the complexity of solving an elliptic fractional PDE is quasi-optimal, i.e., $O((N\log_2N)^d)$ with $N$ being the number of modes in each spatial direction. Ample numerical tests for various decaying exact solutions show that the convergence of the fast solver perfectly matches the order of theoretical error estimates. With a suitable time discretization, the fast solver can be directly applied to a large class of nonlinear fractional PDEs. As an example, we solve the fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation by using the fourth-order time-splitting method together with the proposed MCF--spectral-Galerkin method.},

  abstract     = {This paper is dedicated to the improvement of the efficiency of the leapfrog method for linear and semilinear second-order differential equations. In numerous situations the strict CFL condition of the leapfrog method is the main bottleneck that thwarts its performance. Based on Chebyshev polynomials new methods have been constructed for linear problems that exhibit a much weaker CFL condition than the leapfrog method (at a higher cost). However, these methods fail to produce the correct long-time behavior of the exact solution which can result in a bad approximation quality. In this paper we introduce a new class of leapfrog-Chebyshev methods for semilinear problems. For the linear part, we use Chebyshev polynomials while the nonlinearity is treated by the standard leapfrog method. The method can be viewed as a multirate scheme because the nonlinearity is evaluated only once in each time step whereas the number of evaluations of the linear part corresponds to the degree of the Chebyshev polynomial. In contrast to existing literature (which is restricted to linear problems), we suggest to stabilize the scheme and we introduce a new starting value required for the two-step method. A new representation formula for the approximations obtained by using generating functions allows us to fully understand the stability and the long-time behavior of the stabilized and the unstabilized scheme. In particular, for linear problems we prove that these new schemes approximately preserve a discrete energy norm over arbitrarily long times. The stability analysis shows that stabilization is essential to guarantee a favorable CFL condition for the multirate scheme, which is closely related to local time-stepping schemes. We also show error bounds of order two for semilinear problems and that a special choice of the stabilization yields order four for linear problems. Finally, we discuss the efficient implementation of the new schemes and give generalizations to fully nonlinear equations.},

We first show by means of a counterexample that one cannot expect global convergence of the scheme without any further assumptions on the energy. For the class of uniformly convex energies, we derive error estimates of optimal order, provided that the Lipschitz constant of the load is sufficiently small. Afterwards, we extend this result to the case of an energy, which is only locally uniformly convex in a neighborhood of a given solution trajectory. For the latter case, the local incremental minimization scheme turns out to be superior compared to its global counterpart, as a numerical example demonstrates.},

In engineering applications, the pressure term is necessary for calculating important quantities based on stresses like the lift and drag. For reduced-order models generated via a proper orthogonal decomposition, it is common for the pressure to drop out of the equations and produce a velocity-only reduced-order model. To recover the pressure, many techniques have been numerically studied in the literature; however, these techniques have undergone little rigorous analysis. In this work, we examine two of the most popular approaches: pressure recovery through the pressure Poisson equation and recovery via the momentum equation through the use of a supremizer stabilized velocity basis. We examine the challenges that each approach faces and prove stability and convergence results for the supremizer stabilized approach. We also investigate numerically the stability and convergence of the supremizer based approach, in addition to its performance against the pressure Poisson method.},

In particular, those results imply that milder (compared to the optimal) grading yields the optimal convergence rate $2-\alpha$ in positive time, while quasi-uniform temporal meshes yield first-order convergence in positive time. Furthermore, under appropriate conditions on the nonlinearity, the method of upper and lower solutions immediately implies that, similarly to the exact solutions, the computed solutions lie within a certain range.

  abstract     = {We study a model of crowd motion following a gradient vector field, with possibly additional interaction terms such as attraction/repulsion, and we present a numerical scheme for its solution through a Lagrangian discretization. The density constraint of the resulting particles is enforced by means of a partial optimal transport problem at each time step. We prove the convergence of the discrete measures to a solution of the continuous PDE describing the crowd motion in dimension one. In a second part, we show how a similar approach can be used to construct a Lagrangian discretization of a linear advection-diffusion equation. Both discretizations rely on the interpretation of the two equations (crowd motion and linear diffusion) as gradient flows in Wasserstein space. We provide also a numerical implementation in 2 dimensions to demonstrate the feasibility of the computations.},

Solutions of this system behave contractively, i.e., the Euclidean distance between two solutions $x(t)$ and $\widetilde{x}(t)$ is a nonincreasing function of $t$. It is then of interest to investigate whether a similar contraction takes place, at least for suitably small step sizes $h$, for the discrete solution. Dahlquist and Jeltsch&#39;s results imply that (1) there are explicit RK schemes that behave contractively whenever $Lh$ is below a scheme-dependent constant and (2) Euler&#39;s rule is optimal in this regard. We prove, however, by explicit construction of a convex potential using ideas from robust control theory, that there exist RK schemes that fail to behave contractively for any choice of the time-step $h$.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic numerics aims to study numerical algorithms from a stochastic perspective. This field has recently evolved into a surging interdisciplinary research area (between numerical approximation and probability theory) attracting much attention from the data science community at large. Motivated by this development, we incorporate a stochastic viewpoint into our study of multivariate quasi-interpolation for irregularly spaced data, a subject traditionally investigated in the realm of deterministic function approximation. We first construct quasi-interpolants directly from irregularly spaced data and show their optimality in terms of a certain quadratic functional on a weighted Hilbert space. We then derive the approximation order of our quasi-interpolants via a two-step procedure. In the first step, we approximate a target function by scaled integral operators (with an error term referred to as bias). In the second step, we discretize the underlying convolution integral at the irregularly spaced data sites (with an error term called variance). The final approximation order is obtained as an optimal trade-off between bias and variance. We also show that the scale parameter of the integral operators governs the regularization effect of the quasi-interpolation scheme, and find an optimal parameter value range to fine-tune the subtle balance between bias and variance under some additional assumptions on the distribution of the data sites. It is worth noting that evaluation of integrals is not needed in the implementation of our quasi-interpolation scheme, and that our quasi-interpolants are easy to construct. Numerical simulation results, including approximating the classical bore hole test function in eight dimensional space, provide evidence that our quasi-interpolation scheme is robust and capable of providing accurate generalizations.},

The new method draws inspiration from successful numerical stabilization techniques used in the context of finite element (FE) methods, such as local projection stabilization (LPS). In particular, the new LPS-ROM is a velocity-pressure ROM that uses pressure modes as well to compute the reduced order pressure needed for instance in the computation of relevant quantities, such as drag and lift forces on bodies in the flow. The new LPS-ROM circumvents the standard discrete inf-sup condition for the POD velocity-pressure spaces, whose fulfillment can be rather expensive in realistic applications in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Also, the velocity modes do not have to be either strongly or weakly divergence-free, which allows the use of snapshots generated, for instance, with penalty or projection-based stabilized methods. The numerical analysis of the fully Navier--Stokes discretization for the new LPS-ROM is presented by mainly deriving the corresponding error estimates. Numerical studies are performed to discuss the accuracy and performance of the new LPS-ROM on a two-dimensional laminar unsteady flow past a circular obstacle.},

Being established in the generic GDM framework, these results apply to a variety of numerical methods, such as finite volume, (mass-lumped) finite elements, etc. The theoretical results are illustrated, in both fast and slow diffusion regimes, by numerical tests based on two methods that fit the GDM framework: mass-lumped conforming $\mathbb{P}_1$ finite elements and the hybrid mimetic mixed method.},

With the help of these a posteriori error estimators, an AFEM algorithm is proposed and studied. We are able to establish both the reliability and the efficiency of these estimators, by means of a special linear auxiliary problem involving the discrete Moreau--Yosida-regularized dual formulation, along with a local regular decomposition for $H(curl)$-functions and the bubble functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the strong convergence of the sequence of the edge element solutions generated by the adaptive algorithm toward the solution of a limiting problem, by first achieving the convergence of the maximal error indicator and the residual corresponding to the sequence of the adaptive edge element solutions, under a reasonable condition on the regularization parameter in terms of the adaptive mesh size. Three-dimensional numerical experiments are presented to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the adaptive algorithm when it is applied to a problem arising from the type-II (high-temperature) superconductivity.},

The PML problem is defined in a spherical layer and derived by using the Laplace transform and real coordinate stretching in the frequency domain. The well-posedness and the stability estimate of the PML problem are first proved based on the Laplace transform and the energy method. The exponential convergence of the PML method is then established in terms of the thickness of the layer and the PML absorbing parameter. As far as we know, this is the first convergence result for the time-domain PML method for the three-dimensional Maxwell equations. Our proof is mainly based on the stability estimates of solutions of the truncated PML problem and the exponential decay estimates of the stretched dyadic Green&#39;s function for the Maxwell equations in the free space.},

  abstract     = {The stability and error analysis of a second-order fast approximation are considered for the one-dimensional local and nonlocal diffusion equations in the unbounded spatial domain. We first use the conventional central difference scheme to discretize the local second-order spatial derivative operator and use an asymptotically compatible difference scheme to discretize the spatial nonlocal diffusion operator, and apply second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF2) to approximate the temporal derivative to achieve a fully discrete infinity system. To solve the resulting fully discrete systems, we develop a unified framework that is applicable to the discretization of both local and nonlocal problems. A key ingredient is to derive Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN)-type absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs). To do so, we apply the $z$-transform and solve an exterior problem using an iteration technique to derive a Dirichlet-to-Dirichlet (DtD)-type mapping as exact ABCs. After that, we use the Green formula to reformulate the DtD-type mapping equivalently as the DtN-type mapping. The resulting DtN-type mapping allows us to reduce the infinity discrete system into a finite discrete system in a truncated computational domain of interest, and also make it possible to present the stability and convergence analysis of the reduced problem under some open but reasonable assumptions. To efficiently implement the exact ABCs, we further develop a fast convolution algorithm based on approximation of the contour integral induced by the inverse $z$-transform. The stability and error analysis of the reduced finite discrete system based on the fast algorithm for exact ABCs are also established, and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

For ground states we can quantify the convergence speed as exponentially fast where the rate depends on spectral gaps of a linearized operator. The forward Euler time discretization of the flow yields a numerical method which generalizes the inverse iteration for the nonlinear eigenvalue problem. For sufficiently small time steps, the method reduces the energy in every step and converges globally in $H^1$ to an eigenfunction. In particular, for any nonnegative starting value, the ground state is obtained. A series of numerical experiments demonstrates the computational efficiency of the method and its competitiveness with established discretizations arising from other gradient flows for this problem.},

  abstract     = {We propose an iterative algorithm for the numerical computation of sums of squares of polynomials approximating given data at prescribed interpolation points. The method is based on the definition of a convex functional $G$ arising from the dualization of a quadratic regression over the Cholesky factors of the sum of squares decomposition. In order to justify the construction, the domain of $G$, the boundary of the domain, and the behavior at infinity are analyzed in detail. When the data interpolate a positive univariate polynomial, we show that in the context of the Lukács sum of squares representation, $G$ is coercive and strictly convex, which yields a unique critical point and a corresponding decomposition in a sum of squares. For multivariate polynomials which admit a decomposition in a sum of squares and up to a small perturbation of size $\varepsilon$, $G^\varepsilon$ is always coercive, and so its minimum yields an approximate decomposition in a sum of squares. Various unconstrained descent algorithms are proposed to minimize $G$. Numerical examples are provided for univariate and bivariate polynomials.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the $H(div)$-conforming finite element families for second-order elliptic problems have come more into focus since, due to hybridization and subsequent advances in computational efficiency, their use is no longer mainly theoretical. Their property of yielding exactly divergence-free solutions for mixed problems makes them interesting for a variety of applications, including incompressible fluids. In this area, boundary and interior layers are present, which demand the use of anisotropic elements. While for the Raviart--Thomas interpolation of any order on anisotropic tetrahedra optimal error estimates are known, this contribution extends these results to the Brezzi--Douglas--Marini finite elements. Optimal interpolation error estimates are proved under two different regularity conditions on the elements, which both relax the standard minimal angle condition. Additionally, a numerical application on the Stokes equations is presented to illustrate the findings.},

The present work aims to fill the gap by recovering strong convergence rates of (fully discrete) finite element methods for the CHC equation. More accurately, strong convergence rates of a full discretization are obtained, based on Galerkin finite element methods for the spatial discretization and the backward Euler method for the temporal discretization. It turns out that the convergence rates depend heavily on the spatial regularity of the noise process. Differently from the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation, the presence of the unbounded elliptic operator in front of the cubic nonlinearity in the underlying model makes the error analysis much more challenging and demanding. To address such difficulties, several new techniques and error estimates are developed. Numerical examples are finally provided to confirm the previous findings.},

In particular, kernels with varying nonlocal interaction radius $\delta &gt; 0$ and fractional Laplace kernels, parametrized by the fractional power $s\in(0,1)$, are studied. In order to provide an efficient and reliable approximation of the solution for different values of the parameters, we develop the reduced basis method as a parametric model order reduction approach. Major difficulties arise since the kernels are not affine in the parameters, singular, and discontinuous. Moreover, the spatial regularity of the solutions depends on the varying fractional power $s$. To address this, we derive regularity and differentiability results with respect to $\delta$ and $s$, which are of independent interest for other applications such as optimization and parameter identification. We then use these results to construct affine approximations of the kernels by local polynomials. Finally, we certify the method by providing reliable a posteriori error estimators, which account for all approximation errors, and support the theoretical findings by numerical experiments.},

Therefore, it is practical (i.e., requires $N$ independent Gaussian coefficients) to generate an approximate sample path of Brownian motion that respects integration of polynomials with degree less than $N$. Moreover, since these orthogonal polynomials appear naturally as eigenfunctions of the Brownian bridge covariance function, the proposed approximation is optimal in a certain weighted $L^{2}(\mathbb{P})$ sense. In addition, discretizing Brownian paths as piecewise parabolas gives a locally higher order numerical method for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) when compared to the piecewise linear approach. We shall demonstrate these ideas by simulating inhomogeneous geometric Brownian motion (IGBM). This numerical example will also illustrate the deficiencies of the piecewise parabola approximation when compared to a new version of the asymptotically efficient log-ODE (or Castell--Gaines) method.},

Under certain regularity assumptions, we show that all four variants are optimally convergent and that variants $\mathfrak{B+}$ and $\mathfrak{H+}$ achieve superconvergence without postprocessing. For the two known variants, we prove their optimal convergence under weaker requirements of the meshes and the stabilization functions thanks to the new analysis techniques being introduced. For solution with low-regularity, we give an analysis to these methods and investigate the effect of different stabilization functions on the convergence.

  abstract     = {A time-stepping $L1$ scheme for subdiffusion equation with a Riemann--Liouville time fractional derivative is developed and analyzed. This is the first paper to show that the $L1$ scheme for the model problem under consideration is second-order accurate (sharp error estimate) over nonuniform time steps. The established convergence analysis is novel and concise. For completeness, the $L1$ scheme is combined with the standard Galerkin finite elements for the spatial discretization, which will then define a fully discrete numerical scheme. The error analysis for this scheme is also investigated. To support our theoretical contributions, some numerical tests are provided at the end. The considered (typical) numerical example suggests that the imposed time-graded meshes assumption can be further relaxed.},

  abstract     = {The singular values and singular vectors of a compact operator $T$ can be estimated by discretizing $T$ (in a variety of ways) and then computing the singular value decomposition of a suitably scaled Galerkin matrix. In general, the singular values and singular vectors converge at the same rate, which is governed by the error (in the operator norm) in approximating $T$ by the discretized operator. However, when the discretization is accomplished by projection (variational approximation), the computed singular values converge at an increased rate; the typical case is that the errors in the singular values are asymptotically equal to the square of the errors in the singular vectors (this statement must be modified if the approximations to the left and right singular vectors converge at different rates). Moreover, in the case of variational approximation, the error in the singular vectors can be compared with the optimal approximation error, with the two being asymptotically equal in the typical case.},

Although it is based on ideas from Kalman filtering, it may be viewed as a derivative-free optimization method. In its most basic form it regularizes ill-posed inverse problems through the subspace property: the solution found is in the linear span of the initial ensemble employed. In this work we demonstrate how further regularization can be imposed, incorporating prior information about the underlying unknown. In particular we study how to impose Tikhonov-like Sobolev penalties. As well as introducing this modified ensemble Kalman inversion methodology, we also study its continuous-time limit, proving ensemble collapse; in the language of multi-agent optimization this may be viewed as reaching consensus. We also conduct a suite of numerical experiments to highlight the benefits of Tikhonov regularization in the ensemble inversion context.},

Preintegrating a ridge function yields a new, potentially much smoother ridge function.

However, for initial boundary value problems, poorly imposed boundary conditions lead to instabilities in Grad&#39;s Hermite expansion, which could result in nonconverging solutions. For linear kinetic equations, a method for posing stable boundary conditions was recently proposed for (formally) arbitrary order Hermite approximations. In the present work, we study $L^2$-convergence of these stable Hermite approximations and prove explicit convergence rates under suitable regularity assumptions on the exact solution. We confirm the presented convergence rates through numerical experiments involving the linearized BGK equation of rarefied gas dynamics.},

In this paper we consider an alternative model of the random field, in which the random variables have the same uniform distribution on an interval, but the random variables enter the input field as periodic functions. The field is constructed in such a way as to have the same mean and covariance function as the affine random field. Higher moments differ from the affine case, but in general the periodic model seems no less desirable. The new model of the random field is used to compute expected values of a quantity of interest arising from an elliptic PDE with random coefficients. The periodicity is shown to yield a higher order cubature convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/p})$ independently of the dimension when used in conjunction with rank-1 lattice cubature rules constructed using suitably chosen smoothness-driven product and order dependent weights, where $n$ is the number of lattice points and $p$ is the summability exponent of the fluctuations in the series expansion of the random coefficient.

As a result, face-based degrees of freedom drive the approximation on the faces, and independent local problems respond for the multiscale basis function computation. We show how to recover other well-established numerical methods when the basis functions are promptly available. A numerical analysis of the method establishes its well-posedness and proves the quasi-optimality for the numerical solution. Also, we demonstrate that the multiscale hybrid-mixed method is superconvergent in natural norms.

We consider the Poisson equation discretized with piecewise polynomial Lagrange finite elements of any order and prove the optimal convergence of our method in the $H^1$ norm. Moreover, the discrete problem is proven to be well conditioned, i.e., the condition number of the associated finite element matrix is of the same order as that of a standard finite element method on a comparable conforming mesh.

  abstract     = {We consider a scalar conservation law with hysteresis in which the flux function depends on the history of the evolution. The work is motivated by the need to account for hysteresis in important applications to transport with adsorption. To model hysteresis we use an auxiliary system of ODEs with constraints known as linear play combined with particularly chosen nonlinear truncation functions. A combination of these allows a quite general shape of hysteresis graph with piecewise linear primary and secondary scanning curves; this is distinct from the well-known Preisach model. We prove well-posedness of the model and stability of an explicit-implicit finite difference scheme. The challenge of history dependence requires auxiliary results in product spaces. Numerical results confirm convergence of linear or slower rate.},

An essential feature of these constructions is to properly average the PDE coefficients on the subsimplexes.

Their well-posedness are established for sufficiently small mesh size assuming that the convection-diffusion problems are uniquely solvable.

First, we give an exact continuous relaxation problem in the sense that both problems have the same optimal solution set. Moreover, we show that a vector is a local minimizer with the lower bound property of the original problem if and only if it is a lifted stationary point of the relaxation problem. Second, we propose a smoothing proximal gradient (SPG) algorithm for finding a lifted stationary point of the continuous relaxation model. Our algorithm is a novel combination of the classical proximal gradient algorithm and the smoothing method. We prove that the proposed SPG algorithm globally converges to a lifted stationary point of the relaxation problem, has the local convergence rate of $o(k^{-\tau})$ with $\tau\in(0,\frac{1}{2})$ on the objective function value, and identifies the zero entries of the lifted stationary point in finite iterations. Finally, we use three examples to illustrate the validity of the continuous relaxation model and good numerical performance of the SPG algorithm.},

Such schemes are popular in the numerical solution of evolutions defined with the $p$-Laplace operator since the latter lead to linear systems. The semi-implicit treatment of the operator requires introducing a regularization parameter that has to be suitably related to other discretization parameters. To avoid restrictive, unpractical conditions, a careful convergence analysis, which avoids the Aubin--Lions lemma, has to be carried out. The arguments presented in this article show that convergence holds under a moderate condition that relates the time-step size to the regularization parameter but which is independent of the spatial resolution.},

AA has been used for decades to speed up nonlinear solvers in many applications. However, a rigorous mathematical justification of the improved convergence rate has remained lacking. The key ideas of the analysis presented here are relating the difference of consecutive iterates to residuals based on performing the inner-optimization in a Hilbert space setting, and explicitly defining the gain in the optimization stage to be the ratio of improvement over a step of the unaccelerated fixed-point iteration. The main result shown here is that AA improves the convergence rate of a fixed-point iteration to first order by a factor of the gain at each step. While the acceleration reduces the contribution from the first-order terms in the residual expansion, additional superlinear terms arise. In agreement with the theory, numerical tests are given which illustrate improved linear convergence rates, but for quadratically converging fixed-point iterations the rate is slowed. Our tests further illustrate how AA can perform similarly to damping in enlarging the domain of convergence.},

Even when a nonlinear relationship is assumed, it is typically formulated in terms of an explicit relation. Implicit constitutive models provide a theoretical framework that generalizes this, allowing for general implicit constitutive relations. Since it is generally not possible to solve explicitly for the shear stress in the constitutive relation, a natural approach is to include the shear stress as a fundamental unknown in the formulation of the problem. In this work we present a mixed formulation with this feature, discuss its solvability and approximation using mixed finite element methods, and explore the convergence of the numerical approximations to a weak solution of the model.},

The improvement in this work is a new method that directly approximates the viscous fluid stress $\sigma$, enforcing its symmetry weakly. The finite element space in which the stress is approximated consists of matrix-valued functions having continuous “normal-tangential” components across element interfaces. Stability is achieved by adding certain matrix bubbles that were introduced earlier in the literature on finite elements for linear elasticity. Like the earlier work, the new method here approximates the fluid velocity $u$ using $H(div)$-conforming finite elements, thus providing exact mass conservation. Our error analysis shows optimal convergence rates for the pressure and the stress variables. An additional postprocessing yields an optimally convergent velocity satisfying exact mass conservation.

In the case of continuous boundary conditions, the inversion is done explicitly. We consider two spatial discretizations of the initial system either on a staggered or on a collocated grid, both of interest from the practical point of view. We use a Crank--Nicolson time discretization. The proposed numerical scheme with the staggered grid permits explicit $\mathcal{Z}$- transform inversion, whereas the collocated grid discretization does not. A stable numerical procedure is proposed for this latter inversion. We test numerically the accuracy of the described method with standard Gaussian initial data and wave packet initial data which are more convenient to explore the dispersive properties of the initial set of equations.

This allows for local stress elimination around each vertex. We develop two variants of the method. The first uses a piecewise constant rotation and results in a cell-centered system for displacement and rotation. The second uses a piecewise linear rotation and a quadrature rule for the asymmetry bilinear form. This allows for further elimination of the rotation, resulting in a cell-centered system for the displacement only. Stability and error analysis is performed for both variants. First order convergence is established for all variables in their natural norms. A duality argument is further employed to prove second order superconvergence of the displacement at the cell centers.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel artificial compression, reduced order model (AC-ROM) for the numerical simulation of viscous incompressible fluid flows. The new AC-ROM provides approximations not only for velocity but also for pressure, which is needed to calculate forces on bodies in the flow and to connect the simulation parameters with pressure data. The new AC-ROM does not require that the velocity-pressure ROM spaces satisfy the inf-sup (Ladyzhenskaya--Babuska--Brezzi) condition, and its basis functions are constructed from data that are not required to be weakly divergence-free. We prove error estimates for the reduced basis discretization of the AC-ROM. We also investigate numerically the new AC-ROM in the simulation of a two-dimensional flow between offset cylinders.},

  abstract     = {Those studying complex domains containing superposed fluid and porous layers will frequently encounter the phenomenon of natural convection. The mathematical model of this problem can be described using a Navier--Stokes/Darcy system coupled with heat equations. The interface conditions for Navier--Stokes/Darcy systems are the Beavers--Joseph--Saffman conditions; the heat equations in two subdomains are coupled by the continuity of temperature and heat flux. By constructing a perturbation system of the original model, we prove its well-posedness and propose an effective finite element algorithm. The algorithm separates the model into two subproblems, which can improve the computing efficiency. By using the energy estimate method and the inductive method, we prove the stability of the algorithm, and the complete error analysis is also derived afterwards. Finally, numerical tests are implemented to verify our theoretical results.},

The approximation in space is discretization agnostic: the space approximation can be done with continuous or discontinuous finite elements (or finite volumes, or finite differences). The method is first-order accurate in space. This type of accuracy is consistent with Godunov&#39;s theorem since the method is linear. The two key theoretical results of the paper are Theorem 4.4 and Theorem 4.8. The method is illustrated with continuous finite elements, and it is observed to converge with the rate O(h) in the L^2-norm on manufactured solutions, and it is O(h^2) in the diffusion regime. The proposed method does not suffer from overshoots at the interfaces of optically thin and optically thick regions, is positive, and is asymptotic-preserving with respect to the diffusion limit.},

In particular, we show the reliability for nonconforming Nédélec elements based on a residual-type argument and a Helmholtz--Weyl decomposition of W^p_0(curl;Omega). As a consequence, we are also able to derive an a posteriori error estimate for a quantity of interest called the AC loss. The nonlinearity for this form of Maxwell&#39;s equation is an analogue of the one found in the p-Laplacian. It is handled without linearizing around the approximate solution. The nonconformity is dealt with by adapting error decomposition techniques of Carstensen, Hu, and Orlando. Geometric nonconformities also appear because the continuous problem is defined over a bounded C^1,1 domain, while the discrete problem is formulated over a weaker polyhedral domain. The semidiscrete formulation studied in this paper is often encountered in commercial codes and is shown to be well-posed. The paper concludes with numerical results confirming the reliability of the a posteriori error estimate.},

We obtain uniform-in-time estimates for the error between a finite element approximation and the reference solution corresponding to the coarse mesh measurements. We consider both the case of a plain Galerkin method and a Galerkin method with grad-div stabilization.

Instead of solving a large nonlinear system of equations on a fine mesh, the two-level method provides the flexibility of solving a small nonlinear system of equations on a coarse mesh with mesh size H followed by solving one linear system of equations on a fine mesh with mesh size h. In constructing the two-level algorithm, we introduce a small positive constant $\epsilon$ to the original nonlinear term of the Darcy--Forchheimer equation to avoid difficulties associated with nondifferentiability of the Euclidean norm at zero. The priori error estimates for the velocity and pressure gradient are obtained in $L^2$ and $L^{3/2}$ discrete norms, respectively. These estimates state that if piecewise constant velocities and piecewise continuous, linear pressures are used, then the coarse and fine meshes are related by $h = O(H^2)$. Numerical examples are provided to show the efficiency and accuracy of the method. Numerical results show that the two-level Galerkin mixed finite element method is computationally more cost-effective than the standard Galerkin mixed finite element and the rate of convergence also agrees with the theoretical results.},

Implicit and explicit schemes are used for the self-adjoint and anti-self-adjoint parts of the operator, respectively. For a $k$-step method, some correction terms are added to the starting $k-1$ steps to maintain $k$th-order convergence without imposing further compatibility conditions at the initial time. Long-time $k$th-order convergence for the numerical method is proved under the assumptions that the operator is coercive and that the non-self-adjoint part is low order. Such an operator often appears in practical computation (such as the Stokes--Darcy system) but may violate the standard sectorial angle condition used in the literature for analysis of BDF. In particular, the proposed method and analysis in this paper extend the long-time energy error analysis of the Stokes--Darcy system in Chen et al. [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 51 (2013), pp. 2563--2584; Numer. Math., 134 (2016), pp. 857--879] to general symmetrized and decoupled BDF methods up to order 6 by using the generating function technique.},

  abstract     = {We present and analyze a numerical framework for the approximation of nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations of the Stefan or porous medium types. This framework is based on piecewise constant approximations for the functions, which we show are essentially necessary to obtain convergence and error estimates. Convergence is established without regularity assumption on the solution. A detailed analysis is then performed to understand the design properties that enable a scheme, despite these piecewise constant approximations and the degeneracy of the model, to satisfy high-order error estimates if the solution is piecewise smooth. Numerical tests, based on continuous and discontinuous approximation methods, are provided on a variety of one- and two-dimensional problems, showing the influence on the convergence rate of the nature of the degeneracy and of the design choices.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop and analyze an arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian discontinuous Galerkin (ALE-DG) method for solving one-dimensional hyperbolic equations involving $\delta$-singularities on moving meshes. The $L^2$ and negative norm error estimates are proven for the ALE-DG approximation. More precisely, when choosing the approximation space with piecewise $k$th degree polynomials, the convergence rate in $L^2$-norm for the scheme with the upwind numerical flux is $(k+1)$th order in the region apart from the singularities, the convergence rate in $H^{-(k+1)}$ norm for the scheme with the monotone fluxes in the whole domain is $k$th order, the convergence rate in $H^{-(k+2)}$ norm for the scheme with the upwind flux in the whole domain can achieve $(k+\frac{1}{2})$th order, and the convergence rate in $H^{-(k+1)}(R\backslash R_T)$ norm for the scheme with the upwind flux is $(2k+1)$th order, where $R_T$ is the pollution region at time $T$ due to the singularities. Moreover, numerically the $(2k+1)$th order accuracy for the postprocessed solution in the smooth region can be obtained, which is produced by convolving the ALE-DG solution with a suitable kernel consisting of B-splines. Numerical examples are shown to demonstrate the accuracy and capability of the ALE-DG method for the hyperbolic equations involving $\delta$-singularity on moving meshes.},

  abstract     = {The skeletal finite element method (FEM) in this paper is a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin FEM with the Lehrenfeld--Schöberl stabilization and also known as a weak Galerkin FEM. With an appropriate stabilization, it provides eigenvalue approximations for the Laplacian on any regular triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ with maximal mesh-size $h_{\max}$, which are guaranteed lower eigenvalue bounds (GLB) if they are sufficiently large. This paper establishes a bound $\alpha(\mathcal{T})$ for a global stabilization parameter $\alpha$ such that $\alpha\le \alpha(\mathcal{T})$ leads to an eigenvalue approximation $\lambda_h\le\lambda$ for the exact eigenvalue $\lambda $, provided $ \kappa_{CR}^{2}h_{\max}^2\, \lambda_h\le 1$ for a universal constant $ \kappa_{\rm CR}$. For a 2D triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ into triangles, a comparison with the bound $\text{CRGLB}:= \lambda_{CR}/(1+\varepsilon\lambda_{CR})\le \lambda$ from [C. Carstensen and J. Gedicke, Math. Comp., 83 (2014), pp. 2605--2629] proves under the same conditions that $\text{CRGLB}\le \lambda_h\le \lambda$. The paper also provides an alternative proof of the already established asymptotic lower bound property.},

The accuracy of the constructed discrete scheme is established by comparing it with the known implicit time stepping (backward Euler) finite element scheme. An error estimate of $O(h + \tau^{3/4})$ in the energy norm of the differential operator of the problem is obtained, where $h$ and $\tau$ denote the mesh parameters in space and time, respectively.

The generalized local Lax--Friedrichs (GLLF) fluxes with two weights, which may not be monotone, are proposed and analyzed. Under a condition for the weights, we first show the monotonicity for the flux and thus the $L^2$ stability of the scheme. Then, by constructing and analyzing a special piecewise global projection which commutes with the time derivative operator, we are able to show optimal error estimates for the DG scheme with GLLF fluxes. The result is sharp for monotone numerical fluxes, for which only suboptimal estimates can be proved in previous work. Moreover, optimal error estimates are still valid for fluxes that are not monotone, allowing us to choose some suitable weights to achieve less numerical dissipation and thus to better resolve shocks. Numerical experiments are provided to show the sharpness of theoretical results.},
