We suggest new conditions concerning both absolutely continuous and discrete distributions. By using the new conditions, which are easily checkable, we either establish new results or extend previous ones in both the Hamburger case (distributions on the whole real line) and the Stieltjes case (distributions on the positive half-line). Specific examples illustrate the results as well as the relationship between the new conditions and previously available conditions.},

  abstract     = {It has been understood that the “local” existence of the Markowitz optimal portfolio or the solution to the local-risk minimization problem is guaranteed by some specific mathematical structures on the underlying assets&#39; price processes known in the literature as “structure conditions.” In this paper, we consider a semimartingale market model and an arbitrary random time. This random time may model the default time of a firm, the death time of an insured, or any occurrence time of an event that might somehow impact the market model. By adding additional uncertainty to the market model via this random time, the structure conditions may fail, and hence the Markowitz optimal portfolio and other quadratic-optimal portfolios might fail to exist. Our aim is to investigate the impact of this random time on the structure conditions from different perspectives. Our analysis allows us to conclude that under some mild assumptions on the market model and the random time, the structure conditions remain valid on the one hand. Furthermore, we provide two examples illustrating the importance of these assumptions. On the other hand, we describe the random time models such that these structure conditions are preserved for any market model. These results are elaborated separately for the two contexts of stopping with the random time and incorporating totally a specific class of random times, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In Nevzorov&#39;s $F^\alpha$-scheme, one deals with a sequence of independent random variables with distribution functions that are powers of a common continuous distribution function. A key property of the $F^\alpha$-scheme is that the record indicators for such a sequence are independent. This allows one to obtain several important limit theorems for the total number of records in the sequence up to time $n\to\infty$. We extend these theorems to a much more general class of sequences of random variables obeying a “threshold $F^\alpha$-scheme” where the distribution functions of the variables are close to the powers of a common $F$ only in their right tails, above certain nonrandom nondecreasing threshold levels. Of independent interest is the characterization of the growth rate for extremal processes that we derive in order to verify the conditions of our main theorem. We also establish the asymptotic pairwise independence of record indicators in a special case of threshold $F^\alpha$-schemes.},

  abstract     = {We present a surprisingly simple version of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing (FTAP) for continuous time large financial markets with two filtrations in an $L^p$-setting for ${1 \leq p &lt; \infty}$. This extends the results of Kabanov and Stricker in [“The Dalang--Morton--Willinger theorem under delayed and restricted information,” in In Memoriam: Paul-André Meyer, Springer, 2006, pp. 209--213] to continuous time and to a large financial market setting while, however, still preserving the simplicity of the discrete time setting. On the other hand, it generalizes Stricker&#39;s $L^p$-version of FTAP [Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré Probab. Statist., 26 (1990), pp. 451--460] towards a setting with two filtrations. We do not assume that price processes are semimartingales (and it does not follow due to trading with respect to the smaller filtration) or have any specific path properties. The two filtrations in question can also be completely general, and we do not require admissibility of portfolio wealth processes. We go for a completely general and realistic result, where trading strategies are just predictable with respect to a smaller filtration than the one generated by the price processes. Applications include modeling trading with delayed information, trading on different time grids, dealing with inaccurate price information, and randomization approaches to uncertainty, which will be dealt with elsewhere.},

It is known that Fatou&#39;s lemma for a sequence of weakly converging measures states a weaker inequality because the integral of the lower limit is replaced with the integral of the lower limit in two parameters, where the second parameter is the argument of the functions. In the present paper, we provide sufficient conditions when Fatou&#39;s lemma holds in its classical form for a sequence of weakly converging measures. The functions can take both positive and negative values. Similar results for sequences of setwise converging measures are also proved. We also put forward analogies of Lebesgue&#39;s and the monotone convergence theorems for sequences of weakly and setwise converging measures. The results obtained are used to prove broad sufficient conditions for the validity of optimality equations for average-cost Markov decision processes.},

Under some conditions, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the finite and infinite time ruin probabilities as well as the logarithmic asymptotic for them. When $R$ is a Lévy process, we retrieve some well-known results. Finally, we obtain conditions on the exponential functionals of $R$ for ruin with probability 1, and we express these conditions using the semimartingale characteristics of $R$ in the case of Lévy processes.},

  abstract     = {We study a problem of option replication under constant proportional transaction costs in models where stochastic volatility and jumps are combined to capture the market&#39;s important features. Assuming some mild condition on the jump size distribution, we show that transaction costs can be approximately compensated by applying the Leland adjusting volatility principle and the asymptotic property of the hedging error due to discrete readjustments. In particular, the jump risk can be approximately eliminated, and the results established in continuous diffusion models are recovered. The study also confirms that, for the case of constant trading cost rate, the approximate results established by Kabanov and Safarian [Finance Stoch., 1 (1997), pp. 239--250] and by Pergamenschikov [Ann. Appl. Probab., 13 (2003), pp. 1099--1118] are still valid in jump-diffusion models with deterministic volatility.},

We give two dual characterizations of this property in terms of (1) martingale-like properties for each small market plus (2) a contiguity property, along the sequence of small markets, of suitably chosen “generalized martingale measures.” Our results extend the work of Rokhlin, Klein, and Schachermayer and Kabanov and Kramkov to a discounting-invariant framework. We also show how a market on $[0,\infty)$ can be viewed as a large financial market and how no asymptotic arbitrage, both classic and in our new sense, then relates to no-arbitrage properties directly on $[0,\infty)$.},

Half-space functions are often called linear threshold functions. We assume that the Boolean cube ${-1,1}^n$ is equipped with a uniform measure. We also assume that $\|\omega\|_2\leq 1$ and $\|\omega\|_{\infty} = \delta$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. Let $0\leq\varepsilon\leq 1$ be such that $|\mathbf{E} f|\leq 1-\varepsilon$. We prove that there exists a constant $C&gt;0$ such that $\max_i(\operatorname{Inf}_i f)\geq C\delta\varepsilon$, where $\operatorname{Inf}_i f$ denotes the influence of the $i$th coordinate of the function $f$. This establishes the lower bound obtained earlier by Matulef et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 39 (2010), pp. 2004--2047]. We also show that the optimal constant in this inequality exceeds $3\sqrt{2}/64\approx 0.066$. As an auxiliary result we prove a lower bound for small ball inequalities of linear combinations of Rademacher random variables.},

Here, constraints are placed on the conditional probabilities for the validity of one or another hypothesis under the condition that this hypothesis is rejected. We give an asymptotic formula for $n^*$ in a scheme with severe (tending to zero) constraints on these conditional probabilities of hypotheses. Earlier, Volodin and Novikov found a similar formula for discrimination of one-sided hypotheses. In the present paper, the proof of the asymptotic formula is carried out under weaker constraints on the probability model. The accuracy of our formula is illustrated numerically for some probability models.},

Assume that there exist $\sigma$-algebras $\mathfrak M^{(1)}, \dots, \mathfrak M^{(n)}$, $ \mathfrak M^{(j)} \subset \mathfrak M$, $j=1, \dots, n$, such that ${E}{(\xi_j\mid \mathfrak M^{(j)})}=0$. Under these assumptions, we prove an inequality for ${E}|T|^p$ with $p \ge 2$. We also discuss applications of the main result of the paper to estimation of moments of linear forms, $U$-statistics, and perturbations of the characteristic equation for the Stieltjes transform of Wigner&#39;s semicircle law.},

We allow that both drifts add up to the maximal value of one. Our target is to choose the strategy in a way s.t. the expected value of the number of surviving companies is maximized. The optimal strategy for this problem is investigated, and it is shown rigorously that the strategy of always pushing maximally the company with less endowment---a strategy which is optimal in the case when one wants to maximize the probability that both companies survive---is in fact not optimal.},

Mapping every simplex of the dual weighted Delaunay mosaic to the radius of the smallest empty circumscribed sphere whose center lies in the $k$-plane gives a generalized discrete Morse function. Assuming the Voronoi tessellation is generated by a Poisson point process in ${R}^n$, we study the expected number of simplices in the $k$-dimensional weighted Delaunay mosaic as well as the expected number of intervals of the Morse function, both as functions of a radius threshold. As a by-product, we obtain a new proof for the expected number of connected components (clumps) in a line section of a circular Boolean model in ${R}^n$.},
